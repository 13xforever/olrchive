00:00.000 --> 00:17.240
Since your last spoke, the gaming storefront and launcher world is getting a little bit

00:17.240 --> 00:19.840
smaller with EA choosing to relinquish their exclusivity.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.440
Balance has shifted in the force.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.800
This is just one headline to catch up on.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.920
Stay tuned for the rest of the stories we have time for starting right now on the show

00:25.920 --> 00:33.240
where every gamer has a voice.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:37.600 --> 00:39.160
where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.040
It is Orange Lounge Radio back again, back, back, back again.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.820
Episode number 797 for this November the 3rd of 2019.

00:47.820 --> 00:51.280
My name Rob Roberts, her name DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.280
Hi.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.760
And his name, Techmaster Loki.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.760
Hello.

00:54.760 --> 00:59.440
We have you guys in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do

00:59.440 --> 01:03.680
tape live at the Voice of Geeks network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock

01:03.680 --> 01:06.400
Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.560
Insert your name here.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.560
That's right.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.720
So, and we appreciate of course all the hosts and all you guys that support our show.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.600
And even if you're listening on the podcast feed, welcome back.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.360
Hope you weren't thrown off by us being gone for two weeks.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.720
We'll address all that a little bit later in the show.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.700
But since we have been gone for a little bit, I want to jump right into gaming news tonight.

01:24.700 --> 01:30.540
Let's talk about BlizzCon because ironically, the last time that we did have a show, we

01:30.540 --> 01:37.140
were kind of talking about this whole Blizzard made a big boo-boo with the banning of the

01:37.140 --> 01:39.300
Hearthstone player and so forth.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.140
So BlizzCon happened and many folks were surprised.

01:43.140 --> 01:49.460
I don't know if I was surprised, but I think many folks were surprised that BlizzCon opened

01:49.460 --> 01:50.780
with a little bit of this.

01:50.780 --> 01:55.260
Before we start the opening ceremony, I want to say a few words.

01:55.260 --> 02:02.780
You know, Blizzard had the opportunity to bring the world together in a tough Hearthstone

02:02.780 --> 02:08.380
esports moment about a month ago and we did not.

02:08.380 --> 02:15.580
We moved too quickly in our decision making and then to make matters worse, we were too

02:15.580 --> 02:20.260
slow to talk with all of you.

02:20.260 --> 02:25.580
When I think about what I'm most unhappy about, there's really two things.

02:25.580 --> 02:32.620
The first one is we didn't live up to the high standards that we really set for ourselves.

02:32.620 --> 02:37.000
And the second is we failed in our purpose.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.580
And for that, I am sorry and I accept accountability.

02:42.580 --> 02:43.580
So there it is.

02:43.580 --> 02:50.220
The new CEO of Blizzard, J. Allen Brack, sorry I'm butchering the last name there.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.340
I don't have it right in front of me.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.340
And he's accepting accountability for what happened with the whole issue.

02:55.340 --> 03:00.500
But to quote Jim Sterling, what are you apologizing for?

03:00.500 --> 03:03.220
Because you're being incredibly vague about everything.

03:03.220 --> 03:06.580
You're not mentioning the specific things that you did wrong and the specific things

03:06.580 --> 03:10.100
that you need changed and the specific things that you're not living up to standards on.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.980
You're just seeing a tough esports moment.

03:13.980 --> 03:15.560
You know what the fucking thing is.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.500
It was a little weird to be so blunt.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.500
It's such bullshit.

03:18.500 --> 03:26.020
It is such bullshit because they say they're apologizing about it, but are they unbanned?

03:26.020 --> 03:27.020
Nope.

03:27.020 --> 03:28.260
They are still banned.

03:28.260 --> 03:34.900
So they're just they're just appeasing you because they're like, yeah, see, we're apologizing

03:34.900 --> 03:35.900
for it.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.420
Here's some new things that you like and you're totally going to forget about it months down

03:39.420 --> 03:41.900
the road when this stuff comes out and you're going to purchase it anyways.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.380
I understand you would like some smoke for your ass.

03:44.380 --> 03:45.380
Let me blow it for you.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.380
I don't know.

03:46.380 --> 03:49.420
I think you guys are using harsher language than even I might.

03:49.420 --> 03:53.700
And I took a lot of shit on Twitter this week for my stance, but I'm I'm OK with it.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.900
You know, like, again, I'm not saying that like we need to boycott Blizzard.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.060
That's not the word I'm choosing to use in this whole situation.

04:01.060 --> 04:04.380
I am seeing other people right now.

04:04.380 --> 04:10.020
That's where I am about Blizzard, because look, and in many ways, yes, it is about the

04:10.020 --> 04:16.180
issue of banning Blitzchung and more so I'm at least I'm at least thankful.

04:16.860 --> 04:21.660
That this that Jay Allen got up there and said it wasn't just what we did, but it was

04:21.660 --> 04:24.180
how slow we were to respond to respond.

04:24.180 --> 04:28.620
So I do want to give credit for acknowledging that, because I do feel like and I it's not

04:28.620 --> 04:29.620
that I disagree with you.

04:29.620 --> 04:30.620
I don't know.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.620
They're pretty quick.

04:31.620 --> 04:35.660
They're pretty quick to respond to the was that the college team also got banned for

04:35.660 --> 04:36.660
six months.

04:36.660 --> 04:37.660
All right.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.220
And I and that's the thing is, it's like I do appreciate that at least he called that

04:40.220 --> 04:41.220
portion of it out by name.

04:41.220 --> 04:44.740
But Eddie, though, didn't shut up and let me talk.

04:45.020 --> 04:51.740
But like you, I am kind of like, why don't they just call exactly what it is?

04:51.740 --> 04:55.020
And for me in that, I mean, great, you accepted accountability.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.020
It's a nice start.

04:56.020 --> 04:58.900
But what's the real difference that's going to change?

04:58.900 --> 05:02.100
And if they're not going to sit here and say, we're going to unban those casters who didn't

05:02.100 --> 05:05.340
deserve it, even though there's some people out there that feel the casters did deserve

05:05.340 --> 05:11.060
it because they feel like the casters lobbed the ball or whatever, I as as somebody who

05:11.060 --> 05:15.500
has been in the position similar to what would a caster would go through lives of worth,

05:15.500 --> 05:17.420
I completely disagree with that assessment.

05:17.420 --> 05:18.420
That's fine.

05:18.420 --> 05:19.420
Everybody's entitled to their opinion.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.240
And that is also important to this scenario.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.000
If you want to keep playing Blizzard games, go off, sis.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.340
I'm totally fine with that.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.340
It's your money.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.340
Spend it on how you want.

05:27.340 --> 05:33.140
But for me, it's not just about what's happening or what's happened with the Blitzchung scenario.

05:33.140 --> 05:38.620
That was more like the final straw for me because we're forgetting there's been a lot

05:38.620 --> 05:43.380
of comedy of Blizzard errors that has been happening over the last two years, namely

05:43.380 --> 05:48.660
the last BlizzCon and everything that happened there, namely remember when at this exact

05:48.660 --> 05:52.840
same time, this was all going down, there was a guild that got banned for being called

05:52.840 --> 05:57.100
gay boys because the automated system, you know, threw it out, whatever, fine blame it

05:57.100 --> 06:00.060
on the automated system, but that's still like a thing that happened that shouldn't

06:00.060 --> 06:01.060
have.

06:01.060 --> 06:04.320
And it's, it's more like a culmination of all of these things.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.500
And I think what really irritates me about this whole situation, this is what it really

06:08.500 --> 06:13.780
is for me, is that, and it's funny because these folks, you know, on Twitter, and again,

06:13.780 --> 06:17.100
I'm not trying to like shade anybody and everybody's welcome to their opinion and so forth want

06:17.100 --> 06:20.100
to say, well, if you're mad at Blizzard, you should be mad at Apple.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.060
You should be mad at Microsoft.

06:22.060 --> 06:26.340
You should be mad at Sony and whatever other companies are having the perception of embed

06:26.340 --> 06:27.420
with China.

06:27.420 --> 06:32.180
And that argument, I suppose, would be something you could do if, if that is the only issue

06:32.180 --> 06:33.740
I have with Blizzard.

06:33.740 --> 06:41.180
But the problem is that it's not because what's really irritating to me, here's what it is.

06:41.180 --> 06:47.480
It's that they were so fast to ban all these folks that said things about China.

06:47.480 --> 06:52.420
But do you remember when that Overwatch League player made the homophobic remarks on his

06:52.420 --> 06:53.420
stream?

06:53.420 --> 06:54.580
How long did that guy get banned for?

06:54.580 --> 06:56.060
Did he get a lifetime ban?

06:56.060 --> 06:57.060
No.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.500
Did he get a six month ban?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500
No.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
He got a four game ban.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.980
That was the equivalent of a month.

07:02.980 --> 07:05.100
That is why I'm mad.

07:05.100 --> 07:14.100
Because the China thing was like way overcompensating compared to what they've done in other situations.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.700
That was the straw that broke the camel's back.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.860
But if you want to continue to play Blizzard games, that's fine.

07:18.860 --> 07:23.160
Because I also understand there's a tricky line here.

07:23.160 --> 07:27.700
There's many employees, many people I know that work for Blizzard that have nothing to

07:27.700 --> 07:28.700
do with any of this.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.140
In fact, they get very frustrated by this stuff as well.

07:32.140 --> 07:35.820
And yeah, I don't really want to hurt those people.

07:35.820 --> 07:40.280
But the reality is I already bought Diablo 3, I bought Overwatch and so forth, and I

07:40.280 --> 07:45.540
just don't really see the need to continue my World of Warcraft subscription right now.

07:45.540 --> 07:50.860
And not playing two MMOs right now is really great for freeing up my plate for doing other

07:50.860 --> 07:51.860
things.

07:51.860 --> 07:56.460
Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2, which we'll get into in a minute, because admittedly they

07:56.460 --> 07:58.540
look pretty sweet.

07:58.540 --> 08:04.100
I'll evaluate those games and whether I want to buy them or not when they come out.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.340
They're not coming out tomorrow.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.900
They're not coming out by the end of the year.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.300
They're probably not coming out by summer.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.780
Because where's Warcraft 3 remastered?

08:13.780 --> 08:17.060
For all the shit it got, where's Diablo Immortal?

08:17.060 --> 08:21.820
I think they maybe acknowledged, I think Warcraft 3 they said is doing the beta.

08:21.820 --> 08:26.160
I think they acknowledged Diablo Immortal, but for all intents and purposes, those games

08:26.160 --> 08:30.880
that were their big flagship things last year, for better or for far, far worse, still

08:30.880 --> 08:32.800
aren't out.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.220
So we have a whole year at least.

08:35.220 --> 08:39.080
Did they say that these games, because I saw a tweet that was something like, wow, all

08:39.080 --> 08:42.040
these games are coming out in 2020, Blizzard's got a huge year ahead.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.960
Did they say these games are coming out in 2020?

08:43.960 --> 08:44.960
I don't think so.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.960
I don't think they did.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.360
And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in chat.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.200
I don't think they said, I would imagine the Warcraft expansion, yeah, it's got to be because

08:51.200 --> 08:52.620
that's their timetable.

08:52.620 --> 08:56.740
And maybe one of these games, probably Overwatch 2 is going to be next year.

08:56.740 --> 08:57.740
That's a guess.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.620
But is it all coming next year?

08:59.620 --> 09:01.860
I don't necessarily think so.

09:01.860 --> 09:04.420
Blizzard don't always work on those types of timetables.

09:04.420 --> 09:05.900
Again, it's been a year.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.300
Where's Warcraft 3 remastered?

09:07.300 --> 09:08.380
Where's Diablo Immortal?

09:08.380 --> 09:10.200
Those games still aren't out.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.100
So that's where it is for me.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.260
Blizzard, we're seeing other people for a little bit and I'm going to continue to see

09:15.260 --> 09:16.440
other people.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.900
Let's see how you do in the next year.

09:18.900 --> 09:22.840
Let's see the action behind those words that you just said.

09:22.840 --> 09:27.100
And then in a year when these games are out, I'll decide what I want to do.

09:27.100 --> 09:32.100
But more importantly though, at the very end of his little apology, if you will, he talked

09:32.100 --> 09:35.900
about like, we have players from, you know, around the world, like, you know, I want to

09:35.900 --> 09:40.500
say like 69 countries or 65 countries or whatever in there, or they're talking about their company

09:40.500 --> 09:44.020
and stuff and about people everywhere around the world and that they want those voices

09:44.020 --> 09:46.500
heard.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.460
Except if it's about China, in which case then we're going to ban your ass.

09:49.460 --> 09:53.140
Well, did you notice though that, okay, so there was a panel and I forgot to grab the

09:53.140 --> 09:57.020
video of it, but there was a panel, somebody posted this in our discord actually, so shout

09:57.020 --> 10:01.140
out to vognetwork.com slash discord because it's actually where I first saw it.

10:01.140 --> 10:04.500
There actually was a World of Warcraft Q and A panel where somebody asked this question

10:04.500 --> 10:09.300
and then at the very end of it said, you know, free Hong Kong revolution of our times.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.580
The exact same quote that got Blitzchung in trouble, he said that right at the end of

10:12.580 --> 10:16.380
his question, then promptly walked off and sat down and the host just kind of had one

10:16.380 --> 10:20.900
of those like smiles, like not, yep, this is what they taught me in training might happen

10:20.900 --> 10:23.140
and just kind of smiled and acknowledged it and moved on.

10:23.140 --> 10:28.420
Like they just kind of, it was very obvious they had a game plan for what they were going

10:28.420 --> 10:34.500
to do if a Hong Kong thing started and it was going to be very much shut the fuck up

10:34.500 --> 10:38.460
and just let it take its course and then get the, get the car moving again because that's

10:38.460 --> 10:39.460
exactly what that hosted.

10:39.460 --> 10:40.860
And then there was, there were, it got awkward.

10:40.860 --> 10:46.300
I thought what the guy did was very like, just very like bam, just slap, like just thwack

10:46.300 --> 10:48.140
the table and then left.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.180
Then there, I thought it was a little awkward cause then somebody kind of tried to piggyback

10:51.180 --> 10:52.180
on that.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.180
It was like free Hong Kong, free Hong Kong.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.780
And there was like dancing in front of the camera.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.780
And then the guy said, did you have anything you want to say?

10:57.780 --> 10:59.540
And it said free Hong Kong.

10:59.540 --> 11:06.020
And I, I feel like the second individual kind of messed up that opportunity a little bit.

11:06.020 --> 11:09.540
And you know, when the adrenaline's going, there's a lot of things you do.

11:09.540 --> 11:12.340
It just, the second person came off a little bit more immature.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.560
I think the first one was very cool and calculated.

11:14.560 --> 11:19.020
The second one was very much like Muppet Flail and it didn't read very well at all, but again,

11:19.020 --> 11:23.380
the way they responded to it very much the host, would you like to say anything that

11:23.380 --> 11:29.060
did it like very, like they knew that was, there was very much an action plan for that

11:29.060 --> 11:33.540
scenario and you saw it play out there as kind of awkward-ish as it was.

11:33.540 --> 11:41.900
So which that's better than maybe like cutting away and trying to shut it down and everything.

11:41.900 --> 11:45.600
So I'll give them that, like they seem to be learning in that regard.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.580
You know, they didn't, they didn't try to like shut it down completely.

11:48.580 --> 11:49.580
I suppose.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.580
I don't know.

11:50.580 --> 11:54.140
Anyway, I do want to get to some comments in our chat Questbuster over at a Twitch TV

11:54.140 --> 11:58.500
slash a VOG network says on Rob's note about Blizzard employees feeling frustrated.

11:58.500 --> 12:03.060
A few of them did stage a small walkout of their own on campus when this broke.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.780
Yes, very important to note.

12:05.780 --> 12:07.180
And I think that is so cool.

12:07.180 --> 12:10.720
And I really applaud those folks because you know what?

12:10.720 --> 12:16.680
Angry internet dorks only go so far like that type of behavior.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.120
That's what's really going to affect the change.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.620
So when you know that those people on the inside are really on your side too, that is

12:23.620 --> 12:25.060
a really, really good feeling.

12:25.060 --> 12:27.500
So I fully support what those guys are doing.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.760
And I think, I think that's, that's fantastic.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.760
And hopefully the change will continue from within.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.860
You know, I guess I can talk a little more openly about this now because I used to work

12:37.860 --> 12:42.760
in for many years, I no longer work in, I worked in the health insurance industry.

12:42.760 --> 12:47.140
And believe me, I've heard a lot of shit about health insurance over the years.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.440
It is a pretty messed up system.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.000
But you know what, all I could really do in that scenario, I had to do what I could do

12:53.000 --> 12:56.200
from the inside to try to make it better for the customers to try to make it better for

12:56.200 --> 12:59.240
people to understand to try to make sure that people weren't getting screwed over and all

12:59.240 --> 13:00.560
that type of stuff.

13:00.560 --> 13:05.160
Sometimes it's, it's the folks on the inside have to kind of do what they can.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.680
But every like big fuck up that's ever happened in gaming, it happened in a boardroom somewhere.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.600
It didn't happen because some hard working developer that's working crunch time and all

13:13.600 --> 13:17.000
that stuff, you know, decided they were going to screw something up.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.520
Anyway, let me get to more comments.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.800
SG100Matt says, we all know what they were talking about in reference to Jay Allen's

13:22.800 --> 13:23.800
speech there.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.320
They admitted to acting too quickly.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.320
They admitted to acting too slowly to speak.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.000
Do they really need to name names?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.280
In my opinion, I don't think so.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.680
It's going to take a long time for Blizzard to win back people's trust and rightfully

13:33.680 --> 13:34.680
so.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.920
But this apology is a start.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.120
They need to act and not use nice words and heartfelt speeches.

13:39.120 --> 13:43.440
They need to do more and prove to us they will be better to win back our trust.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.440
Exactly.

13:44.440 --> 13:49.540
And the way I see it as much as Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 do look great, and I hope, I hope

13:49.540 --> 13:53.920
they do make better and do better so I can feel good about supporting those games and

13:53.920 --> 13:56.480
supporting my friends that work at the company.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.920
I don't feel the need to pre-purchase today.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.560
Is that so wrong?

14:01.560 --> 14:04.880
Don't feel the need to pre-purchase the new WoW expansion today, which believe me is something

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
you can do.

14:05.880 --> 14:06.880
You want to get your level 60?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.360
Because it's 60 again because everybody's getting a squish.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.860
You want to get your level 60 WoW character boost right now?

14:11.860 --> 14:13.680
You can pre-purchase Shadowlands today.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.720
I just, maybe not now.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
Maybe not, not today.

14:17.720 --> 14:22.120
Anyway, let's see, trying to go to some other comments here.

14:22.120 --> 14:27.060
Questbuster in chat says, open forum, public space, little doubt Blizzard likely drilled

14:27.060 --> 14:30.700
everyone manning their stations at the con on what to expect.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.700
Absolutely.

14:31.700 --> 14:32.700
They knew it was coming.

14:32.700 --> 14:37.980
Somebody on Twitter commented that it sounded like they had a separate mic volume for the

14:37.980 --> 14:45.900
crowd, that they had a way to kill the crowd mics and kill the crowd speech if need be.

14:45.900 --> 14:49.580
Which you know, as much as you might want to say like, yo, fuck Blizzard for that type

14:49.580 --> 14:50.580
of thing.

14:50.580 --> 14:54.700
Like real talk y'all, there's a lot of things on TV that are like that and a lot of things

14:54.700 --> 14:55.860
where if there's pre-pand...

14:55.860 --> 15:00.340
I mean, even any sporting event knows how to cut away from a streaker, right?

15:00.340 --> 15:03.180
Because you don't want to give the streaker attention.

15:03.180 --> 15:07.100
You don't want to broadcast the booty on TV since it's running by.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.740
You know, those types of things, like anybody putting on a professional presentation knows

15:10.740 --> 15:12.580
how to cut away from this stuff like that.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.260
So I mean, I'm not surprised to hear it.

15:14.260 --> 15:19.660
It's just weird to hear it with BlizzCon, but I mean, BlizzCon is a massive media production,

15:19.660 --> 15:21.020
is it not?

15:21.020 --> 15:24.960
Tigerclaw is saying, was the red shirt guy back at BlizzCon?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.800
I wonder what comment he made.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.760
Remember his comment about Diablo Immortal being a late April Fool's joke?

15:29.760 --> 15:33.580
It actually wasn't the same red shirt guy.

15:33.580 --> 15:37.200
Wearing a red shirt has become some sort of interesting symbol.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.240
And it's interesting that all these people that get up on the mic and do interesting

15:40.240 --> 15:42.840
things are often wearing red shirts.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.720
But believe it or not, the guy who asked the lore question started the whole red shirt

15:46.720 --> 15:47.720
thing.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.680
The guy who said, is this an April Fool's joke?

15:49.680 --> 15:54.480
And the guy who just said free Hong Kong are all different red shirt guys.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.520
I wish I had a graphic.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.800
This is a more professional TV operation, I'd have a graphic that would show them side

15:59.800 --> 16:00.800
by side.

16:00.800 --> 16:06.440
Lore nerd, guy making shitty comment, guy saying free Hong Kong.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.720
Very different people.

16:08.720 --> 16:16.280
Anyway, anything else you guys want to say about the apology and all that stuff?

16:16.280 --> 16:22.600
Darsakha, Loki, I know I've said a lot there, I want to open it up to you guys too.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.160
It's just vague corporate speak.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.480
That's seriously what it is.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.520
There's no good way for them to get out of it.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.520
Really there's not.

16:30.520 --> 16:36.400
They fucked up, they've kept fucking up, and they're trying to do distraction tactics.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.520
Now it's this sort of fake accountability thing.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.220
And I don't believe words anymore, I believe actions.

16:42.220 --> 16:47.480
I want to see action before I remotely even consider anything else.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.520
Because as it stands, I'm pretty done with Blizzard.

16:51.520 --> 16:57.880
I was already done with WoW in general, and now I'm done, done.

16:57.880 --> 17:05.080
No, this is definitely one of the final straws for me, especially exactly for the same reason

17:05.080 --> 17:06.080
that you said.

17:06.080 --> 17:13.000
And remember, every time there's a controversy, even with Bethesda, they always give the,

17:13.000 --> 17:17.900
we're going to do better, we need to do better, it's not up to our expectations.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.840
Everybody has that fucking line.

17:19.840 --> 17:24.000
It doesn't fucking matter what they say, it's about what they do.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
So let's see them do something about it, because right now they haven't done shit.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.380
And in regards to people comparing company A to company B to whatever, I look at the

17:33.380 --> 17:36.120
past record and look at the integrity.

17:36.120 --> 17:40.040
Has this company actually made good on what they say?

17:40.040 --> 17:45.520
If they found something has gone awry with their services or whatever, how quickly were

17:45.520 --> 17:47.740
they to make a change?

17:47.740 --> 17:52.540
So that being said, I don't really care about anyone throwing out comparisons.

17:52.540 --> 17:53.540
What about this?

17:53.540 --> 17:54.540
What about that?

17:54.540 --> 17:57.240
That is a fallacious argument in and of itself.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.660
And trust me, if you want me to list the general fallacious arguments and why I don't respect

18:01.660 --> 18:03.980
them, I can do that in another time.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.500
But it is inherently a fallacious argument.

18:06.500 --> 18:11.060
The only thing that you can look at is the company itself, what it is doing, and only

18:11.060 --> 18:13.100
compare it to its own actions.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.460
End of story.

18:15.500 --> 18:19.500
I saw a very interesting tweet that was very kind of like this kind of like shady thing

18:19.500 --> 18:22.780
that was like, and it didn't name names, but I could, you know, sometimes you got to feel

18:22.780 --> 18:24.980
the, you feel the shade a little bit, right?

18:24.980 --> 18:28.260
It's like that, that gif of the shade moving over the city.

18:28.260 --> 18:31.740
And it was something like, interesting all of these people tweeting their criticisms

18:31.740 --> 18:36.040
of Blizzard from their iPhones when Apple has done all this stuff too.

18:36.040 --> 18:42.340
And I'm like, okay, look, I can, I can understand why folks may have a criticism of Apple and

18:42.340 --> 18:43.340
China.

18:43.340 --> 18:44.340
That's fine.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.180
And that is your choice to make.

18:46.180 --> 18:47.180
That's fine.

18:47.180 --> 18:51.020
I'm going to tell you why I didn't make that choice, because it's not the same thing.

18:51.020 --> 18:55.380
I just said Blizzard's thing is a history of these things going on.

18:55.380 --> 19:00.140
And it's also the Apples and, or excuse me, the, the what happened here versus what that

19:00.140 --> 19:01.140
happened there.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.780
And there was a big disconnect between the two bands and what happened there, despite

19:04.780 --> 19:06.420
all this other stuff in between.

19:06.420 --> 19:11.300
With Apple, yes, I realized they pulled an app that, you know, was very controversial,

19:11.300 --> 19:16.820
but for what it's worth, at least when it happened immediately, Tim Cook put out, the

19:16.820 --> 19:20.560
CEO put out a statement saying, this is why we did it.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.460
This is the policy that it broke.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.800
And this is what it was.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.180
They didn't wait a week.

19:25.180 --> 19:28.900
They said, here's the word straight from the top when it happened.

19:28.900 --> 19:33.860
Now I'm not like, again, if you have decided you can't support Apple because of that or

19:33.860 --> 19:35.100
whatever, that's fine.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.060
That's your call to make and so forth.

19:37.060 --> 19:42.940
But I just want to say where this is not the same as this in my viewpoint.

19:42.940 --> 19:46.340
And I think to kind of throw out there that like, oh, you got to ban all these companies

19:46.340 --> 19:48.300
because they all do business in China.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.380
Yo, China's got 1 billion people.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.400
Of course, everybody wants to do business in China.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.660
But again, it's about how you do that business.

19:56.660 --> 20:02.840
And again, you know, when this ban doesn't match that ban, and so on and so on.

20:02.840 --> 20:10.560
Is it as much of a crime to say free Hong Kong as it is to say F A G G O T on a stream?

20:10.560 --> 20:18.040
So you know, that's, that's, that's why I feel for me that argument doesn't work.

20:18.040 --> 20:22.040
And also one other thing I'd say about that whole thing is that Apple, I don't mean, it

20:22.040 --> 20:25.960
could be Apple, it could be Microsoft, it could be Samsung, it could be, you know, and

20:25.960 --> 20:28.360
insert whoever you want here.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.040
That is a device that I use to stay in contact with family and all that stuff.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.240
We're talking about that versus a video game.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.320
One is a little more easier to cut out than the other.

20:39.320 --> 20:44.600
I think that's why you have so much activism against Chick-fil-A, for example.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.620
It's really easy to cut out fast food.

20:47.620 --> 20:51.420
I don't want to dive down that whole well right now, but I think that's what makes that

20:51.420 --> 20:53.760
particular boycott really easy.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.160
It's fast food.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.480
Most people shouldn't be eating it anyway.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.920
Anyhow, other comments in chat.

21:00.920 --> 21:09.120
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network, a zet in our chat says, watch what they do, not

21:09.120 --> 21:10.400
what they say.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.300
Very, very well said.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.300
That's exactly what it is.

21:13.300 --> 21:18.200
And we've got, and what I'm trying to say is, look, y'all, we've got like a year.

21:18.200 --> 21:21.540
So Blizzard's got a whole chance to be awesome.

21:21.540 --> 21:25.800
And I will say that little rainbow pan, at least that he was wearing, that was cool.

21:25.800 --> 21:26.960
That was a nice gesture.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.160
That's a little baby step.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.160
That's a cool thing.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.160
Yay.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.000
But we got a ways to go.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
All right.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Anyway, fifth dream today in chat says other companies make phones, you guys.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yes.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.280
And I've seen every single one of those other companies used in a don't support X company

21:45.280 --> 21:47.280
because China.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.280
You name it.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.280
Samsung, there's a reason.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.280
Google, there's a reason.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.320
Microsoft, you still using a Windows phone?

21:52.320 --> 21:53.320
There's a reason.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.040
Everybody's got a reason.

21:55.120 --> 22:01.320
I would also look at, and just back to that, look at all of these various companies' interactions

22:01.320 --> 22:06.120
with the government where they operate out of, and also look at the action.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.120
Just saying.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
All right.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.340
Let's get back to games because, you know, let's talk about the games that were announced

22:12.340 --> 22:13.340
at BlizzCon.

22:13.340 --> 22:17.360
Because I will say, of course, you know, despite all this stuff, I still want to be, I'm still

22:17.360 --> 22:18.580
a fan of gaming.

22:18.580 --> 22:21.560
And I got to say, some of these games look pretty darn cool.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.100
Let's talk first about Overwatch 2.

22:24.100 --> 22:28.860
So on Twitch right now, we're playing some of the gameplay trailer that they put out

22:28.860 --> 22:33.300
for Overwatch 2, which shows some of the new features that are going to be in the game,

22:33.300 --> 22:36.860
such as there's a new Toronto map, but it looks like they're kind of reusing some maps,

22:36.860 --> 22:39.140
but they are going to be some new modes.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.420
They've kind of redone what the characters look like.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.620
There's going to be more of a focus on PvE.

22:43.620 --> 22:48.340
Didn't I say before that if Overwatch were to ever do an expansion, they could do something

22:48.340 --> 22:49.660
on PvE?

22:49.660 --> 22:50.660
Just saying.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.660
Yes.

22:51.660 --> 22:52.780
I'm not trying to be that guy that's like, I was right.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.820
But anyway.

22:54.820 --> 23:00.300
And then they're revealing a new hero in this trailer as well, a new type of map that you

23:00.300 --> 23:04.260
can fight on, like a push map, which is actually really funny.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.220
Blizzard is a master at putting together these types of trailers.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.560
You'll notice I'm not showing this.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.660
I love this part of the trailer, the push mode where the little robot is like, I am

23:12.660 --> 23:16.140
really good at pushing, like says these, it's really cute.

23:16.140 --> 23:19.220
It's very Disney and it's very, very well done.

23:19.220 --> 23:22.180
And you can't help but get goosebumps when you see something like this.

23:22.180 --> 23:25.620
I mean, and if you're an Overwatch fan, I mean, double so.

23:25.620 --> 23:29.260
This looks really, really, really good, I got to say.

23:29.260 --> 23:32.500
You know, especially if you're an Overwatch fan.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.500
Very interesting though.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.500
Oh, and there we go.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.620
And you know, a lot of folks out there saying, when are we going to get a black woman in

23:38.620 --> 23:40.780
Overwatch?

23:40.780 --> 23:44.860
And there we have people of color, women in Overwatch.

23:44.860 --> 23:51.260
We don't have a black woman in Overwatch, but Blizzard did announce they're going to

23:51.260 --> 23:54.860
handle that with us, is her name Sojour, Sojourne.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.860
When are we going to goose in Overwatch, dammit?

23:56.860 --> 23:58.060
I want the goose.

23:58.060 --> 23:59.060
The goose?

23:59.060 --> 24:00.060
The goose has to be in Overwatch.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.060
Oh, for the goose game?

24:01.060 --> 24:02.060
Yes.

24:02.060 --> 24:03.540
I think the goose would be better suited for Smash.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.540
Just saying.

24:04.540 --> 24:05.540
All the games.

24:05.540 --> 24:06.540
I don't care.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.540
All of them.

24:07.540 --> 24:11.380
Smash, Pokemon, Animal Crossing.

24:11.380 --> 24:15.180
It turns out the goose is doing the pushing on the new Toronto map.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.180
Anyway.

24:16.180 --> 24:19.340
Uh, but no, I will say the game looks really good.

24:19.420 --> 24:25.180
Here was the hot take I had on Twitter that, um, I don't know, I, I said that Overwatch

24:25.180 --> 24:32.140
2, well, okay, here's why, because they mentioned, oh, if you have Overwatch 1, you can play

24:32.140 --> 24:37.220
with people in Overwatch 2 and Overwatch 1 will still get the new heroes and it'll still

24:37.220 --> 24:42.700
get, I think some of the new stuff, but it's not going to get the new play modes.

24:42.700 --> 24:46.240
It's not going to have, like some stuff is still going to be locked out.

24:46.240 --> 24:50.960
And I was kind of like, you know why this is so easy for Overwatch 2 to be cross play

24:50.960 --> 24:54.880
with Overwatch 1, because it's an expansion.

24:54.880 --> 24:59.460
It's a really well branded expansion to Overwatch 1.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.200
That's not a bad thing, y'all.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.200
Don't come for me.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
Okay.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.200
I didn't send for you.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.200
Okay.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.200
It's, it's not a bad thing.

25:06.200 --> 25:11.160
And I think we see this type of thing happen quite often in the sports game world, right?

25:11.160 --> 25:14.920
But an Overwatch is a giant e-sport.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.000
You know, who's an expert at reselling old content.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.560
I'll give you a hint.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.280
It's part of the company name.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.840
So that's a, that's an Activision playbook.

25:26.840 --> 25:27.840
Yeah. Right.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.800
Um, so you know what I, I, and maybe under the hood, maybe it is a sequel, maybe it is

25:32.800 --> 25:35.580
an all new graphical engine or something under the hood.

25:35.580 --> 25:40.680
I'm glad that at least letting your like, you know, skins and stuff transfer over because

25:40.680 --> 25:43.560
if it were Activision, it would just make you buy those things again.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.960
But I, you know, well, and you know, hello, let's celebrate that.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.100
That is something to note.

25:48.100 --> 25:53.040
And I think it is, it, I will say this, that's actually not shade.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.480
What I'm saying there is that, oh, Overwatch 2 is kind of like an expansion for Overwatch

25:56.480 --> 25:57.480
1.

25:57.480 --> 26:04.120
It actually does seem like the smart and only possible way to not so much fragment the fan

26:04.120 --> 26:10.600
base, especially when you're still trying to push this Overwatch league thing.

26:10.600 --> 26:15.900
And how is the Overwatch league going to, like, let's say Overwatch 2 did come out and

26:15.900 --> 26:19.040
it was a completely new engine, completely new game.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.800
Didn't work with the first game or anything because it's all new stuff.

26:21.800 --> 26:25.400
It would be like, how would you, which game would they play in Overwatch league?

26:25.400 --> 26:26.720
What would, how would they sell it?

26:26.720 --> 26:30.160
Like would they just completely leave Overwatch 1 behind and say, oh, it's all about that

26:30.160 --> 26:31.160
Overwatch 2 shit.

26:31.160 --> 26:36.360
Now I don't understand if the Overwatch loyalists features that they're adding are PvE.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.360
Who cares?

26:37.360 --> 26:40.560
Like if it fragments, it's not, I love the PvE stuff.

26:40.560 --> 26:44.520
But yeah, but like, I don't see how this would, this wouldn't be any different than

26:44.520 --> 26:48.760
just selling an expansion except now they can sell it for like $40 instead of $20.

26:48.760 --> 26:54.800
Well, and there are there to be fair, it's not solely PvE because there are new PvP map

26:54.800 --> 27:01.040
types and those will be, uh, locked such as a new map and world of Warcraft will be locked

27:01.040 --> 27:05.880
if you don't get the shadow lands expansion when that comes out, because that's how expansions

27:05.880 --> 27:09.000
work cash grab to me.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.760
I actually completely disagree with as critical as I've been a blizzard.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.520
I don't say, I don't think it's a cash grab.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.200
I think this is very blizzards model.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.880
They do, they do expansions with Diablo all the time.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.160
They do expansions with world of Warcraft.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.960
They do expansions with Warcraft 3.

27:25.960 --> 27:30.160
No, no, I'm not saying that I'm not saying that's wrong that they do an expansion.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.760
I'm talking about, yes, I have Overwatch 1.

27:32.760 --> 27:37.760
I buy an expansion for the adds additional content to the game.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.400
Yes, I understand what an expansion is.

27:39.400 --> 27:45.120
This is, hey, you like this game while you want the additional content to re-buy the

27:45.120 --> 27:47.480
whole fucking game again is what I mean.

27:47.480 --> 27:51.440
I actually don't think it's that at all because they are saying the original Overwatch will

27:51.440 --> 27:57.600
still get the new heroes and enough to be cross compatible with Overwatch 2.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.760
It's just if you want these extra PvE, you want these extra new skins, you want these

28:01.760 --> 28:06.920
new PvP modes, then you're going to have to buy this expansion, which is called 2.

28:06.960 --> 28:17.200
Arguably this expansion is going to be the cost of a full game versus what I feel DLC

28:17.200 --> 28:20.000
would be priced at.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.240
I'm going to some comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network and Bobby does say clearly

28:25.240 --> 28:26.240
they didn't announce price.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.320
I figured they did because again, we're a year out.

28:28.320 --> 28:33.120
I mean, games prices may change overall in a year, who knows at least.

28:33.120 --> 28:37.560
Matt Defton chat says PvE is what Overwatch needed so badly.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.800
Fifth Dream Today says just pull a DOA and make 3000 of the same DLC for the next game.

28:41.800 --> 28:46.960
S2100 Matt says the PvE stuff they did in Overwatch was one was only for a limited time

28:46.960 --> 28:49.280
and was limited in what they did with it.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.640
From what they are showing, this broadens everything.

28:52.640 --> 28:57.120
Quest Buster says, speaking of fragmentation, Activision also wanted to avoid fragmenting

28:57.120 --> 29:01.360
the base with the new Modern Warfare and the upcoming content with free maps and no season

29:01.360 --> 29:02.360
passes.

29:02.360 --> 29:07.000
Ooh, I like this comment from Matt Deft who says what we suggested on GFM cast is that

29:07.000 --> 29:13.520
probably Overwatch one is going free to play or that Overwatch two will include Overwatch

29:13.520 --> 29:14.520
one for free.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.320
Well, I think it kind of has to.

29:16.320 --> 29:22.480
I think Overwatch two by default kind of has to, but I really like that theory that Overwatch

29:22.480 --> 29:24.880
one might just straight up go free to play.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.480
I don't think it will.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.880
I I'm not going to be so quick to shoot that theory down.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.080
I'm not going to say, Oh, you're right.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.080
You're right.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.440
I don't think it'll happen at the same time.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.440
I think Overwatch two will come out first.

29:38.440 --> 29:43.280
Then maybe after a year, that might be like the long-term plan.

29:43.280 --> 29:46.280
I could see that, but I don't know.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.280
We'll see.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.640
So that's Overwatch two.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.120
You know, again, Blizzard does a great job at putting together the trailers, really kind

29:53.120 --> 29:55.480
of hit you in the feels with all that stuff.

29:55.480 --> 30:01.040
And you know, yeah, like I, I would love to play the PvE stuff in Overwatch, quite frankly.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
So I'm curious to hear more about that.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.320
And then of course, the other big reveal, the thing I didn't grab video for was World

30:07.320 --> 30:11.040
of Warcraft Shadowlands, just because, you know, we do have a lot, a lot, a lot of news

30:11.040 --> 30:15.040
to get into tonight, so I can't do all the BlizzCon stuff, but yes, there is a new World

30:15.040 --> 30:16.200
of Warcraft expansion coming.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.200
It's called Shadowlands.

30:17.200 --> 30:21.840
You know, it's going to allow you to level your character from 50 to 60.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.840
Why?

30:22.840 --> 30:25.120
Because the level squish is incoming.

30:25.120 --> 30:30.080
So a current level 120 character will be squished to level 50.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.880
And it's going to be very interesting because apparently you're going to level to 10 in

30:33.880 --> 30:34.880
a new zone.

30:34.880 --> 30:39.280
And then from 10 to 50, you can level in any of the expansions because it was getting to

30:39.280 --> 30:40.320
be too much.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.820
Like I kind of figured this had to be coming.

30:42.820 --> 30:47.920
Like Warcraft has had so many expansions now that like, if you want to level an alt, it

30:47.920 --> 30:49.860
can really be a slog.

30:49.860 --> 30:53.400
So I actually think this is a good thing.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.760
It's just going to be interesting to see how this plays out.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.400
But they're saying that everything, I mean, like you're not going to get screwed out of

30:59.400 --> 31:03.760
being able to hunt for transmog gear and stuff.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.880
Like you can still run the old dungeons and really overpower it.

31:07.880 --> 31:13.160
I think the official lines was something like, we want the level ups to feel more meaningful

31:13.160 --> 31:15.120
in scale and blah, blah, blah.

31:15.120 --> 31:20.680
But the reality is like, it's like if they had up the level cap to 130, it's too fucking

31:20.680 --> 31:21.680
much.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.840
This takes too long and it's too much of a slog through old ass expansions.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.840
So you know what?

31:26.840 --> 31:29.240
I honestly think this is actually a better idea.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
So cool.

31:30.240 --> 31:36.320
Anyway, but the other big game that was announced, of course, was finally Diablo 4.

31:36.320 --> 31:42.100
And here's some gameplay of Diablo 4 that they showed, which, you know, looks very similar

31:42.100 --> 31:44.480
to any other Diablo game I've seen.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.080
But it just, you know, you can see the years of upgraded graphics and so forth.

31:48.080 --> 31:51.240
A lot of people are talking about how the new Diablo has like a darker tone.

31:51.240 --> 31:57.160
I don't know if I, I guess, I mean, it's, I think people hate on Diablo 3 too much,

31:57.160 --> 31:58.320
to be quite honest.

31:58.320 --> 32:05.000
I don't think what I'm seeing in this Diablo 4 is like some massive color palette shift

32:05.000 --> 32:06.260
from Diablo 3.

32:06.260 --> 32:07.520
I don't see that.

32:07.520 --> 32:12.440
What I do see is riding horsies and I do see the druid shifting into a bear, which looked

32:12.440 --> 32:13.440
really cool.

32:13.440 --> 32:17.980
And I think a lot of those classes are coming back and yeah, I mean, I, I've always been

32:17.980 --> 32:20.200
a big fan of the Diablo games.

32:20.200 --> 32:25.500
It took a little bit for Diablo 3 to get there, but it got there and it's really fun to play.

32:25.500 --> 32:28.140
And I'm curious to hear more about Diablo 4.

32:28.140 --> 32:31.940
I think it is still like really early on me again, it looks really good.

32:31.940 --> 32:37.140
We see things in the snow and, you know, we do see like a real kind of varied amount of

32:37.140 --> 32:40.520
different environments that the Diablo game is taking place in.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.940
So that does seem really cool.

32:43.100 --> 32:48.500
I think one thing that they did very well in Diablo 3 was that they really created this

32:48.500 --> 32:53.540
end game in the expansion with running the rifts and all that stuff that of course they

32:53.540 --> 32:58.260
didn't really have time to get into with this Diablo 4 discussion and everything that they

32:58.260 --> 33:01.380
were showing at BlizzCon with Diablo 4.

33:01.380 --> 33:04.580
You know, because there's just so much to get into with the game and they probably want

33:04.580 --> 33:08.020
to focus a little bit on the story mode and the base and the demo that people were going

33:08.020 --> 33:09.500
to play while they were there.

33:09.500 --> 33:12.860
So they're not ready to talk about end game yet because this game is still forever out

33:12.860 --> 33:13.980
and that's fine.

33:13.980 --> 33:17.780
But I'm curious to hear more about that when the time gets closer.

33:17.780 --> 33:23.580
But this will be the thing that I will really want to get so why I am, believe it or not,

33:23.580 --> 33:28.540
really rooting for Blizzard to make those internal changes they need to take and for

33:28.540 --> 33:34.260
Jay Allen to mean it when he says he's going to take accountability and shift those changes

33:34.260 --> 33:38.020
the way they need to be shifted so that I can feel good about buying Diablo 4 when it

33:38.020 --> 33:40.540
comes out because it does look pretty hot.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.640
And honestly I'll probably buy Overwatch 2 as well with the same bullet point that

33:44.640 --> 33:46.820
I put on the last one.

33:46.820 --> 33:49.660
Any thoughts on Diablo 4 from you guys and our chat?

33:49.660 --> 33:52.220
It looks pretty but it's more fucking Diablo.

33:52.220 --> 33:54.420
But is more fucking Diablo a bad thing?

33:54.420 --> 34:00.100
I don't know, I got bored with Diablo 3, I got bored with Diablo 2, just Diablo is kind

34:00.100 --> 34:01.100
of boring.

34:01.100 --> 34:07.340
The clicks and destruction and loot and gold, it's very soothing in a weird way.

34:07.340 --> 34:12.700
It didn't gather any of my interest, it really didn't.

34:12.700 --> 34:17.580
Loki, I don't think you've really ever super been into Diablo but now what I didn't show

34:17.580 --> 34:22.300
here was there was a very long cinematic that was very gory and so forth.

34:22.300 --> 34:25.340
And you know what, Blizzard's cinematics team always does a great job.

34:25.340 --> 34:27.980
I just didn't show it here because it wasn't the game.

34:27.980 --> 34:35.100
But it was a great announced trailer and it always baffles my mind why the Blizzard cinematics

34:35.100 --> 34:38.060
team just doesn't make a movie.

34:38.060 --> 34:40.380
Imagine if they had just made the World of Warcraft movie.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.780
It would probably have been better than it was.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.660
Honestly, it very much might have.

34:44.660 --> 34:46.580
So I don't know what's up with that.

34:46.580 --> 34:50.920
Thank you, now I just remembered that they made a Warcraft movie.

34:50.920 --> 34:54.080
You know what movie they ought to- I liked it by the way, I liked the movie.

34:54.080 --> 34:57.740
I didn't think it was terrible but here's the thing.

34:57.740 --> 35:02.940
The movie they ought to make, Blizzard's cinematic team ought to make an Overwatch movie.

35:02.940 --> 35:06.060
I really think that's a missed opportunity.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.860
It seems ridiculous that that- maybe that's a thing that will happen in a few years.

35:09.860 --> 35:16.780
But an Overwatch movie seems like the biggest opportunity that they're not taking.

35:16.780 --> 35:18.420
I don't know why they share movies now.

35:18.420 --> 35:23.140
You know who kind of picked up on that opportunity and decided to go ahead and run with that?

35:23.140 --> 35:24.140
Riot Games.

35:24.140 --> 35:25.860
Did you see their announcement?

35:25.860 --> 35:26.860
No I didn't.

35:26.860 --> 35:30.500
So Riot Games, they always do these really cool cinematics and music videos and stuff

35:30.500 --> 35:33.220
around their League of Legends tournaments and everything.

35:33.220 --> 35:40.820
So now they have their animation studio working on a series called Arcane which is their animated

35:40.820 --> 35:45.180
series that kind of ties in all the cinematics that they've been doing.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.620
But they do some pretty awesome stuff.

35:46.620 --> 35:50.780
I remember the KDA music video and everything and they've had a bunch of cool things that

35:50.780 --> 35:51.780
they put out.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.380
So I'm looking forward to anything that they've done.

35:54.380 --> 35:55.860
But yes, they should do that too.

35:55.860 --> 35:58.660
I think it would be very fitting.

35:58.660 --> 35:59.660
Agree.

35:59.900 --> 36:05.260
Now I want to get into something else that was posted on our Discord actually.

36:05.260 --> 36:07.140
I want to talk a little bit about this.

36:07.140 --> 36:12.860
So a shout out for our Discord server at voggenetwork.com slash Discord because sometimes you guys post

36:12.860 --> 36:13.860
stories there.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.300
This is kind of like a completely different note.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.500
It's not necessarily about BlizzCon itself but I thought this was very interesting.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.780
I wanted to get your guys' take on this including in our chat room.

36:22.780 --> 36:26.260
But it's a story about the Overwatch 2 leak.

36:26.260 --> 36:29.940
Now we've been off for the past two weeks so we did not get a chance to talk about the

36:29.940 --> 36:30.940
leaks.

36:30.940 --> 36:34.540
But I think most of you generally know at this point that it was pretty much out there

36:34.540 --> 36:39.420
that Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 were going to be happening because there was an ESPN related

36:39.420 --> 36:40.420
leak with Overwatch.

36:40.420 --> 36:44.980
There was like a foreign guide art book or something that leaked the Diablo 4.

36:44.980 --> 36:47.060
But we knew these things were coming, right?

36:47.060 --> 36:50.380
But there was an interesting interview with Jeff Kaplan who of course is the creative

36:50.380 --> 36:55.100
guy behind Overwatch that talked about how those leaks were very frustrating for the

36:55.100 --> 36:57.460
Overwatch 2 team.

36:57.460 --> 37:01.340
Because what happened, here's the quote, our artists are heartbroken.

37:01.340 --> 37:04.100
They take such care to make the art look beautiful.

37:04.100 --> 37:07.620
And then we get some crappy version of what the art looks like, because somebody had like

37:07.620 --> 37:09.520
taken a cell phone pic or something, I don't know.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.460
And then people are like, I don't know, it doesn't look that good.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.680
And we're like, no, it does.

37:13.680 --> 37:14.680
It looks amazing.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.620
It's just a crappy screenshot that someone took.

37:16.620 --> 37:19.760
So it can be a bit demoralizing.

37:19.760 --> 37:24.940
That's a very interesting comment, especially when you consider many people were theorizing

37:24.940 --> 37:29.260
that the leaks were intentional on Blizzard's part to try to deflect.

37:29.260 --> 37:32.180
I don't know if I buy into that, but I'll just put it out there because it is something

37:32.180 --> 37:33.620
gamers are talking about.

37:33.620 --> 37:40.700
That Blizzard potentially put those leaks out there themselves in order to get the focus

37:40.700 --> 37:45.460
off of what was happening with the Hearthstone competition and the results.

37:45.460 --> 37:48.200
And instead to talk about the future of Blizzard things.

37:48.200 --> 37:52.420
So it's very interesting the whole leaks and how they can be damaging for the game.

37:52.420 --> 37:53.420
What do you guys think?

37:53.420 --> 37:55.140
Good thing or are leaks a bad thing?

37:55.140 --> 37:56.140
Depends.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.140
Depends.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.140
It's good for me.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.780
It's really, it's really situational because in some cases it builds hype for something

38:01.780 --> 38:04.220
that makes people even more interested in it.

38:04.220 --> 38:05.220
Yeah.

38:05.220 --> 38:12.800
I mean, like for me, if there's a movie that I want to see, I might go look for like leaked

38:12.800 --> 38:17.980
reviews or, you know, things like, or I might see like, does the dog die or something?

38:17.980 --> 38:23.260
Well, I'm giggling because speaking of discord, I feel like, and I'm not being shady, I promise,

38:23.260 --> 38:27.060
but I feel like every week there's the weekly tiger claw update on what's going on with

38:27.060 --> 38:32.500
the Sonic the Hedgehog movie based off what's leaked from either a standee that showed up

38:32.500 --> 38:37.020
in a cinema or what junkie XL doing the soundtrack has made a comment about the redesign.

38:37.020 --> 38:39.860
I think that was the thing this week and so on and so on.

38:39.860 --> 38:45.440
So it's interesting because I mean, you know, for, for fans and folks, even though I'm,

38:45.440 --> 38:49.260
I'm very much, when it comes to that, I'm very much like, I'll wait for the new tree.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.500
You had me at junkie XL doing the soundtrack.

38:51.740 --> 38:54.860
I mean, that's already like that Jim Carrey being in it.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.260
I mean, I totally see it.

38:56.260 --> 38:57.420
So it's, so it's interesting.

38:57.420 --> 39:01.460
So those leaks can sometimes be, uh, well, I just didn't realize he was doing the soundtrack.

39:01.460 --> 39:02.940
That's okay.

39:02.940 --> 39:03.980
But that is something, right?

39:04.340 --> 39:14.620
So anyway, uh, let's see, uh, going to, uh, comment from YYR in our Twitch chat who says, uh,

39:14.620 --> 39:16.820
leaks make a game healthier.

39:16.820 --> 39:21.020
Green vegetables are great for your health because it's L E E K S get, get it.

39:21.500 --> 39:21.820
Get it.

39:21.820 --> 39:22.620
Thanks, dad.

39:22.820 --> 39:26.100
YYR officially making dad jokes in the chat.

39:26.100 --> 39:26.580
Thank you.

39:26.580 --> 39:28.660
Officially, um, act.

39:28.660 --> 39:31.820
Defton chat says speaking of leaks, how about them Pokemon leaks?

39:32.020 --> 39:33.980
Well, that's one that's going on right now, right?

39:34.220 --> 39:39.820
I know some people are trying to avoid those leaks, so I'm not going to get into them in great detail.

39:39.940 --> 39:44.500
I will just point out, I have a text message from Shane about an hour ago talking about that.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.380
I guess the pokey decks has leaked.

39:46.500 --> 39:50.620
So I'm like, which Pokemon got cut and he's kind of explaining it to me again.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.980
I'm going to respect the wishes of those that are trying to avoid the leaks.

39:53.140 --> 39:59.260
So I don't want to get into those details, but, um, I mean, it is causing us to talk about Pokemon and get that

39:59.260 --> 40:01.180
whole like hype building a little bit there.

40:01.380 --> 40:06.820
I mean, in Shane's case, not that any additional hype is needed, but I suppose, you know, I'm a little bit more of a

40:06.820 --> 40:08.580
filthy casual when it comes to Pokemon.

40:08.700 --> 40:12.660
So talking about it does make me go, oh yeah, that Pokemon games in like two weeks.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.900
It's going to be here before I know it.

40:14.020 --> 40:14.900
Crazy stuff.

40:15.220 --> 40:16.660
So anyway.

40:17.620 --> 40:18.620
All right.

40:20.260 --> 40:25.140
Bobby Blackwood from chat says, how do you know when a joke becomes a dad joke when it becomes a parent?

40:26.700 --> 40:27.220
All right.

40:27.220 --> 40:27.660
Anyway,

40:29.500 --> 40:30.180
womp, womp.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.860
All right, uh, let's move on.

40:31.860 --> 40:39.340
We've spent a long time on that topic, but there's, that's honestly, I feel like outside of Blizzcon, that's like all anybody's been talking about this weekend.

40:39.620 --> 40:43.180
There is some other stuff that's been going on in the world that we will get into.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.820
Um, but we were gone for a couple of weeks, right?

40:45.820 --> 40:48.780
This is our first show back since I think October 13th.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.700
Um, not completely by our design.

40:51.980 --> 41:00.020
Um, I'll explain a little bit more about that in a moment, but I thought we could take an opportunity to talk about what were some of the big headlines we missed in our time off.

41:00.020 --> 41:03.820
So Loki, what were some of the things we missed while we were gone for two weeks?

41:04.100 --> 41:15.780
Um, so apparently we have a new system coming out from analog, so they're doing a portable system that looks kind of like a original Game Boy, but it plays most portable games.

41:16.060 --> 41:17.980
I've reached out to try to get a demo, by the way.

41:18.540 --> 41:19.060
Oh.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.180
Um, so it looks pretty awesome.

41:21.180 --> 41:26.020
It's got like a 1600 by 1440 resolution, three and a half inch screen.

41:26.260 --> 41:36.020
It plays Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games out of the gate, and then they're going to have adapters for the game gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, Atari Lynx, and more.

41:36.300 --> 41:44.620
And with the, you know, resolutions on the screen, I can imagine they could play quite a bit more, but the system's going to cost $200 and it's coming out sometime in 2020.

41:44.860 --> 41:45.980
And it looks so nice.

41:46.540 --> 41:49.900
I mean, I'm not even really interested in handheld games, but I kind of want one.

41:49.900 --> 41:58.900
I feel like I have so many like retro things that like, as neat as this looks, I'm like, if I have, if I buy one more of these things, honestly, I need less shit in this house, not more.

41:59.460 --> 42:01.140
Well, this plays like original cartridges.

42:01.140 --> 42:12.620
This isn't like one of those, you know, uh, classic mini systems or anything like that, which really I'm surprised Nintendo's not doing a classic mini Game Boy or something like that, but I guess we'll have to wait and see on that.

42:13.100 --> 42:18.780
Um, so then Capcom also mentioned that they want to bring back some old dead franchises.

42:18.860 --> 42:21.900
Uh, one that sounds like they may be batting around is Akami.

42:21.900 --> 42:24.100
So we may see a new Akami game pretty soon.

42:24.540 --> 42:33.860
And apparently, uh, Japanese arcade, Anata no Warehouse is closing down and they apparently were pretty legendary interesting arcade.

42:34.060 --> 42:40.700
Um, and it's unfortunate that they're going down because of a change to the sales tax laws in Japan.

42:41.700 --> 42:43.140
And let's see what else.

42:43.860 --> 42:54.740
So we had some announcements regarding, um, Panzer Dragoon remake is getting a physical edition, which I know that was teased also come into PC.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.460
Yeah, I'm excited about that.

42:56.500 --> 42:57.780
That's a pretty soon, isn't it?

42:58.180 --> 42:58.820
I think so.

42:58.860 --> 42:59.620
Yeah, I think so too.

42:59.620 --> 43:02.460
I think it is a holiday for this year game, believe it or not.

43:02.740 --> 43:05.420
Uh, now that Halloween's over, we're in the holidays.

43:05.420 --> 43:08.140
Apparently some people say we've skipped Thanksgiving.

43:08.220 --> 43:10.940
I've always kind of considered Thanksgiving a holiday.

43:11.140 --> 43:14.180
So I sort of thought this period was always the holidays.

43:14.380 --> 43:25.180
I kind of got mad, like, like, or at least an annoyed look in my face the other day because it was like the middle of October and they were wearing Santa hats at the grocery store I went to to get a sandwich.

43:25.180 --> 43:26.980
I'm like, really?

43:27.300 --> 43:29.260
Like it's not even fucking Halloween yet.

43:29.260 --> 43:29.620
Really?

43:29.620 --> 43:31.180
You got fucking Santa hats?

43:31.180 --> 43:32.100
I mean, what the hell?

43:32.300 --> 43:32.780
Back to games.

43:32.900 --> 43:33.420
Anyway, sorry.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.860
Um, so then what else?

43:36.900 --> 43:39.940
Uh, they're going to have used to acknowledge your weird pagan holiday.

43:41.540 --> 43:45.420
They're going to be doing physical releases of the Aladdin and Lion King games.

43:45.460 --> 43:46.980
Uh, yeah, I heard about that.

43:47.340 --> 43:49.900
Uh, so those are going to be coming out as well.

43:49.940 --> 43:55.620
Uh, I'm surprised the licensing got all worked out for that, especially how both those movies got the real life remakes.

43:55.860 --> 44:01.980
Disney's been some real dicks too about their old properties, especially the stuff they just got from Fox.

44:02.180 --> 44:19.420
There's this whole thing, and I don't want to deviate too much from games, but I think this is kind of adjacent because like, like there would be cinemas in town that would do like late night screenings of the princess bride or Ghostbusters or, and I don't, you know, like all these, I don't even know if those are actually Fox or Disney, but like classic movies and stuff.

44:19.420 --> 44:19.660
Right?

44:19.780 --> 44:19.980
Yeah.

44:20.020 --> 44:21.140
Disney's pulled all that.

44:21.220 --> 44:27.420
They're not allowing theaters to show those old movies anymore with one notable exception.

44:27.420 --> 44:33.980
There is one exception that they haven't touched, and that's a little movie called the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is still a Fox movie.

44:33.980 --> 44:49.740
And I think, I think the reason why is because they know if they touch that they're going to be fucked with a capital F because there will be some angry cross dressers out there acting out the rock or picture show, which I've been a proud member of that scene for a long, long time.

44:49.980 --> 44:52.100
Uh, that will be very upset at that whole thing.

44:52.100 --> 44:57.220
So, uh, I think Disney is rightfully so stayed away from the rock or picture show.

44:57.220 --> 45:00.660
But everything else they've been like not renewing rights, not granting.

45:00.860 --> 45:02.940
And it's all because of fucking Disney Plus.

45:04.060 --> 45:06.980
Because why, why go to the theater to see it when you can buy Disney Plus?

45:06.980 --> 45:10.980
Well, it's kind of like, that's the other thing that kind of annoying for me.

45:10.980 --> 45:19.100
Cause most of the MCU, this next phase of it is they're Disney Plus shows, which I'm like, okay, well, the cinematic universe.

45:19.100 --> 45:25.780
I kind of was hoping more than being the cinemas, but I guess TV now, cinematic universe, whatever.

45:26.740 --> 45:31.180
Tiger Claw says, I'm sure you're still giddy that the rock your picture show is now a Disney movie.

45:31.340 --> 45:37.100
Actually, Tiger Claw, I feel the exact opposite of that remark, especially in light of everything I just talked about.

45:37.500 --> 45:41.060
Fuck Disney right now with a whole lot of this, this sucks.

45:41.900 --> 45:49.540
I was going to get Disney Plus, but now I kind of don't want to because I don't want to support this.

45:49.980 --> 45:52.620
Oh, there goes Rob again, talking about boycotts.

45:52.860 --> 45:57.020
I don't know if it's, it's not a, I don't think it's a boycott so much as it is.

45:57.340 --> 45:58.580
I don't want to buy that.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.060
Yeah, I don't want to buy that.

46:02.140 --> 46:08.100
So they did a piece on Conan O'Brien about Death Stranding in his visit to Kojima Studios.

46:08.100 --> 46:11.580
And of course, predictably so, he's in the game.

46:12.420 --> 46:13.340
So that's awesome.

46:14.780 --> 46:17.820
Last of Us 2 got delayed to spring of 2020.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.100
I heard it got another little delay.

46:19.100 --> 46:20.020
That's all right.

46:20.020 --> 46:24.740
Well, you know, honestly, again, if you need the delay to get it right, delay it.

46:24.780 --> 46:25.260
Cool.

46:25.660 --> 46:25.980
Yep.

46:26.420 --> 46:27.620
And then, um,

46:27.620 --> 46:29.340
We should start celebrating delays.

46:30.220 --> 46:36.820
We should, I maybe I'm going to put that on the list of things to do, uh, make a bumper to celebrate video game delays.

46:37.180 --> 46:39.100
I'm going to, I'll get on that for 2020.

46:39.740 --> 46:40.100
Okay.

46:41.020 --> 46:49.060
And then I was going to say, um, last but not least, uh, let's see, we'll talk about how Sony has confirmed that PlayStation,

46:49.060 --> 46:53.100
um, six through 10 in Japan, at least the trademarks for those are in place.

46:53.460 --> 46:55.620
I think we're actually getting into that a little later in tonight's show.

46:55.620 --> 46:56.900
Well, now I spoiled it for you.

46:56.900 --> 46:58.380
So there you go.

46:58.420 --> 46:59.660
We'll come into it a little later.

46:59.740 --> 47:01.740
See how it says this week at the top of that.

47:01.740 --> 47:02.780
That's whatever.

47:02.780 --> 47:03.100
You know what?

47:03.100 --> 47:04.300
I'm not paying attention to this shit.

47:05.740 --> 47:06.180
All right.

47:06.260 --> 47:09.860
Anyway, our shows as broken as WWE 2K20.

47:12.660 --> 47:13.020
All right.

47:13.020 --> 47:15.820
Let's get into, uh, another segment here.

47:15.820 --> 47:18.740
We're gonna talk a little bit about our gaming weeks, but we're gonna do it a little bit

47:18.740 --> 47:22.580
differently because, um, we've been gone for three weeks, so there's been a lot going on.

47:22.580 --> 47:24.980
So I want to do a segment called how is your week?

47:24.980 --> 47:25.900
How is your day?

47:25.940 --> 47:30.180
And those long time OLR fans may recognize that name.

47:30.180 --> 47:35.820
I've brought it back from the dead, uh, tonight just because it's been so long and I know a lot has been going on.

47:35.820 --> 47:42.300
So first collectively before I go to dark soccer, because of course I'll, I'll let her go first, but generally I want to speak to what happened to the show.

47:42.500 --> 47:52.380
So, um, two weeks ago we knew we weren't going to be here kind of because I found out for work about two or three weeks prior I was going to need to be gone.

47:52.380 --> 47:58.940
I was going to be on my way to Vegas for some work related things and I had to fly out on a Sunday because it started Monday morning.

47:59.100 --> 48:00.860
So we knew two weeks ago we wouldn't be here.

48:00.860 --> 48:02.580
The reality is day job.

48:02.780 --> 48:03.980
Most important thing.

48:04.020 --> 48:08.380
It pays the bills without this, the lights aren't on, so got to do the J job stuff.

48:08.380 --> 48:10.180
So I think y'all understand and know about that.

48:10.580 --> 48:15.900
Last week was a little shittier because believe it or not, we were pre, we were here, we were prepping to do a show.

48:15.900 --> 48:16.820
We were all going to be here.

48:16.820 --> 48:17.580
It was going to be great.

48:17.580 --> 48:18.620
We're going to do the show.

48:18.620 --> 48:25.220
And then, um, we had some crazy ass wind here in the Sacramento area and really up and down California.

48:25.420 --> 48:30.140
I'm sure you guys have heard about those really horrific fires that have been happening up and down the state.

48:30.460 --> 48:35.020
Um, and, uh, luckily not so much here in our area in Sacramento.

48:35.020 --> 48:44.260
Yes, there were some fires in Sacramento, but I don't believe any structures or most importantly, people, maybe a few structures, but no people in the Sacramento area.

48:44.260 --> 48:48.460
So for the most part, we were fine, except I'm so glad there wasn't any spontaneous combustion.

48:48.780 --> 48:52.380
The, the problem was is those high winds killed the cable.

48:52.860 --> 48:56.660
And so without the cable, we couldn't broadcast our show on Twitch.

48:56.940 --> 49:02.940
And I did give thought to, well, we could all sit here and at least record something and we could just put it on the podcast feed.

49:03.100 --> 49:09.380
But the problem is without cable, we can't pull up our stories to look at and do that whole thing.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.020
And it just would have been really weird.

49:11.060 --> 49:13.500
And honestly, guys, the whole thing was really frustrating.

49:13.500 --> 49:14.620
So I was just like, fuck it.

49:14.620 --> 49:16.380
We're just not going to do OLR again tonight.

49:16.780 --> 49:19.140
So thank God we're here tonight because I shit you not.

49:19.140 --> 49:21.020
Do you know what happened at one o'clock earlier today?

49:21.180 --> 49:25.700
The power went out for about, luckily it was only about 15 minutes.

49:25.860 --> 49:31.260
But like I wrote this tweet that thankfully didn't go through probably because the power outage was probably trying to send it to my router or something.

49:31.580 --> 49:32.740
Well, no, because the router would've been off.

49:32.740 --> 49:33.940
But for whatever reason, it didn't send.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.900
And it said, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

49:36.900 --> 49:37.940
The power just went out.

49:37.940 --> 49:40.700
It's like, God does not want to hear any more OLR.

49:41.580 --> 49:43.380
God is done with this show.

49:43.820 --> 49:44.500
The end.

49:45.260 --> 49:47.180
Thankfully, power came back on 15 minutes later.

49:48.380 --> 49:50.420
So a crisis averted and here we are.

49:50.420 --> 49:50.860
Hooray.

49:51.740 --> 49:55.500
I will warn you guys, though, next week, guess what?

49:55.700 --> 49:56.860
I'm not going to be here live.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.340
But here's the thing.

49:58.420 --> 50:01.860
I've been planning a trip to New York City for like six months.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.740
I'm my gay ass is going to see some Broadway.

50:04.940 --> 50:06.380
I'm fucking hyped about it.

50:06.580 --> 50:08.140
You know, sorry, not sorry.

50:08.140 --> 50:08.940
But here's the thing.

50:09.140 --> 50:11.660
Luckily, we're able to make it work myself.

50:11.660 --> 50:12.700
Dark Soccer Loki.

50:12.700 --> 50:16.740
We're going to tape a special show midweek and we're going to air that on Sunday.

50:16.740 --> 50:20.740
So we're going to do an OLR bonus stage episode this weekend.

50:20.740 --> 50:22.940
And that will also go on the podcast feed, of course.

50:23.100 --> 50:27.500
So it'll be a lot easier than it was to miss two shows in a row.

50:27.500 --> 50:28.820
But that's why we've been gone.

50:29.540 --> 50:31.340
It's very nice to be back because, of course,

50:31.540 --> 50:35.620
it's very frustrating to not be here for a couple of weeks.

50:35.820 --> 50:37.100
I will say a couple of things that have

50:37.300 --> 50:40.620
happened housekeeping wise on the VOG network front.

50:40.820 --> 50:45.900
Our Discord server is now a boosted server because a very kind individual just

50:46.100 --> 50:50.340
got Discord Nitro and used his two boosts on the VOG network server.

50:50.540 --> 50:53.020
So now we have the higher sound quality and all that fun stuff.

50:53.220 --> 50:55.420
And you can use the can you use the emote?

50:55.420 --> 50:58.060
No, I think that's that I can do that because I'm a Nitro person.

50:58.140 --> 51:00.260
It's supposed to unlock more stuff.

51:00.460 --> 51:02.260
Bottom line, join the VOG network Discord,

51:02.460 --> 51:09.220
VOG network dot com slash Discord, that's VOG network dot com slash Discord.

51:09.420 --> 51:11.540
Act F says God wanted OLR.

51:11.540 --> 51:13.260
That's because the power went back that fast.

51:13.260 --> 51:17.020
Yes, that's true. Bobby Blackwolf says the final premiere.

51:17.220 --> 51:20.860
Yeah, because Twitch TV premieres are going away on November 12th.

51:21.060 --> 51:22.620
And

51:22.820 --> 51:26.020
Kaijuto in chat says you guys need to let Bobby fill in for you.

51:26.140 --> 51:28.500
I'm sure he won't mind recording for four hours.

51:28.700 --> 51:32.580
I actually I think Bobby actually would mind that maybe if he had some co-hosts

51:32.580 --> 51:37.100
to help him, but I don't know if he'd want to go for four hours unless he gets

51:37.100 --> 51:40.380
Tommy Tallarico on his show next week, then he'll be fine going for four hours.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.980
Yeah, Tommy could go for like ten hours, so that's fine.

51:43.180 --> 51:44.700
That's no shade. I love Tommy.

51:44.900 --> 51:47.860
And I want to hear all about his in television, which has no shade.

51:48.060 --> 51:52.500
But he certainly talks because he's enthusiastic about what he's talking about.

51:52.700 --> 51:53.620
Let's see. So, yeah.

51:53.620 --> 51:55.820
And D'Artesia says, so not numbered?

51:56.020 --> 52:00.340
No, we're not going to number the next show because I'm specifically delaying

52:00.540 --> 52:03.460
episode eight hundred until December 1st.

52:03.660 --> 52:04.940
So that way,

52:05.140 --> 52:11.140
episode eight hundred is the same month as our one year anniversary on Twitch.

52:11.340 --> 52:14.740
I don't want to say too much about this right now because I don't know what will

52:14.740 --> 52:17.940
be in place or what won't be in place, but behind the scenes,

52:18.140 --> 52:22.940
we're plotting a sort of soft relaunch, if you will, of Orange Lounge Radio,

52:22.940 --> 52:26.500
because reality is, you know, there's a lot of great people

52:26.500 --> 52:28.540
out there that are still listening and so forth.

52:28.540 --> 52:31.620
But we've really been kind of struggling to get the word out about our show,

52:31.820 --> 52:35.420
get some of the longtime listeners from a long time ago to come back.

52:35.420 --> 52:38.620
And I bet a lot of people don't even know we're on Twitch now and so forth.

52:38.620 --> 52:39.860
So we want to do kind of like just like

52:40.060 --> 52:44.500
a soft relaunch and kind of a creative reboot, if you will, of our show.

52:44.620 --> 52:47.380
Not saying we're going to like change everything and so forth,

52:47.580 --> 52:51.580
but maybe there'll be some new art, maybe some new promo pics of us,

52:51.580 --> 52:52.380
because it's been a while.

52:52.420 --> 52:54.420
I'm going to stop wearing pants.

52:54.620 --> 52:56.820
Maybe we'll wear pants, maybe not.

52:57.020 --> 52:59.620
Maybe we'll have some new sound effects,

52:59.620 --> 53:01.300
maybe some new videos and things like that.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.220
So just some creative kind of like, you know, like a makeover.

53:04.420 --> 53:06.300
Who doesn't love a makeover, right?

53:06.500 --> 53:09.380
Y'all watch your daytime TV and see those fabulous makeovers.

53:09.580 --> 53:11.660
That's what we're looking at for episode number eight hundred.

53:11.860 --> 53:15.860
So anyway, Sia Tabiri says smush cam.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.580
Don't count anything out.

53:17.780 --> 53:18.980
Don't count anything out.

53:19.140 --> 53:20.140
All right.

53:20.340 --> 53:23.060
Dark Tits Sia says hashtag bring back the soundboard.

53:23.260 --> 53:26.740
I can give that an enthusiastic no.

53:26.940 --> 53:29.580
All right. Anyway, let's move on with how is your week?

53:29.580 --> 53:30.220
How is your day?

53:30.420 --> 53:33.300
Dark Sakura, you've had a bit going on.

53:33.340 --> 53:33.900
I have.

53:33.900 --> 53:35.620
I'm actually surprised you're here tonight.

53:35.620 --> 53:38.260
And I don't mean that in a shady way, but you know why I'm saying that.

53:38.460 --> 53:41.260
Well, and I'll just go ahead and come out with it.

53:41.260 --> 53:42.820
But I'm not going to define what it is.

53:43.020 --> 53:46.660
I had a salpingectomy, salpingectomy.

53:46.860 --> 53:48.740
Look it up if you care.

53:49.220 --> 53:52.820
But I it was a laparoscopic procedure.

53:53.020 --> 53:54.900
I had it on Wednesday.

53:55.100 --> 53:58.020
I'm on my last bit of medication for it.

53:58.220 --> 53:59.820
So, yeah, I hurt quite a bit,

54:00.020 --> 54:03.260
but I couldn't miss this after not having been here for two years.

54:03.460 --> 54:04.420
Two years.

54:04.620 --> 54:05.740
You're definitely on drugs.

54:05.940 --> 54:07.340
Definitely. Oh, my God.

54:07.540 --> 54:10.420
Well, OK, so they gave me the big oxy.

54:10.460 --> 54:12.460
Right. And I've never taken it before.

54:12.660 --> 54:14.140
Oh, that's fun.

54:14.340 --> 54:15.700
I've never taken it before.

54:15.700 --> 54:19.060
And like for for like a while, I'm like, I don't feel anything.

54:19.260 --> 54:23.660
I don't feel anything. Oh, oh, oh.

54:23.860 --> 54:26.580
And then that's that's what it's been like on that shit.

54:26.780 --> 54:28.060
By the way, thank you to our soccer,

54:28.060 --> 54:31.580
because when you came to the show, you brought me a little bag of candy corn,

54:31.580 --> 54:34.940
which you talked about on the last hour, a little bag of maple candy corn.

54:34.940 --> 54:37.220
So I'm feeling my Canadian self tonight.

54:37.220 --> 54:39.780
I'm actually not Canadian at all, but I love Canada so much.

54:39.980 --> 54:43.740
This maple candy corn is really good store just for you.

54:43.740 --> 54:44.900
OK, but what cracks me up,

54:44.940 --> 54:48.540
it's in the same type of packaging that like trail mix would be in.

54:48.740 --> 54:50.580
It's like not a big bag of candy corn,

54:50.580 --> 54:52.940
but it's one of those like little snack bags of candy corn.

54:53.140 --> 54:55.020
So that was funny. The only size I saw that.

54:55.020 --> 54:57.980
And I got you the other thing, the other thing that you never get.

54:57.980 --> 54:59.980
Oh, yeah, I love vanilla tootsie rolls.

54:59.980 --> 55:01.780
So she brought me a whole thing of them.

55:01.980 --> 55:03.220
I found those trick or treat.

55:03.420 --> 55:05.060
But by the way, would you dress up?

55:05.140 --> 55:07.140
Oh, you didn't do Halloween because I did procedure.

55:07.140 --> 55:08.820
Oh, did it work? What'd you do?

55:09.020 --> 55:13.540
OK, so I got at the thrift store because I thrift for everything now because I

55:13.580 --> 55:15.660
don't know what fucking fits me and I'm cheap.

55:15.860 --> 55:19.780
So I got it was like a Forever 21 skater dress, like three quarter sleeve.

55:19.980 --> 55:22.580
But it had it was black with pentagrams all over it.

55:22.780 --> 55:25.500
So I wore that and my woven witch hat.

55:25.700 --> 55:28.980
I'll find a picture and put it in chat or something.

55:29.180 --> 55:31.660
And then just did like hardcore, really awesome makeup.

55:31.860 --> 55:34.340
And I made cookies.

55:34.540 --> 55:37.540
My cookies were I got

55:38.220 --> 55:39.780
dehydrated strawberries.

55:39.940 --> 55:42.340
So I took half of the big bag of them

55:42.340 --> 55:45.300
and just powdered them to make my flavoring in my sugar cookies.

55:45.500 --> 55:50.020
And the other half I soaked in water and they got kind of leathery and chewy,

55:50.220 --> 55:53.580
you know, like when you get the pink drink at Starbucks, it's the same thing.

55:53.780 --> 55:55.140
They get kind of leathery and chewy.

55:55.340 --> 55:57.340
And so I add a lot of red food dye to it.

55:57.340 --> 55:59.300
And I made visceral cookies because it

55:59.500 --> 56:02.380
was kind of like what I would imagine eating intestines like.

56:02.580 --> 56:06.100
So I made visceral cookies and had everybody

56:06.100 --> 56:07.820
with like red mouths and everything from the food dye.

56:07.820 --> 56:08.940
It was pretty cool.

56:09.180 --> 56:10.860
And I'm still waiting for Detroit Become

56:11.060 --> 56:14.460
Human to come out on an epic thingy, so it's not out.

56:14.660 --> 56:18.340
I did get my legit physical copy of River City Girls.

56:18.540 --> 56:20.500
And so Dan and I are going to play that.

56:20.500 --> 56:22.660
We talked about setting up the stream and everything.

56:22.660 --> 56:24.580
But like right now, I'd probably just

56:24.780 --> 56:27.540
start falling over into a giggle fit trying to play it.

56:27.740 --> 56:29.180
And I'm back into Sims.

56:29.180 --> 56:31.420
I've been playing Sims with my computer being a little shit.

56:31.620 --> 56:35.260
So I've already put together my next computer.

56:35.260 --> 56:36.260
It's going to be great.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.620
I'm getting an iMac Pro.

56:37.620 --> 56:39.340
It's about four grand, has sixty four

56:39.540 --> 56:41.580
gig of RAM with a really nice graphics card.

56:41.780 --> 56:44.300
And it will be well enough that I can

56:44.300 --> 56:46.260
do it for still playing some of my other games.

56:46.460 --> 56:48.180
Buy me one too.

56:49.740 --> 56:52.460
Did y'all can't see the look I'm giving Rob right now.

56:52.660 --> 56:56.140
And it's called, do you know how much sushi you'd have to buy me?

56:56.340 --> 56:59.860
Four thousand dollars, four thousand dollars worth, two hundred and sixty

57:00.060 --> 57:02.660
dollars worth of pudding. I was just in Vegas.

57:02.860 --> 57:06.900
So the type with the real gold flakes on it, the edible ones.

57:06.900 --> 57:09.620
Also, you know what I just did before I came here?

57:09.820 --> 57:12.500
But I had chocolate with edible gold in it.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.540
Yum, it was great. Good times.

57:14.740 --> 57:18.620
And you've also given me candy and coffee while I'm kind of high.

57:18.820 --> 57:22.300
So I just want to make sure you are in a good mood for tonight.

57:22.500 --> 57:23.820
I'm in a mood. All right.

57:24.020 --> 57:25.300
I'm in some kind of mood.

57:25.500 --> 57:27.220
I love everybody.

57:27.420 --> 57:29.340
Mostly Loki. How was your week?

57:29.340 --> 57:30.500
How was your day?

57:30.700 --> 57:32.220
What you dress up as for Halloween?

57:32.420 --> 57:34.860
I had well for work.

57:34.900 --> 57:38.860
They made us do well, they wanted me to do like an 80s costume.

57:39.060 --> 57:42.300
So I went to the Halloween store the night before Halloween.

57:42.500 --> 57:44.620
And the first costume I saw that reminded

57:44.820 --> 57:47.980
me of the 80s was a double dare contestant costume.

57:48.180 --> 57:50.100
That's awesome. Did you get pics?

57:50.300 --> 57:51.740
I didn't see any.

57:51.940 --> 57:56.980
I took a picture of the costume, like, but it's great because not only do I get

57:56.980 --> 58:00.340
to wear this costume for one day because it was really just like a T-shirt and like

58:00.540 --> 58:04.380
some elbow pads and they have like a helmet and stuff with like a magnetic cup.

58:04.420 --> 58:06.420
It's like the cup that they normally wear

58:06.420 --> 58:08.380
on top of their head when they're filling it full of crap.

58:08.580 --> 58:09.380
Yeah. Yeah.

58:09.580 --> 58:13.060
So but now I have a double dare T-shirt that I can wear any time.

58:13.060 --> 58:15.820
So it's like the kids shirts and the wife a shirt.

58:15.820 --> 58:17.140
And you guys could have been family. Yeah.

58:17.140 --> 58:19.700
They didn't have they only had it like the adult sizes.

58:19.900 --> 58:21.260
So they had large and extra large.

58:21.460 --> 58:23.980
So I and there was like two left.

58:23.980 --> 58:25.380
I'm shocked you didn't get a picture.

58:25.580 --> 58:26.700
Yeah, I should have.

58:26.700 --> 58:29.340
But I got to go get my costume and get my costume.

58:29.340 --> 58:33.180
OK, because mine's very so I'm going to go get it for the people.

58:33.180 --> 58:35.860
OK, why you continue to tell us about your week and your day.

58:36.060 --> 58:37.100
All right.

58:37.300 --> 58:41.380
So my week I did well, I mean, it was a lot of Halloween stuff.

58:41.580 --> 58:46.740
So like the first week that we weren't here, I went to we had like a local

58:46.740 --> 58:49.700
haunted house that we took the kids to and that was all right.

58:49.900 --> 58:53.020
And then the kids went trick or treating on Halloween.

58:53.220 --> 58:57.820
And we did all that. And what else?

58:58.020 --> 59:01.340
I mean, we did some school field trip,

59:01.340 --> 59:06.140
so I have been playing a lot of Pokemon Go and Ingress because I was up in Grass

59:06.340 --> 59:10.660
Valley and there's a bunch of portals and stuff that I have never tagged before.

59:10.860 --> 59:12.620
So I say, yeah, what the hell?

59:12.820 --> 59:14.260
Because this is boring.

59:14.460 --> 59:17.300
So I'm going to do this as I walk around.

59:17.500 --> 59:20.980
And then other games I actually played to I played more Borderlands three.

59:21.180 --> 59:24.420
So I think I'm pretty far into that.

59:24.620 --> 59:27.300
I did manage to play what the golf I was

59:27.300 --> 59:30.460
many thinking about streaming it, but I just didn't get around to it.

59:30.460 --> 59:31.860
So I've been playing that.

59:32.060 --> 59:34.020
And you ready? You ready?

59:34.220 --> 59:35.900
I'm ready.

59:36.100 --> 59:38.660
It's because Rob is the greatest.

59:39.540 --> 59:41.180
Hello.

59:42.580 --> 59:46.740
I can't even do an Australian accent, but I've just I've dressed as Sia for Halloween.

59:46.940 --> 59:53.020
And the minute I saw the wig, I was like, that's so incredibly random and ridiculous.

59:53.220 --> 59:54.340
I have to do it.

59:54.540 --> 59:59.500
So anyway, not to interrupt your story, but I interrupted it.

59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.940
OK, but I did it in a Sia wig, so it's awesome, right?

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.580
I should have worn my costume today.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.020
I forgot. You really should.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.940
We didn't we got robbed of a Halloween edition of OLR.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.660
Yeah, we really did.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.900
But yeah, so I played Borderlands three

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.220
and what the golf and I'm really digging what the golf.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.940
It's a pretty fun non golf game.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.220
It's really strange.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.660
And there's a lot of images like other games in there.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.420
Definitely worth checking out.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:31.980
And then I've been working on my game a little bit, not making much progress in it

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.620
or I should say I've been working on it quite a bit.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.980
Yeah, the progress I'm making is very minimal, which is unfortunate because it's

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.500
kind of frustrating, but it's still progress.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.060
So doing that and then what else?

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.340
That's pretty much it. Yeah.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.300
All right.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:56.460
Let's see my my week in my day, I went to a conference that was about

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.820
learning and I talked a little bit about this on Bobby show.

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.620
So I'll kind of like throw you back to Bobby show last week because we still did

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.980
a call even though the power was out.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.900
I could still use my excuse me, the cable was down.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.020
I could still use my phone, but I went to a learning conference.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.660
I learned a lot like they were talking

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:15.380
about using A.R. in learning, which I thought was really cool.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.940
Like the fact that like let's say you're learning how to build a jet engine.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.420
You could put a pair of glasses on, like say the HoloLens or something,

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:25.500
and you can use those glasses to like look at the jet engine and it'll show you

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.100
like the outline, like put the piece here and do this.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.860
And I just I thought it was really cool.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.620
And then I also had like a VR thing

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.020
that was training about like workplace safety and stuff.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.500
So anyway, I'll just defer you over to Bob.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.620
It sounds like a valuable use of assets to you know, it was it was interesting

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:44.940
because I've always associated A.R. and VR with gaming, even though A.R.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.340
specifically things like HoloLens and stuff, you know, they're saying

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.460
it's not so much like don't think of HoloLens as a gaming device because

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.780
they're finding more and more uses in the real world for it.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:57.260
Well, I got to see some of the selling that the people and I got to see some

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.420
of those real world adaptations firsthand.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:06.140
And I really do think like, you know, in five years, this type of like glasses,

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.660
learning how to do I think you're going to see much more of that.

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.420
I really think that is the type of place we're talking about.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.900
Even I guess I know Google, the glass hole and Google Glass and all that stuff.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.300
But I think there'll be some form of that that's going to be a little more standard

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.180
in the next maybe, what, five, 10 years. We'll see.

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.900
That's just kind of something I walked away from.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:27.020
And I think there will be some sort of gaming because they talked about the A.R.

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.860
can certainly have a place of storytelling.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.020
And certainly, you know, the brief extent of HoloLens I have had,

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.020
I got to play that fragments game, which was kind of like the mystery game.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.260
And it's it's fucking awesome.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.940
And like so there's definitely storytelling experiences there.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.020
I just don't know.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.620
You know, A.R. is not necessarily a gaming device.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.620
I think A.R. is just it's going to be new technology.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.660
Yeah. And where there is technology, there will be games and porn people.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:56.820
Like, I'm sure I didn't see any of this, but I'm sure A.R. porn.

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.660
It's going to happen.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:02.340
It's it's going to happen.

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.900
Yeah, it will.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.740
Like you're going to you're going to see it and you're going to be able to.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.380
Stick your head right in there.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.340
What? Boink. You can you just it's V Boink.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.500
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, there you go.

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.500
Anyway, in the games.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.740
So, OK, because I did decide to scale back the MMO stuff a little bit,

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.540
I'm only playing one MMO right now. I'm playing Final Fantasy 14.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:30.220
But even then, it's kind of like, oh, I get on I do some my daily dungeons

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.140
and I've been enjoying the thing like I saw.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.740
I don't know if it's like playgrounds or something like that.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.420
What the hell is that?

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.220
OK, so they just did a new patch five point one.

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:40.500
And with that, they did new beast tribe dailies.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.700
So there's this like fairy tribe, basically, of fairies that you help out.

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.980
And as you are doing the quest

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:52.220
and you gain reputation, you're unlocking dreams in this dreamscape.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.100
And so the first dream you unlock is this big playground.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.340
And so it's just like the thing about Final Fantasy 14

01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.460
that I'm really kind of loving

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.700
is that they're they're definitely do these things that are very tongue in cheek.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.060
Like we're going to create this canvas

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:08.500
because we know our fan base is going to go hog fucking wild with it.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.740
And so they basically found a way to write into the story

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.500
this way to have this big like cotton candy dreamscape

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:18.340
where you're sliding down slides and you have chairs that are macarons

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.940
like the not macaroons, but the French macaron macaroon.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.540
Yeah, the French ones that are that are way better.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.580
Like, don't get me wrong, I love the coconut ones, too,

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.980
those little pastry ones. Oh, so fucking good.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.540
I had one today. Well, I'm so jealous.

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.780
Well, you can get those as like chairs for your house now

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.860
because of this dreamscape.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.580
So when you and it's just like this little playground

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.700
that you can go hog wild and play on, it's really cute.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.220
So I've been doing that type of stuff in Final Fantasy 14, and that's been cool.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.060
But I've been playing other games, too.

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:49.540
So I've been checking out the outer worlds thanks to Xbox Game Pass.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.660
It was out. Yeah.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.620
So I was like, oh, I'm just going to check this out, download it and play it.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.820
And I've I've been kind of into it.

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.420
Like it's outer worlds is interesting

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:02.460
because I feel like the game part of it, I kind of played it before.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.660
It's kind of like what?

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:06.100
Like it's kind of like Fallout meets Bioshock,

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.060
kind of like that type of thing for me.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.980
And it's it is a little bit shooty shoot.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.020
But there is a Bobby Black Wolf mode.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.660
You can play it on like a story based mode.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.700
That's very easy.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.500
Your first ability you get lets you slow down time.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:22.500
So it's really easy to like zoom in and hit people super easy.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.380
So I'm loving that.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.620
So I don't have to worry so much about the game side of things

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.820
and experience the story.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.420
And that's the part where in the outer worlds, it's really, really well done.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.820
Like almost I mean, I don't know, because I haven't played much more

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.900
in like the first 30 minutes or hour of the game.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.980
So I can't say like, oh, it's better than Mass Effect.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:42.300
But like the choices feel like they're richer than like a Mass Effect.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.060
And you don't necessarily know what's the good choice.

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.500
What's the bad choice?

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.860
You just have choices.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.420
And it really like plays out the story in different ways.

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.780
So much that I'm like, oh, I wonder what would go

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.140
what would happen if I went back and picked that choice instead?

01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:00.060
So, yeah, I've been into the outer worlds for that reason, actually.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.300
So, yeah, Quest Buster says outer worlds was so fun.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.540
There are a lot of neat decisions you can make.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.100
And Bobby says, I like story mode.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:12.060
I'm about nine hours in that comment from our chat.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.180
Over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.180
Well, here's the thing.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:19.180
So because I kind of set up Xbox Game Pass so I could play the outer worlds,

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.060
then I was like, oh, yeah, I have Xbox Game Pass.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.460
I should go play these other games I've been missing out on, too.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.420
So the one I've actually spent the most time on, I think,

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.660
probably so far this week is a game called Bloodstained.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.020
I love Bloodstained.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:32.620
Now, wait a minute.

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.740
Didn't I talk about this before when it came out on the Switch?

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.820
Yes, but I kind of put it away really quick

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.860
because the Switch version had its issues.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.540
And all I was reading, which the issues weren't like gigantic,

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:49.020
but it was just everything I was reading was, hey, just we're working on it.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.260
We're going to put out some patches.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.860
So I was like, well, if they're going to patch the game, then fuck it.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.740
I'll wait for the patches to come out.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:59.260
Well, in the meantime, I it came out on Xbox Game Pass and I was like, well,

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.740
I'm just I want to just play on the PC. I'm going to check it out here.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.260
So I've been playing it.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.740
I'm actually like I'm really enjoying it now that I'm like finally getting into it

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:10.820
and playing it like I got past the little pirate ship level

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.660
or whatever you'd call it that was first got to the actual castle.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:17.300
That first boss was so hard.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.380
Like, am I am I just bad?

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.220
Because it took me a while to figure out how to beat that guy.

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.100
My God. Like for a first boss down.

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460
Yeah, you really like and I think that's what it took.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.340
I really had to study like, wow, what is OK, why don't why am I doing so bad?

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.820
You really have to pay attention to that pattern.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.300
And then I also I got a soul that really helped.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.780
Like it made this giant drill type of thing.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.220
Oh, yeah, that's the best.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:42.700
Then use that most of the game.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.940
OK, that drill made it so much easier to beat that guy.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.220
So that was that was about that. So, yeah.

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.980
So now I was checking out bloodstain and I've been really into that.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.660
So as far as like, you know,

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.380
having that Symphony of the Night feel and so forth.

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:00.220
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if any game is ever going to touch

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.980
Symphony of the Night, but bloodstains pretty rad.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.580
Like, I'll give it that.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.020
I am going to shade one thing, though.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:10.660
So for all like the shit this game has gotten for technical issues and stuff.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.820
Sure enough, as I'm playing the game

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.540
and I had maybe been like 10 minutes since my last save,

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.180
I'm going through the castle.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.340
I go up to read a library book because you can read these books

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.780
and it's how you learn how to do some of the special moves and stuff.

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:25.380
You might get a little bit more of the lore.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:28.100
I go up to read the book and game crashes.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.780
Yeah, which I thought was supposed to be a problem

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.460
with the switch version that they were fixing.

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.420
But apparently it was in the PC version, too,

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.780
or at least the version I was getting on Xbox Game Pass,

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.260
because somebody either tweeted me or told me on Discord like,

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:44.540
oh, it might be a Steam version versus a, you know, something,

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.860
whatever is Epic Store, wherever else the game is out.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.820
And I'm like, oh, there's actually another one

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.260
because I'm getting it on Xbox Game Pass.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:55.820
So anyway, that was annoying, but it only happened to me the one time.

01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.460
And now I've just been really good about saving as much as I can,

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.700
which I really try to do in games.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.860
Save often.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.660
I know, but that was really that was irritating.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:09.900
Another game I checked out was a game called Minit, M-I-N-I-T.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.900
So it's like it's like a black and white RPG.

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.740
It has very much an old school computer look to it.

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:18.780
Like it looks like you're playing on an Apple 2e or like, you know,

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.100
one of those really old computers.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.100
But obviously you're playing like your Xbox controller.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.740
And the whole catch is that once you pick up the sword

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.380
that kind of officially starts the game, every minute you die

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.980
and you restart.

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:36.220
Now, as irritating as that sounds, like most roguelikes,

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.380
although this game is not a roguelike, it's a it's a it's a very linear type

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:43.900
of thing, any like let's say you go into a new house,

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.180
you'll start from that house.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.940
Let's say you find a new item.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.220
You'll have that new item when you start your game.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:54.460
Let's say you got so, you know, so everything you kind of do

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.620
makes sense that you don't have to progress that part again

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.580
after you die and restart.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.660
So it's an interesting little twist in it.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.820
So it's kind of like part roguelike, part adventure game.

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:08.620
I do feel like it is a very simple type of game where it's like

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.700
go to the lighthouse.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.660
The lighthouse has the flashlight so you can get through the cave.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.060
The cave gets the death.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.420
And this is kind of like, you know, the one thing leads to another.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.140
But it's not too linear.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.620
Like there definitely seems to be some branching, some ways to go.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.180
You can explore the map and so forth.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.140
So it is like it's a cute game.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.420
I think it only retails for like eight bucks,

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.220
which is probably about the right price.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:29.660
Which one again?

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.340
Minit.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:33.420
It was free just a few weeks ago on Epic.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:34.340
Oh, was it Epic?

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.140
I don't know if I grabbed it when it was free on Epic,

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:37.340
but it's on the Game Pass.

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.700
So I just grabbed it there.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.180
It was like, I thought I heard about this game.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.300
So I and it sounded like something up my alley.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:42.940
So I checked it out.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:43.460
It's on Switch.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.620
Yeah, and I've been into it.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.780
So that's for sure.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.780
Metal Mayhem is confirming what you said.

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.740
Minit was a freebie on Epic a while back.

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:53.580
YYR is telling me to play Supermarket Shriek on Game Pass.

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.140
I downloaded it and I just haven't gotten to it yet.

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.740
But it is in my list of like things that's going to be awesome.

01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.540
Yeah.

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:03.260
Um, now the other game I checked out was

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.940
and I don't know why I downloaded this game.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.580
I was just like, oh, it's free.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.220
Well, I can finally try it.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:13.300
So I decided to play Marvel versus Capcom Unlimited because.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:14.580
Yeah.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.100
Was it?

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.700
Oh, Lord, worthy.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.980
It was it was a choice.

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:19.860
Was it New Infinite?

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.540
I was like, well, that was forty five gigs.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.380
I just wasted.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.180
Look, this it has a story, I don't know.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.940
It's I want to sit here and go, it's not that bad.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.060
There's other fighting games I could be playing.

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:39.300
Why not just do Capcom versus SNK two on Game Pass?

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:39.780
How about that?

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.700
That would have been a better use of my bandwidth.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.500
I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.700
I put on. Yes, thank you.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.140
Marvel's Capcom Infinite.

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:47.700
I said infinite. Thank you.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.580
Yeah, well, I don't know why I put unlimited.

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.780
Yeah, Marvel's Capcom Infinite.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.020
That's the one I've been playing.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.220
So, um, yeah, I loved it.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.580
So much I couldn't even remember the name.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.820
Metal Mayhem says free where not really free.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.420
It's Xbox Game Pass.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.740
So you have to be paying for the game pass and then you get it there.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.380
But I mean, I am as I'm using it more and more.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.420
I'm definitely like getting some of the value out of Game Pass.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:14.940
So that part I'm appreciating because I'm not dropping 20 bucks

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.260
or 10 bucks on a copy of Marvel's Capcom Infinite

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.140
just because it's on sale.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.140
Like, I appreciate that.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.740
I was able to download that and try it for myself and be like,

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.500
oh, I'll just play Street Fighter four next time.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.860
I want to play a game like that.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.460
So anyway.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.540
Oh, D'Artecio says get Dragonball fighters.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.820
That's that's probably better.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:36.820
I don't think it's on that.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.500
It's not on Game Pass yet.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.500
That's kind of the reason I've been visiting these games,

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.220
because I'm like, well, I should get some value out of this.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.860
So I've been trying to get the value.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:45.860
So there you go.

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.780
That was my gaming week and essentially my week in my day.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.260
So let's move on.

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:52.460
We still have some news to get into.

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:53.820
And I want to get into the news.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.100
So costume quest is free right now.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.540
I want that. Oh, on the epic store, right?

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.900
Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.820
And so my Loki, let's get into some gaming news.

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.820
So you know what Bethesda needs to do for Fallout 76?

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.580
What everybody's been asking them to do?

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.260
Paywall some more bullshit for it.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.420
That's what they need to do.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.500
And that's what they did with Fallout first.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:21.020
Their ninety nine dollar subscription service.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.180
That's ninety nine dollars for a year or twelve ninety nine a month

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.500
because it's super affordable.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.380
So what do you get for your ninety nine dollars a year?

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.420
You get private worlds so you can play in a private world

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.820
exclusively for you and up to seven friends.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.700
Problem is, it doesn't fucking work

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.020
because anybody on your friends list can join your game.

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.380
So that's all fucked.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:48.260
Unlimited storage for crafting components in your own new scrap box container.

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.980
It was deleting your items.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.940
It's great. A new survival tent, a place full fast travel point

01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:02.180
with a stash sleeping bag and more for basic needs.

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.580
I don't believe that was working either.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:09.420
You get some stupid Adams, sixteen or one thousand six hundred fifty

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.940
Adams per month, which the quote Angry Joe.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.140
You can't even buy blue for that.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.860
One of the colors for your armors is actually more than what that is there.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:23.380
It's twenty dollars for blue. That's stupid.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.060
Ranger armor outfits.

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:32.300
So they had the special ranger armor that we're going to get into this,

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.580
how this is also kind of working against people that bought that.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:38.260
And then some unique emotes.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.980
So obviously, people were not too thrilled about that.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.060
And unfortunately, because of that,

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:48.620
actually, people that are paying for this service.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:54.580
Are actually getting some shit from people that aren't buying the service.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:59.620
So when they see, you know, players wearing these exclusive armors or whatever,

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:03.900
they're kind of getting harassed a little bit, which is not a good thing.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:10.580
But basically, you know, one of the things

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:14.580
that also kind of goes against is they're talking about before that.

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:18.580
The they've even promised that all of the enhancements

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.460
that they would do the games are all the sell stuff

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.300
they would sell through the atomic shop would not be.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:27.180
It would just be cosmetics only, not like pay to win.

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:31.980
But then again, they're giving you now the ability to basically

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:36.580
have private servers and have unlimited storage because storage is a problem

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.940
in the game, and now you can pay for that problem to go away.

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.740
A problem that they created, by the way.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.900
So it's just it's ridiculous.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:51.900
I don't know why they thought this was a great idea, but.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.620
I don't know, and now the people, you know,

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.740
some fans of the game are saying, well, this is kind of a slippery slope

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.620
because now that you have this service, if people take advantage of it,

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.740
they're going to start piecemealing more things off of it.

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.660
And here's the even the worst part about it.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:11.420
Like, so to go along with this, they have that whole update

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.820
that they were going to do where they were going to be

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.500
introducing NPCs back to the game.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.260
Well, that got delayed.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.900
It got that part got delayed.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.500
So the actual meaningful updates to the game delayed.

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.460
But let me sell you something else.

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.540
I don't want to disrespect the Fallout fans out there.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.660
And I'm really sorry that your game has turned out this way.

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.740
But like, shouldn't Bethesda at their point just cut their losses and move on?

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.340
Like, shouldn't they just like, let's just they're going to milk this thing dry.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.740
Let's just take what we've learned from this experience

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.100
and apply it to future games

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.660
so that we don't end up in this type of situation ever again.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.540
Like, wouldn't that just be the best course of action for this?

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:44.660
Or is it just one of these?

01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:48.500
They must be facing such pressure from their investors to make this game happen.

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:52.780
And to be fair, other games have turned their asses around,

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.740
like Diablo three fixed itself.

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.540
No Man's Sky fixed itself.

01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.020
Final Fantasy 14 fixed itself.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:03.740
So like Fallout 76, like I feel like desperately wants to join that club.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.540
But then they make moves like this where it's like, oh, PS,

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.500
your whole stash gets deleted when you use it, where it's just like,

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:12.380
that's that's not how you're going to win the people over.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.020
That's not how it's done.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:18.500
And it's like, who like who who even wants to give this a try anymore?

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.780
Like there's been so much shit regarding this.

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:24.300
So much, in fact, that Australia has said, you know what?

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.740
We think that some consumers were misled.

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.140
And that we're going to actually

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.700
require that Bethesda or Zenimax in this case to

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.340
actually refund some of these players.

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:40.780
So apparently, if anyone asked for a refund in Australia

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:45.620
between November 24th, 2018 and June 1st, 2019 can now receive that refund.

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.260
They said that, of course,

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:53.860
if you receive the refund, you'll be no longer entitled access to play the game.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:57.540
But apparently, you know, some people that were asking for refunds,

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.540
you know, with, you know, problems with servers lagging,

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:04.380
graphical visual problems, we're told that they couldn't get one.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:08.940
But apparently, Australian consumer law says otherwise.

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:12.340
So if you had made that request,

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.780
now it's time to actually get that refund.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.540
If you haven't, you're kind of out of luck.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.700
Questbuster in chat says it goes deeper than that.

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.660
Some fans were upset with Bethesda's direction of the Fallout series

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.500
for a while now, and the bugs and Fallout 76 was the last straw for them.

01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:30.340
Fallout first just made things a lot worse.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:34.340
And some folks in chat bringing up that everybody wants to be Fortnite.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.660
YYR saying the investors and higher ups want games as a service.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.860
Every game should be a service with recurring charges.

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.900
Ideally, Bobby says exactly works for Fortnite.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.540
Act Def says Fortnite is popular and making money.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.660
Do the Fortnite so we can get more money.

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.860
That quote attributed to investors.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.140
But then you can't sell your game for $60.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:56.060
Like if Fallout 76 was a free to play game and they wanted to go the Fortnite route,

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.580
I think people wouldn't be so harsh about the, you know,

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.780
the $99 subscription fee or anything else.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.660
I'm sorry. A Fortnite is not a $60 game.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.900
It's the problem is that it's like, here's a $60 game.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.900
Oh, and then we want to sell you these cosmetics.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.100
They're like $20 each. Oh, and then we want you to buy this shit.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:18.260
Oh, and then we want you to buy a $99 subscription service to a game that like

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.980
is this going to be even functioning in a year?

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:26.100
I mean, like, why why should I drop $99 on this game?

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.060
Like, I don't know.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.420
And look, I do understand to an extent that there's going to be boardroom

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.340
pressure to mirror the successes of other games.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.100
But like Fortnite started from somewhere.

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.580
Why not create the next big thing in gaming?

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.980
Because believe it or not, you know, every year

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.500
we're talking about these new games, these new things that happen in gaming.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.700
They come from somewhere.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:51.100
And I feel like, you know, I think Fallout 76 is kind of a gone thing at this point.

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:55.300
But let's say this Starfield or this Elder Scrolls six comes out.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.420
If Elder Scrolls six is a great fucking game,

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.140
then that's what people are going to be talking about.

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.100
And people are going to want to play it and talk about it.

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:04.260
But look, it's like, OK, if you want to compare your game to Fortnite

01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:06.460
and you want to compare, you know, like how they have it.

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.540
Don't just look at the microtransactions.

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.540
Look at how the game plays. The game is polished.

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.100
The game doesn't have that many bugs in it.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:19.380
Fallout 76 was fucking broken when it came out there.

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:20.460
You cannot compare it.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.980
You can't say, well, we're going to put

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.980
we're going to set the same same type of shop

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:26.100
and we're going to have the same type of success.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.780
You got to have the good game to get the people there,

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.340
the one to actually play your game, because right now it's fucking broken

01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:36.220
and just promises of like roadmaps of and that's the bad thing about it.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:39.220
It's like a lot of these games of service stuff, even with Anthem,

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:43.420
have these roadmaps because they come out incomplete, broken pieces of rush shit.

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.260
And then now it's like, oh, but we promise we'll get, you know, better later.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.620
Pay us another hundred dollars.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:50.180
I mean, fuck that.

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:51.420
Why should I waste my time?

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:54.860
Bobby Blackwell in chat says wasn't Final Fantasy 14, 60 dollars

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.020
and then a monthly fee.

01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:58.140
To be fair, I think it was 40 dollars and then a monthly fee.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:02.140
But I think it is worth saying there are two games, maybe three.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.260
If you want to get technical, they can get away with doing that right now

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:09.100
that can charge an upfront fee and then a monthly fee on top of that.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.380
But it didn't stop everybody else from trying to mirror that. Right.

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.540
Hello. What was it?

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:19.700
Rift. Hello. God, there's so many other tabula rasa.

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.220
Star Wars, Old Republic,

01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:27.300
Elder Scrolls Online and all these games that tried to do the same thing and flopped

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:30.100
and credit games, two games have succeeded with that model.

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.020
And there's a little difference, too, because we understand with I'm putting

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.660
eleven and fourteen in the same bucket.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:38.180
We understand that like a game like Final Fantasy 14 is an MMO,

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.980
which I know you could say that, you know, well,

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.860
Anthem and these other games could be like an MMO.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:46.580
But I believe that Final Fantasy and I know that was the case for eleven.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.900
They're not selling cosmetic items.

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.180
It's that monthly fee.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.220
That's your price to entry. Incorrect. OK.

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.140
But they're not shoving it down your throat. Correct.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.260
Like these other games. Correct. OK.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.060
Eleven didn't sell cosmic items.

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.820
That's all I have to go by.

01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.180
No, fourteen definitely does.

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:09.740
But like it's a fucking fat cat as a mount, like it's fucking adorable.

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.820
And they I mean, they do say that.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:13.740
But so does Wow Wow has their mount store, too.

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.420
So they and they sell expansions.

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.220
So it is it's a different model than this game to the service.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.980
But here's the thing. It's like the games of service stuff.

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.500
Like you have Fortnite, which is free to play.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.820
And then they have their, you know, season pass or not their passes,

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.820
but they're kind of different

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.460
seasons that they do with different things that you can get for loot

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.460
and you can pay for skins and stuff like that.

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.060
So they have that model.

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:40.540
Then they have the model where you buy the game and you play online

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.780
and there's other like cosmetics and stuff.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.700
And then you have like subscription services and stuff.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:49.300
Fallout 76 wants to do all of those models at once.

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.100
And that's where it's fucked up.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:54.820
And here's the thing also about 14 that's very unique is that

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.420
the original product came out. It was garbage.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.940
The company had to apologize for it and they fixed it.

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:04.540
And, you know, I know not everybody is going to understand this or believe this.

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.980
But this this is a hill I'm willing to die on.

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.260
This is this is a hill.

01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:10.860
I'm going to I'm going to die on this hill. I'm dying.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.220
I'm dying on my hill.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.860
Final Fantasy 14. That was my microphone.

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:16.100
Killing Pikachu.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:19.220
Final Fantasy 14, I'm dead.

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.980
But I wanted to say my final words on my tombstone are Final Fantasy

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:29.860
14 has some of the best story in any MMO or any Final Fantasy game.

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:33.020
Put it on my tombstone, pepperoni and sausage.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.220
All right. Now I want pizza. Thanks, Rob.

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.340
And that's why Final Fantasy 14 gets away with it.

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:45.980
And in many ways, World of Warcraft is the same thing.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.180
It's got a story that many,

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:50.500
many people love and adore, and they've made their guildmates and all this stuff.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.980
And it's it's their life.

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:56.220
And I mean that in a negative way, like when Alan and I were first dating,

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:00.060
we used to quest in World of Warcraft and that was like our date.

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.580
I know it sounds weird, but that's the type of stuff you do

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.500
when you have like long distance between you sometimes.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.260
And so like, you know, World of Warcraft

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:09.340
had a really engrossing story where you could do things like that, too.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:12.620
I think that's why in particular, those two games have gotten away with it

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:15.980
as well as they have, because they're both extremely polished games.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:18.780
So anyway.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.340
Moving on, where were we?

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.500
Oh, it was that it on Fallout 76? Yes.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.900
OK, let's move on before I before I die again.

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.780
Let's rather you not die.

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:32.140
Let's talk about Death Stranding, because that game is kind of like

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:34.260
going to be the hot new thing of this week.

01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:37.060
And the reviews are finally coming out on Death Stranding.

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:40.180
And we finally kind of fucking know what the game is.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.660
And it sounds like Death Stranding.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.940
I still don't know what it is after hearing the reviews.

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.700
It's Fetch Quest is what Death Stranding is.

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:46.740
It's Fetch Quest, the game.

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.980
It's Amazon Delivery Boy, the game with babies, with babies.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.740
But it sounds like Amazon babies.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.620
It sounds like it's obviously I'm oversimplifying it.

01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:00.580
It sounds very interesting that you have to kind of like actually balance yourself

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:04.220
as you're going through terrain because of the big load that you're carrying.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.740
But, you know, you have to like be very careful not to fall in the baby.

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:11.460
Yeah, or kill the baby or I don't know, things like that.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:17.060
It's interesting because the more and more I read these reviews about like, wow,

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:20.940
this game story is up its own ass so deep.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:24.020
I'm all I'm like more and more like I really want to play it.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.740
Yeah, I kind of do too.

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:32.140
The more I hear about like Kojima has successfully eaten his own ass

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.940
in a video game and he's put it on screen for us all to enjoy.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.100
I'm like, I want to play that.

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.380
This self-indulgent garbage.

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:43.100
It's art. I want to play it.

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.420
It is time to indulge in some Kojima ass.

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:51.100
It kind of is like the more and more I hear people hating on this game.

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:54.260
I'm like, it sounds awesome.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:58.180
Like when somebody said, what was the review?

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.020
I read somewhere where it was like,

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.300
it's the classiest walking simulator you'll ever play.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.980
I'm like, I love walking simulators.

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.340
There was one. There was one I read.

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.060
I got to find the

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:12.220
I got to find the quote.

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:15.020
It was something about like it was from a giant ball.

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.660
They had they had a great quote.

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.220
I'll get this for you.

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.660
But it was oh, here we go.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.020
Giant ball with death stranding.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.100
Johnny Woofay in our chat says,

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:30.300
I have my life size baby in a jar with absurd game preordered.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.180
That's where I'm at.

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:33.540
I'm at this point where I'm like, OK,

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:36.740
like I can appreciate really bad cinema.

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:41.100
Like if this is that like as a game, I'm kind of into it.

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.260
Like right now, I can't believe I'm saying this,

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.540
especially after giving this game shit for so many years of like,

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.660
where's the game? Right.

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.460
Like now I'm like, I kind of now that I know what the game is

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.980
and that it's apparently really ridiculous, I really want it.

01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.540
I don't know what it is. I can't explain it.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:03.420
That sounds a lot like me winning my pink Game Boy advance.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.020
I don't like pink, but I wanted it for reasons.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.980
Bobby Black Wolf with this comment says,

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.860
apparently it's the Dark Souls of Walking.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.940
A little rock can trip you up if you don't hold L2 and R2

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:18.820
perfectly. The Dark Souls of Walking?

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:22.180
That is put that on the box.

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.940
That's amazing.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.300
The Dark Souls of Walking.

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:33.460
Uh, where's that quote?

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.580
I got to find it. It was hilarious when I read it.

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:39.780
Here we go. Jeff Gerstmann, 2019.

01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:43.460
It's part American Truck Simulator, but also QWOP.

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:49.380
I fucking love QWOP. Let's do this.

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:51.620
Oh, my God. I can't wait for Death Stranding.

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.700
This is really fucking ridiculous.

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.020
Don't you kind of want it, though?

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.580
I know. I told you already that I want it.

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:01.580
I don't even know what the game...

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:06.540
Look, look, even Dark Sakura, even the harshest of harsh in this house,

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:10.860
even her cold black recently operated heart.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.980
They didn't work on my heart.

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.340
That's what you were unconscious.

01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:20.460
They might have. Even she is like, I'm kind of into Death Stranding

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:21.540
all of a sudden.

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:23.060
It's not an all of the sudden thing.

01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.300
I was already really into it.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.660
I still don't know what it's about.

01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.700
I'm just going to have my psychological fix for what I'm lacking

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:33.180
from Silent Hill not existing in real life anymore.

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.700
Loki, we're going to explain what this game is about.

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.620
Look at me, Loki. Look at me. Look at me.

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.700
The Dark Souls of walking.

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:43.820
It's a metaphor.

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.060
As all Kojima things are, it's a metaphor.

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.780
Tiger Claw on chat says, Who knows?

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:52.340
Death Stranding could be your game of the year for 2019.

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.940
It might be. But isn't that going to be interesting

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.140
if it ends up winning awards at the game awards?

01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.500
How's that going to work?

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.180
I should also. Jeff Keeley's in the game and he produces the game awards.

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:05.100
Like, aren't they going to say shenanigans if this game wins?

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:08.020
I mean, it could also be the violent diarrhea of video games.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.580
No, but we won't know until we try it.

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:14.540
It's like ice cream.

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:17.420
You look at the ice cream, you think, wow, that could be really bad for me.

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:19.820
This is really rich and I'm lactose intolerant. Right.

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:24.100
But you eat the ice cream, not knowing if it maybe has some acidophilus

01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:27.620
strains in there that will help offset the the lactose.

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:31.060
But then again, you might also have violent diarrhea because of it.

01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:33.540
That's Death Stranding.

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:37.460
Potential violent diarrhea, but delicious while you're consuming it.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:43.980
Did she just say never mind, Eurogamer calls it Hideo Kojima's

01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.940
first post Metal Gear game is a messy, indulgent vanity project,

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:50.780
but also true original. I'll go for it.

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:53.620
Yeah, I'm all about vanity projects anyway.

01:29:55.100 --> 01:30:00.300
I mean, Madonna's Madam X was kind of a vanity project as well, right?

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:00.820
Kinda.

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:08.100
Why, why, orange hat is asking, why is the diarrhea violent?

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.260
Apparently, you're not lactose intolerant.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:15.460
All right, moving on.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:16.820
I think, wow, look at that.

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:17.300
Wait, wait, wait.

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:20.580
My stream deck just showed we just lost three viewers.

01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.740
Good job there, Sakura.

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.900
You know what, they can get over it.

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:28.540
All right, moving on. You know what?

01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:32.100
They'll just have to rejoin and watch that pre roll ad and we'll get the coin.

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:34.740
All right, moving on.

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:41.180
Dr. Sakura, fucking get us back on topic topic like we ever had one.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:46.620
So how about something that doesn't have anything to do with violent diarrhea?

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:49.180
Nintendo Switch.

01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:55.900
It actually has already, of course, surpassed the Nintendo 64 sales in April.

01:30:56.180 --> 01:31:01.860
And now it looks like over the holidays, it's going to pass over the SNES for sales.

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:09.780
It will need 7.43 million more sales to pass the sales figures of the Super Nintendo.

01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:15.220
And I mean, in last year, the Switch sold 9.41 million units.

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.580
So two quarters to go.

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:19.260
We need to see what's going to happen.

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:29.100
So that means it's right now 11 million away from its target, which is by fiscal year ending in March 2020,

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.020
which would be 18 million Switch units.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:40.060
So, of course, we also have the Switch Lite, you know, definitely cutting into the expense of the full unit.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:44.620
I mean, but, you know, they've also been doing just really quality games.

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:49.860
I mean, not just, you know, Link's Awakening that just came out, like, not long ago.

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:52.980
But there's the Fire Emblem, Three Houses got great reviews.

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.260
You know, it's a pretty great system.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:01.140
And on top of that, it's very versatile because you can carry it with you and play it on your big screen,

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.780
which is what everybody wanted.

01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:05.100
So there you go.

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.180
Yeah, and Nintendo Switch is great.

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:13.900
And it's so weird to think that, like, it's at the point where there's going to be more of those out there than there were

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:18.140
Super Nintendo, because it always feels like Super Nintendo is like the greatest system of all time.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:19.380
I still feel that in my heart.

01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:23.100
But maybe that's because I was 12 years old and Super Nintendo was like the new thing.

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:28.420
And so I think whatever system like you associate with like your junior high and your early high school,

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.580
like formative years, you're going to think is the greatest console of all time, too, probably.

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.980
Well, I don't know. Maybe. I don't know.

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:35.300
There's always the Sega Saturn.

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:42.260
But anyway, I'm just I'm kind of like, oh, it's weird to think that we're already at a point where the Switch is

01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:46.700
going to outsell that. But that also is because more and more people are gaming.

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:51.300
Right. You know, like the only people that don't understand gaming at this point are boomers.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:54.060
OK, boomer. Yeah, you would be surprised.

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:58.420
No, I know. And I'm just I just wanted an opportunity to make a cheap joke at the boomers expense.

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:04.460
But I think I think more and more even and even in that age group are getting into gaming.

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:11.100
And I think more and more people gaming is just a part of culture now and is is a part of art art that we partake in.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:16.860
So it's just interesting, like how fast the switch has hit that point when it sometimes felt like, oh,

01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:23.140
there's nothing could ever top the Super Nintendo, even though actually a lot of systems have since taught the Super Nintendo in sales.

01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:28.860
Yeah. So anyway, by the way, do you know why I started smirking while you were reading that story?

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:35.980
Because I realized the whole point of me bringing up Death Stranding was to tell you guys that, oh, yeah, it's also coming out on PC.

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:37.260
And you forgot to mention that.

01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:40.700
And I never mentioned what the actual story was about.

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:45.740
It was up on the. So we're clear just to back up a little bit here.

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:49.900
Oh, yes. Death Stranding is to get a PC release.

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.700
Yes, that was that was the original point of the summer 2020.

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:56.300
Yes. If if the PlayStation 4, for whatever reason, you still have one.

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:57.900
You're like, oh, I'm going to skip it.

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.380
I'm going to wait for PlayStation five or you're just a strictly a PC gamer.

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:06.380
Well, guess what? Death Stranding will also be out on PC next year from what?

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.580
Five or five games is doing it right.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:14.260
Some people are actually pissed off about this news because they were promised that it would be a PlayStation exclusive.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:15.460
And now they're very.

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:17.580
Why are you mad at something that's not exclusive?

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:20.100
I don't I don't know.

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.780
How dare you get to play the game?

01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:24.020
I like to on another platform. Damn it.

01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.380
I think it's a fanboy thing.

01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:30.620
Like when you've been defending Sony and all this stuff all this time and you're like, well, they're the ones that OKed it.

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:35.460
I I mean, if you think about it, are you mad that like, you know,

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:41.060
Detroit become human and all those other aquatic dream games are on Epic Store?

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:45.060
I was at first, but then I didn't care.

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.740
At first I was afraid.

01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:49.340
I was such a no stop it.

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.340
But yeah, I don't I don't.

01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.300
Maybe somebody in our chat wants to give insight on that because I just don't think that way.

01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.140
I'm just like, yeah, more people get to play the game. That's cool.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:03.700
And honestly, the PlayStation still has a big old six month window for people to experience.

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:08.180
The Dark Souls of walking all to themselves.

01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:11.340
So I can't wait to check out the Dark Souls.

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:16.380
I don't know. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they are afraid this means that Sony isn't committed to the console.

01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:23.740
What the news about the PlayStation five didn't show that the PlayStation four is has has a lifespan.

01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:27.060
The PlayStation five is indeed coming.

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:32.460
I don't I honestly like to to Bobby's point and everybody else out there,

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:40.980
like Sony kind of has to be a little more committed to PC because of where Microsoft is positioning themselves,

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.980
because Microsoft is about to step into this world where it's going to be.

01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:56.540
You know, Xbox is more the ecosystem that you experience either on your PC or on your television via an Xbox console as a delivery or via the cloud.

01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:08.260
I actually would go so far as to say it would be foolish of Sony to not consider getting in on the PC side of things as well and finding that right partner to do so.

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.860
That maybe isn't necessarily Microsoft or depends how they want to play that game.

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:18.140
So anyway. All right, let's move on.

01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.900
Loki, let's talk about games that won't happen.

01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.900
And this is not the first time this has happened.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:29.940
But EA has canceled NBA 2K20 or NBA, I'm sorry, NBA Live 20.

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:36.340
I can't believe I'm confused at what two NBA franchises are out there.

01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:39.700
But yes, NBA Live 20 is not coming out.

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.980
They said we're not launching a new NBA Live HD product this season.

01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:56.820
Instead, we are expanding our vision, learning are leaning hard into the new leading edge platforms and taking the time to ensure we deliver against the opportunity for our players.

01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:05.380
So maybe extra time to, I don't know, develop for the new platforms that come in next year.

01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:12.140
I mean, that's good, I guess, instead of just rehashing, you know, roster update 2020 or something like that.

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:18.820
Yeah, it would be very disappointing if like the PlayStation 5 version was just like the PlayStation 4 copied with some upgrades.

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:30.420
So if they're taking the year off to really bring us like a really souped up NBA, because I could see this, you know, as much as we here at OLR don't always get into the sports games, you know, we don't do the deep dive on those all the time.

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:32.860
Although I don't know, like, I still love NBA Jam.

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:34.780
And, you know, there's always going to be Tecmo Bowl.

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.180
There's always going to be those sports games that kind of like buck the trend.

01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:38.020
Right. Blade and steal.

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:42.260
But the reality is we don't usually do the deep dive on the sports games.

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:52.260
But the reality is when it comes to E3, when it comes to that big press conference or whatever it is where Sony is going to unveil the new console and so forth, it is going to help them to be able to show off.

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:59.660
Look how pretty the sports ball is, because there are a lot of people out there that the consoles are, it's their Madden machine.

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:00.740
It's their NBA machine.

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.780
These are the games they fucking play.

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:07.380
Live has been kind of think they're weaker of the sports franchises that they had.

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:11.940
I mean, really, 2K kind of rules the NBA franchises stuff.

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.860
But I don't know.

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:17.900
I know it's been kind of iffy in the past and 2K kind of gives it a run for its money.

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:22.780
But 2K has been kind of second to some folks and I don't I have really low standards for sports games.

01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:29.420
Some folks in chatter are quick to bring up WWE 2K20, which no, no, no, I know that's a hot piece of shit.

01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:31.940
I mean, I've seen the videos, so yes.

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.740
And that's what happens when you have no competition.

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:38.100
It's just it's completely fucked.

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.220
It's the Dark Souls of wrestling games, the challenge, playing it.

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.460
It's just it's it's all sorts of messed up.

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:51.940
Yeah, all right, well, I pour one out, I guess, for NBA Live 20.

01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:58.740
But I mean, if it makes the next NBA game that much better, I think we can do I think we can go one year without.

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.300
I think it'll be OK, so we'll see what happens.

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:06.500
Anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about since we're talking about the next round of consoles,

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:11.940
our next story has to do a little bit with the next round of Xbox and what Microsoft might have in store.

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:16.900
And one of the people that's going to be helping them out with the development of games to their console, it's Ubisoft.

01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:22.420
Apparently, Ubisoft is developing five games for Microsoft's new console.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:29.380
This is from an earnings call where Yves Guillemot, I hope I said his name right, who is the Ubisoft CEO.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:33.940
He announced that they are working on five games for Microsoft's next Xbox console.

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:40.660
Three of the five titles are Watch Dogs, Legion, Gods and Monsters and Rainbow Six Quarantine.

01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:42.740
They've talked about these games previously.

01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:46.020
For example, I know that Watch Dogs was a big part of their E3 this year.

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:53.180
So these three games will be released both on Xbox one and the Project Scarlet, whatever that is.

01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:57.100
But apparently the other two games have yet to be announced.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:04.260
Now, the only other thing about this whole thing is that I thought all Scarlet games were still going to work on the old Xbox hardware.

01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:06.140
I thought that was the thing that Microsoft promised.

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:10.380
Or was that only for their own games and they can't talk about third parties?

01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.420
Did I misinterpret that?

01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.300
I thought, I don't know.

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:20.340
So to be determined, well, we really won't know until they unveil the console because they could change any of the rules, quite frankly.

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:26.140
It should also be noted Ubisoft has delayed several games that they've been working on.

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:35.500
And this could be part of the reason for the delay is that developers now have time to create next-gen versions of the game because we're in this interesting little in-between period.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:36.460
I don't know.

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:44.020
But it should also be mentioned that as part of this earnings call, only Xbox Scarlet was mentioned, not PlayStation 5.

01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:46.820
Ubisoft has typically supported both.

01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.100
So this could mean something.

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.540
It could mean nothing.

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:59.500
We don't really know until they officially unveil these things outside of just an earnings call where they're trying to tell the investors we're working on something, but we can't get all the details just yet.

01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:01.740
So, interesting.

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.340
We'll see what develops from here.

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:12.540
But I don't know, anything you guys are reading in the tea leaves about this with Ubisoft working on the next Xbox, but not being so explicit about PlayStation or any of this?

01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:14.540
And I open this up to the chat room as well for your thoughts.

01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:19.260
I don't, I'm so sick of rumors.

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:20.580
I mean, I...

01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:22.220
Well, to be fair, this isn't a rumor.

01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:23.620
It's on an earnings call.

01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.060
It's just like, what do you read into it?

01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:29.580
But still, I don't want to read anything into it until I have something concrete.

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:35.900
I mean, that's really how I am with any of this stuff now, because we've been burned before trying to follow this.

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.580
So I'm really just reserving judgment.

01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.260
Some comments from our chat.

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:47.900
Questbuster says those are the same three games that they delayed following Breakpoint's less than stellar reception.

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:52.580
Yeah, the Breakpoint game did not quite live up to the expectations they were hoping for.

01:41:52.580 --> 01:42:00.100
So, you know, but I mean, every studio has that one game, it seems like, that doesn't seem to go over so well.

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.460
So I don't know, maybe, but certainly they don't want to do it again.

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:04.020
We'll see.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.940
So, all right, moving on.

01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:09.260
Let's get into our next story, Dark Sakura.

01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:11.180
Wheel.

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:19.180
Speaking of things that are getting out, Kohl's has their Black Friday 2019 ad leaked.

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:22.020
It's got stuff in it that's very interesting.

01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:26.700
So their deals are going to be actually pretty good.

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:28.500
I think last year's were really good too.

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:36.340
But right now is, you know, they've also been pretty universal for what they do.

01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:42.820
So what their Black Friday promotion is right now is that you get $15 in Kohl's cash for every $50 that you spend.

01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:54.620
And so this means that when you put that along with your doorbusters, you're getting like another like 60 to whatever bucks that you can spend on other things too.

01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:57.220
I mean, not that I'm putting theirs up, but theirs was the leaked list.

01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:06.260
So for the doorbusters that they're having this year is a PS4 one terabyte Fortnite Neo versa bundle for $200 with $60 in Kohl's cash.

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:10.260
So effectively, when you apply that cash to it, it's $139.99.

01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:17.420
Xbox One S one terabyte with Jedi Fallen Order for $200, again with the same deal.

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:25.460
And then a switch with a carrying case and controller charging dock for $319.99 with $90 in their Kohl's cash.

01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:27.220
So $229.99.

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:40.700
The Jedi Fallen Order bundle looks like it's probably going to be the big one a lot of people go to, but the switch one is pretty okay, especially with, you know, the incentive of their little Kohl's cash deal.

01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:44.020
Yeah, I was gonna say, I think a switch is normally about $300 anyway.

01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:47.580
But yeah, if you're like, you're like, oh, I want to buy new clothes on top of it.

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:51.340
It's a pretty good like the cash back or whatever the Kohl's card or whatever it's called.

01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.500
It's pretty, pretty good deal.

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:56.820
And it doesn't it looks like the that not everyone's going to be super aggressive on it.

01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:05.500
Because I think that people are already kind of agro on winning the the new the systems anyway, if they're going to buy them, they're going to buy them.

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:15.660
Yeah, I was gonna say this is this is I mean, and this is this year is the swan song apparently for these consoles, because next year we'll be talking about PlayStation five, whatever the next Xbox is a come the holidays.

01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:19.740
So I mean, that's a real like they're that's a deep discount on both those consoles.

01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.820
So if you have stopped for you have still not got on board, which is fine.

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:27.260
And not every gamer has that kind of income to buy the latest and greatest consoles.

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.860
Sometimes you have to get your games to garage, which is pretty steady.

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:37.660
And that's fine. But these Yeah, these consoles are a way to get on board if you you know, and especially now with the rich libraries, both these platforms have

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:40.260
Well, both I'm talking about the switch. That's three.

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:44.300
Well, well, but this is also a little newer, which isn't spot

01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:51.980
They're not really advertising, they're not really pushing anything super aggressive for their marketing for the switch, because they know the switch is going to be a seller.

01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:58.500
I mean, that's just going to go without saying, but I mean, the other two, I don't know that that's really a super aggressive.

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.820
Like deal for either of those either.

01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:05.380
I mean, I said, I'm repeating my words now.

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:13.660
But I'm really I'm not really convinced that that's like the most aggressive way they can push it like as the we need you to buy these because they're going to be gone, blah, blah, blah.

01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:15.500
I don't think I don't get that feel off of it.

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:21.460
Well, and but to be fair, this is also only the first of what is many Black Friday postings to come.

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:24.260
And, you know, the rest of the holidays as well.

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:30.940
You know, this is going to be the time still sub 200 is a pretty, pretty darn good way to get in to both these systems.

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:35.660
So, yeah, I'm sure the deals are just going to be even better at other places, too.

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:39.660
So it's that time of year when we get into the sales.

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.300
I can't believe November's like already here.

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:45.540
It's crazy. My mommy's birthday's in two days and I don't know what to get her.

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.380
Well, happy early birthday. Get her Nintendo Switch.

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:51.420
I'm just kidding. My mom would be like, maybe I'll get her an NES.

01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:54.780
Well, I mean, you can always get a device.

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:58.540
I mean, as silly as it is to have a PlayStation or an Xbox, she wouldn't be into it.

01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:03.660
But you could you use them as media centers, but maybe she's already got a Blu-ray player for my brother.

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:07.180
Yeah. And I was going to say maybe a Roku or something like that is a better I'll send her an S.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.740
Yeah. She used to sneak into my room and play mine enough.

01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:13.700
Oh, there you go. Now, get her one of the NES classics, if you can find one.

01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:16.340
We'll see. All right. We'll see.

01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:19.540
All right. Well, moving on to something that is sunsetting.

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:21.300
It's no longer going to be around.

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:24.860
And actually, I got to say, this one kind of surprises me, kind of doesn't.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.860
Oh, I'm sorry. This is your story, Loki. My bad.

01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:30.100
I was like bringing it up going. Oh, hold on.

01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:36.380
Yes. So apparently PlayStation Vue is going to be done at the end of January.

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:44.420
So it was there Sony's kind of TV offering, and I did try it out for a little bit.

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:47.780
Wasn't all that impressed, especially when Comedy Central went away.

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:51.740
And apparently it just hasn't been doing that well, I guess.

01:46:51.820 --> 01:47:00.380
So they said that for the inactive paid subscriptions will receive their final charge for PlayStation Vue in December 2019.

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:05.460
Unless they cancel prior to their billing date, they'll be able to watch until January 30th.

01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:13.500
Well, yeah, they said they're going to remain focused on their core gaming business instead of this.

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:23.980
Interesting way to set the tone in advance of the PlayStation V, because I would have thought, oh, maybe.

01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:29.620
I mean, I realize PlayStation Vue has not been doing so hot, especially because they have not been landing the right channels.

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.500
Yeah, it's been kind of like, yeah.

01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:44.380
Yeah. So, you know, and maybe that has more to do with the general shift with people are kind of canceling their cable in favor of piecemealing the Netflix, Hulu, CBS, Disney, all this stuff.

01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:49.580
Somebody added it all up. It's like 90 bucks if you want to get everything that's out there right now, a month.

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:52.660
So but anyway, people are kind of piecemealing what they want that way.

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:58.020
I don't know if it has to do with the cable going away or whatever, but it's going to be interesting when the PlayStation V kind of rolls out.

01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:02.340
Like, is there going to be an emphasis on TV and media and that sort of thing?

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:05.860
We all know famously when the Xbox One was debuted.

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:15.580
And this was part of the reason that, you know, they kind of got shit for that reveal, especially Don Mattrick, because the message from that early, early reveal, if you guys remember, was TV, TV, sports, sports, sports.

01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:24.380
But I don't even know if the Xbox One ever, like, kind of fulfilled that promise that they were going to do with like their even like the Windows Universal apps and stuff like that.

01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:26.260
They had to dial back that whole introduction, remember?

01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:32.140
Yeah, but yeah, but even like with the Windows 10 Universal apps, do they have like the support that they promised to have in there?

01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:42.620
Because like I thought there was supposed to be all this additional functionality being added to the Xbox One with those Universal Windows platform apps that were supposed to run on the Xbox One natively.

01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:52.220
But I don't think that ever happened to I mean, I know Skype and stuff sort of works in there, but I don't think there's been like a large support for that.

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:58.220
I don't think so either, but it's probably something that just isn't a priority right now while we wait on the next Xbox. That's my guess.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:02.980
Some people are going to miss view, by the way, because you know, in chat says I'm going to miss view.

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:06.500
It was great. It had HBO, Cinemax, Starz, all the Disney channels.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.020
Just scroll off it.

01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:09.980
Darn it.

01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:11.940
Disney's not going to be on there anymore.

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:13.180
It had picture in picture.

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:14.460
The basic plan was worth it.

01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:18.220
All they were missing was Viacom, but no one watches MTV and all that trash.

01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:22.620
Well, Disney is not going to be on there anymore, I'm assuming, so they're going to lose that.

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:24.020
And then who knows?

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:24.860
I mean, the other ones.

01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:29.940
Yeah, by the way, Bobby wants to point out there has been support for that, what you're talking about.

01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:32.620
That's how Antstream Arcade is on Xbox One.

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:35.780
For instance, it's the same Universal Windows app that's on PC.

01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.220
HoloLens will also run the Universal Windows app.

01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:40.420
Does Antstream work on HoloLens?

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:42.140
That's kind of kind of silly, but fun.

01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:44.940
So, OK, so that's so I guess they can.

01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:52.380
That actually does that does make sense because there have been other things I've played on PC that are just like 360 or excuse me, Xbox One.

01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:54.700
So, yeah, interesting.

01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:57.620
Anyway, let's move on now.

01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:02.180
Loki kind of stole the thunder on this earlier, but that's OK, because this is more of a silly, quick thing.

01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:09.580
But the official trademarks have been filed for PlayStation six, seven, eight, nine and 10.

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:10.300
That's right.

01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:14.220
Trademark applications have been submitted for PlayStation six through 10 in Japan.

01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.860
Obviously, they already did five.

01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:21.300
But you know what? PlayStation can keep this naming convention all the way through PlayStation 10 if they want.

01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:29.780
And I fully look forward to the wonderful gaming articles we'll see once the PlayStation nine comes around based on the original commercials that they had.

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:30.380
Oh, yeah.

01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:32.460
Dark Tetsuya linked that old commercial.

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:38.300
I didn't I thought it was a little bit too much of a deep dive to play here, but you can Google it if you want.

01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:44.380
And it is interesting, there was a commercial around the PlayStation two era that was trying to show off.

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:46.420
Here's what the PlayStation nine will be like.

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.220
And it was trying to show like the future of gaming.

01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:54.940
And I think the whole point of the commercial was the future starts here with the upgrade from PlayStation to PlayStation two.

01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:57.660
And then they set this path for PlayStation nine.

01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:03.740
That was, you know, that was the holodeck, basically, as gaming gets one one step closer and closer to the holodeck.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:10.460
So, yeah, it is interesting to note that PlayStation may keep these naming conventions all the way through PlayStation 10.

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:15.980
Of course, they don't have to trademark these names and not, you know, there's nothing making them do that.

01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:22.340
So it's it's a little bit of a nonstarter starter, but people are, you know, making some jokes about it.

01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:27.340
And that's why I made a little joke about it in the sidebar with my extreme enthusiasm for this news.

01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:36.380
But it should be noted that Sony does have a history of future proofing the console strategy in 2006, which was the year that PlayStation three was released.

01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:41.300
That is when they trademarked both PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:47.660
So PlayStation five was confirmed 14 years ago from when it's going to be released, basically.

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:54.260
So anyway, not to you know, at PlayStation has that mechanism.

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:56.220
It works for them. So why not?

01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.740
Bonds 006 in our chat says name squatting.

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:07.020
It's not so much squatting when it's you doing it, but I can also see where they want to prevent other people from doing it.

01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:14.020
But at the same time, I don't think I could just go in there and say, oh, I'm going to go trademark PlayStation 11 because they haven't gotten to that one yet.

01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:24.180
Like, I wouldn't pass the test because Sony would be able to challenge that and it would cost me a lot of money in fees unless I had used the name PlayStation somewhere else.

01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:26.660
So it would be it would be very, very silly.

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:31.020
But I do get what you're saying, like domain squatting and all that stuff is a very serious issue out there.

01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:36.140
And, you know, something that is a bigger problem on the Internet, but bigger than we get into right now.

01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:39.100
But what we can get into right now is a much simpler time.

01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:43.020
Why? Why? Why talk about the PlayStation six or the PlayStation 10?

01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:49.980
Well, we can all go all go back to an era before even the PlayStation one, a very good go back to something that didn't come out in America.

01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.580
That's right. We can go all the way back.

01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:59.660
So every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this out, the classic game of the week.

01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:07.300
But once a month, Dark Soccer has to find a soundtrack as she mixes it up a little bit and does the classic soundtrack of the month.

01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:11.940
And since we've been gone for so long, I think we hopped from soundtrack to soundtrack.

01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:16.700
Right. Because I kind of did we did we get a September or excuse me, do we get an October soundtrack?

01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:20.380
I think we did. Yeah, I'd have to look.

01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:22.180
But I could always do another one, whatever.

01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:27.700
I know. Well, anyway, I'll go check our wiki because they know more about the show than I do.

01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:30.300
But I know we have a classic soundtrack of the month tonight.

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:34.780
And this is this is interesting because you're still seeing with your eight bit theme, but you went to a very different console.

01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:38.740
I did, because, I mean, most of the people are familiar more with the NES of this.

01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.540
But I think the better soundtrack is on the MSX, too.

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:48.740
And so, of course, I picked Metal Gear, kind of on a weird Kojima kick for reasons I can't imagine why.

01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:54.140
Well, it's art, explosive diarrhea anyway.

01:53:54.820 --> 01:54:01.940
But anyway, and I specifically went, though, for the MSX one, because the MSX two really did have a much better sound processor.

01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.780
I mean, it was a damn computer, for fuck's sake.

01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:08.060
So I mean, but I really enjoy the music.

01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:20.020
It actually said that it's had a three person composer team of Mizutani Iku, Take no Uchi Shigahiru and Furukawa Motouaki.

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:26.860
And then I wouldn't say that the the NES version was a bad translation, but it wasn't all that good.

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:39.020
So going back to Mizutani, he actually did quite a bit of music for other games and created the sound driver at Natsume

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:43.380
and did a lot of work for the Super Nintendo.

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:47.380
But other games he did was Russian Attack.

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:48.980
Of course, there's Metal Gear.

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.380
There was Snatcher for PC-88, Snatcher for MSX.

01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:58.660
I'm looking for a few other games that people might know better.

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:02.580
Shatterhand, he did some Sentai games.

01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:05.980
Dragon Fighter, quite a few other ones.

01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:08.540
Renegade, sound director.

01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:16.060
And then Furukawa did looks like worked on Gradius and Salamander.

01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:23.740
So I mean, we got some pretty good talent working on this game before some of the other titles came out.

01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:30.340
And as for the MSX itself, the audio for it was actually really, really good.

01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:35.700
They had MSX audio, which was released.

01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:51.540
So it had the Yamaha Y8950, nine channels of FM or six channels of FM and five drums had hardware acceleration to bump up the sample rate to 256k for audio RAM.

01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:56.340
So I mean, it was really just a good little machine for when it came out.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:04.380
And a lot of the music ability was standard for all the MSX Turbo-R computers.

01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:06.980
But it was built in on all the MSX2 systems.

01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:11.220
So really good music.

01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:27.060
And I think that Metal Gear being such an early title for Kojima, he had such in-depth direction over the whole game that you can feel his influence in with the music composition as well.

01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:38.300
I mean, really, it's one of, I'd say, the better video game soundtracks out there, not just, you know, for MSX, but in general, it really fit the game.

01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:46.420
It brought, you know, the action to life that that music really felt the stuff felt like it belonged to the stealth genre in particular.

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:50.340
So and of course, we got some what, some boss fight music in here.

01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:54.980
I thought I had it within that first minute, but I don't have been talking.

01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:56.300
Yeah, I think you were talking over it.

01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:00.620
But yeah, I mean, I love the boss fight music in this game.

01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:05.380
I think the clip I got ends with a boss theme too, but it's like a nine minute clip.

01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:06.460
So we may not get there.

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:10.580
And I wouldn't say that the NES music was bad by any...

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:13.700
No, and it's what we all kind of remember too.

01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:22.500
It's very interesting how butchered this game was in the US, but yet it still sold so well here.

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:30.020
It sold so well, in fact, that they ended up making that whole Snake's Revenge that like Kojima kind of was like, that wasn't my game.

01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:32.940
I wish I could find that documentary that we watched.

01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:38.620
But the really interesting thing about it is that like, basically people were like, yeah, this version isn't good.

01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.860
We want you to do another, please, please, please, please, like fine.

01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:42.100
And he did another.

01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:49.380
And then, of course, it became really the one of the series that totally pushed his career.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:57.020
And then, of course, you know, Snatcher didn't really sell that well when it came out, but it, you know, of course, picked up that cult following.

01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:05.700
And then we got, you know, the more deluxe versions of Snatcher and then, you know, Policenauts was really out there and then we got Metal Gear Solid.

01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:22.100
So, you know, I think that all of those games really, though, have this to thank for it in the direction of just that level of storytelling and the environment that was created.

01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:24.540
And I think music goes a long way to creating that environment.

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:25.620
Is there a way to play?

01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:29.940
Because I noticed this particular streamer is using like an English version of the MSX.

01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:32.140
Oh, yeah, there's translated ROMs out there.

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:38.940
I thought I remember hearing there was a, like, they put the MSX version of Metal Gear in like Metal Gear Solid 3 or something like that.

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:39.580
Yes.

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:41.900
Um, so I remember that was the thing that I heard.

01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.100
Going back to that.

01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:45.700
Because I've never played the MSX version.

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:50.380
I would really like to, just because I loved the original Metal Gear when I was a kid.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:59:00.580
But then when I found out, you know, obviously years later that like, holy shit, like they completely changed the last boss in the game to like, I always thought it was weird.

01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:04.300
I was like, why is Metal Gear just like this big computer you kill with explosives?

01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:11.140
Because they, the mapper they used or something couldn't handle the actual Metal Gear looking mech thing.

01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:23.020
So just as an FYI, there was a port of the MSX2 Metal Gear for phones through Konami's NetDX service in Japan as a promo for Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater.

01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:43.620
Um, and it, uh, the updated port also, uh, it says it served as a basis for the version included on the second disc of subsistence, which is the expanded edition of Metal Gear Solid 3 for PS2 and then HD edition for PS3 also included it and the Vita version.

01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:48.900
The MSX2 Metal Gear was also released as a virtual console download for Wii in Japan.

01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:54.860
Um, the ROM used the, uh, the ROM was used for an emulated rerelease.

01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:57.340
Um, so there you go.

01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:05.180
Um, and they're confirming that in chat active says, um, MGS3 subsistence has it, uh, Johnny Wu-Fei says it should be on the HD collection.

02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:06.220
Yeah.

02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:10.740
And I know that, you know, Dan certainly has played through it.

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:14.900
I, I sat and played through it for a little bit, but honestly it's.

02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:19.700
If you're in the house and someone else is already playing some of this, or like, why the fuck am I playing it?

02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:24.140
But, well, neat, neat to highlight the MSX version too.

02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:30.540
So you can hear the differences, especially when I think so many of us are familiar with the NES version, which again, isn't bad.

02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:34.580
Uh, but it just wasn't quite the same thing as the MSX version.

02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:38.700
So it's kind of interesting to go back to the roots of where the series was at.

02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:45.180
Well, and also, I mean, the, there was so much cut out in the, the NES version.

02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:50.180
And I think that of course, graphically, the MSX two just ran circles around it.

02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:54.500
Cause I mean, hello, it's a computer and it had more capability than the nested.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:01:05.260
So, and honestly, I think that if this game had been made originally for NES instead of MSX two, it might not have even gotten the following that it did.

02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:11.180
So I think because it has such a big following for MSX two in Japan, that it led the way for the next one.

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:14.620
And then, you know, that's my theory.

02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:17.900
I can't articulate it quite well right now because of drugs.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:18.740
No, you're fine.

02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:20.620
All right.

02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:30.140
So there it is your classic soundtrack of the month, metal gear, but specifically the MSX version, MSX two, excuse me, version of metal gear.

02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:30.740
So there you go.

02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:41.060
Um, and I did want to say just to just clarify, I did, I did a little research and the very last OLR we did before the break, you highlighted DuckTales as October's pick for South course.

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:45.940
Yeah, I know what, how much we forget and, uh, three weeks of being gone, but there you go.

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:47.180
So, all right.

02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:48.220
I think anymore coffee.

02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:49.420
So, all right.

02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:50.300
You need more coffee?

02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:50.820
Yeah, I think so.

02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:52.300
Well, sadly, I don't have a break tonight.

02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:53.980
We're going to get right into rapid fire news.

02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:55.140
Maybe Alan can help.

02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.260
Cause I hear Alan just got back.

02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:57.740
Oh, Alan, somebody in chat.

02:01:57.740 --> 02:01:58.500
Wanted your take on this.

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.220
Can you, can I bug you to come on the show?

02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:01.980
Come sit on Pikachu's lap.

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:03.420
Okay.

02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:04.340
Hi Alan.

02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:05.420
It's always nice to have you here.

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:07.900
This is, um, this is my other half Alan.

02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:08.260
Hi.

02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.140
Um, thank you, Matt.

02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:18.420
So, uh, so with some, uh, questions in chat, cause we were talking about Diablo earlier in the show and I don't know, have you been following the news that came out of Blizzcon and all that stuff would like Diablo and all that?

02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:20.060
Not with Diablo.

02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:20.980
I just know that it's a thing.

02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:22.460
They finally are given a Diablo four.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:24.940
Well, cause you were super into Diablo three.

02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:29.660
So somebody in our chat specifically asked, what was Alan's take on Diablo four?

02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:32.460
I haven't seen any, like, I've never seen this.

02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:34.460
Oh, you didn't even look at this game play trail or anything?

02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:40.860
Well, now that you've seen, I mean, it's, it's Diablo, but look, druids, they have druids now and he turns into a bear.

02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:42.620
He goes rawr and he smashes everybody.

02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:53.700
Well, I mean, it's kind of, I mean, it's probably like witch doctor reskinned a little bit or barbarian reskinned a little bit.

02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:57.700
Like, I mean, there's only so many powers, but however, like I'm, I'm not being a hater.

02:02:57.700 --> 02:02:58.660
It's just, you know,

02:02:58.820 --> 02:02:59.340
Oh, that's okay.

02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:00.940
So you're just not well-researched on Diablo.

02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:02.340
What have you been playing then?

02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:03.340
I'll bug you on that real quick.

02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:10.940
Um, I've been playing lots of, uh, I mentioned this last time I was on the show, um, doom with project brutality three.

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:15.140
I've been playing, uh, postal too.

02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:16.940
Cause I found that is random.

02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:18.780
What made you get into postal too?

02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:22.100
Cause I can't not associate that series with the terrible movie.

02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:26.020
Well, um, is that guy still around that director?

02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:26.660
Uwe Boll?

02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:26.980
Yeah.

02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:28.660
He pretty much got laughed out of the industry.

02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:28.980
Okay.

02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:29.420
It's fine.

02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:39.260
Um, because I watch, I basically, I subscribe to a bunch of modding channels, like Skyrim.

02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:40.980
Watches a lot of YouTube guys.

02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:41.340
Yeah.

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:45.860
Like I have YouTube red because I, I forget that you're the only person I know with YouTube red.

02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:47.140
Well, it's wait.

02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:47.940
Look, he wants to jump in.

02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:53.780
I like to add as of 2016, Uwe Boll is no longer a film producer.

02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.620
He's a restaurant tour and he's a food.

02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:57.660
He's a food critic.

02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:58.500
Oh boy.

02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:02.420
Anyway, get him on, um, he opened a restaurant called Bauhaus and that makes me happy.

02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:05.300
I want to see Gordon Ramsey go to his restaurant.

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.140
I was going to say, get him on kitchen nightmares.

02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:13.980
Um, so I'm on these YouTube channels that showcase mods.

02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:20.940
And when you watch those in your recommended, it will be like mod for whatever.

02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:24.420
And then I'm like, Oh, I didn't know that.

02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:28.460
Or like, I haven't thought, like, for example, I have a, um,

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:33.460
I haven't looked at Oblivion or Skyrim mods in like three years.

02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:40.900
So the next time I go onto the nexus, it's going to be like, Oh, there's 2,500 mods that are neat that I can check out.

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:43.900
That's kind of how I discovered project brutality three for doom.

02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:50.540
So I saw something, I saw that, um, they patched in running, running with scissors, patched in.

02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:57.900
Um, when you go to the mall to meet Gary Coleman, one of the stores said closed for renovations,

02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:04.140
opening October of 20, uh, uh, it was 2016 or 2018 or something.

02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:09.220
I, and in 2003, that's funny because that's 13 years from now.

02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:09.860
Well, guess what?

02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:11.420
It's now 15 years in the future.

02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:16.460
So they actually went and made a, well, I guess it's 2016, so we better go patch in.

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:17.500
So I saw that.

02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:24.940
And then I realized, Oh, they put out an actual, um, they retcon postal three and they put in an expansion to postal two.

02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:27.580
Uh, I think it came out in 2015.

02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:30.100
It's called paradise lost.

02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:37.260
Um, so yeah, they supported running with scissors, supported postal two with an expansion 13 years after the fact.

02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:38.580
And I was like, Oh, that's neat.

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:41.860
So then I fell down that rabbit hole, especially when they're up to like what I see local looking up.

02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:42.140
Yes.

02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:43.660
But have you played postal four?

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:45.300
No regrets.

02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:47.980
I haven't.

02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:48.660
I'm going to wait.

02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:53.180
Cause right now you pay for early access and they are basically like it's post alpha.

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:55.860
There's not really like there's some quest.

02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:09.420
It's obviously they're trying to recapture the, um, uh, the, um, magic, I guess if you'd call it that of postal two, I'm going to, I'm going to let that, I think that if you eat, if you eat raw dough, you'll get sick.

02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:11.380
So I'm going to let that bake in the oven for a bit.

02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:17.380
Um, it looks, I mean, it looks great for like a proof of concept, but I'm not, I'm not that much of an early adopter.

02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:24.180
Um, uh, yeah, so no, it looks neat, but I, I'm going to wait for the mod.

02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:25.300
I'm going to abstain.

02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:28.620
Well, it doesn't have to be modded necessarily, but I just came out.

02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:31.140
Um, but yeah, postal four, no regrets.

02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:34.580
Um, uh, yeah.

02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:35.780
So, all right.

02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:39.260
Well, it's you, you are the mod king of OLR as far as, well, I don't know.

02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:41.620
Logie likes mods too, but you really like mods.

02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:50.140
I feel like maybe it's just cause I live with you, but you, you are really, it's why, it's why it's like, I, there are other reasons why I don't like to play on console.

02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:55.180
Just, I like the coziness of my monitor, my two monitors and being at my desk.

02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:58.500
And it's like this little bubble that I'm in where it's playing on a couch in a living room.

02:06:58.500 --> 02:06:59.380
Feels weird to me.

02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:05.140
Um, cause I will, cause also I like to all tab and like look at Twitter and stuff and not be on my phone.

02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:08.260
So I'll just like pause doom and go look at Tumblr or whatever.

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:11.540
Um, I like that you can't really do that on console or you can't do it well.

02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:12.940
You have to have a tablet or something.

02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:15.340
One other question for you before we move on with the show.

02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:19.740
Have you been, uh, I noticed you've been kind of like watching, we have like that giant screen screen that

02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:23.740
separates our office sometimes you have to kind of like poke around to see what I'm doing, I'm doing.

02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:27.660
And I noticed you've kind of been like surprised, like, Oh, Rob's playing like bloodstain or he's playing

02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:29.340
like things that aren't Final Fantasy 14.

02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:30.380
Like how, how has that been?

02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:30.580
Yeah.

02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:35.060
Cause I know, you know, you haven't, I can't really recall what the last new game was.

02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:35.740
You were really.

02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:41.620
Psych because you have gamer ADD and you'll buy, like you'll buy stuff the week it comes out and then

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:44.740
you'll play it for a couple of days and then you won't play it again.

02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:45.780
Drag me, expose me.

02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:50.460
And then if I'm like, Oh, Oh, when are you going to be no man's sky or when you're going to beat?

02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:53.340
And obviously I'm trolling you and you'll say, never fuck off.

02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:56.540
Like, you know, that it's, that was 20 days ago.

02:07:56.580 --> 02:07:58.820
I never, I'm literally never playing that again.

02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:03.860
Um, so yeah, aside from 14, I don't really know what you've been playing.

02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:07.060
So when I saw you play bloodstain, I'm like, Oh, that came out like six months ago.

02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.500
Why are you, why are you playing that?

02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:12.140
You play that, you play that the first week it's out and then never at all.

02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:13.580
Cause it was on Xbox game pass.

02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.940
So it was a chance for me to go back and visit.

02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:16.860
I'm not playing it on the switch.

02:08:16.860 --> 02:08:17.780
I'm playing it on PC.

02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:18.300
Gotcha.

02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:18.660
Okay.

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:19.260
It makes sense.

02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:24.980
Anyway, we got to get back with the show, but thank you for coming on and giving us your updates.

02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:25.540
Appreciate it.

02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:30.180
It's been a little bit, so, and, uh, you're coming to New York with me next week, so that'll be fun.

02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:31.340
Get to meet some of the listeners.

02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:35.100
It sounds like we're going to do that and get, get to see some shows.

02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:36.500
So I'm really excited about that.

02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:36.980
All right.

02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:37.420
Thank you, Alan.

02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:38.500
All right.

02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:45.300
Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk quickly about some other things happening around the, happening around the industry.

02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:50.380
Uh, this week, Loki, it's another month, so there's more free things that you get to look forward to.

02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:57.820
So if you are a PlayStation plus subscriber, you'll be getting Neo and Outlast 2 for the games for November.

02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:00.660
That's from November 5th through December 3rd.

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:10.620
And then on the Xbox side of things, Sherlock Holmes, the devil's daughter from the first to the 30th and the final station from the 16th through December 15th.

02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:12.540
And those are Xbox One games.

02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:22.620
And of course the Xbox 360 compatible games, Star Wars, Jedi Starfighter for the first half of November and Joyride Turbo on the second half.

02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:29.380
And then last but not least, um, Epic Games has more free games.

02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:36.820
Remember to check the back every single week because they've got new games that keep, um, sorting through there or they keep, you know, cycling them through.

02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:41.900
This week, of course, uh, to go along with, uh, Halloween, we have Costume Quest and Soma.

02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.820
So those are free until November 7th.

02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:50.900
And then, uh, they think they had next week's listed as well, but I have to pull these up real fast.

02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:52.780
But yeah, definitely keep an eye on that.

02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:58.340
I tend to grab things even if I have no interest in actually playing them because you never know.

02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:00.540
You never know when you might want to do that.

02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:04.540
Uh, Nuclear Throne and Ruiner are going to be, um, the week after.

02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:06.860
And those actually, I think Ruiner sounded pretty cool.

02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:08.260
I think I already have Nuclear Throne though.

02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:12.620
I have Soma and Costume Quest on Steam already, but why not?

02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:14.820
I have it on all the platforms.

02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:16.380
All right.

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:19.220
Uh, moving on, let's talk about The Witcher, which I forgot to mention.

02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:22.940
I actually reinstalled Witcher 3 cause I totally forgot to mention on my good old games.

02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:25.460
I got on a kick with covert action again.

02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:29.700
I just, I had a bug to play Sid Meier's covert action, which I have on GOG.

02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:31.740
Um, and so I was playing that a little bit.

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:33.260
I, that's one of my favorite classics.

02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:37.420
I'm going to do a covert action stream sometimes so I can explain why I love this game so fucking much.

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:42.460
Uh, but then I was like, once I installed GOG, I was like, Witcher 3, I need to play that again.

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:46.900
And so I actually spent a little bit with Witcher 3 until I got sucked into Bloodstained.

02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:50.900
But I need to go back and play more because I got like past the tutorial and I was doing like the first couple of quests.

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:57.460
And, um, yeah, so I didn't even like get into that in my gaming week, but there's just been so many weeks that we've been gone.

02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:04.100
But a lot of people are still talking about The Witcher because some more information came out about the Netflix series, which to be fair is not based on the game.

02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:06.500
It's based on the books, which also the game was based on.

02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:19.500
So it's, it's not directly a video game thing, but then they showed that trailer that has the bathtub scene recreated, which is all anybody ever wanted was for Henry Cavill to recreate the, uh, Geralt bathtub scene.

02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:20.860
That will be happening.

02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:26.820
In the series, uh, to the delight of many, uh, that will be on December 20th is when The Witcher series is going to be coming out.

02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:28.900
Did some of you guys watch that new trailer that came out?

02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:29.220
I did.

02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:29.500
It did.

02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:31.340
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:32.460
So, um, I'll be curious.

02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:39.700
There was also a panel that they did recently and that the show is going to focus on Ciri and Yennefer more so than Geralt.

02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:42.740
So that's kind of interesting because the games focus on Geralt.

02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:47.060
So there's already a little bit of a difference right there, but we'll see what happens with that.

02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:55.620
Uh, the other thing I had to talk about, we kind of got into already earlier in the show, I will just mention Pokemon sword and shield leaks are out there.

02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:56.140
That's right.

02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:59.300
Uh, some information is leaking on the new sword and shield games.

02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:08.780
Um, again, I want to respect those that are staying away from the leaks, so I'm not going to detail all of those, but if you want to go look out, look at what are all the Gigantamax Pokemon that are in the game.

02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:10.260
That information's out there.

02:12:10.900 --> 02:12:20.940
It sounds like just before the show, Shane was texting me about the complete Pokedex information is breaking as well as to what Pokemon have been cut and how many Pokemon are there.

02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:27.940
Uh, last I heard though, that was still developing as I think it was, there may be more after you beat the game and question mark.

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:34.220
So there may not have the final final version, but at least we have plenty of Pokemon confirmed that are in the game.

02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:35.260
So I'll leave it at that.

02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:42.340
Um, and then, uh, you can also see some of the new, uh, there's not, uh, uh, I think we all saw the Ponyta or Ponyta.

02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:44.700
We saw that new form, the Galar form of that.

02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:49.180
There are some Galar form showing up for other Pokemon, and you can go look at those as well.

02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:53.260
Uh, the complete evolution line of the three starter Pokemon are out there as well.

02:12:53.380 --> 02:13:01.260
If you want to go searching for those on Twitter and look that up as well, the internet has a lot of that stuff out there or just private message Shane directly.

02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:09.180
He will be happy to talk your ear off about all of the leaks and all that stuff because this is so funny because he told me, he said, I, the leaks are coming out.

02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:12.020
I'm getting off the internet for two weeks cause I can't read any of the leaks.

02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:17.860
And then I shit you not like four hours later, I read all the leaks and they'd start getting pictures of all that Pokemon.

02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:20.660
And yeah, so that didn't last very long, but that's all right.

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:25.820
I understand these games are just around the corner and some people are getting very excited about it, but the leaks are out there.

02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:30.900
So if you're trying to stay away from the leaks, you may have to have a little more restraint than Shane had with that.

02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:32.580
You're gonna have to really stay off social media.

02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:36.380
In fact, some of that is probably already crossing your dashboard.

02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:39.340
So, uh, hope you can avoid that, uh, until the game is out.

02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:41.700
Uh, anyway, moving on dark soccer, what do you have?

02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:48.460
I have just realized that I can actually understand more Spanish while I'm high as a kite than I can when I'm sober.

02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:50.260
I don't know.

02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:51.980
It's like how I am when I read French.

02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:57.140
Um, but, uh, Soul Calibur getting a new character.

02:13:57.140 --> 02:14:09.980
They just revealed, uh, Hilda, who honestly, I totally freaking love her outfit, but she kind of makes me think of Cersei in Game of Thrones chair swords, just with her whole armor and dress and short hair thing.

02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:18.460
Um, but anyway, um, there's not a release date, um, for when she's going to be out, but I mean, she looks pretty cool.

02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:19.620
Yay.

02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:27.420
And then also, um, uh, the outer world, um, has credits that include D and D characters.

02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:30.580
That's pretty cool.

02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:33.060
I'm actually trying to see, um, uh, yeah.

02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:44.740
John Cotto's five, fifth edition campaign have forever after like, okay, well, if you're D and D I have trouble, I've actually written stories based off of D and D characters.

02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:51.860
I think that's why they were credited because I think they were playing D and D to get inspiration for their game.

02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:59.060
And so, because like, you know, and they actually had characters that died in their thing and they, uh, they have a whole tribute section in their credits.

02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:08.860
I think a lot of it is supposed to be for real people, uh, that passed during the making of the game, but they kind of gave the nod to the D and D characters too, because their D the D and D campaigns creatively shaped.

02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:10.700
What ended up being the outer world.

02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:12.580
So I just thought it was kind of funny.

02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:17.380
Like, you know, you don't always see like fake characters credited in games, but I thought it was cute.

02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:22.780
Well, honestly though, there, how there's a lot of, let me start over.

02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:23.420
Okay.

02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:29.460
There's a lot of stories out there that are based off of people's role plays and fan fiction.

02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:36.540
I mean, yes, 50 Shades of Shit was based off of, you know, Twilight fan fiction.

02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:46.820
But I mean, if you want to go back further, one of my favorite anime series ever and novel now that I'm reading, Record of Lodoss War was built off of a tabletop role play game.

02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:57.820
So, I mean, just as an example, some of the characters that I'm putting into the novel that I'm working, I'm not officially doing the national novel writing thing, but I'm starting on our remote or whatever.

02:15:57.860 --> 02:15:58.500
Yeah, whatever it is.

02:15:58.700 --> 02:15:59.580
I'll try this November.

02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:02.740
It's supposed to be not a pod mode for some people to the daily podcast thing.

02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:05.060
I always say I'm going to do that some year and then I forget.

02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:12.740
Oh, at any rate, I, uh, words, um, God, I can't speak D and D.

02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:13.300
Yeah.

02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:18.300
Um, but there are characters from old D and D campaigns of mine that are totally ending up in my story.

02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:19.900
So same.

02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:24.940
Uh, pixel pox, uh, pixel pockets and chat says daily podcast.

02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:31.460
Yeah, it's more, it's not so much for like gaming podcasters and news related things, but there's a lot of like personal podcasts out there.

02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:32.260
That was a rabbit hole.

02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:34.740
I fell down some time ago and I thought it was very fascinating.

02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:44.300
Like, especially like some, uh, folks in the LGBTQ plus community that I know, like had like daily podcasts that were more like, they're almost like blogs maybe, but they're like audio blogs.

02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:52.180
And so there would be some folks that would do these that would participate in this daily, you know, November thing where they basically putting out a podcast every day.

02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:53.260
And it was just, it was interesting.

02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:57.580
It was like hearing somebody read their live journal entries, but they were kind of like talking through it.

02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:12.620
I, I always thought a podcast like that might be interesting, but I don't, I also don't think I'm that interesting, but I thought maybe if I had like some topics I could talk about every day where I could like mix in like, here's my life and here's my funniest moment from the second grade or something.

02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:20.580
Like I could maybe fill out 30 days, but then I, then I'm like, eh, I should take that energy and focus on the podcast I have or several.

02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:24.820
Cause I mean, there's been, oftentimes I have two or three podcasts running at once, but you know.

02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:27.020
Oh, we still have things to talk about.

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:29.500
I know there's, and there's always more ideas out there on the table.

02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:30.100
That's for sure.

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:34.780
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that will be coming out very, very soon.

02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:36.140
We'll start in the U S Loki.

02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:36.940
He has lots of stuff.

02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:44.980
So just stands 2020 coming out on the Wii Nintendo switch PlayStation four X-Box one and Stadia.

02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:46.420
That's right.

02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:56.540
Isn't Stadia right around the corner, the 19th question mark, uh, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games, Tokyo 2020 on Nintendo switch.

02:17:56.780 --> 02:18:13.100
Planet zoo on the PC red dead redemption two on PC, uh, volferrous on PlayStation four death, stranding on PlayStation four Disney zoom, zoom festival on Nintendo switch.

02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:18.980
Goloma on PlayStation four Layton's mysterious or mystery journey.

02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:25.700
Um, cat real and the millionaires conspiracy deluxe edition on Nintendo switch.

02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:26.820
That's a mouthful there.

02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:38.660
Need for speed heat on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one new super lucky tale on Nintendo switch and volferrous also coming to X-Box one.

02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:40.460
All right.

02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:47.580
Heading over to Japan, uh, looking at the PlayStation four, uh, death stranding is clearly the big release this week in Japan as well.

02:18:47.620 --> 02:19:01.340
Uh, there's also a brand new PlayStation four, like a, it's a like one terabyte, a PlayStation four pro one terabyte hard drive death stranding limited edition also coming out in Japan, which I think we're also getting anyway here in the U S so it's, I don't think there's any major differences between the two.

02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:02.820
Uh, but death stranding is the big release.

02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:07.420
There are a few other minor releases in Japan this week, such as a Fortnite dark fire bundle.

02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:13.700
I don't know if Fortnite quite enjoys the same popularity in Japan, but they do have a localized version of it themselves.

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:19.220
So you can pick up the dark file fire bundle, which I guess would be more like physical release of the game.

02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:24.820
You can pick that up for about 30 bucks, uh, but the equivalent in yen, uh, over in Japan this week.

02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:28.100
Uh, and then I think that's, I think that's really it.

02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:30.580
Oh, there's a need for speed game this week too in Japan.

02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:33.380
Need for speed heat is also out this week in Japan.

02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:36.820
That's for PlayStation four looking quickly at Nintendo switch.

02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:38.580
I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything there.

02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:40.740
Uh, the Fortnite bundle is there as well.

02:19:40.900 --> 02:19:43.100
And then there is a, this is a mouthful.

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:46.700
You're ready for this Sumiko Gurashi, the movie.

02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:49.180
Oh, that's, I have a notebook with those little animals on it.

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:49.300
Yeah.

02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:51.420
The pop-up book and the secret child.

02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:53.660
Let's play the worlds of picture books in a game.

02:19:53.780 --> 02:20:02.500
That is the full title that is out on the switch this week, as well as the fruit labyrinth and Eden of Grisaia full package.

02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:07.140
I don't know some people like a full package, the fruit, the labyrinth.

02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:08.380
Oh, it's an anime game.

02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:09.260
Of course it is.

02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:10.060
Of course it is.

02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:10.660
Of course it is.

02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:17.860
That will include the prologue, the after story, the short scenario, the leisure of Grisaia, the afterglow of Grisaia and the melody of Grisaia.

02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:22.860
I wonder if it's a repackaging of older games, but anyway, that is what your release dates look like in Japan this week.

02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:23.940
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:30.900
On the fourth, we have grip combat racing, ultimate edition, uh, just dance 2020.

02:20:31.220 --> 02:20:34.020
We have north guard, uh, on the seventh.

02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:37.700
Also on the seventh is will a wonderful world, which actually looks kind of cute.

02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:49.220
Jumanji the video game because of reasons, stranded sails, um, golem only on PlayStation looks like, um, a Siberia trilogy.

02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:53.420
I wonder if it's the old Siberia games.

02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:53.940
I have to look.

02:20:54.420 --> 02:21:04.740
Um, horizon chase turbo for PlayStation, Capcom home arcade on the seventh, need for speed heat, um, and intend to switch light.

02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:07.540
Is that, uh, how do you pronounce the fuck out of these?

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:21.780
Zacian and Zamazenta edition, uh, Tokyo and Sonic at the Olympics games, Tokyo 2020, super street, the game, death stranding, uh, Disney Tsum Tsum festival.

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:30.100
Uh, there's a bunch Layton's mystery journey, catch rail and the millionaire's conspiracy words.

02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:36.860
Um, that is it for this portion of the week, although there's a game coming out next week that just is absolutely fascinating.

02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:38.340
The unicorn princess.

02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:39.180
Yay.

02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:41.420
I kind of want to play it just cause it's the unicorn princess.

02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:42.140
Why not?

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:45.300
All right, let me get into a few comments and then we're going to get into the mailbag.

02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:46.580
Cause I think we're a little bit behind.

02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:47.180
Oh, nevermind.

02:21:47.180 --> 02:21:48.420
It's a shitty little tween game.

02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:48.860
Okay.

02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:53.660
We have a lot of emails to get into tonight, which we're going to participate at orange on Trudy.com.

02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:55.820
But first I want to read some comments on the release date stuff.

02:21:56.100 --> 02:22:00.460
Uh, Johnny Woo face says, I'm glad doom got delayed too many releases this month.

02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:01.100
LOL.

02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:01.660
Yeah.

02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:04.740
What death stranding is this week and the next week is Pokemon.

02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:12.660
And so it's, it's really ramping up as we get closer to, uh, you know, Thanksgiving and the official kickoff of the holiday season, uh, shopping season anyway.

02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:14.940
So yeah, November is always a crazy month.

02:22:14.940 --> 02:22:20.100
And then pixel pockets confirming that Grisaia that game I was talking about in Japan is a visual novel series.

02:22:20.220 --> 02:22:21.940
Some are available in English.

02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:25.660
Bobby Blackoff also pointing out Google Stadia is next weekend as well.

02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:27.260
So you also have a console.

02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:35.220
I'm using my quotey fingers also this weekend, although that is only the like pro one that, or the Chromecast one, right?

02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:39.980
Not you get the 2020 is when you can just fire up your browser and do Stadia that way.

02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:40.260
Right.

02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:42.620
This is the special Chromecast bundle one.

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.260
So, um,

02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:46.580
I'm rushing right out to go get one of those.

02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:50.740
I'm curious to hear what other, or other early adopters think of it.

02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:55.380
Uh, and I'll, you know, make, I just went destiny too is like the game.

02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:56.900
I'm just kind of like, okay.

02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:03.100
I'm like, I can already play destiny too on PC, but I, I still am very anxious to hear about the technology and all that.

02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:04.180
So I'm trying to keep an open mind.

02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:06.500
So very curious to hear what all that is in store.

02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:07.140
Okay.

02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:09.820
So we are going to get to the mailbag.

02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:11.420
I think we have a lot of emails to get to tonight.

02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:20.900
And because we have three, because we forgot to do it during the classic game of the week segment, I want to make sure we open up the community gift chest here on Twitch.

02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:36.340
So for those of you that are watching live on Twitch TV, you can contribute to the gift chest and you can actually, if you're a prime person, you can contribute some gifts to the gift chest and we will give them away in our chat here.

02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:38.940
It's all through the Twitch mechanism of the community gift chest.

02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:42.940
So that is open and we'll stay open through our mailbag segment.

02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.460
And hopefully I did that right.

02:23:44.460 --> 02:23:50.780
And it is actually open because I'm not, I'm just looking at it on my screen right now on the dashboard.

02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:53.100
Bobby will tell me if I did it wrong and he'll fix it.

02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:57.660
In the meantime, Dark Soccer, let's get to the emails.

02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:00.140
Hey guys, it's Flea here.

02:24:00.900 --> 02:24:03.020
By the way, this one is from the 20th.

02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:06.420
First off, I want to say how much I enjoy your podcast.

02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:07.780
Look forward to listening every week.

02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:08.460
Oops.

02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:13.900
I was listening to your discussion last week about the Blizzard China controversy and I'd like to put my two cents in.

02:24:14.780 --> 02:24:18.900
I'm a little baffled at the outrage online regarding the action that Blizzard took against this player.

02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:27.980
While I support free speech, Blizzchung signed a contract that he would not speak in a way that could offend anyone or damage Blizzard as a company.

02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:35.820
And the contract specifically mentions that doing so would lead to a forfeiture of the prize money and removal from grandmasters.

02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:38.780
Blizzard has a legal obligation to follow through and these terms are not met.

02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:52.700
It's very obvious now that what Blizzchung said has dragged them into political discourse of what is happening in Hong Kong and Blizzard upholding their contract has damaged their reputation, which is ironically what this cause in the contract was meant to avoid.

02:24:53.660 --> 02:25:00.820
I will say that I'm glad Blizzard walked back their penalty in the end and I hope they amend their contract to be more forgiving in the future.

02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:11.140
I really find it disingenuous, I can't make words, disingenuous that the gamer population who in September were tripping over themselves to buy the new iPhone.

02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:18.660
I'm not, fuck, we already just, it's another one of the Apple whatever, you know, are doing that.

02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:20.460
I don't want to fucking read this.

02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:25.300
No, we, Dark Soccer is a little bit on the meds.

02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:29.540
We did address many of the points in the email, but I do want to make sure the listeners.

02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:39.420
Were tripping over themselves to buy the new iPhone from Apple, are also holding bullshit to a separate standard when all they did was take away prize money for an e-sport, which Apple banned an app designed to keep protesters safe and could actually save lives.

02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:40.660
No, that's not the fucking point.

02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:52.060
This is a tough time as companies are navigating if they're going to uphold the standards of free democratic internet or if they will censor themselves to comply with the censorship of the Chinese internet.

02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:56.260
We need to remember that there are people behind these difficult decisions and mistakes will be made.

02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:57.660
Anyway, enough ranting for me.

02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:59.700
Thanks for everything you guys do.

02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:00.340
It's flee.

02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:04.940
PS included the text from the contract below that pertains to why he was banned.

02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:19.180
Engaging any act that in Blizzard's sole discretion brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages Blizzard's image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player's prize total to zero USD.

02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:24.820
In addition to other remedies which may be provided under the handbook and Blizzard's website terms are still so subjective.

02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:29.620
Yeah, you know, and I feel like I did address a lot of these points earlier in the show.

02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:32.580
I just want to make sure you know what, it's where every gamer has a voice.

02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:36.340
So I'm just like, it's my brain right now.

02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:37.700
Just yeah, it's fine.

02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:47.580
But here's the thing I do want to make this very clear is that I'm a little less on the blitzchung thing, especially ever since they dialed it back to the six months.

02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:57.140
I still think it's a little bit much, but what really irritated me is when you put this side by side with how they treated the Overwatch League issues and what's been going on over there.

02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:01.100
I felt that this was way too extreme compared to what was going on over there.

02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:03.220
And that is really kind of like the root cause.

02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:08.780
And I mean, just add that onto the pile of, you know, everything else where Blizzard is misstepped.

02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:15.740
I just feel like I've given Blizzard so much loyalty and a lot of these things, these actions are starting to make me question, well, why is that?

02:27:15.980 --> 02:27:25.900
And so again, I'm not, I'm not personally, I'm not boycotting Blizzard, but I just want to see other people for a little while and on top of that, Blizzard handle their issues.

02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:33.660
Keep in mind, people are so quick to point the finger at the biggest other company there is, but they're not the only one doing this.

02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:37.140
You know, they're two completely different things.

02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:38.060
It's a game.

02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:48.820
And it's also, it's also the thing where it's like, you can invoke Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, you can invoke whoever you want to invoke, but they are separate issues.

02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:52.860
And I think you have to kind of assess what works for you and what doesn't work.

02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:56.620
And again, like I said, in its core, it's a fallacious argument.

02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:58.220
It's absolutely fallacious.

02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:05.860
I also completely understand, for example, like I know the gals from Girls Gone Wow, because they just put out two episodes from being at BlizzCon.

02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:10.660
I haven't been able to listen to them yet just because I've had a busy weekend, but I know they went and they had a great time.

02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:12.380
They were smiling big in their pictures.

02:28:12.580 --> 02:28:15.180
They got to meet a lot of community members for the first time.

02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:20.180
Am I going to be upset at them for supporting Blizzard because they shut down?

02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:21.620
No, I'm not.

02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:22.580
Absolutely not.

02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:34.380
I'm actually like super happy for them that they got to like be celebrities, the celebrities that they are at BlizzCon and meet all those new people, because I also realized at the end of the day, BlizzCon is very much like a family gathering for some people.

02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:38.340
And so that is, you know, like their moment.

02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:46.740
I think the Blizzard handled the protests and all that appropriately, such as we mentioned earlier in the show, and the protester kind of went to take the mic.

02:28:46.980 --> 02:28:52.540
They had their system set up to just let that person talk, not shut it down, you know, and do that whole thing.

02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:54.660
They were pretty professional about all that.

02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:57.380
And we didn't even talk about the protests outside.

02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:03.460
But I was actually surprised that a respectable number of people showed up.

02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:11.020
It wasn't like massive protests, but there was like 30, 40 people that showed up and they were chanting and they had signs and they were giving out.

02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:12.420
I thought this was very smart.

02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:16.740
They were giving out free T-shirts for people to wear inside.

02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:25.900
So that way, when they showed up on the cameras and stuff and they would have the messages on there, I thought that was really an intelligent way to do a peaceful protest.

02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:28.420
And I think at the end of the day, that is also the most important thing.

02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:30.300
All the protests was very, very peaceful.

02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:38.940
We're not hearing about any type of like, you know, unfortunately, we're not hearing the level of the protests we're hearing about in Hong Kong, just very matter of factly.

02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:41.460
And so that part is really cool.

02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:45.500
And I am not one to judge anybody on how they want to spend their money and so forth.

02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:49.500
But I'm just saying, this is why Blizzard and I are getting a divorce for now.

02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:53.300
But maybe in six months, we'll get back together.

02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:56.020
Oh, I didn't fully address the part of the email, the Blitzchung thing.

02:29:57.020 --> 02:30:12.700
And I kind of said this on the last episode, so I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself, but I feel like a more appropriate punishment would have been suspended for one or two games and just have him not be able to do on camera interviews for six months.

02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:15.940
If that had been the ban, I would have totally understood it.

02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:27.820
But one more thing I'm going to say, look at what a company like Wizards of the Coast, who by the way, also is distributed by Tencent in China, has handled a very similar issue recently.

02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:33.700
Wizards of the Coast had a player that won that made a very similar statement in his winning thing.

02:30:33.700 --> 02:30:35.340
And you know what Wizards of the Coast did about it?

02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:36.060
Nothing.

02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:39.140
And they also have the Tencent presence in China.

02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:52.660
So it's just but maybe, but one could argue it's because of what's happened at Blizzard has caused this conversation and other companies to look at it and in, in fact, has had a positive change in that regard.

02:30:52.860 --> 02:30:57.300
So anyway, I will shut up now and not double back on this topic too much.

02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:00.460
But I just want to get that out and give a respectful response to the email.

02:31:00.460 --> 02:31:03.100
I'm not trying to be to be bitchy about it right now.

02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:10.780
I'm, it's just that I, I think people are trying to pull an argument that has nothing to do with it.

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:15.820
So that's, um, anyway, I do want to also mention this because this is geo 100.

02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:18.460
Matt says there was some positive Hearthstone news from Blizzcon.

02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:19.620
And I did hear about this.

02:31:19.620 --> 02:31:20.500
This is really cool.

02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:24.020
Uh, Leooon, I hope I said the name right.

02:31:24.020 --> 02:31:31.580
I'm sorry if I butchered that, has become the first woman to win a Blizzcon title because she won the, um, uh, Hearthstone championship.

02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:32.300
Oh, good.

02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:33.180
Congratulations.

02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:33.980
Mazel tov.

02:31:34.060 --> 02:31:34.540
That's right.

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:35.940
Next email.

02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:36.660
Break the ceiling.

02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:37.900
Yep.

02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:38.340
Next email.

02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:39.660
Hey, OLR.

02:31:39.700 --> 02:31:43.900
I had read so many glowing reviews of Link's Awakening that I decided to pick it up on lunch day.

02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:46.940
I may be in the minority, but the game hasn't lived up to the hype for me.

02:31:47.340 --> 02:31:48.740
It's certainly a faithful remake.

02:31:48.740 --> 02:31:59.460
If anything, Nintendo stuck too closely to the original, by the way, Nintendo didn't do it, um, keeping its dated gameplay intact and having to constantly consult guides to find the next dungeon or even the next key.

02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:07.820
The, um, items are so far fairly rubbish and the NPCs feel like random cardboard cut out, stabled together from different games.

02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:13.180
What is new are the toy box style graphics, which are beautiful until they begin to move.

02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:16.100
When outdoors, the frame rate drops to a distracting level.

02:32:16.100 --> 02:32:22.140
And I say that as someone who doesn't normally even pay attention to technical details like that, I didn't notice any frame rate issues.

02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:22.860
Did you?

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:29.420
I've noticed some stuttering, like it's not major, but it's enough to go, Oh, that was a, that was a rough transition.

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:30.540
Yeah, weird.

02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:35.020
Um, I vaguely remember playing Link's Awakening DX on Game Boy Color back in the day.

02:32:35.380 --> 02:32:42.540
I'm sure it was good compared to your average Game Boy title, but to be a $60 Switch game, I think it needed a little modernization.

02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:43.740
What do you think of the game?

02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:45.060
Am I being overly harsh?

02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:47.260
Forever a loyal listener, Elliot B.

02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:51.620
Um, everyone's opinion is their own opinion.

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:54.820
If that's how you felt about it, that's how you felt about it.

02:32:55.300 --> 02:32:59.220
Um, you know, for, for us, we were pretty excited about it.

02:32:59.260 --> 02:33:00.420
We wanted the nostalgia.

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:04.140
And I think a lot of that money that you're paying for it is for nostalgia.

02:33:04.700 --> 02:33:07.420
Um, the dungeon maker thing is pretty fun.

02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:16.060
Um, you know, Dan and I just like went around looking for Easter eggs and try, he, we did the whole thing from memory.

02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:18.180
No guides at all.

02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:22.980
We didn't do any guide until like doing the hero playthrough.

02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:26.780
So, I mean, that's the fun of those old style games.

02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:28.420
Like that is the exploration.

02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:38.580
We didn't have guides yonder and when that was the fun of it is that it brought back that sense of how much this do we remember?

02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:40.660
Is it really the old friend that we knew?

02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:46.180
And, you know, I think that that's where the game was really banking on is that nostalgia factor.

02:33:46.180 --> 02:33:53.380
And if you didn't have the nostalgia for the original game that the other, that other people do, then it's definitely going to color your experience with it.

02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:53.860
Yeah.

02:33:54.380 --> 02:33:58.540
Honestly, bottom line, dude, you're, you're allowed to like, and not like whatever you want.

02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:01.260
And it doesn't mean like, you're allowed to be wrong once in a while.

02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:02.260
No, I'm just, I'm totally kidding.

02:34:02.460 --> 02:34:04.900
Like, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't mean that you're wrong.

02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:06.660
Uh, you know, that's what opinions are.

02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:15.700
And you know, like, I know I've seen that movie that like everybody loved and I was just like, what, why, why does everybody love this movie?

02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:17.500
I'm going to give you a good example.

02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:19.060
Uh, I love Xanadu.

02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:21.140
I feel like I'm, everyone else is wrong.

02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:21.380
Okay.

02:34:21.380 --> 02:34:23.500
I feel like I'm expected to love this movie.

02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:29.700
But when I saw Call Me By Your Name, I was like, it's not like, it took, it was slow.

02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:31.220
I didn't, it's very artsy.

02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:34.340
I didn't really like it until the dad's speech at the end.

02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:37.420
I'm not going to say anything about that, but I was like, that was the best part of the whole movie.

02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:38.540
And that was only like two minutes of it.

02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:41.620
You know, there's always going to be, it's art.

02:34:41.620 --> 02:34:43.300
Art is subject to interpretation, right?

02:34:43.300 --> 02:34:44.860
And sometimes your interpretation is going to be different.

02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:47.140
To be fair, it's different when you're seeing it with Shane.

02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:53.140
He has a way of influencing, but, um, well, I'm sure there's plenty of video games.

02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:54.220
Is there a video game?

02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:55.420
And I opened this up to you guys in chat too.

02:34:55.420 --> 02:35:00.220
Is there a video game that everybody loved, but then you played it and you were like, I don't get it.

02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:03.380
Like, why does everybody like, I don't really like bionic commando that much.

02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:04.740
The original.

02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:05.100
Yeah.

02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:06.460
Oh, girl.

02:35:06.500 --> 02:35:07.020
Okay.

02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:07.460
All right.

02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:08.020
We all had a pain.

02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:09.580
I didn't like Metroid when I first played it.

02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:12.260
I'm just being honest.

02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:12.660
I didn't care.

02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:15.460
I didn't like it when I first played it.

02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:16.900
No, I liked it better.

02:35:16.900 --> 02:35:21.900
Now as an adult, I actually didn't like Metroid until I played through the guardian legend.

02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:23.940
It's also interesting to point out.

02:35:23.940 --> 02:35:28.980
And I would be curious, Elliot, if this ends up being your experience too, and not that you're obligated to go back and play it again, but you might.

02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:34.620
But like, I know that like one game I played and I didn't get it at first and I didn't go back and play it till like five years later.

02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:35.580
And then I loved it.

02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:36.500
Mass Effect.

02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:39.620
The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, I don't get it.

02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:40.500
Why do people love this?

02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:41.020
Here's the thing.

02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:43.420
I didn't actually like Link's Awakening the first time I played it.

02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:45.700
I didn't think it was very fun.

02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:47.820
I like it now as an adult.

02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:51.900
I thought it was a much more solid game now that I can come into it as a mature gamer.

02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:52.140
Yeah.

02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:58.140
You know, but like there's people who'd be like, I don't like Link to the past.

02:35:58.180 --> 02:35:59.500
I mean, some people are like that.

02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:02.820
Dan doesn't care for Link to the past that, you know, everyone else loves it.

02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:04.420
And it's not that he doesn't like it.

02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:06.060
It's just, it's not up there, you know?

02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:09.780
But, um, I mean, what about you, Matt?

02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:11.660
Uh, Mass Effect.

02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:14.140
I didn't really like that game.

02:36:15.740 --> 02:36:17.020
And that's what Bobby says in chat.

02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:18.300
Mass Effect and Super Metroid.

02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:20.500
I was, is he trolling with the Super Metroid answer?

02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:23.260
Cause I don't think Bobby, I never knew Bobby to hate Super Metroid.

02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:28.100
He just likes, he just likes to bring up the whole stupid Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid debate.

02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:29.620
Every possible opportunity.

02:36:29.820 --> 02:36:33.620
Uh, Shane is still in chat saying, I hated Mass Effect and Dragon Age at first.

02:36:33.820 --> 02:36:35.180
Even Shane hated Mass Effect.

02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:37.860
I didn't like the first Dragon Age, but Dragon Age 2 I loved.

02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:44.020
I, I'm still not as into Dragon Age as the rest of you, but I did, I did enjoy Inquisition.

02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:47.860
I did enjoy Inquisition what, but I never really like played through the whole entire thing.

02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:49.100
And that's Splatoon.

02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:53.500
I honestly think I like Mass Effect 3 better than 2.

02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.740
Because Garris, even more Garris.

02:36:57.820 --> 02:36:59.180
I'm trying to think of a game.

02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:07.540
I know there has to be something, but I'm trying to think of something where I was really like, I don't understand why you people obsess over this game.

02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:10.660
I have to chew on that for a little bit.

02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:12.020
I know there's gotta be an example.

02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:15.980
So it was like, I can think of so many movies, but I can't think of games as these.

02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:19.100
I'm trying to think of games that have won like game of the year type of accolades.

02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:20.580
Alan, you're giving me a look.

02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:22.500
Dark soul.

02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:23.060
Okay.

02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:23.780
Dark souls.

02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:25.940
I didn't.

02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:26.460
Okay.

02:37:26.460 --> 02:37:29.260
I didn't hate dark souls, but dark souls isn't for me.

02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:34.380
All the jokes from earlier this evening aside, I guess, I guess that could be an example.

02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:37.460
There's movies that a lot of people I know, like that I can't stand.

02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:38.860
Like I won't watch face off.

02:37:39.380 --> 02:37:43.420
I think because it was really actually very triggering right at the beginning of it.

02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:49.820
Oh, um, I, I do not care for the way everybody loves fire emblem and those games.

02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:51.260
I don't like, I don't care for those games.

02:37:51.340 --> 02:37:54.380
Um, not for me, never liked real time strategy like that.

02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:54.740
Yeah.

02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:59.980
It's like the only types of like tactical games I could really get into is, um, uh, final fantasy tactics.

02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:01.780
I don't even like final fantasy tactics.

02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:02.380
Hmm.

02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:05.060
I've never liked those games like that.

02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:08.940
I mean, and even like Disgaea would be another one.

02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:14.940
I mean, I had my hands on the Macross game for PC engine for a while and I didn't like it.

02:38:14.980 --> 02:38:17.180
I really wanted to, cause it was fucking Macross.

02:38:17.700 --> 02:38:18.580
I thought of the game.

02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:19.380
I thought of the game.

02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:21.180
Persona.

02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:22.940
I haven't played it.

02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:23.380
I'm sorry.

02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:24.540
I'm sorry guys.

02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:25.780
That there it is.

02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:26.540
That's the game.

02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:29.980
I, I can't get into it the way the rest of you can.

02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:30.940
I'm sorry.

02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:31.620
I've tried.

02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:32.420
I need to play though.

02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:33.740
Danganronpa.

02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:36.380
Maybe.

02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:38.740
I don't know if, I don't know if it's for me, but we'll see.

02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:41.420
I wasn't super into Danganronpa at first either, but I really like it now.

02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:42.340
All right.

02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:43.700
So there you go, Elliot.

02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:45.380
See, we've made confessions about the games.

02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:47.380
We, we don't understand either.

02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:49.700
So it happens anyway, but thank you for the email.

02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:50.820
Sports games, all of them.

02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:53.140
Except tech mobile.

02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:56.300
Um, or actually super high impact for Super Nintendo.

02:38:57.940 --> 02:38:58.940
This is the last email.

02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:00.780
Um, Haya OLR crew.

02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:03.060
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act theft.

02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:07.060
My last call to the show was to talk about colossal event for Pokemon go.

02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:09.820
I mentioned my expectations and worries about the event.

02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:12.260
Now it has happened and I participated in it.

02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:14.180
I'll talk about my impressions of the event.

02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:15.780
The event itself was good.

02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:18.180
It was fun doing the special research to get the.

02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:22.380
Reggie Gigas along with some of my friends.

02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:25.980
We had a great time overall and it was, my eyes are blurry.

02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:28.020
It wasn't overly difficult to finish.

02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:32.500
We were done after two to three hours tops and continued to raid and do some

02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:34.780
researches for special Pokemon.

02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:37.340
Even those who were pretty easy to do.

02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:40.260
And again, no, even those were pretty easy to do.

02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:43.300
And again, the Pokemon that were given through those were pretty cool.

02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:44.700
I even got a shiny Skarmory.

02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:49.180
Um, after I finished the event, I felt unsatisfied again.

02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:52.660
It was pretty short and simple, but it was overly simple to do.

02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:55.340
Just catch an evolve, rinse and repeat three times and you were done.

02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:58.020
Basically the Pokemon spawning through the event.

02:39:58.020 --> 02:39:58.580
Well, good.

02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:00.420
Wasn't the best or most varied.

02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:04.180
I would love to see more rare Pokemon spawn and get more shinies and really

02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:05.820
good ones for raids or PVP.

02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:07.540
I haven't done PVP yet.

02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:13.620
Many people are complaining about the shiny rates, but I don't think that

02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:14.540
should be the case here.

02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:16.660
Shinies are supposed to be rare.

02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:20.700
And then again, the lack of variety on the spawns really made it kind of dull

02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:24.740
to do even to even do the special research.

02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:28.260
Since again, it was composed of really simple and mundane tasks.

02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:31.260
The raid, the raids were perfect though.

02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:32.180
Not really difficult.

02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:36.220
They could be taken down by a small group of three people with good or excellent

02:40:36.220 --> 02:40:39.460
counters and they appeared everywhere quite often.

02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:45.420
Like really, I think I did like three raids in the same gym during

02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:46.860
the time I spent on the event.

02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:49.460
The rewards were great.

02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:54.180
Getting rare evolution stones, like the new Unova stone and getting the quote

02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:57.380
free raid passes for the duration of the event was good.

02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:01.420
I think the money I paid for all of this wasn't worth it.

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:07.340
We also got a post for Avatar, which is really bad, even though I'm using it

02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:08.980
right now, but it seriously doesn't look okay.

02:41:09.420 --> 02:41:11.900
And the medal is just for showing off.

02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:16.660
I would prefer to have a Safari zone or go fast one, which had some merit to it.

02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:21.260
Overall, I don't regret buying the special ticket and participating in this event.

02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:22.420
I had fun.

02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:26.020
I had, and I had a really good time, but what I got was really.

02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:29.740
But what I got wasn't really worth the price of admission.

02:41:30.260 --> 02:41:34.260
I would have been okay paying $5 for this, but $8 seemed the wrong price.

02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:38.580
And yeah, it's $3 only, but I could have used it to buy other stuff in game that

02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:40.340
is worthwhile or for other games too.

02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:42.380
Well, that's all for me right now.

02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:45.260
Thanks for reading PS, sorry for sending this kind of late.

02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:46.660
Deft is come Brown.

02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:50.260
Thank you for the email and for the recap of the event, because

02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:51.340
admittedly I didn't do it.

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:52.900
So I'm glad to hear that somebody did.

02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:56.660
Um, I just didn't, I don't know.

02:41:56.660 --> 02:42:00.500
Like I just didn't want to pay the money, especially cause you got the raid passes.

02:42:00.540 --> 02:42:02.740
I have like 60 unused raid passes.

02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:04.740
Cause that's how infrequently I've been rating anymore.

02:42:04.740 --> 02:42:08.140
In fact, I just realized I just missed that dark cry or whatever

02:42:08.140 --> 02:42:09.380
that most recent one has been.

02:42:09.420 --> 02:42:11.980
I, does somebody have an extra cause they need one?

02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:14.140
Um, cause I didn't raid for it.

02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:17.180
I've just been really slacking on those rates because I've been a little more

02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:20.380
like, I've all of a sudden just been more like into Ingress lately.

02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:22.740
Maybe something about the anomaly just kind of made me back into that.

02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:24.300
And I was playing Harry Potter a little bit.

02:42:24.580 --> 02:42:27.900
So I try to run my Bluetooth on Pokemon, but the Bluetooth won't

02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:31.140
like, let me do the raids.

02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:35.420
So, and I just, when I heard that that, uh, Reggie Gigas or whatever was going

02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:39.260
to be in the, uh, EX raids anyway, I was just like, I'll, I guess I'll get

02:42:39.260 --> 02:42:40.620
it eventually or they'll be out there.

02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:41.580
I just, I don't know.

02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:44.780
I wasn't super interested in paying eight bucks for what they were offering, but

02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:46.140
I'm glad to hear about your story.

02:42:46.180 --> 02:42:49.860
Uh, and kind of the, the pros and cons about it at the end of the day, honestly.

02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:53.420
Uh, Shane might, uh, surprise you in chat.

02:42:53.420 --> 02:42:54.740
They're saying I didn't do it either.

02:42:54.740 --> 02:42:58.420
The lack of special spawns all a go Fest was really the deal breaker for me.

02:42:58.700 --> 02:42:59.340
Oh fuck.

02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:02.180
Darkrai can't be traded because it's mythical fucker.

02:43:02.980 --> 02:43:04.180
Well, I'm fucked.

02:43:04.700 --> 02:43:08.180
They'll bring it back or it'll be, it'll be in a reward box or something.

02:43:08.180 --> 02:43:12.060
And I, I refuse to believe that Darkrai is going to be gone forever and they'll

02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:12.980
bring it back at some point.

02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:13.700
They always do.

02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:15.700
So, all right.

02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:17.060
Anyway, so that's it for emails.

02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:18.060
Okay.

02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:21.260
Uh, if you would like to email us in a future episode, please send us an email.

02:43:21.260 --> 02:43:24.020
Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

02:43:24.140 --> 02:43:26.220
And with that, we can stop collecting the gifts.

02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:29.900
So Bobby, if you wouldn't mind, go ahead and close the gift box there and

02:43:30.020 --> 02:43:33.020
distribute the freebies there in chat.

02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:34.260
Uh, appreciate that.

02:43:34.660 --> 02:43:38.740
Um, And those will go out there shortly in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog

02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:39.140
network.

02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:40.740
Sorry to the podcast folk.

02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:43.540
We don't have any way to let you guys participate in that as well.

02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:46.700
It's just one of the little perks for being able to be here live on, whoa, a

02:43:46.700 --> 02:43:47.860
whole bunch of stuff just went out there.

02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:50.620
Be here, be here live on a Sunday night.

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:54.780
I feel like everybody that doesn't have Twitch prime ended up getting one of

02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:55.460
those rewards.

02:43:55.460 --> 02:43:56.060
Well, there you go.

02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:56.940
Congrats, you guys.

02:43:56.940 --> 02:43:57.260
Thanks.

02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:00.700
And thank you to our very generous community for, uh, distributing all those

02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:01.140
gifts.

02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:02.420
Super appreciate it.

02:44:02.740 --> 02:44:04.140
All right, let's move on.

02:44:04.140 --> 02:44:05.260
We have some more news for you guys.

02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:08.140
I'm actually going to ask us to try to maybe take this a little bit more in

02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:09.180
turbo mode here.

02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:10.780
Those were coming up on nine o'clock.

02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:11.900
We've had a long show tonight.

02:44:12.060 --> 02:44:14.940
I want to make sure we have time to get some calls in and I have to take dark

02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:16.460
soccer home tonight cause she's on meds.

02:44:16.460 --> 02:44:17.940
So it's going to be a long night for me.

02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:19.620
So there better be tacos on the way home.

02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:21.260
Let's that can be arranged.

02:44:21.260 --> 02:44:22.220
Let's go to turbo mode.

02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:23.100
All right.

02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:28.100
So EA has been putting their own games on origin for the longest time.

02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:30.460
Well now they're coming back to steam.

02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:35.860
So starting November 15th with the release of star Wars, Jedi fallen order,

02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:38.860
they will be releasing games on steam as well.

02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:43.700
And also they're going to be allowing the EA access subscription service to

02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:46.300
be purchased on steam as well.

02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:51.660
And going forward, their other games will be, um, put on to steam.

02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:53.860
So that's pretty cool.

02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:57.980
And they, according to their official announcement, um, they're going to have

02:44:57.980 --> 02:45:00.740
some older EA releases come back as well.

02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:06.660
The Sims four unravel to apex legends and battlefield five with crossplay

02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:09.380
between steam and origin as well.

02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:11.700
So cool.

02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:16.260
Do you think this is a sign EA is going to let origin kind of go or what do you

02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:19.220
think, or is this, I don't know, actually that wasn't really the first initial

02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:19.980
thought I got from this.

02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:24.700
My first initial thought was, Oh, this is a move against Epic because Epic has

02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:27.660
really been trying to like get the more and more exclusives and so forth.

02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:33.420
So maybe, uh, EA and like EA and steam have this whole, the enemy of my enemy

02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:36.100
is my friend type of thing going on.

02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:37.260
Does that make sense?

02:45:37.580 --> 02:45:39.300
So it's just business, right?

02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:40.060
Yeah, maybe.

02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:42.540
And Ubisoft left steam to go to Epic.

02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:44.180
So, you know, it makes sense.

02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:44.980
Makes sense.

02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:47.940
So interesting, interesting how this is all shaking out there.

02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:51.620
Um, but how many of these storefronts are we really going to want

02:45:51.620 --> 02:45:52.620
to install on our computer?

02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:56.980
Like, I'm not really that concerned by additional storefronts, honestly,

02:45:56.980 --> 02:46:02.180
like even like the Epic store, eh, whatever, it's just a launcher.

02:46:02.180 --> 02:46:06.220
I have, you know, I don't necessarily keep them launched all the time.

02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:10.220
If I want to play a game that I don't have that many games on the Epic

02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:13.380
storefront and the ones I do like have purchased there, I think I've

02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:14.500
purchased like three games.

02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:18.060
Most of the other ones are just free, which I probably have on

02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:19.860
steam anyways, or other consoles.

02:46:20.300 --> 02:46:21.900
Um, I don't know.

02:46:21.900 --> 02:46:23.140
I just, who cares?

02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:24.900
It's just launching another fucking thing.

02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:27.180
It really doesn't matter at this point.

02:46:27.660 --> 02:46:28.020
All right.

02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:31.300
Uh, let's talk a little bit about, uh, mixer.

02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:34.060
I know it's weird cause we're broadcasting on Twitch, but, and we're

02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:36.580
going to talk about mixer, which am I even allowed to do that?

02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:37.100
Of course I am.

02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:40.220
It's I'm allowed to talk a little bit about the competition because

02:46:40.220 --> 02:46:41.460
competition is healthy.

02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:42.380
I think it's a good thing.

02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:45.460
And, uh, you know, where one company goes, the other might follow.

02:46:45.460 --> 02:46:47.420
And you know, I think it's all, it's all a good thing.

02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:49.500
It's all about the streaming world at the end of the day.

02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:52.180
And besides, there's a lot of people that listen to this show on the podcast

02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:55.580
feed and don't use either Twitch or mixer, but I think it is worth

02:46:55.580 --> 02:47:00.420
noting that this week mixer has dropped their subscription price down to $4.99.

02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:03.740
This is notable because they were charging $5.99.

02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:08.300
That is more than a Twitch subscription, but $4.99 is now at the

02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:10.180
same place as a Twitch subscription.

02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:14.060
It's now a Twitch and a mixer subscription will cost you the same thing.

02:47:14.380 --> 02:47:18.660
Perhaps this is because the recent move of some big notable streamers

02:47:18.660 --> 02:47:20.340
over to mixer, I don't know.

02:47:20.580 --> 02:47:24.780
Uh, maybe when Ninja went over from Twitch to mixer, perhaps it was one of

02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:27.740
those things where, Hey, his followers are gonna have to pay more money to

02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:29.140
subscribe to him over on mixer.

02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:30.500
Well, they're not going to have to do that anymore.

02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:34.580
So mixer took care of that this week by dropping the price down from a dollar.

02:47:34.860 --> 02:47:38.180
Uh, and you get, I guess, special, I don't, I have to admit, since I do

02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:41.220
pretty much exclusively use Twitch myself once in a while, I peek at the

02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:44.500
mixer stuff, especially because like in the X-Box app, it's embedded in

02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:45.380
there because it's a Microsoft thing.

02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:45.660
Right?

02:47:45.820 --> 02:47:49.340
So like when I go to play, uh, something like bloodstained, it'll be like, here

02:47:49.340 --> 02:47:53.340
are the people streaming bloodstained on mixer right now, which I really

02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:58.060
wish I hope we see like a Sony and Twitch partnership thing, maybe going

02:47:58.060 --> 02:47:59.100
into the next generation of games.

02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:02.780
Cause I know you kind of get that a little bit on Sony now, but it only

02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:06.020
shows you the people streaming natively through the console.

02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:07.820
So I hope maybe, I don't know.

02:48:07.820 --> 02:48:09.140
We'll see, we'll see what develops.

02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:12.980
But anyway, uh, so yeah, uh, that's, uh, pretty cool that they have

02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:16.340
dropped, uh, the, um, subscription down.

02:48:16.660 --> 02:48:20.060
Um, I don't know what the split is over there.

02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:22.540
Do their people get half like Twitch does?

02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:23.060
I don't know.

02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:23.860
I don't know either.

02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:26.900
Uh, it should also be noted mixer doesn't have the whole, uh, Amazon

02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:28.740
prime thing coming into play either.

02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:33.060
Uh, so there's no like freebie chances, by the way, if you are rocking your

02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:36.820
Amazon prime account and, uh, or your Twitch prime or new, what have you, and

02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:40.220
you haven't yet used your free subscription, consider using it here at

02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:41.580
the voice geeks network, VOG network.

02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:45.420
Uh, using it here, we'll open up the video archive and you can watch, uh, all

02:48:45.420 --> 02:48:50.700
your, uh, episodes of, uh, OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, the few here and

02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:54.380
there specials that we've done over the past year, you can watch all that on video.

02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:57.100
So, um, yeah, there you go.

02:48:57.100 --> 02:49:00.540
Mixer, uh, drop in there to be a little more competitive, especially with some of

02:49:00.540 --> 02:49:03.060
the big name streamers that have left recently dark soccer.

02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:03.700
What do you have for us?

02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:05.060
Just some stuff.

02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:08.180
Um, and I also do have bonus news as well.

02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:14.500
So, um, women in France have, uh, organized, uh, basically in France, about

02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:15.940
half of all gamers are women.

02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:21.620
And so, um, you know, being that they are completely, uh, underrepresented,

02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:27.260
uh, underrepresented though, for the 10th, uh, edition of the Paris games week fair,

02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:31.660
which, um, is actually just ended today, the organization women in

02:49:31.660 --> 02:49:33.420
games had a dedicated soul there.

02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:37.900
Um, it was created in 20, not the stall, but the group was created in 2017.

02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:42.500
It has 1600 members and it promotes involvement of all genders

02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:43.780
in the video game community.

02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:49.300
Um, and then did I have another thing?

02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:52.180
Yeah, that was my story.

02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:54.020
You said you had a bonus thing as well.

02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:54.740
A bonus thing.

02:49:55.060 --> 02:49:58.020
Um, they, they apparently did start, um, nevermind.

02:49:58.020 --> 02:49:59.340
This is an old article, so nevermind.

02:49:59.620 --> 02:49:59.980
Okay.

02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:05.500
Um, uh, what, what do you think is going to be like the long-term effect

02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:07.100
of this organization in France?

02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:12.100
Uh, hopefully, you know, we'll see some serious strides because I mean, the

02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:20.140
moment, anytime an organization composed mostly of women and croaches on male

02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:22.660
territory, Oh shit, people get in arms.

02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:27.900
And I really want to see the, the binary broken number one.

02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:30.100
And I want to see those walls broken down.

02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:36.220
I'd like for people to stop mattering what someone has between their legs or,

02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:40.180
you know, how their bodies are built and say, Hey, this is a gamer and

02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:41.420
they have something to contribute.

02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:43.540
That's the goal.

02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:46.860
Just one minor thing that, cause I don't want the email coming in on it.

02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:48.460
Gender is not always about what's between your legs.

02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:49.260
That's what I said.

02:50:49.260 --> 02:50:49.900
Oh, just making sure.

02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:50.220
Oh, sorry.

02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:51.580
I'm I'm misinterpreted what you said.

02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:52.020
Okay.

02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:55.900
Well, because I mean, I, I, I phrased it exactly like that because

02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:57.660
that's not what gender is.

02:50:58.220 --> 02:51:00.700
You know, but people focus on that bullshit.

02:51:00.740 --> 02:51:01.140
Got it.

02:51:01.300 --> 02:51:01.660
Got it.

02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:02.540
So whatever.

02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:04.580
Um, this is me.

02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:05.260
I know.

02:51:05.260 --> 02:51:05.660
I know.

02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:06.860
That's why I was like, wait a minute.

02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:08.580
I think she wanted to phrase that in a different way, but that's okay.

02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:14.060
Um, I wanted to point out though, um, that I, well, I don't know.

02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:15.860
Cause maybe it's just from my perspective.

02:51:15.860 --> 02:51:16.580
I am a dude.

02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:20.420
So, you know, I don't have the same perspective, but I do feel like, like

02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:25.260
it's getting better than it was even just like three years ago, but I think

02:51:25.260 --> 02:51:29.780
it's because more people are speaking up about like, yo, this is fucked up.

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:33.100
And like, you know, that we're starting to see more things like, Oh yay.

02:51:33.100 --> 02:51:36.940
We just had, you know, a woman, you know, break or break the streak

02:51:36.940 --> 02:51:39.380
and, and win the Hearthstone championship.

02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:43.380
And we're seeing, uh, I think more like men and women diversity

02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:44.740
in games and things like that.

02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:47.540
I don't know, but I, my perspective is not the one to hear.

02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:48.260
What do you think?

02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:50.860
Well, I actually, do you think we're going the right way?

02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:54.500
We have to take, gain ground when, when we can.

02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:58.220
And I do think that there are some steps being made in the right direction,

02:51:58.220 --> 02:52:02.420
but I would like to also point out, and it's maybe about a year ago, um, one

02:52:02.420 --> 02:52:05.940
of my favorite podcasts, Stuff Mom Never Told You did a series about women in

02:52:05.940 --> 02:52:11.380
video games and basically what it's like to be a woman gamer from the perspective

02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:13.100
of a gamer and from statistics.

02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:19.180
And it really is a very, very good breakdown on just what we experience,

02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:21.300
you know, down to the numbers.

02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:23.660
The thing that I like is that it had the numbers in it.

02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:29.500
And it's really, I mean, it's really the only way that, like, for example,

02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:32.220
if you're a gamer, the only way to really be safe is to conceal your,

02:52:32.300 --> 02:52:36.700
your gender or to pick something gender neutral and you still get fucking ratted

02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:40.700
on, you know, people still try to give you shit for it, you know, or being

02:52:40.700 --> 02:52:44.500
a voice in the community, you know, they're like, oh, well, well, you're

02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:47.420
just saying this because you're, you're a woman or, you know, your opinion

02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:49.580
doesn't matter or go back to the kitchen or whatever the fuck.

02:52:49.580 --> 02:52:51.380
It's still fucking happens.

02:52:51.380 --> 02:52:54.060
And as long as it fucking happens, we have not done enough.

02:52:54.380 --> 02:52:54.980
That's true.

02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:58.500
And it's still, you know, the, the thing I can come comment on being a gay

02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:02.300
dude is that, you know, we still hear like anti-gay slurs and stuff and

02:53:02.300 --> 02:53:04.060
happen and you know, that whole thing.

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:07.300
I do like to think it's getting better, but you're right.

02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:12.700
Imagine what it would be like to be a lesbian of color.

02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:14.020
Oh, sure.

02:53:14.860 --> 02:53:19.220
You know, I've, I've got friends who have just been absolutely devastated

02:53:19.220 --> 02:53:23.220
by the language that they've received in playing games and trying to be

02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:28.660
outspoken out there on, you know, this rather treacherous water that is,

02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:31.660
you know, the internet cesspool, really.

02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:37.180
But it does feel like for what it's worth it, at least now we have more

02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:42.260
games with more representation in them, probably because games are easier

02:53:42.260 --> 02:53:46.220
to make and so games, like not everybody could just sit down and

02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:48.500
plunk out an Atari 2,600 game, for example.

02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:51.900
And obviously I'm using extreme example here, but now more people are

02:53:51.900 --> 02:53:53.300
kind of like able to tell stories.

02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:54.740
And I think that like helps.

02:53:54.780 --> 02:53:58.700
I don't necessarily want to, you know, do the big comparison with the civil

02:53:58.700 --> 02:54:00.380
rights movement or anything like that.

02:54:00.660 --> 02:54:03.860
But there is a, it was just a little meme that kind of reminded me of this

02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:09.620
fact that major changes in government and in society haven't happened until

02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:14.180
it was made a big inconvenience for the dominant party.

02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:18.340
We didn't get ADA until people surrounded the White House with wheelchairs.

02:54:18.380 --> 02:54:24.020
You know, it took a march to Washington and, you know, big fights for school

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:27.700
integration, the whole civil rights movement to give people of color

02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:29.620
closer to an equal standing.

02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:30.260
They don't have it yet.

02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:33.500
It's what's happening, but it's not there yet.

02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:34.820
We still have a lot of work to do.

02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:38.580
You know, women got the votes because we were jailed.

02:54:38.580 --> 02:54:42.620
We went on hunger strikes, force fed, you know, things that, oh, well, you

02:54:42.620 --> 02:54:43.460
just see Susan B.

02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:44.820
Anthony and whatever the fuck.

02:54:44.820 --> 02:54:49.900
But people don't know those stories about women who were force fed raw eggs

02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:54.820
through a tube because they dared stand up for suffrage, you know?

02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:56.860
And you're dealing with all of this worldwide.

02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:00.420
You're dealing, well, I mean, I hate Gandhi because he was pretty racist,

02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:06.180
he was pretty racist, but I mean, he would walk, you know, walk works of protest,

02:55:06.380 --> 02:55:10.420
you know, and the thing is, is that any kind of injustice like this has

02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:12.620
to be fought without rest.

02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:16.940
And if one person falters, someone else has to step up.

02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:21.820
And that's why I say all of us, you know, no matter what your gender is, you

02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:25.620
need to stand up and look out for the other oppressed groups because you

02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:27.020
could fucking be next.

02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:29.020
And I'm done.

02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:30.180
No, you're fine.

02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:31.260
It needed reset.

02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:35.460
I mean, so much for turbo mode, but important topic, but a topic we could

02:55:35.460 --> 02:55:37.580
do a whole three hour show on anyway.

02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:40.740
But we got to move on just for time's sake, since we're after 9 p.m.

02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:43.020
And we still have some more stories to get to, including what Loki

02:55:43.020 --> 02:55:43.820
is going to talk about next.

02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:44.580
Yes.

02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:48.860
And so we had talked about Xbox all access a while back, that whole plan

02:55:48.860 --> 02:55:56.860
where you could basically get an Xbox, uh, one or Xbox one X, um, game pass

02:55:56.900 --> 02:56:01.260
and Xbox live discounted over the course of, uh, two years.

02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:03.020
So you have monthly payments that you pay.

02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:08.740
Well, it's coming back as of November 18th and it's available through, um,

02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:11.940
different partners, depending on where you're purchasing it from.

02:56:11.940 --> 02:56:18.100
I want to say North America is in, uh, Amazon, amazon.com.

02:56:18.180 --> 02:56:21.460
Um, UK would be game or Smith's toys.

02:56:21.940 --> 02:56:27.260
And in Australia, they have that online at Telstra or I think

02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:28.620
in their Microsoft stores.

02:56:29.020 --> 02:56:35.740
So, um, the way it works, it could be as little as $19.99 per month for 24 months.

02:56:36.100 --> 02:56:39.220
They are also along with the program.

02:56:40.380 --> 02:56:46.780
Um, you have the opportunity to upgrade to the next, uh, uh, project scarlet

02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:51.740
when it's available in the holiday 2020, although not for the Xbox one X version,

02:56:51.740 --> 02:56:56.100
which is weird, but they don't offer the upgrade that way.

02:56:56.460 --> 02:57:04.380
Um, that's curious, but for the other versions, they like the Xbox one S.

02:57:04.820 --> 02:57:08.860
You can get that, uh, with an upgrade path as well.

02:57:09.460 --> 02:57:13.660
So, um, yeah, they mentioned Xbox one X would be 30 99 a month.

02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:22.420
Um, Xbox one S is 22 99, 19 99 would be for the Xbox one S all digital version.

02:57:23.740 --> 02:57:26.900
So, and no upfront costs and yeah.

02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:30.500
Yeah, especially, and I've been commenting on the show myself that, you know, game

02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:32.420
passes is getting stronger and stronger.

02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:34.780
Like I'm actually enjoying that more myself as a consumer.

02:57:34.780 --> 02:57:38.500
So this is an interesting, you know, way to kind of jump into this, especially

02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:41.620
going into the holiday season where it's like, you know, if I could just, you

02:57:41.620 --> 02:57:45.380
know, buy somebody a year of this or whatever, I guess you're agreeing to it.

02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:46.220
It's like a contract.

02:57:46.220 --> 02:57:47.060
I mean, it's not so easy.

02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:48.020
It is interesting.

02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:52.380
And I'd want to see more like how the interactivity with the project scarlet

02:57:52.380 --> 02:57:57.300
stuff and the Xbox one works before I would be like willing to jump into

02:57:57.300 --> 02:58:00.860
something like this, but it's interesting.

02:58:00.860 --> 02:58:06.180
And I'm curious to see why the Xbox one X doesn't have an upgrade path on that,

02:58:06.180 --> 02:58:09.300
but, uh, the other ones do so that's weird.

02:58:10.060 --> 02:58:10.540
Yeah.

02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:11.540
So, all right.

02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:14.380
Well, I'll be curious to see if, uh, it's a successful program.

02:58:14.380 --> 02:58:15.460
And people, I'm sorry.

02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:18.060
I especially want to see if they apply this to the next.

02:58:18.060 --> 02:58:18.660
I'm sorry.

02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:20.140
They does have an upgrade path.

02:58:20.140 --> 02:58:26.220
The difference is that it, the Xbox one S you have to have it for 18 months.

02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:29.260
Whereas the Xbox one X it's for 12 months.

02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:30.420
I see.

02:58:30.420 --> 02:58:31.700
All right then.

02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:32.620
All right.

02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:35.940
Well, moving on to, uh, one more story for tonight.

02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:41.980
It has to do with Pac-Man's 40th anniversary and, uh, Pac-Man is, uh,

02:58:41.980 --> 02:58:45.860
getting some, uh, special new things for the 40th anniversary Namco Bandai

02:58:45.860 --> 02:58:47.220
trying to go all out a little bit.

02:58:47.220 --> 02:58:50.260
I'm hoping that means we're going to see some games in the next year.

02:58:50.260 --> 02:58:54.300
But, um, the early thing we have at least is we have a song called

02:58:54.300 --> 02:58:59.740
join the pack by Ken Ishii, who I think is a famous DJ over in Japan.

02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:04.260
Uh, there's actually a music video out there for join the pack, uh, by a

02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:09.740
famous director, Yuichi Kodama, uh, who won wards at con in 2008, uh,

02:59:09.740 --> 02:59:11.420
the international film festival.

02:59:11.420 --> 02:59:15.700
Uh, he also did the, uh, flag handover ceremony at the Rio Olympics, 2016.

02:59:15.700 --> 02:59:17.180
So some big names behind this.

02:59:17.180 --> 02:59:19.060
Now, sadly, you would think it's a video show.

02:59:19.060 --> 02:59:22.180
I would show you the video, but I do have to have concern about

02:59:22.180 --> 02:59:23.260
getting muted here.

02:59:23.260 --> 02:59:25.660
So I can't really play the song cause it is copyright song.

02:59:25.660 --> 02:59:27.780
However, if you want to check that out, I listened to it.

02:59:27.780 --> 02:59:28.740
It's okay.

02:59:28.740 --> 02:59:30.900
It's it's no Pac-Man fever.

02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:32.860
But maybe I'm just showing my age there.

02:59:32.860 --> 02:59:34.460
Uh, anyway, you can check that out.

02:59:34.460 --> 02:59:36.940
Uh, the, uh, join the pack is the official theme song there.

02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:39.740
I'm hoping this leads into some game announcements.

02:59:39.740 --> 02:59:43.060
Cause I don't think that, wow, we made a Pac-Man song.

02:59:43.060 --> 02:59:45.740
I mean, even though they got some talented names behind it, I don't think

02:59:45.740 --> 02:59:48.740
that's really a great anniversary thing, but maybe if it's like, Hey,

02:59:48.740 --> 02:59:51.620
we're going to put out like a mega Pac-Man collection, or we're going to

02:59:51.620 --> 02:59:56.140
put out like a lost Pac-Man thing, or, uh, we're going to let arcade one

02:59:56.140 --> 02:59:59.620
up, make a baby Pac-Man table, how they're going to do.

02:59:59.620 --> 03:00:02.620
We're going to make a Pac-Man live action movie.

03:00:02.860 --> 03:00:05.380
How they're going to do it because they've never done a pinball table before.

03:00:05.380 --> 03:00:08.380
I don't know, but this is, this is the time to learn how they're going to start.

03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:11.660
Uh, but we'll, we'll see what else comes out of their 40th anniversary,

03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:13.340
but I was still kind of like, wow.

03:00:13.340 --> 03:00:17.020
Is it really like, oh my God, why don't they make like arcade one

03:00:17.020 --> 03:00:20.460
up pinball tables, like miniaturized version of pinball tables, dude,

03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:24.980
wait, like if these mini machines are as popular as they're like, like bit

03:00:24.980 --> 03:00:27.900
like they, I feel like the mini arcade one up machines, like there's more

03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:30.340
and more of them and they're getting some bigger and bigger franchises,

03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:33.940
like the Ninja Turtles thing, the star Wars thing, which, um, shout out,

03:00:33.940 --> 03:00:37.100
if you haven't seen Bobby Blackwell's video, he put that up at, uh, on the

03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:39.700
VOG network, YouTube, which we don't talk about a lot because we don't use

03:00:39.700 --> 03:00:43.620
it a lot, but Bobby put a great little clip from his show up there, uh, with

03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:46.700
him, like building the arcade one up star Wars thing.

03:00:46.700 --> 03:00:49.380
So if you haven't seen what these machines look, look like, check it out

03:00:49.380 --> 03:00:51.100
over on our YouTube channel at VOG network.

03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:53.860
Um, but these are kid one ups are getting bigger and bigger names.

03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:55.100
Didn't they get a gauntlet one?

03:00:55.380 --> 03:00:55.860
Nothing like that.

03:00:55.860 --> 03:00:57.060
No, I make that up.

03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:58.180
I think you made that up.

03:00:58.220 --> 03:00:58.780
I made that up.

03:00:58.780 --> 03:00:59.980
Cause I want one, my bad.

03:01:00.180 --> 03:01:05.020
Um, but, uh, that would be really cool, but I, the mortal combat one, I kind of

03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:09.060
want to get cause I love the old mortal combat games, so, but it's just, you

03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:13.980
know, again, I need less shit in this house, not more, so the eternal struggle.

03:01:15.740 --> 03:01:16.140
All right.

03:01:16.140 --> 03:01:17.940
Anyway, uh, there you go.

03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:20.340
So that is, uh, Pac-Man's 40th anniversary.

03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:22.900
Uh, let's, let's open up the listener round table.

03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:25.780
You guys, uh, we're going to go to our discord and if you want to give us a

03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:30.420
call, you can join the green room over in our discord over at vog network.com

03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:33.980
slash discord, and we're going to get to some calls here on air.

03:01:33.980 --> 03:01:36.100
I'm probably not gonna be able to take a lot of calls tonight just because

03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:38.740
we're already running a little late, but that's what happens when you take

03:01:38.740 --> 03:01:41.780
so much time off and then Blizzcon happens the same week that you come back.

03:01:42.340 --> 03:01:43.260
You feeling okay over there?

03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:43.740
Yeah.

03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:48.300
Had a little bit of a thing to get, uh, kind of having a great discussion.

03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:51.660
I mean, I got a little angry for a moment, but, um, talking about the

03:01:51.660 --> 03:01:56.100
experience of women in gaming, you know, uh, Kaijuna was bringing up

03:01:56.100 --> 03:02:00.540
having a friend, well, a former friend who was going off on a woman after

03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:03.300
having been beaten in a game and I'm like, okay, so I'm take that.

03:02:03.300 --> 03:02:07.380
And imagine this is every experience you have with it directed at you.

03:02:07.900 --> 03:02:12.980
Every game, maybe not every game, but just about any time you sit and play

03:02:12.980 --> 03:02:17.500
any kind of multiplayer game, this happens and it's always at you, no

03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:20.940
matter what you do, how clean of a game, how little shit you talk about

03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:23.420
people, this is the experience of women in gaming.

03:02:25.020 --> 03:02:29.780
Um, I do want to point out, um, Bobby Black Wolf is, is, uh, justifying my

03:02:29.780 --> 03:02:33.780
gauntlet experience saying I did not make that up in fact, there is a

03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:39.380
rampage cabinet that has rampage joust defender and I have played that one.

03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:40.860
I forgot that it had gauntlet.

03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:44.940
So, yeah, but you were, I, I was not, maybe you, maybe your

03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:46.740
brain went to gauntlet legends.

03:02:46.780 --> 03:02:47.140
Yes.

03:02:47.140 --> 03:02:49.460
Unfortunately that is not a thing that they have.

03:02:50.140 --> 03:02:52.060
If they did that, yeah.

03:02:52.100 --> 03:02:52.580
Right.

03:02:52.620 --> 03:02:52.820
Yeah.

03:02:52.820 --> 03:02:54.660
I would have been very excited to be pretty amazing.

03:02:54.740 --> 03:02:55.620
That would be pretty amazing.

03:02:55.660 --> 03:02:57.620
All right, let's get to, um, some calls.

03:02:57.780 --> 03:03:00.660
So I'm going to try to drop somebody in the on air room and hello.

03:03:00.660 --> 03:03:01.780
You were on orange launch radio.

03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:02.300
Who's this?

03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:05.500
Amy, uh, this is my lovely him.

03:03:05.540 --> 03:03:06.140
How are you?

03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:07.460
Hey, I am great.

03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:09.780
Except I'm just having to adjust the volume on the fly, but don't

03:03:09.780 --> 03:03:10.220
worry about that.

03:03:10.220 --> 03:03:10.940
That's on my end.

03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:12.060
So sorry about the echo guys.

03:03:12.060 --> 03:03:12.860
What's on your mind tonight?

03:03:12.860 --> 03:03:14.180
Raging or excuse me, metal mayhem.

03:03:14.180 --> 03:03:14.660
What's on your mind?

03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:19.300
Oh, well, I started to bring up, um, unusual.

03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:24.980
Topic, uh, mainly, uh, hoarding of, uh, digital PC games.

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:32.820
Um, as you know, Nowadays, things do humble bundle sale, uh, bundle

03:03:32.820 --> 03:03:36.820
bundles, uh, steam sales, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:45.700
It's incredibly easy to build up massive amounts of, uh, PC, uh, games.

03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:53.220
Um, and, you know, depending on the person, you know, it can be easily,

03:03:53.340 --> 03:03:59.260
you know, justified as, you know, eventually I'll get around to play X

03:03:59.260 --> 03:04:04.660
game or Y game, or you never know if a certain game is going to be

03:04:04.660 --> 03:04:06.980
elicited at some point down the road.

03:04:07.020 --> 03:04:13.140
Like, uh, you know, Doug Tails remastered was fairly recently.

03:04:13.780 --> 03:04:20.860
Um, that being said, you know, I, you know, do you think that, you know, the

03:04:20.860 --> 03:04:28.060
building of these massive libraries of games, uh, can be an issue in a sense?

03:04:28.100 --> 03:04:28.620
No.

03:04:28.660 --> 03:04:34.140
I mean, you know, case in point, no, not to sound like a bragging, but with

03:04:34.140 --> 03:04:40.580
all the games I have through the various services, I get well over 2000 games.

03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:46.060
Odds are, you know, probably not going to get around to play every single one of

03:04:46.060 --> 03:04:54.020
those games, especially since a lot of them can be upwards is say 50 hours long.

03:04:54.820 --> 03:05:00.740
Um, so do you think that it can be like a serious hoarding issue, even

03:05:00.740 --> 03:05:05.980
though that they don't take a physical room like, uh, cartridges?

03:05:05.980 --> 03:05:13.500
Um, I mean, hoarding is in some ways kind of a part of human nature.

03:05:13.540 --> 03:05:17.460
Like I realized that sometimes we associate that word hoarding with like,

03:05:17.460 --> 03:05:23.460
um, the TV show hoarders when things go to, uh, an extreme of sorts, but I think

03:05:23.460 --> 03:05:27.220
something about the collection and collectibles that's, there's something I

03:05:27.220 --> 03:05:29.420
think that's kind of like fused in us with that whole thing.

03:05:29.660 --> 03:05:32.780
Um, case in point, you know, even though you kind of talk about, oh, we build up

03:05:32.820 --> 03:05:36.540
this huge library of digital games on Steam, uh, or whatever service, you know,

03:05:36.540 --> 03:05:38.980
we're using and we, we may or may not ever getting around to play them.

03:05:39.220 --> 03:05:39.700
You know what?

03:05:39.700 --> 03:05:45.180
I think of houses I've gone into that have gigantic bookshelves, lots and lots

03:05:45.180 --> 03:05:45.980
of books.

03:05:46.140 --> 03:05:49.860
And I think to myself, you probably have never read all of those books.

03:05:49.860 --> 03:05:52.900
Maybe they have, but I bet there's a lot of books on that shelf that you've never

03:05:52.900 --> 03:05:53.260
read.

03:05:53.460 --> 03:05:56.300
Uh, same thing with the people, you know, that you go into their house and they

03:05:56.300 --> 03:05:59.740
have DVDs that practically wrap around the house.

03:05:59.900 --> 03:06:02.980
Maybe you're seeing less and less of that because of this digital future we're

03:06:02.980 --> 03:06:03.420
living in.

03:06:03.420 --> 03:06:06.580
But I know I went to somebody's house not that long ago who I was meeting, um,

03:06:06.620 --> 03:06:10.180
kind of like, like a new friend I just met and I was like, dang, you got to like

03:06:10.180 --> 03:06:11.380
a lot of DVDs.

03:06:11.620 --> 03:06:15.380
And then I'm thinking, has this person actually watched the DVD or do they buy

03:06:15.380 --> 03:06:15.940
the DVD?

03:06:15.940 --> 03:06:18.380
Because maybe they saw the movie in the theater and they just kind of liked it.

03:06:18.540 --> 03:06:19.140
I mean, I don't know.

03:06:19.140 --> 03:06:22.020
And I'm not saying like, oh, everybody who has these collections doesn't actually

03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:22.460
use them.

03:06:22.580 --> 03:06:22.980
Sure.

03:06:22.980 --> 03:06:25.980
I bet there are some people that have watched every single DVD that they own.

03:06:26.140 --> 03:06:28.060
Have you watched every single DVD that you own, Loki?

03:06:28.300 --> 03:06:29.820
I don't know the main DVDs anymore.

03:06:29.820 --> 03:06:30.300
Not anymore.

03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:30.460
Right.

03:06:30.460 --> 03:06:31.500
And when I did know.

03:06:31.540 --> 03:06:35.340
Yeah, but have you played every single game in the vault?

03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:39.700
Okay.

03:06:39.820 --> 03:06:40.460
See what I mean?

03:06:40.780 --> 03:06:42.860
So that's funny, Rob.

03:06:42.940 --> 03:06:48.740
So the digital collection on steam, the digital just makes it easier to do that.

03:06:48.740 --> 03:06:52.100
And just, there's something about having that impressive collection.

03:06:52.100 --> 03:06:55.980
Like, oh, remember when it used to be, we have this big binder full of CDs, check

03:06:56.020 --> 03:06:58.260
out my CD collection or, you know, things like that.

03:06:58.260 --> 03:07:01.500
Like, it's just like having the collections as part of nature.

03:07:01.660 --> 03:07:06.380
So I don't think it's like a bad thing to have, like all these games pile up.

03:07:06.380 --> 03:07:11.780
In fact, I mean, sometimes you get the most random bug to go play a certain game

03:07:11.980 --> 03:07:14.740
and then you find out, oh, I have that in my collection.

03:07:14.740 --> 03:07:18.540
And then maybe you get to experience this thing that you might collect dust

03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:19.300
otherwise.

03:07:19.420 --> 03:07:20.140
So, I don't know.

03:07:20.140 --> 03:07:21.140
Those are my thoughts.

03:07:22.340 --> 03:07:25.900
Did I really address your question, Metal Mayhem, or was there something deeper in

03:07:25.940 --> 03:07:26.140
that?

03:07:28.620 --> 03:07:29.940
More or less you did.

03:07:30.180 --> 03:07:35.980
You know, the thing is, you know, at least when I was strictly a console gamer, you

03:07:35.980 --> 03:07:43.660
know, up until that close to the end of the PS3 era, you know, a lot of games,

03:07:43.980 --> 03:07:47.820
you know, especially in physical games, were $60 plus.

03:07:49.300 --> 03:07:54.180
That being said, I didn't buy every single last game that I came across.

03:07:54.700 --> 03:08:01.780
Now, ever since you introduced me to PC games, namely Steam, you mentioned Steam

03:08:01.780 --> 03:08:02.980
sales and all that.

03:08:02.980 --> 03:08:07.780
Now, I kind of caught the bug, you know, where I was in no estate.

03:08:08.060 --> 03:08:11.380
Now, this game is going to weigh $20.

03:08:12.020 --> 03:08:14.300
Now, it's on sale for $2.

03:08:14.300 --> 03:08:20.500
So Humble Bundle has this bundle, you know, I can get all these games for a dollar.

03:08:21.020 --> 03:08:27.540
I was like, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, I'll buy two of that, you know, I'll buy

03:08:27.980 --> 03:08:33.420
whatever, you know, I'll get around to playing these eventually.

03:08:33.420 --> 03:08:39.460
But, you know, the thing is, you know, it kind of go up and, you know, now I got,

03:08:39.460 --> 03:08:42.980
like, like I said, quite, you know, quite, you know, collection.

03:08:42.980 --> 03:08:48.780
And honestly, you know, I probably got more games, you know, more free time than the

03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:52.340
average person because I'm disabled and don't have a nine-to-five job.

03:08:52.820 --> 03:08:55.740
But even with that being said, even if I...

03:08:55.740 --> 03:09:01.300
What you find, despite your limitations, your boundaries in that regard, you've kind

03:09:01.300 --> 03:09:05.980
of found ways to, in a way, still, like, keep your happiness and keep your level of

03:09:05.980 --> 03:09:07.900
happiness because you are a gamer.

03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:11.260
And I know we've talked about this when you first started listening to OLR.

03:09:11.260 --> 03:09:15.020
I remember some of your concern was, am I going to fit in here because I'm still

03:09:15.020 --> 03:09:19.260
playing Nintendo 64 games when y'all are talking about PlayStation 2 and 3 type of

03:09:19.260 --> 03:09:23.300
games? And the answer was an enthusiastic, yes, you still fit in here because you're

03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:24.340
still a gamer.

03:09:24.340 --> 03:09:29.860
And I think that's also, you know, you are working with the cards that you have.

03:09:30.100 --> 03:09:36.060
And in my impression, and I apologize if I'm misstating anything, but my impression

03:09:36.060 --> 03:09:41.260
is you've kind of made a fun hobby out of deal shopping, you know, and I don't...

03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:42.580
There's nothing wrong with that.

03:09:42.660 --> 03:09:45.220
Lord, you ever seen any of those extreme coupon shows?

03:09:46.660 --> 03:09:51.380
People make hobbies out of finding those good deals, and that's definitely not a bad

03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:56.140
thing at all. And it allows you to still play a lot of, maybe not games that came out

03:09:56.140 --> 03:09:59.820
yesterday, but a lot of games that came out within the past couple of years that are

03:09:59.820 --> 03:10:04.260
still very, very good and worthy of your attention, whether you got it for free or got

03:10:04.260 --> 03:10:07.220
it on a deep cut for only, like, 99 cents.

03:10:07.900 --> 03:10:13.340
So, yeah, you know, I'll be the first to admit that because I live on Social Security

03:10:13.340 --> 03:10:21.420
disability and which doesn't pay me much per month, you know, I can't afford to go buy,

03:10:22.620 --> 03:10:25.980
you know, expensive games on the regular.

03:10:25.980 --> 03:10:31.460
But, you know, I kind of honed my ability to find the deals, you know, like you

03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:38.660
mentioned, you know, I look all over the place, the humble bundle, you know, the sales,

03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:46.100
you know, read little articles to post, you know, I'll repost the stuff that I find on

03:10:46.100 --> 03:10:47.500
Steam in the one group.

03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:55.460
Sorry. So, yeah, I mean, I can't quite adapt to it.

03:10:55.460 --> 03:11:00.180
So, you know, I mean, if I can find, like, a really good deal and stuff, you know,

03:11:00.180 --> 03:11:04.900
pouring out to get stuff to all the people, because I know I'm probably not the only

03:11:04.900 --> 03:11:08.260
person in the world that has to live on a tight budget, you know.

03:11:08.820 --> 03:11:10.420
Absolutely not.

03:11:10.420 --> 03:11:13.380
And I think there's other people also on a tight budget.

03:11:13.380 --> 03:11:17.860
I'm sure you're not alone in that, that appreciate all those tips and those things that

03:11:17.860 --> 03:11:19.700
you put out there when you find the games.

03:11:19.700 --> 03:11:24.180
And that's why you have sites like, for example, I'll just shout out Cheap Ass Gamer.

03:11:24.180 --> 03:11:26.860
I know they've had a podcast that's been around forever, too.

03:11:27.500 --> 03:11:30.780
And, you know, it's because people love a good deal.

03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:36.060
And to build up those backlogs, because you never know, someday, maybe it'll be easy to

03:11:36.060 --> 03:11:40.620
pass along those digital backlogs to somebody else, just like it would be your library book

03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:42.460
collection or your DVD collection.

03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:45.100
Anyway, Metal Mayhem, I got to let you go because we're running really long tonight.

03:11:45.100 --> 03:11:46.060
But thank you so much for your call.

03:11:46.060 --> 03:11:46.780
I appreciate it, buddy.

03:11:46.780 --> 03:11:47.280
Okay?

03:11:48.380 --> 03:11:49.260
Have a good night.

03:11:49.260 --> 03:11:49.740
Take care.

03:11:49.740 --> 03:11:50.620
Take care.

03:11:50.620 --> 03:11:50.860
All right.

03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:52.780
That was the only call that was waiting on Discord for us.

03:11:52.780 --> 03:11:55.580
So, I am going to go ahead and close up Discord just because we're running over three hours

03:11:55.580 --> 03:12:00.220
right now, and I know everybody's about had it, but that's what happens when you've been

03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:01.500
gone for a few weeks.

03:12:01.500 --> 03:12:06.140
I will still go over to Loki and ask if there's any last minute stories that you might have.

03:12:06.140 --> 03:12:07.100
Yes, there is.

03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:08.380
So, I was going to mention this.

03:12:09.180 --> 03:12:16.780
One of my favorite independent game companies, Bossa, who did the very famous Surgeon Simulator

03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:18.220
games in I Am Bread.

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:27.420
Well, they have done something kind of in a similar tone as like how we got Goat Simulator

03:12:27.420 --> 03:12:29.660
with Coffee Stain games.

03:12:29.660 --> 03:12:38.060
So, they have these prototypes of games that they're developing that you can download for

03:12:38.060 --> 03:12:42.940
free and try them out and let them know which one you want turned into a real game.

03:12:42.940 --> 03:12:52.700
So, you can go to bossapresents.com and download either they have Pigeon Simulator, I Am Fish,

03:12:53.820 --> 03:12:56.700
or Trash Bandits, and they all look great.

03:12:56.700 --> 03:12:58.460
Oh, Trash Bandits all the way.

03:12:58.460 --> 03:13:03.420
So, Trash Bandits, you're a fox and you collect trash.

03:13:03.420 --> 03:13:06.620
I thought it was like actual like little bandits going through the trash.

03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:07.900
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:13:07.900 --> 03:13:13.820
So, Trash Bandits, it's basically your foxes that you're collecting things and throwing

03:13:13.820 --> 03:13:17.740
in the back of like a garbage truck.

03:13:17.740 --> 03:13:22.140
So, you're doing that and you're actually like, you know, it looks pretty crazy.

03:13:22.140 --> 03:13:24.780
I Am Fish, it's similar to I Am Bread.

03:13:24.780 --> 03:13:28.140
I Am Bread was kind of the game where you control a piece of bread and you try to get

03:13:28.140 --> 03:13:29.180
to the toaster.

03:13:29.180 --> 03:13:34.780
In I Am Fish, you're a fish in a fish bowl and you have to roll a fish bowl to get to

03:13:34.780 --> 03:13:40.220
a water source without breaking the fish bowl and dying because you're a fish.

03:13:40.220 --> 03:13:44.940
Pigeon Simulator is this ridiculous game where you're pigeon and poop on things and pigeon

03:13:44.940 --> 03:13:45.420
things.

03:13:45.420 --> 03:13:48.700
So, all look great, all free.

03:13:48.700 --> 03:13:52.940
So, go check them out and I'm going to download all of them.

03:13:52.940 --> 03:13:54.780
Yeah, that's great.

03:13:54.780 --> 03:13:55.340
I love that.

03:13:55.980 --> 03:13:57.580
So, that's Trash Bandits.

03:13:57.580 --> 03:13:58.460
That's all I had.

03:13:58.460 --> 03:13:59.100
All right.

03:13:59.100 --> 03:14:00.540
No, that's a great last minute story.

03:14:00.540 --> 03:14:01.980
It's completely appropriate.

03:14:01.980 --> 03:14:05.420
I will ask, I know Darcy, you don't usually have a ton of last minute stories, but sometimes

03:14:05.420 --> 03:14:05.580
you do.

03:14:05.580 --> 03:14:06.460
So, you have anything for us?

03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:07.340
No.

03:14:07.340 --> 03:14:07.420
Okay.

03:14:07.420 --> 03:14:07.820
No.

03:14:07.820 --> 03:14:08.380
Cool.

03:14:08.380 --> 03:14:08.700
All right.

03:14:08.700 --> 03:14:11.500
Then we're going to go ahead and start to make the moves to wrap things up tonight.

03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:13.260
Great show back.

03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:17.900
I really, it was hard to be gone an extra week, but I'm really glad to be back.

03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:23.340
As I've mentioned before, we will not be live next week, but we're not, we are going to,

03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:25.260
thankfully it works out, we are going to have a show.

03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:29.580
So, please be on the lookout on our social media because we're going to be soliciting

03:14:29.580 --> 03:14:33.420
your questions to help us build the next show that's coming up.

03:14:33.420 --> 03:14:37.820
And I seem to remember an email that had a question we need to still get to to answer

03:14:37.820 --> 03:14:38.060
that.

03:14:38.060 --> 03:14:40.300
I said we do that the next time we record a show.

03:14:40.300 --> 03:14:45.180
So, we'll handle all of that for our recorded in advance show for next Sunday.

03:14:45.180 --> 03:14:48.540
So, we will still have something new on the podcast feed for you guys and something new

03:14:48.540 --> 03:14:53.180
for those of you that are here for Bobby's show live on Twitch Sunday night, something

03:14:53.180 --> 03:14:54.140
to view right after that.

03:14:54.140 --> 03:14:55.100
So, that'll be really good.

03:14:55.900 --> 03:14:58.780
But we have run really long and I think it's time to wrap things up.

03:14:58.780 --> 03:15:01.820
So, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:15:01.820 --> 03:15:03.740
So, I'll start tonight.

03:15:03.740 --> 03:15:11.820
My final thought is I've been enjoying playing the games like more of them this week, a diverse

03:15:12.380 --> 03:15:14.860
different set of games than just nothing but MMOs.

03:15:14.860 --> 03:15:18.220
And I'm going to try to kind of keep doing that and make really good use of my game pass

03:15:18.220 --> 03:15:20.380
and stuff and have more games to tell you guys about.

03:15:20.380 --> 03:15:25.660
The place where I've been slacking is streaming, which I feel like is always my struggle, but

03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:30.220
just with my new job and the traveling that goes into my new job, it's been a little bit

03:15:30.220 --> 03:15:31.900
harder to get to that regularly.

03:15:31.900 --> 03:15:35.740
But I'm going to hope as we get into the new year, I can really settle down and try to

03:15:35.740 --> 03:15:37.420
do that a little more regularly for you guys.

03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:39.820
Because I know you all want to see me play Death Stranding.

03:15:39.820 --> 03:15:41.020
I know you do.

03:15:41.020 --> 03:15:42.540
So, that's my final thought.

03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:43.580
I can't wait.

03:15:43.580 --> 03:15:44.940
Loki, since you left, you go next.

03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:45.740
What's your final thought?

03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:53.260
Looks like Pigeon Simulator is much of a simulator of pigeons as Surgeon Simulator was a surgical

03:15:53.260 --> 03:15:53.900
simulation.

03:15:54.460 --> 03:15:55.020
It's great.

03:15:55.020 --> 03:15:56.220
I can't wait to try it out.

03:15:56.780 --> 03:15:57.340
All right.

03:15:57.340 --> 03:15:59.500
And last but not least, Dark Sakura, I hope you feel better.

03:15:59.500 --> 03:16:00.300
I'm glad we were able to.

03:16:00.300 --> 03:16:02.140
I would have been really sad if you couldn't be here tonight.

03:16:02.140 --> 03:16:05.180
I mean, I would have completely understood, but that would have meant one month of no

03:16:05.180 --> 03:16:05.900
Dark Sakura.

03:16:05.900 --> 03:16:08.460
So, I'm glad you're here.

03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:09.660
Glad you made it through the show.

03:16:09.660 --> 03:16:11.740
Any final words of tonight from you?

03:16:11.740 --> 03:16:12.700
I have no filter.

03:16:13.500 --> 03:16:17.100
I am still completely zoned.

03:16:17.100 --> 03:16:18.780
Especially when on the meds.

03:16:18.780 --> 03:16:20.060
And I have no fucking filter.

03:16:21.100 --> 03:16:22.700
This is the craziest feeling ever.

03:16:22.780 --> 03:16:26.860
And I'm kind of digging it, but I'm sorry if I've been a bitch.

03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:28.300
It's okay.

03:16:28.300 --> 03:16:29.100
A bitcher.

03:16:29.100 --> 03:16:31.580
It's a bitchier than usual.

03:16:31.580 --> 03:16:31.980
Yes.

03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:32.300
All right.

03:16:33.340 --> 03:16:34.300
Actually, I'm not really sorry.

03:16:36.220 --> 03:16:36.620
All right.

03:16:37.660 --> 03:16:38.220
That's it.

03:16:38.220 --> 03:16:39.980
Thank you guys so much for joining us here.

03:16:39.980 --> 03:16:41.020
Back live tonight.

03:16:41.020 --> 03:16:42.540
We'll be back live in two weeks.

03:16:42.540 --> 03:16:45.180
We'll be back in a taped form next week.

03:16:45.180 --> 03:16:46.220
Thank you guys for being here.

03:16:46.220 --> 03:16:47.020
Thanks for your support.

03:16:47.020 --> 03:16:47.980
Thanks for sticking with us.

03:16:48.540 --> 03:16:53.020
Despite the fact that sometimes the cable knocks out our show for a week or that our

03:16:53.020 --> 03:16:54.300
real lives get in the way.

03:16:54.300 --> 03:16:56.860
Things happen at the end of the day.

03:16:56.860 --> 03:16:57.900
Happy gaming.

03:16:57.900 --> 03:17:02.860
Keep the debate spirited, but keep the debate friendly, positive, and peaceful.

03:17:02.860 --> 03:17:04.220
And don't be a dick.

03:17:04.220 --> 03:17:04.620
That's it.

03:17:04.620 --> 03:17:06.700
I'll get off my high horse and roll the credits.

03:17:06.700 --> 03:17:07.660
Have a great night, everybody.

03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:07.900
Bye.
