weird memory foam cervical pillow and it's like got these grooves on the side I can put my arms

it's all right all right we'll talk about games that you played and all that good stuff a little

01:32.780 --> 01:37.260
later but for now I want to jump right into our kickoff topic tonight because it's been quite the

01:37.260 --> 01:43.900
week in the gaming news world hasn't it give it a name what the name of the week or the name of

01:43.900 --> 01:50.380
the story or what the name of the whole thing fuckery I'm honestly not a bad word for it

01:50.380 --> 01:56.260
shenanigans I I don't know what to say it's it's been a weird week um okay so here's the deal I

01:56.260 --> 02:01.220
know many of you that subscribe to gaming podcasts and the like and and watch streams on Twitch

02:01.220 --> 02:08.060
probably stay somewhat afloat on gaming news so I don't like to think that I'm reporting the news

02:08.060 --> 02:12.140
here at orange launch radio but we definitely want to discuss it with those of you guys in chat

02:12.140 --> 02:16.660
because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks Network twitch TV

02:16.660 --> 02:21.180
slash vog network that's VOG Network six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern every Sunday night

02:21.180 --> 02:27.020
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show so I'm sure a lot of you have heard about this already you've

02:27.020 --> 02:32.300
heard one thing or another if you didn't hear it in the gaming blogs or social media or what have

02:32.300 --> 02:36.740
you you probably heard about it maybe in some mainstream news because that is how big this

02:36.740 --> 02:43.500
story has gotten this story had senators from the United States commenting on it it's that big a

02:43.500 --> 02:48.700
deal what am I talking about of course I'm talking about this situation with Blizzard and the player

02:48.700 --> 02:54.380
that they banned so Blizzard of course as you probably know suspended one of their competitive

02:54.380 --> 03:00.020
players after a hearthstone competition the name of the player blitz chung is kind of the online

03:00.260 --> 03:07.820
handle of the player and he was in a grandmasters Asia-pacific post-match interview and as he was

03:07.820 --> 03:11.460
kind of wrapping up the interview and said goodnight goodbye that type of thing he said

03:11.460 --> 03:17.580
liberate Hong Kong revolution of our age now if you don't know what's going on in the world at

03:17.580 --> 03:24.860
large there's a lot of protests going on in Hong Kong Hong Kong was under British rule for quite

03:24.860 --> 03:32.420
some time up until you're wrong but it was about 10 15 years ago and I'm sorry I don't know the

03:32.420 --> 03:37.380
year off it was I think more recent than that I think definitely within the last decade well see

03:37.380 --> 03:42.060
here's here's what comes to mind so you guys I'd say you guys here in studio not you guys out there

03:42.060 --> 03:48.140
but you guys remember my ex was from Hong Kong right so he a big reason why I think his family

03:48.140 --> 03:53.820
kind of relocated was because of that handoff that was coming up so it handed off from British rule

03:53.820 --> 04:01.540
to Chinese rule long story short and I am greatly simplifying things 97 so my bad okay so it was

04:01.540 --> 04:07.380
about 20 years and so I'm greatly simplifying things so I apologize but I do you know I do

04:07.380 --> 04:12.780
want to get through the show tonight the people in Hong Kong don't necessarily want to be under

04:12.780 --> 04:17.380
Chinese rule anymore so the people of Hong Kong are kind of speaking up and they would like to

04:17.380 --> 04:22.100
kind of be their own you know country basically I'm really really simplifying a lot of things so

04:22.100 --> 04:28.100
I again please don't feel the need to call me out because I'm openly admitting I'm taking some some

04:28.100 --> 04:34.940
shortcuts here but that has people voicing you know obviously their opposition to wanting to

04:34.940 --> 04:40.340
stay a part of China and wanting to be liberated as you can imagine this is very controversial

04:40.340 --> 04:46.940
within China if you want to go back 20 years now I don't know about you guys or our folks that are

04:46.940 --> 04:50.980
listening but I remember do you guys remember when they were having those free Tibet concerts

04:51.540 --> 04:56.940
to bet and freedom stuff that was kind of an issue where Tibet also under Chinese really it was almost

04:56.940 --> 05:04.500
like kind of a similar ish and again I'm greatly simplifying type of thing there so you know China

05:04.500 --> 05:11.380
has controversy China doesn't have things like the First Amendment for example right we have the

05:11.380 --> 05:18.500
freedom of speech and if I want to sit here and say Donald Trump sucks donkey dick I can say that

05:18.500 --> 05:23.220
because of the First Amendment would protect me because I can openly criticize the president and

05:23.220 --> 05:28.700
I may or may not have done that a few times on this very program right China you don't have such

05:28.700 --> 05:34.680
freedoms right and we kind of know that the internet is locked down a lot in China as well

05:34.680 --> 05:39.780
right there's a lot of websites and a lot of things you can access in China I'd imagine twitch is

05:39.780 --> 05:44.900
probably one of those websites I don't know that for a fact but I can only imagine because twitch

05:44.940 --> 05:50.420
has open speech running rampantly it's likely a website that they probably don't care for in

05:50.420 --> 05:57.420
China so anyway that's a little bit of the oversimplified history lesson as to why why

05:57.420 --> 06:02.540
would somebody want to say this on a live stream why would somebody want to go here and why is this

06:02.540 --> 06:08.100
such a hot-button button political issue because there are many individuals in Hong Kong who don't

06:08.180 --> 06:16.700
want to be under Chinese rule anymore China feels very differently about the issue okay so what

06:16.700 --> 06:23.220
happened after this the stream went to an ad break very quickly and there was some harsh punishments

06:23.220 --> 06:30.140
dealt by Blizzard Blizzard mentioned that Blizz chung violated such section 6.1 of the competition

06:30.140 --> 06:35.580
rules which say that players cannot engage in any act that quote brings you into public disrepute

06:35.580 --> 06:40.500
offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages Blizzard image and so what

06:40.500 --> 06:47.700
was the punishment removal from the grandmasters surrendering of the prize money all of it and the

06:47.700 --> 06:54.220
two presenters even though they quickly kind of did this whole like they want to cover their faces

06:54.220 --> 06:59.300
like they they know what he just said is like oh shit they're like and they cut quickly to a

06:59.420 --> 07:07.060
commercial Blizzard immediately ceased working with both of those casters as well and this left

07:07.060 --> 07:15.540
a lot of people going wow does the punishment fit the crime I don't know about that and a lot of

07:15.540 --> 07:20.580
people were left very confused and very angry because there's a lot of people out there who

07:20.580 --> 07:26.100
also say if the people of Hong Kong want to be free then they ought to have a conversation

07:26.100 --> 07:32.660
about being free that's the way many many many people feel out there now here's the thing from

07:32.660 --> 07:37.580
and now I'm starting to interject some of my personal opinions here I can understand if

07:37.580 --> 07:44.380
Blizzard wants their competitors to not say controversial political statements about anything

07:44.380 --> 07:52.500
because they don't want to drag their game into you know politics it's really hard when you're

07:52.500 --> 07:58.180
competing in a worldwide market because not every country functions the same way I get that as part

07:58.180 --> 08:03.700
of follow-up to this you might have heard Riot Games basically has begged their professional

08:03.700 --> 08:09.980
players please do not bring up politics Riot Games is also owned by Tencent a Chinese company

08:09.980 --> 08:14.420
but I digress okay they they have asked their players please do not bring up these controversial

08:14.420 --> 08:19.620
political issues on stream so I can understand if you sign a contract as a player whether it's

08:19.620 --> 08:24.060
fair or not if you sign a contract as a player that says you will not talk about controversial

08:24.060 --> 08:29.300
political statements and you do then okay I understand why Blizzard felt the need to

08:29.300 --> 08:34.320
retaliate a little bit but I ask again does the punishment fit the crime because I'm not sure it

08:34.320 --> 08:41.180
did and I think that's where a lot of people were left I really don't understand how the casters are

08:41.180 --> 08:47.060
responsible for that when they're just giving the interview and that's a regular thing though in

08:47.060 --> 08:55.060
news old-school communist governments I mean really it is a standard demo yeah so where are

08:55.060 --> 08:59.260
we at now so I mean again I'm sure a lot of you are sitting there going but Blizzard has put out

08:59.260 --> 09:05.620
to say yes so after several days and this is the part a lot of money lost I'm sure yeah oh yeah

09:05.620 --> 09:11.940
this is the part that blew my mind it took them this happened on Monday right it took them five

09:11.940 --> 09:19.740
days Friday 530 Pacific or 830 Eastern like that's the time when the throwaway news comes

09:19.740 --> 09:27.260
out Friday at 530 Blizzard releases a statement and Blizzard says we're listening this this

09:27.260 --> 09:34.460
decision was not influenced by China and our relationships oh shit because many people out

09:34.460 --> 09:41.100
there were accusing Blizzard of you are up China's ass so much and you don't want to lose their

09:41.100 --> 09:46.260
business that you threw the baby out with the bathwater with not only this player but the two

09:46.260 --> 09:50.740
broadcasters and I gotta admit for me the two broadcasters with a part where I was like give

09:50.740 --> 09:56.740
me a fucking break they did not deserve that punishment that's still though mo for countries

09:56.740 --> 10:03.100
like China exactly and I think that's why many of us here in America because we have a different

10:03.100 --> 10:08.980
view on things because of you know we we have the Bill of Rights and our Constitution and so forth

10:08.980 --> 10:15.660
we're kind of seeing they're going this is not indicative of what our country would do and while

10:15.660 --> 10:21.580
you might argue well but it's a worldwide market this is an Asia term Blizzard still an American

10:21.580 --> 10:26.260
company right so I think that's why there's a lot of people that feel very strongly still about this

10:26.260 --> 10:33.660
so after what four or five long days and I couldn't believe it took this long Blizzard puts out the

10:33.660 --> 10:39.780
statement it's not China's thing we're gonna give the prize money back because under as a follow-up

10:39.780 --> 10:46.180
consideration it was determined that he didn't cheat he won the competition fair and square so

10:46.180 --> 10:53.220
why take away the prize money duh this is the thing we should have we asked you to that your

10:53.220 --> 10:59.820
player base kind of expected you to know at the beginning you took away the money why and we're

10:59.820 --> 11:04.860
gonna reduce the suspension to six months but then they they went so far as to still say it

11:04.860 --> 11:10.980
was the broadcasters responsibility to not let this conversation turn into politics and get

11:10.980 --> 11:17.820
political whatever they are says they are still suspended for six months it's still garbage it's

11:17.820 --> 11:23.620
horrible this is still I think a lot of I my theory as to why it took so long is that they

11:23.620 --> 11:29.180
were speaking with whoever their handlers were in in China to make sure that they could do something

11:29.220 --> 11:34.700
in a way that wouldn't damage their business dealings in China um I'm gonna sort of say yes

11:34.700 --> 11:40.220
to that I think it was legal departments that took it this long and all the legal hurdles namely

11:40.220 --> 11:47.100
Activision's legal hurdle this shit wouldn't happen under Mike Morhaime I said it this shit

11:47.100 --> 11:52.900
would not have happened under Mike Morhaime and it wouldn't happened when Activision wasn't in

11:52.900 --> 11:58.540
the picture and it's so frustrating as somebody who's been like such an advocate of Blizzard

11:58.540 --> 12:03.420
games in the past and so forth because it's like the Blizzard I know and love this is the harsh

12:03.420 --> 12:08.380
reality like you've kind of like seen it coming for a long time like the Activision bought Blizzard

12:08.380 --> 12:13.140
and then it's like Call of Duty was in the launcher and all this other stuff and but it's like the

12:13.140 --> 12:22.540
harsh reality is Blizzard is not that like on your side as the player they are not that we are just

12:22.540 --> 12:28.300
like you guys don't want a game and all this stuff if last year's Blizzcon didn't make that

12:28.300 --> 12:34.580
very apparent this whole scenario did because it's Activision's legal department it's Tencent's legal

12:34.580 --> 12:41.340
department that made this thing take so goddamn long so what do I think they should have done well

12:41.340 --> 12:47.420
for one this suspension should not have been as harsh as it was I would have been okay if they

12:47.420 --> 12:52.500
said you know what this blitzchung you signed a contract that said you would not get into

12:52.500 --> 12:57.060
politics because it makes things very complicated we're trying to do things in a world market so

12:57.060 --> 13:02.140
therefore we're gonna suspend you for three games and we're not doing any on-camera interviews with

13:02.140 --> 13:07.260
you for six months I think that would have been more appropriate right I don't know what do you

13:07.260 --> 13:12.940
guys think I mean because I can still understand Blizzard has to navigate tricky waters I get it

13:12.940 --> 13:21.380
but like what they did was like way above and beyond I'd be honest I mean if it were up to me

13:21.380 --> 13:25.980
personally like if I was the one who had to press the button I would have been like do nothing

13:25.980 --> 13:36.180
honestly that's what should have been done in a protected world however you know if anything I

13:36.180 --> 13:41.140
think Chinese politics is the biggest thing to blame that's it well for sure I don't mean to

13:41.140 --> 13:45.700
ignore you guys in chat we just have a lot going on here quest buster and chat says the apologies

13:45.700 --> 13:50.300
made to Western audiences into China were also very different from each other the one for China

13:50.300 --> 13:55.540
promised to uphold national dignity yeah there was an interesting statement on a Chinese is it is

13:55.540 --> 14:00.340
it why bow way bow I'm sorry I don't know the name off top my head but there's a Chinese social

14:00.340 --> 14:06.780
network out there and it's way bow way bow thank you um a account that is supposedly blizzards

14:06.780 --> 14:13.860
Chinese account made a very pro China statement I don't know how else to summarize it was very

14:13.860 --> 14:17.780
like you know we're gonna make these decisions that uphold national dignity and because of course

14:17.780 --> 14:23.500
they did it was it was kind of like it was really a fuck you to everything that was going on over

14:23.500 --> 14:29.260
here with like the protests and people canceling their accounts I know many longtime Blizzard fans

14:29.260 --> 14:36.660
that are like canceling their World of Warcraft accounts I'm including me I uninstalled World

14:36.700 --> 14:41.700
Warcraft today after I unsubbed about two days ago you guys know I've been talking a lot about

14:41.700 --> 14:46.860
World of Warcraft classic and I've been talking about World of Warcraft on this show I unsubbed

14:46.860 --> 14:57.100
and I think a lot of it has to do with kind of that harsh reality that we're in that Blizzard

14:57.100 --> 15:06.460
is now on the same level as EA and I feel sorry I just I'm processing a lot of information as I

15:06.460 --> 15:11.500
think we all are because it's it's so weird like it's just a fucking game but I think for many

15:11.500 --> 15:16.540
people World of Warcraft and in particular and especially you know other other certain things

15:16.540 --> 15:22.300
like overwatch and Blizzcon stuff too Blizzard has historically done a very good job building

15:22.300 --> 15:30.100
communities in these games like people with their World of Warcraft guilds like that is family to

15:30.100 --> 15:41.580
some people right so it's so extraordinarily frustrating to watch that house that your family

15:41.580 --> 15:50.220
is residing in slowly and slowly get turned into a Starbucks I don't know how else to describe even

15:50.220 --> 15:56.780
Starbucks has more user friendly you know what I'm getting at though yeah it's the corporation

15:56.820 --> 16:04.700
coming in and transforming that store being taken over by a Walmart that safe space is suddenly

16:04.700 --> 16:10.420
transforming you know what I mean and I feel really bad for people that have spent a lot of

16:10.420 --> 16:16.060
money to go to Blizzcon this year shit the girls on this network at girls gone wow they're over in

16:16.060 --> 16:21.940
the UK they're going to Blizzcon for the first time this year and this shit has to go down that

16:21.940 --> 16:25.860
is extraordinarily frustrating and I'm not gonna speak for them they have their own show and they

16:25.860 --> 16:29.980
can talk about this or not talk about this whatever they choose to do but I can just look

16:29.980 --> 16:35.260
at people like that and people that are you know out there and you know playing this and they want

16:35.260 --> 16:39.260
to go to Blizzcon this event because it's to see their families and to see the people that they

16:39.260 --> 16:45.300
play these games online with and to have all this happen is so frustrating and then I think about

16:45.300 --> 16:53.140
the various people I've met over the years that work for Blizzard and I know several and I can't

16:53.180 --> 16:59.220
speak for them either and I'm not even about to try but I can say y'all seen those pictures online

16:59.220 --> 17:05.100
of the statue at Blizzard headquarters where it says every voice matters and it's covered up with

17:05.100 --> 17:10.100
paper by the employees who did that and you can see the people standing around the statue the

17:10.100 --> 17:13.960
employees because you got to be an employee to get in there with their umbrellas and what's the

17:13.960 --> 17:19.540
umbrella a sign of that's a that's a symbol that goes with the yeah the liberate Hong Kong movement

17:19.540 --> 17:26.420
so while I can't speak for the people I know I can let those pictures do the talking and so I'm

17:26.420 --> 17:33.860
extraordinarily frustrated for them that this shit happens on an executive level it's it's horrible

17:33.860 --> 17:41.380
what's happening you're watching this company that you knew and loved so much just fall apart and I

17:41.380 --> 17:46.100
know other people out there that are like you know what this doesn't bother me I just want to play

17:46.100 --> 17:52.060
the game I respect people's right to protest but I'm not saying people eating a chick-fil-a well

17:52.060 --> 17:57.580
here's the thing and you know what you can choose what you do and you don't want to do and that is

17:57.580 --> 18:04.140
absolutely fine to be honest but I think even somebody who's somebody in that position could

18:04.140 --> 18:08.820
kind of recognize where it's very frustrating for a lot of us you know what I mean I can understand

18:08.820 --> 18:15.620
you know if you bought overwatch you want to get your money's worth and keep playing it I get that

18:15.660 --> 18:21.540
right I mean that's that seems reasonable to me but I didn't see a need to continue paying a

18:21.540 --> 18:27.900
monthly fee for World of Warcraft anymore and if I was gonna get overwatch on the switch I don't

18:27.900 --> 18:34.100
think I will now I'll reevaluate my thinking in six months since that's the time frame we've

18:34.100 --> 18:40.260
decided to settle on that's where my head's at right now any comments from you guys before I go

18:40.260 --> 18:45.740
to chat I'm probably not gonna re-up it all ever I had been considering it now I'm not although

18:45.740 --> 18:50.660
right now I'm be honest I'm not really gonna re-up on any MMOs right now just because I don't have

18:50.660 --> 18:57.540
the time for it but I had been floating it around in my head whether or not I wanted to and this

18:57.540 --> 19:05.460
pretty much cinched it for me I went went in and uninstalled basically all my Blizzard games I

19:05.460 --> 19:09.420
didn't install well because I was using the wow model viewer but actually now I'm gonna remove

19:09.420 --> 19:15.020
that because I and I have to apologize to psychic for this but I'm not gonna continue with webcomic

19:15.020 --> 19:21.900
using the well models again I'm not gonna do it I'm changing switching my directions because I

19:21.900 --> 19:25.980
don't want to give them any advertising I don't want to support a company that's gonna behave this

19:25.980 --> 19:29.740
way because just because they do it once and then think six months from now people are gonna forget

19:29.740 --> 19:34.660
about it or oh we've changed this in six months they're gonna go back and do the same shit you

19:34.660 --> 19:38.060
know there's already talks about protests at Blizzcon and all this stuff but I want to be

19:38.060 --> 19:41.220
clear on something because this is this is a really weird thing that's happening because

19:41.220 --> 19:46.640
there are people it's one of these weird or not when we live in such a divisive world where we

19:46.640 --> 19:52.260
have you know folks on the left and folks on the right really going at each other right folks on

19:52.260 --> 19:57.500
the left and folks on the right on Twitter kind of all seem to agree what Blizzard did shitty so

19:57.500 --> 20:03.380
it's weird that there's this agreement going on there but some of those like shitty extreme

20:03.380 --> 20:10.340
Twitter people are now getting involved with this whole thing and I just want to make very clear it

20:10.340 --> 20:20.660
is not okay period to harass Blizzard employees to harass Blizzard fans to harass Blizzard content

20:20.660 --> 20:24.580
creators who decide that because they need to still make money to pay their rent they're gonna

20:24.580 --> 20:31.140
continue to create content it is not okay to harass those people period we've got that same

20:31.140 --> 20:37.380
thing going on with the PG&E some some one of the PG&E workers got murdered over something that was

20:37.380 --> 20:42.780
a decision over the company oh my god that's disgusting that's disgusting you know and it's

20:42.780 --> 20:50.060
like this is it is not their fault so y'all I know our OLR listeners and viewers are good enough to

20:50.060 --> 20:56.980
know better but I just need feel the need to say it like it's not okay to harass the employees okay

20:57.020 --> 21:04.300
but it is okay to peacefully protest with signs so that you're seen it is okay to peacefully protest

21:04.300 --> 21:09.220
with management it is okay to do those types of things and and you know if there's a peaceful

21:09.220 --> 21:15.260
protest that's gonna go down at Blizzcon but let the attendees in because some of them came a long

21:15.260 --> 21:20.460
way and have paid a lot of money to have this be the year the Blizzard shit on I will tell you one

21:20.460 --> 21:27.820
thing that does sort of break the purpose of a protest is that civil disobedience in and of

21:27.820 --> 21:32.340
itself is meant to inconvenience the population into paying attention to an adverse situation

21:32.340 --> 21:37.900
that's the whole point of it that was why people you know here at pride while why the protesters

21:37.900 --> 21:45.580
were making a sort of a stockade around the the event it's because you know why people block you

21:45.580 --> 21:51.660
know the bridges in trying to protest for Black Lives Matter and many of the other charities out

21:51.660 --> 22:00.860
there is the fact that you don't get the kind of attention and immediate action that happens as

22:00.860 --> 22:06.740
you get when you make it a inconvenience for other people especially today we're way too

22:06.740 --> 22:13.180
distracted by our modern conveniences how easy is it to say oh well the world is terrible right now

22:13.180 --> 22:19.020
I'm gonna go play a game which is fine every so often but when you cut yourself off from

22:19.020 --> 22:24.100
participating in things that even they don't affect your life immediately they're still going

22:24.100 --> 22:29.460
to affect people that you know it still affects the world that you have to be a part of and just

22:29.460 --> 22:35.620
pushing it away I say oh they can do this peacefully where no one can see them versus

22:35.620 --> 22:40.220
no they're gonna be in your face they're gonna bring the attention to you the people that need

22:40.220 --> 22:45.140
to be inconvenienced are the executives do you want Raven and EJ to not be able to go to bliss

22:45.140 --> 22:50.860
con when they have waited years they can't go you know they're gonna the thing is is that to do it

22:50.860 --> 22:55.780
legally they're they're not gonna be able to block any entrances and exits so that's not gonna be a

22:55.780 --> 23:00.940
problem especially in a big places where this is gonna be I mean not a problem I mean even bringing

23:00.940 --> 23:08.420
that up is like that that can't happen but the thing that I'm saying is that if you inconvenience

23:08.420 --> 23:14.300
the people attending it directly inconveniences the people making money off of them because

23:14.300 --> 23:19.820
there's gonna be complaints there's going to be letters written it's going to spawn more action

23:19.820 --> 23:26.660
I kind of think the action is gonna really have to happen way before Blizzcon quite frankly like

23:26.660 --> 23:32.860
and I think like if we were to put our finger on why are we upset like let's let's put our finger

23:32.860 --> 23:40.180
clearly on that why are we mad at Blizzard what's the why here because for me it was the in bit well

23:40.180 --> 23:44.820
obviously the original action was way too extreme that's part of it but for me like what really

23:44.820 --> 23:50.660
broke the camel's back for me was how long it took them to respond to that it was straight-up

23:50.660 --> 23:56.180
disrespectful in my opinion there are two statements here in chat that I agree with sure

23:56.180 --> 24:00.740
I'm for SSJ 100 Matt says Blizzard is going to look at the week one sales of overwatch switch to

24:00.740 --> 24:06.020
see if players really do care about the issue and then act-deaf says Blizzard will still exist it

24:06.020 --> 24:11.700
won't go under anytime soon but what but what we do to support the free Hong Kong movement will speak

24:11.700 --> 24:16.580
louder than any words or statement we make and that's a big thing actually that I'd really like

24:16.580 --> 24:22.940
to see happen is that while people are taking their money away from Blizzard and hitting them

24:22.940 --> 24:29.060
and in the pocketbook you know the big place that that counts we also need to be putting you know

24:29.060 --> 24:33.860
for taking those resources from Blizzard why don't we put those resources into a charity that

24:33.860 --> 24:37.540
supports the things that Blizzard seems to be trying to squash even if it's just indirectly

24:37.540 --> 24:44.420
you know why don't we put that support in with with free Hong Kong why don't we help them with

24:44.420 --> 24:49.100
protesting efforts why don't we help them with the materials that they need to continue to fight for

24:49.100 --> 24:54.220
their freedom you know especially coming from people in America where that's pretty much we

24:54.220 --> 24:59.700
were raised on being so completely religiously stupid that we have to oppress all other religions

24:59.700 --> 25:05.900
and out of saying fuck you to other government powers so why can't we at least help them with

25:05.900 --> 25:12.300
the fuck you part just saying I I would super agree that the most effective thing you can do

25:12.300 --> 25:19.140
is to stop giving Blizzard money if you disagree you know cancel your wow accounts don't buy

25:19.140 --> 25:24.180
overwatch on switch and those are the things that I plan to do for a little while while we wait and

25:24.180 --> 25:30.660
see you know what Blizzard is gonna do is remember the physical version of overwatch on the switch

25:30.660 --> 25:37.140
is actually just a download code so just you know but you get a box and there was a comment as to

25:37.140 --> 25:42.660
the the week one commentary or you know the thing is is that the majority of people who are going

25:42.660 --> 25:47.940
to get it will get it week one and that's where the bulk of the sales for any kind of game movie

25:47.940 --> 25:53.900
entertainment comes out that's when it happens that and Black Friday or Cyber Monday you know

25:53.900 --> 26:01.220
the big that's going to be the benchmark for if people do care about it because if it's something

26:01.220 --> 26:06.860
that they care about why not why aren't they gonna get it day one it's digital why why you know why

26:06.860 --> 26:11.820
wait if if they want it they're gonna get it and I think that we need to you know make sure that

26:11.820 --> 26:21.020
people really do if they hate what Blizzard's doing they need to have some integrity and stick

26:21.020 --> 26:27.260
to it you know and I know that we bring that we brought up other boycotts you know and some of

26:27.260 --> 26:31.620
them are like oh well this is a minor thing it's not gonna really affect the the whole thing but

26:31.620 --> 26:35.700
like in the case of I'm just use this as an example in chick-fil-a it was recently discovered

26:35.700 --> 26:39.940
that they were funding missionaries who are going over and working with governments that are setting

26:39.940 --> 26:47.580
up executions for gay people on file you know do you want to fund that kind of thing do you want to

26:47.580 --> 26:52.940
contribute to this if the answer is no then you don't eat there anymore or you know with Blizzard

26:52.940 --> 26:59.700
if you don't want to fund them you know just completely giving in to the dictates of China

26:59.700 --> 27:03.620
then you don't support them anymore you don't support this activity you don't support these

27:03.620 --> 27:12.260
business practices if you don't like but the joke let me if you don't support like for example what

27:12.260 --> 27:16.620
GOP is doing you don't vote for them you don't support businesses that contribute to that you

27:16.660 --> 27:23.340
know I'm saying that way you put your money where your integrity is but where do we draw the line

27:23.340 --> 27:27.660
because I feel like you can have a reason to boycott everything I mean in this same bucket

27:27.660 --> 27:32.980
people are talking about they're mad at Apple because Apple shut down an app where Hong Kong

27:32.980 --> 27:37.820
protesters were using it to know where police were Tiffany and company had an advertisement

27:37.820 --> 27:44.220
where it looked like a woman was covering her eye and the China folk China government found that

27:44.220 --> 27:48.740
offensive so Tiffany and company had to pull that ad and there's more examples of this too

27:48.740 --> 27:53.340
specifically with the China and Hong Kong issue so my point is like where do you draw the line

27:53.340 --> 27:59.580
because I feel like for me with Blizzard specifically I think it's because you have this

27:59.580 --> 28:06.180
very kind of like tangible punishment type of thing that happened and you have this big shift

28:06.180 --> 28:11.340
in a company that you've supported for so long that's kind of happened and I think that's why

28:11.340 --> 28:22.260
this one I feel like I really want to do something about this particular one I I think in cases like

28:22.260 --> 28:27.780
for you know if it's something like an app you do have to do with international legalities there's

28:27.780 --> 28:34.220
apps that we can't put out in the US for example for any service because they break federal law

28:34.220 --> 28:42.460
you know I think that's a completely different story than going in for an active punishment of

28:42.460 --> 28:48.540
a person for for using their voice that's a completely different scenario so you have to

28:48.540 --> 28:54.220
kind of pick and choose for you not necessarily for me I have to look at the big picture you know

28:54.220 --> 29:02.020
if you were dealing with you know say that you have X bad thing happen in one country but say

29:02.020 --> 29:08.300
you have them doing different things in other places to offset it you know oh you know for

29:08.300 --> 29:14.860
Blizzard this was a completely punitive action they took against a party that went above and

29:14.860 --> 29:18.620
beyond what should have been what should have been done and the fact that they're defending

29:18.620 --> 29:24.020
their actions is is also a completely different story too we have something more actively showing

29:24.020 --> 29:31.780
the culture of the company in something like the app for example when you were also though

29:31.780 --> 29:39.460
dealing with a company that that donates to companies that are not companies but organizations

29:39.460 --> 29:45.220
that are going for international you know freedom attempts freedom of speech health care that's a

29:45.220 --> 29:51.700
completely different story it doesn't mean that oh all things that China does are great it means

29:51.700 --> 29:57.260
yeah our hand is tied on this one but we're doing other things to offset it you know for example if

29:57.260 --> 30:03.780
you're dealing with you know a company that's out there actively trying to you know end an

30:03.780 --> 30:09.440
entire group of people across the world yeah giving children books is gonna be very small

30:09.440 --> 30:17.980
potatoes in regards to what could end up being seen very well as close to I'll put this way just

30:17.980 --> 30:24.460
Nazi actions you know killing entire groups of people what we have going on in Syria right now

30:24.460 --> 30:30.340
is absolutely horrendous and it's along those same lines it's an active punitive action that

30:30.340 --> 30:36.900
is killing other people I'm to try to wrap this all up and move on to other topics from the week

30:36.900 --> 30:40.740
because there has been other gaming news this week isn't it interesting how you know I think

30:40.740 --> 30:45.940
there's been folks that's been critical of this program in the past you know you and me specifically

30:45.940 --> 30:51.900
because gaming and politics should mix type of thing keep the political talk on the gaming

30:51.900 --> 30:58.740
podcast but isn't it funny that here we are now where it's like we don't have a choice we have to

30:58.740 --> 31:04.460
talk about it because it's impacting the industry like big time so it's kind of like you you you have

31:04.460 --> 31:09.540
to be aware of this stuff and you know make your decisions and so forth it's just it's just

31:09.540 --> 31:15.660
interesting to me that it's like because Blizzard deals in international markets and so forth I get

31:15.660 --> 31:22.740
it they have to walk a fine line I do understand that but isn't it interesting that you know now

31:22.740 --> 31:28.540
there's a lot of gamers that are talking about politics essentially in the fact that we sort of

31:28.540 --> 31:33.980
feel that this punishment didn't fit the crime for just speaking out on how many people in the

31:33.980 --> 31:41.060
country of Hong Kong feel so um anyhow I was looking for some other comments in chat so they're

31:41.220 --> 31:47.300
talking let's see see a Tiberian chat is kind of talking about the you know boycotting a lot of

31:47.300 --> 31:51.500
different things there's an episode of the show Adam ruins everything it's a show I've never seen

31:51.500 --> 31:56.260
to be honest I love that show that talks about that for a little bit called Adam ruins a plate

31:56.260 --> 32:01.220
of nachos which I think is the whole like you know every company that contributed to the nachos

32:01.220 --> 32:09.340
is trash type of thing so there's there are some things on that show that that are factually

32:09.380 --> 32:14.380
incorrect so I'm just gonna leave there you know how you ruin a plate of nachos you put olives in

32:14.380 --> 32:22.620
it actually you've been rather quiet this little segment how are you doing well you don't really

32:22.620 --> 32:31.940
play Blizzard games exactly I'm not affected by this I don't play any of these games so it's fine

32:31.940 --> 32:41.220
no I I've overwatch I haven't played those for a few years so yeah I mean I don't know I I don't

32:41.220 --> 32:46.220
have time for an MMO so that it's not like I would quit it for political reasons but I just

32:46.220 --> 32:55.020
don't have time so I mean the fact that Activision Blizzard is doing something shitty well hello it's

32:55.020 --> 33:02.860
a day of the week so I mean just remember Call of Duty's right around the corner you get your

33:02.860 --> 33:09.020
whole whole nother fill of Activision Blizzard doing shitty stuff some other comments from chat

33:09.020 --> 33:14.060
captain spike says Rob you're gay everything you do touches the political yeah fair and Bobby

33:14.060 --> 33:19.180
Blackwell says surprisingly no talk about the gay guilds name band oh yeah thanks for reminding me

33:19.180 --> 33:23.460
because that was the thing too that was honestly it was one of the things where it was like I was

33:23.460 --> 33:27.860
already mad at this other thing is like when I heard about this gay guild name getting banned

33:27.860 --> 33:33.540
type thing I was just like what else do we want to throw on the fire let's just you know and

33:33.540 --> 33:38.740
another one why not let's just let's let's do the airing of the grievances shall we like it's just

33:38.740 --> 33:44.780
but if you didn't hear I think it was in Wow classic there was a guild name called gay boys

33:44.780 --> 33:50.940
so many people reported it that the name got stripped now in the essence of fairness it was

33:50.940 --> 33:55.740
restored but it does go a long way in talking about why are these automated things why is it

33:55.740 --> 33:59.780
automated why isn't it looked at by somebody because by doing an action like that it makes

33:59.780 --> 34:05.740
it look like you endorse it whether you really do as a company or not etc etc etc quite honestly

34:05.740 --> 34:10.940
again you're so mad about the one thing it's like that oh this just add that to the fire

34:10.940 --> 34:19.380
unlike any other week I probably would have been like well that was a bad look but at least they

34:19.380 --> 34:25.020
made it right and maybe they'll learn something in the future but this week it was like fuck them

34:25.020 --> 34:35.100
it's it's hard it's difficult it's it sucks again to use the analogy that I use all of the time on

34:35.100 --> 34:41.340
this program when we're talking about how can you love video games and love gaming companies yet be

34:41.340 --> 34:48.060
so critical of them it's like Tyra Banks infamously did on that season of America's next pop model

34:48.100 --> 34:54.940
where she yells be quiet Tiffany we were rooting for you we were all rooting for you how dare you

34:54.940 --> 35:06.020
and that quite essentially sums up how I feel about this whole situation with Blizzard let's

35:06.020 --> 35:11.780
see going to some other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network quest buster says

35:11.780 --> 35:17.060
Blizzard just keeps throwing logs on that fire slidekick says let's start a guild in another

35:17.060 --> 35:23.060
game called gay boys you know it's funny like I've gotten like two people sending me private

35:23.060 --> 35:29.700
messages asking me like so how do I sign up for Final Fantasy 14 and I don't know if like Final

35:29.700 --> 35:36.780
Fantasy 14 necessarily wants to just I mean it's hard it's hard to say like I I realize I'm saying

35:36.780 --> 35:40.340
they don't want to get all this business because of what's happening with Blizzard I I but what

35:40.340 --> 35:43.660
I'm trying to say is that I think Square Enix would quite frankly like to stay out of this

35:43.660 --> 35:48.340
issue but the reality is Final Fantasy 14 a while have a lot in common so there's a lot of people

35:48.340 --> 35:53.540
that are like well now's a good time to go looking for good time to go play port night oh wait well

35:53.540 --> 35:58.460
it's funny because actually since you bring up epic epic was one of those companies it felt a

35:58.460 --> 36:03.020
little bit opportunistic a little bit especially for a company that also has holdings intense or

36:03.020 --> 36:09.140
held of them by Tencent but it was a little weird that they came out said well we wouldn't punish

36:09.300 --> 36:14.620
players for what they believe in nobody asked you Tim Sweeney sit the fuck down have a seat

36:14.620 --> 36:20.500
I made my own comment back God shut up I was like I was pretty much like let me know when you're

36:20.500 --> 36:25.820
actually treating your employees better let me know when you have a shopping cart I think like

36:25.820 --> 36:32.940
yeah go seriously go worry about your own shit no one asked you Tim no one asked anyway Bobby

36:33.020 --> 36:38.540
Blackwell says Tim Sweeney opportunistic on Twitter say it ain't so yeah pretty much I

36:38.540 --> 36:43.700
like st100 Matt says here's the moment Rob is talking about I love that it's bookmarked on

36:43.700 --> 36:49.980
YouTube yes it should there there really there is there is definitely like a reality television

36:49.980 --> 36:56.700
Bible that you should assemble on YouTube let's see we should definitely have that would be in

36:56.700 --> 37:01.540
there there would be a whole book of New York where you would have the good morning good morning

37:01.540 --> 37:07.060
good morning good morning not you you can choke let's see what else would be in the way there's

37:07.060 --> 37:12.740
there's a lot of things that would be in there there'd be a whole book of Drag Race as well

37:12.740 --> 37:20.420
absolutely my wife would like to add I'm not doing this with him today well what you want to

37:20.420 --> 37:26.540
do isn't necessarily what you're gonna do oh yeah oh yes thank you there would be a whole

37:26.540 --> 37:32.980
chapter 1 verse 1 of the book of Drag Race I never had a sugar daddy if I wanted a sugar daddy

37:32.980 --> 37:36.460
yes I could go out and get one because I'm what bitch sickening you could never have a sugar daddy

37:36.460 --> 37:45.020
because you are not that kind of girl anyway now I'm getting off topic but the reality is these

37:45.020 --> 37:52.860
monologues they shift our thoughts and feelings oh yes thank you so I kick yes the the classic

37:52.860 --> 38:01.180
Whitney kiss my ass yes the book of being Bobby Brown yes all right moving on I'm glad we could

38:01.180 --> 38:06.860
end it on some laughs let's move on to a less serious topic our gaming weeks the types of video

38:06.860 --> 38:11.140
games that we have been playing this week so let's talk about our gaming weeks dark soccer how was

38:11.140 --> 38:15.900
your gaming week I'm still waiting for a Detroit to become human to come out on PC of course I'm

38:15.900 --> 38:19.940
gonna be replacing my PC at the end of the year so I have to play it quick I thought it was on

38:19.940 --> 38:29.780
the epic store no if I'd want the city of Detroit becoming human stop it the game's great I've been

38:29.780 --> 38:35.460
playing pinball wizard on Apple arcade and it really annoyed me at first but now I actually

38:35.460 --> 38:42.500
super like it I also started sayonara wild hearts which is so great I want the soundtrack for it

38:42.500 --> 38:47.740
like so much like I love that rendition of Claire de lune from the first level it's on Spotify and

38:47.740 --> 38:53.780
I imagine if it's there it's got to be on Apple music and all the other ones too yeah I was also

38:53.780 --> 38:58.900
let me look at it again because I you know of course I was playing my I'm gonna be quitting

38:58.900 --> 39:02.860
the Ragnarok game but I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing because I just want Animal

39:02.860 --> 39:11.420
Crossing to be out I also started hexaflip which is another interesting little puzzler I still

39:11.420 --> 39:16.340
don't like various day life I gave it one more try and I still don't like it so that's pretty

39:16.340 --> 39:23.020
much what I've been playing all right we'll move on to Loki how was your gaming week I played

39:23.020 --> 39:31.220
Borderlands 3 so I played quite a bit of that and that's pretty much it is really just Borderlands

39:31.220 --> 39:38.180
cuz I've been trying to finish it good enjoying it it's more Borderlands you know more more

39:38.180 --> 39:42.380
Borderlands over again I have not started over because I haven't actually finished the first

39:42.420 --> 39:50.020
time through I don't know where I'm at yeah I think I'm like 60% through the game but that's

39:50.020 --> 39:56.140
good I mean it I think that they oversold the diversity of their because one of the things they

39:56.140 --> 39:59.700
talked about was like oh yeah there's so many different planets and it's all very diverse and

39:59.700 --> 40:06.080
stuff like I kind of remember all this stuff from Borderlands 2 this all looks very similar just now

40:06.080 --> 40:12.480
it's on different planets and I don't know it's still good though I mean don't get me wrong I like

40:12.480 --> 40:17.960
all the old characters coming back as well that's kind of a thing that they didn't Borderlands 2 as

40:17.960 --> 40:24.520
well so yeah I'm digging it I actually sat through and because I haven't played through the pre sequel

40:24.520 --> 40:30.040
or tales from Borderlands so I like some of the characters I didn't know who they were so I went

40:30.040 --> 40:33.080
through YouTube and watched like kind of like here's all the things you need to know before

40:33.080 --> 40:38.480
you play Borderlands 2 or 3 you know so I got caught up on what the pre sequel was and so I

40:38.480 --> 40:42.080
didn't need to go back and play the pre sequel because that looks pretty good so there's that

40:42.080 --> 40:48.400
and I worked on my game some I'm gonna work on a lot this week so it'll be good awesome my gaming

40:48.400 --> 40:53.960
week I had kind of a busy gaming week I actually spent most of my gaming week on the cell phone

40:53.960 --> 40:58.600
game I've talked a lot about on this show Ingress so you might see my shirt I'm wearing kind of an

40:58.600 --> 41:03.000
interesting shirt today it says Umbra Sacramento epicenter of enlightenment so this was like our

41:03.000 --> 41:10.080
team merchandise or swag supporting this weekend's anomaly event so Ingress which is the game of

41:10.080 --> 41:14.120
course by the people who did Pokemon go it's where all of the pokey stops and all that come from

41:14.120 --> 41:20.160
although not on our show world tonight but they replaced operation portal recon with a site called

41:20.160 --> 41:25.160
Niantic Wayfarer which in many ways is great because now you can pick what submissions get

41:25.160 --> 41:30.200
prioritized so forth but here's the thing about Wayfarer it's not Ingress art it's mixed art like

41:30.200 --> 41:35.160
Pokemon goes in there too which you can infer they're going to open up OPR and that type of

41:35.160 --> 41:39.760
stuff or now it's Wayfarer they're gonna open that up for Pokemon go players eventually so it'll be

41:39.760 --> 41:43.560
interesting well good I can resubmit the stuff that I've sent because I haven't heard anything

41:43.560 --> 41:48.040
since May and you should log in to Wayfarer because if you haven't heard anything it may

41:48.040 --> 41:52.360
have actually been rejected or maybe it was even approved and you never got an email because you

41:52.360 --> 41:56.520
can go back and look at all your old submissions now finally that's the thing you can do so yeah

41:56.520 --> 42:01.880
you should check that out I'll have to do that now yeah I do that so anyway but I digress a

42:01.880 --> 42:06.320
little bit the Ingress was the original kind of player versus player resistance versus enlightenment

42:06.320 --> 42:12.960
game where a lot of that those landmarks came from so to try to make a long story short there

42:12.960 --> 42:20.120
was a kind of a tournament a big event sort of like maybe like go fest in Chicago except to

42:20.120 --> 42:25.280
remember that like Ingress probably has like 1% of the player base if that a Pokemon go but they

42:25.280 --> 42:30.600
had that in Sacramento was the West Coast so there were three events in the Americas this

42:30.600 --> 42:35.400
weekend at least unlike Pokemon go they do multiple cities so this weekend there were

42:35.400 --> 42:42.320
events in Sacramento on the West Coast Brooklyn New York on the East Coast had also was yesterday

42:42.320 --> 42:46.920
and in the middle was actually Guadalajara in Mexico so those were kind of the three sites

42:46.920 --> 42:51.840
that went yesterday so what happened is that members from the resistance and members from

42:51.840 --> 42:57.520
the light and all kind of converge and they do a live battle for three hours which consisted of

42:57.520 --> 43:01.840
this time it was about who can control portals during certain measurements who can make the

43:01.840 --> 43:06.600
longest link pathing between the portals at certain measurement times who could get the

43:06.600 --> 43:09.960
most unique portal hacks and then there was a cypher game that's kind of like an escape room

43:09.960 --> 43:15.880
type of thing that you like the decoder game that was worth bonus points so my team won yay

43:15.880 --> 43:20.600
because I play on the enlightenment the green side and we did a great job and to give you an

43:20.600 --> 43:24.720
idea about how many people I don't have any official numbers Niantic doesn't give official

43:24.720 --> 43:27.840
numbers I don't know how many people were registered or whatever but people that were

43:27.840 --> 43:32.040
watching the map and all the little like peak players that come up said it was about 300 players

43:32.040 --> 43:37.880
on the green team 200 players on the blue team we're here so there are about 500 players actively

43:37.880 --> 43:41.920
playing in the anomalies because that's a pretty that's a pretty decent turnout for something like

43:41.920 --> 43:47.960
that and I know there was there was at least one girl on her team from Taiwan who was here and there

43:47.960 --> 43:52.240
was a couple from like I think there's one from Sweden so we had some visitors that came a long

43:52.240 --> 43:57.800
way to play so that was that was fun but there was a lot of prep that went into that as you can

43:57.800 --> 44:02.360
imagine when it comes to things like strategy and how that's all gonna work work yeah a lot of my

44:02.360 --> 44:07.600
week was focused on that so that was all yesterday and then today was kind of the cooldown mission

44:07.600 --> 44:12.400
day all factions can do it together it's an individual thing type of thing apparently mine

44:12.400 --> 44:19.200
still in queue oh I did withdraw the other one but it's still in queue and they have this upgrade

44:19.200 --> 44:23.960
next thing so I went ahead and did that I don't know what that's gonna do yeah so all right um

44:23.960 --> 44:29.320
let's see I was looking at some of the comments in chat act F said yeah there's talks about a pogo

44:29.320 --> 44:33.880
event next year in Mexico considering they've done some already in ingress yeah so I and

44:33.880 --> 44:37.200
Guadalajara is not the only city they've done in Mexico I mean that I think they've done one in

44:37.200 --> 44:41.520
they had to have done one in Mexico City I think there was one last year and so on I mean these

44:42.120 --> 44:46.840
events are all I missed an OLR last year because I went to one of these in Chicago so I've traveled

44:46.840 --> 44:54.720
for these myself and they're fun but I walked 23,000 steps yesterday I was very sore and very

44:54.720 --> 45:01.960
tired and I might be coming down with a cold as a result so I mean yeah there's a lot of that it

45:01.960 --> 45:07.160
wasn't just Ingers though that I was playing this week I also played so you know the whole I've been

45:07.200 --> 45:11.560
playing some how fancy 14 I was playing Wow Wow classic but with everything that happened I've

45:11.560 --> 45:16.800
just decided you know what I've been talking about that I kind of need to play less MMOs and catch

45:16.800 --> 45:23.120
up on my backlog anyway so I cancelled Wow we're talking about that but it finally made me get to

45:23.120 --> 45:28.080
my backlog or actually I should say a new game I added to my backlog because it was on sale for

45:28.080 --> 45:33.560
on PlayStation 4 for only $15 so I finally installed and started playing horizon zero

45:33.560 --> 45:38.480
dawn the complete edition I have a copy of that that I'm borrowing you should check it out if you

45:38.480 --> 45:43.760
haven't yet it's um it's okay the thing is I don't well see I know you are not the big fan of using

45:43.760 --> 45:50.280
like controllers because your wrist and so forth and there is like stealthy stuff and so forth but

45:50.280 --> 45:55.600
the game also one thing right off the bat you should know is that the game has five difficulty

45:55.600 --> 46:00.720
levels or maybe it's six but I think it's five so normal it's kind of like the middle one so

46:00.760 --> 46:05.320
I'm playing on easy mode which is one step lower well they have a bobby black wolf mode in the game

46:05.320 --> 46:09.240
they have one that's called story where it's like you don't even have to worry about fighting at all

46:09.240 --> 46:13.120
and that might be you know if you just want to experience the story and so forth that might be

46:13.120 --> 46:16.640
a way to do it without worrying about you know the controllers and all that stuff I'm playing it

46:16.640 --> 46:21.760
on easy just because I want to get a feel for the game mechanics but I just I want to get through

46:21.760 --> 46:25.720
the story and experience the game and get to my next game in the backlog if I like it a lot then

46:25.720 --> 46:30.640
I'll go back and do it on hard or what have you and I gotta say so far I mean I'm not that far in

46:30.640 --> 46:36.240
the game I got through the tutorial stages and I'm in the a little bit after that you don't want

46:36.240 --> 46:42.200
to say too much but I'm like level five so I'm very early on still but I'm really into it I will

46:42.200 --> 46:47.800
say this right off the bat the game is fucking gorgeous it is a gorgeous fucking game like just

46:47.800 --> 46:53.800
going through and I don't even have a 4k TV or an HDR capable TV and like if I had that stuff it

46:53.800 --> 47:00.000
would probably be even more good-looking but I've just been going through on my cheap old 1080p TV

47:00.000 --> 47:06.200
playing on my PlayStation 4 Pro and it looks great I didn't realize there was like an element of like

47:06.200 --> 47:11.280
kind of like electronics so it's like you're out in this big beautiful world but you have this

47:11.280 --> 47:15.800
little scanner device that makes like purple electronic lines type of stuff show up and you

47:15.800 --> 47:20.960
can scan there's a lot of like Metroid prime esque type of scanning that goes on that can give you

47:20.960 --> 47:27.240
some insight into story and things like that so and it looks really good like I thought the whole

47:27.240 --> 47:32.280
game was like outdoors but no there's some areas where you go indoors it's kind of creepy and some

47:32.280 --> 47:37.520
caves or bats fly out yes it's a really really good-looking game and so far this story is like

47:37.520 --> 47:42.920
really yeah I'm into it so I may have yet again slept on a game I really should have started

47:42.920 --> 47:50.240
playing about a year and a half ago but what else is new that happens sometimes right so excuse me

47:50.240 --> 47:56.080
looking at some other comments in her chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network quest buster says

47:56.080 --> 48:03.880
love that game alloy is the best yeah the the heroine of the story definitely they are molding

48:03.880 --> 48:09.960
her to be a big character that would most assuredly be in the next Sony PlayStation all-stars if they

48:09.960 --> 48:18.840
do a game like that that's for sure Captain Spike says OMG same Rob recent play so nice yeah pretty

48:18.840 --> 48:26.520
cool Pele Hanumea says I hope horizon zero dawn 2 is a PlayStation 5 launch title I don't know

48:26.520 --> 48:30.600
if it would be a launch title but I there's got to be a horizon zero dawn 2 in the making there

48:30.600 --> 48:34.080
really has to be it seems like a lot of people who played this game are really into it and I do

48:34.080 --> 48:38.000
I want to keep playing it it's um if you don't know like the type of game it is it's really like old

48:38.000 --> 48:42.680
world or excuse me it's like exploration a lot of like you do the quest to go from one place to

48:42.680 --> 48:48.600
another you may have to hunt monsters and you can do it stealthy and the game rewards you with more

48:48.600 --> 48:53.160
XP if you like learn how to hide in the bush and like scan the enemy for the weak point and shoot

48:53.160 --> 48:57.920
an arrow at it but there's skills that can help you like there's a skill that I bought that slows

48:57.920 --> 49:03.440
down time and zooms in so it's really easy to get a shot on an eye or something like that and honestly

49:03.440 --> 49:06.800
I imagine if you're playing in Bobby Black Wolf mode you don't even have to worry about the

49:06.800 --> 49:10.960
stealth you just go in there with your spear and chop them up and it's way it'll be fine poke them

49:10.960 --> 49:15.880
in the face exactly because that's like if I if I fail and I miss and the thing charges at me I

49:15.880 --> 49:23.920
just swing wild with my spear and it usually ends up dead anyway so it works Bobby says you do still

49:23.920 --> 49:30.280
have to do stealth yes you do still I mean in the tutorials you have to do stealth I don't know in

49:30.280 --> 49:35.800
the game so far I imagine in some story elements there may be some forced stealth but I'm not so

49:35.800 --> 49:40.360
sure if you were to play this game in its easiest mode the story mode it probably isn't gonna give

49:40.360 --> 49:43.720
a shit you can probably just go in there and hack and slash mobs because they're not really gonna be

49:43.720 --> 49:48.000
able to kill you quest buster brought up something I think I would enjoy what's that using trip wire

49:48.000 --> 49:54.480
oh yeah I just got that I I went to the guy and got like a true so you set up a trip wire because

49:54.480 --> 49:58.720
you scan and you can see the path that they take and you set up a trip wire so that way when it

49:58.720 --> 50:03.160
comes and it hits the trip wire goes and it just collapses and you can shoot it in the face it's

50:03.160 --> 50:09.680
great I know it's very rewarding it sounds like so fun dark soccer it's not just any trip wire

50:09.680 --> 50:15.360
it's a shock trip wire so they trip and they get electrocuted can you also have it to wear like

50:15.360 --> 50:19.640
shoots a spike into their face I'm oh there are other types I think there's like a flaming trip

50:19.640 --> 50:25.320
wire and there's just you you got me a flaming trip wire robbed there's flaming arrows too you

50:25.320 --> 50:31.880
got me at fire literally the first quest in the game is to make fire arrows you might have to

50:31.880 --> 50:37.520
check it out yeah I think it's time to hook up ps4 again there you go or at least get the dust

50:37.640 --> 50:42.320
off of it yeah quest buster says stealth is really simplistic in this one it's not on splinter cell

50:42.320 --> 50:46.840
levels of tough no I I didn't think it was that bad I and I don't like stealth usually although

50:46.840 --> 50:50.520
I'll be honest I have been getting my streaming setup together so I can play I love you Colonel

50:50.520 --> 50:56.240
Sanders it's just I had to upgrade my operating system first to be able to do that six fucking

50:56.240 --> 51:03.280
hours you know how long it took to upgrade my Mac 45 minutes yeah but then when you find out your

51:03.280 --> 51:09.080
apps aren't compatible on Mac it takes you a little longer just so you know yes same thing

51:09.080 --> 51:14.760
can happen on Windows well I haven't updated my MacBook Pro but my Mac's updated so all right

51:14.760 --> 51:20.680
anyway um let's see I want to move on let's that was enough for our gaming week a little bit of

51:20.680 --> 51:28.360
housekeeping we will not be here live next week I have a work trip that I need to do and work gets

51:28.360 --> 51:32.640
number one preference sorry guys day job is the thing that pays me to be able to do this show

51:32.640 --> 51:39.840
so we won't be here live on Sunday night however we're gonna try to record during the week but

51:39.840 --> 51:44.160
we're trying our schedules are a little complicated so I can't promise it right now I'm gonna try to

51:44.160 --> 51:49.200
record something for you guys I'll have an update on our Twitter over at twitter.com slash olr so

51:49.200 --> 51:54.720
just a heads up there but if you're on the podcast but you don't see a new show come in next week we

51:54.720 --> 51:58.080
weren't able to get around and record something so sorry about that but you can't always show up for

51:58.080 --> 52:02.800
mr. Bobby Blackwell who is here live the voice he's network right before us on Sunday nights

52:02.800 --> 52:08.160
all right uh anyhow let's move on let's get into some gaming news we've talked a lot about other

52:08.160 --> 52:12.200
stuff let's get into what else has been going on the gaming industry this week so Loki let's talk

52:12.200 --> 52:18.720
about this next Sony console that's is gonna be named PlayStation 5 you know what's funny

52:18.720 --> 52:23.320
last week on the show remember we did that whole thing about Shawn Layden leaving and like yeah

52:23.520 --> 52:28.600
mean and I sat here and I said well maybe they're gonna go in this radical new direction for the

52:28.600 --> 52:33.880
Sony place never and they're not gonna call it the five it's gonna be the place to well can't

52:33.880 --> 52:39.960
win them all I love that the very next day they gave him out and said no bitch it's PlayStation

52:39.960 --> 52:47.120
5 all right so yeah so they basically put out they had an interview with wired and also put

52:47.120 --> 52:55.000
out some stuff regarding the next console so it is gonna be the PlayStation 5 it's gonna be out

52:55.000 --> 53:01.160
holiday 2020 not a big surprise there they said that the console will have a solid-state drive

53:01.160 --> 53:07.760
and they said games released on it would be 100 gigabyte blu-ray discs it will have a 4k blu-ray

53:07.760 --> 53:15.680
drive I hope that means 4k video as well because if you remember the current PlayStation 4 pros

53:15.720 --> 53:20.680
thinking Sony's gonna get that right I mean I don't know but you know what Sony probably

53:20.680 --> 53:25.400
also wants to talk about digital because I would think they want to talk less about the

53:25.400 --> 53:31.560
discs and more about the digital but I don't want to I can't mind read Sony anymore I don't want to

53:31.560 --> 53:41.000
download a 20 gigabyte video file no no thanks they said that the games will need to be installed

53:41.160 --> 53:46.840
from the disc I mean it makes sense because you're talking like huge games they're talking a little

53:46.840 --> 53:51.640
bit about how that the new PlayStation 5 controller is gonna be similar to the PlayStation 4 controller

53:51.640 --> 53:57.000
but they're gonna be improving things like haptics in there as well and they have this adaptive

53:57.000 --> 54:01.520
triggers so what that means is that there'll be variable resistance on the trigger when you're

54:01.520 --> 54:06.360
pulling it down so you may have like different things for example it's like kind of like if you

54:06.360 --> 54:11.120
remember like the old driving games in arcades and stuff like that where they had some you know

54:11.120 --> 54:16.560
resistance on the steering wheel some games have that it's like that but with the triggers so your

54:16.560 --> 54:23.200
game can now fight back sort of yeah okay so the controller is not gonna punch you in the face but

54:23.200 --> 54:26.920
it can make it a little harder to actually like pull the trigger so when like you're choking a

54:26.920 --> 54:33.160
bitch in Grand Theft Auto 5 then you squeeze and eventually you'll feel the neck snap and it'll

54:33.200 --> 54:41.240
just give away so just go on and then of course along with that you'll have the additional

54:41.240 --> 54:49.000
haptics to feel all the bones breaking and so they said other things it sounds like the HD

54:49.000 --> 54:53.640
rumble or whatever that they have I'm not really sure how they're gonna do additional haptics

54:53.640 --> 54:58.000
aside from I guess changing the way they do the rumble all together kind of like how they did it

54:58.000 --> 55:07.240
with the with the the switch joy cons but they said some things that you'll be able to like for

55:07.240 --> 55:13.280
example check out they had a demo I guess of Astrobot rescue mission they said on ice it made

55:13.280 --> 55:20.640
the thumbsticks feel like my character was gliding or jumping in a pool and they said there is some

55:20.640 --> 55:28.720
resistance on the water on a wooden bridge a bouncy sensation so interesting and they said

55:28.720 --> 55:32.360
the thumbsticks I guess there is resistance I wonder if they're talking about resistance on

55:32.360 --> 55:42.880
those as well aside from the triggers interesting so then other stuff I don't know they've got some

55:42.880 --> 55:48.160
new blue point games is gonna be working on some new games right now they said we're working on

55:48.160 --> 55:55.840
a big one right now I'll let you figure out the rest and then they said that their primary

55:55.840 --> 56:04.600
primary focus on the new controller is I guess their primary focus is that new controller there

56:04.600 --> 56:10.240
was some other stuff that came out I don't know if we're gonna be talking about it necessarily no

56:10.240 --> 56:16.320
so there is some other patents we may have talked about this last week of PlayStation VR stuff that

56:16.320 --> 56:20.280
there may be a new version of PlayStation VR that's gonna be launching with the PlayStation 5 as

56:20.280 --> 56:25.880
well so we'll have to check that out and see that's the thing so I mean what do you think of

56:25.880 --> 56:30.960
this news I mean it sounds good I mean I'm interested to see what what what in that how

56:30.960 --> 56:36.040
that translates in the gameplay because I mean honestly at this point like you can push graphics

56:36.040 --> 56:40.240
you can push graphics you can push to graphics but not every game really needs those graphics

56:40.240 --> 56:44.040
push I want to see what you're gonna do they improve the gameplay of these games and I'm

56:44.080 --> 56:50.800
curious to see how this haptic stuff feeds into it cuz yeah I'd be pretty cool I mean just don't

56:50.800 --> 56:55.960
make the controllers like $80 each but you know I I'm interested to see where they go with that

56:55.960 --> 57:01.640
because some things worked some things didn't work like I don't know about the touchpad that's

57:01.640 --> 57:06.920
on the PlayStation 4 controller maybe that was kind of a not really working out thing but some

57:06.920 --> 57:13.240
other stuff I'm kind of with you it's like it sounds really neat now show me what it can do

57:13.760 --> 57:19.280
I realize you know a random day in October 2019 is not really when they are gonna do the big

57:19.280 --> 57:23.980
unveiling for the next console this is the type of thing I have to wait for the next c3 or probably

57:23.980 --> 57:28.560
Sony's own event but that also gets me excited about like you know with additional haptics in

57:28.560 --> 57:33.320
the DualShock controller what about additional haptics in a new VR controller and that might be

57:33.320 --> 57:38.400
pretty cool too yeah like that like I like the haptic type of stuff like especially like on my

57:38.400 --> 57:43.480
phone in gaming because the phones have the haptic stuff in it like you know the the little like

57:43.480 --> 57:47.520
haptic stuff that happens like an ingress for example like when people are attacking near me

57:47.520 --> 57:52.080
you actually feel a little like a little haptic like shake in your phone it's really cool like I

57:52.080 --> 57:56.240
like it and when you're glipping you you can feel you know and obviously other games have it too like

57:56.240 --> 58:01.480
you know the yeah so I'm I like that haptic stuff and I'm curious what it's gonna do more for the

58:01.480 --> 58:06.520
console gaming yeah so but now it's just a matter of okay so what are the games that are gonna use

58:06.520 --> 58:12.280
these features but you know and then one feature that is see when it's going away I guess that is

58:12.280 --> 58:17.800
maybe not a big deal to some people because they may have not used it but the integration with

58:17.800 --> 58:24.120
PlayStation 4 and Facebook is gonna be going away as well basically saying that we're working with

58:24.120 --> 58:29.680
Facebook of course is working with Sony to finalize an updated contract designed to improve

58:29.680 --> 58:35.080
the Facebook integration with PlayStation while these discussions are in progress Facebook

58:35.080 --> 58:42.360
features will be not available on PlayStation 4 and it's already gone which is kind of surprising

58:42.360 --> 58:46.920
like I don't know like I kind of like the Facebook integration which is weird because there's a lot

58:46.920 --> 58:54.000
about Facebook I don't like but it did make it very easy to find my friends who are also on

58:54.000 --> 59:00.320
PlayStation and very very easy to just be like oh I don't know this person by their username so we

59:00.320 --> 59:05.640
can just exchange the real names and that or my my real name that was probably the only thing I

59:05.640 --> 59:11.240
used with that but I know they were talking about other things like you know sharing screenshots

59:11.240 --> 59:17.480
videos music trophy details and stuff like that yeah or links to gameplay broadcasts but I really

59:17.480 --> 59:22.320
only use it for the friends stuff but yeah no you can do all the sharing just like you can share to

59:22.320 --> 59:27.480
Twitter like the video is not stuff or I shared us I shared a screenshot from horizon zero dawn

59:27.480 --> 59:31.520
like either earlier today or yesterday to Twitter I could have done that to Facebook yeah but I just

59:31.520 --> 59:35.280
figured the people that follow me on Facebook don't really probably care about all my gaming

59:35.280 --> 59:39.600
updates most of the people on Twitter probably don't either but too bad I don't know Twitter

59:39.600 --> 59:43.880
feels like the easier place for those like shorter updates whereas things on Facebook get kind of

59:43.880 --> 59:49.240
lost but I'm I don't know it's it's still a little weird to me that it went away I'd kind of like to

59:49.240 --> 59:54.320
know more of the reasons why behind it like was there some type of agreement that fell through

59:54.320 --> 59:58.920
does Sony plan to build their own type of social network like what but if that was the case well

59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.640
then they would get rid of the Twitter functionality and that stuff too so I'm kind of not sure like

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.640
what's all going on my first thought was maybe Facebook made it harder maybe Facebook did

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:15.040
something to to this but no you could still have Facebook integration on the switch you can find

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.080
your hands on the digital switch through Facebook I don't know what's up I'll be honest I never used

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:27.840
any features like that so for me it's kind of a no-deal I guess some people like it I'm personally

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.560
trying to get myself off Facebook as often as as I can which is why there's been an increase in

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.800
me using Twitter lately so yeah slidekick and chat says did you talk about the biggest news

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:43.800
of the recent week which was Galarian Ponyta since I brought up Nintendo says says the one

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:50.920
who just changed their Facebook Twitter name yeah so we did not bring it up yet on the show

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.560
but I will take this opportunity to mention it does look cute as if I wasn't going to buy

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:01.560
Pokemon sword and or shield anyway I'm gonna keep thinking of Galarian's I was gonna get Pokemon

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:07.320
shield anyway with heads exploding now it's just doubly so that I'm gonna get Pokemon shield so

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.840
yeah it's like it says someone who had committed to shield months ago I couldn't be happier same

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.680
that's the same boat I'm in SSG 100 Matt I love this as 200 Matt and chat says tinfoil hat maybe

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:26.880
Facebook is going to have a deal with Microsoft but at the same oh no I here's why cuz they're

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.920
still in with Nintendo switch wouldn't into the switch have to get rid of it too I don't think

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:35.200
it's a deal maybe it's just that maybe so much has changed that it just doesn't integrate well

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.200
anymore with it or something yeah maybe I don't know well we'll probably never know the real reason

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.640
why as to what's going on but it's fun to speculate see that's why you always do your quote

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.120
fingers and go reason all right well let's talk a little more about some things going on at

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:57.360
Microsoft dark soccer oh yeah I don't know how to feel about this I'm sure people have some feelings

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:05.760
but Mikey Barra left Xbox after having been there for about 20 years he's very very high level as in

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:12.880
the corporate vice president of Xbox said he's a he's gone bye-bye and this is his direct quote

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.520
it's been a great ride at Xbox and the future is bright thanks to everyone at Team Xbox I'm

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.440
incredibly proud of what we've accomplished and I wish you the best more soon on what's next for me

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:30.240
super excited sounds like someone was given some opportunity you know an opportunity recently

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.240
opened up at Sony I'm just saying yeah I'm not saying but I'm saying but I mean we've also lost

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:43.280
you know other big figures with with Xbox you know like a Phil Spencer was one of the the big

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:54.600
departures you know so he he did we know Spencer still had of Xbox oh no they said they're goodbye

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.920
to Ibarra sorry I misread something okay I was like wait a minute still there I was like why

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.040
is that there no he's still there no it said that they they you know the big big goodbyes on

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:12.760
Facebook sorry on Twitter but but he did get those some yeah the other high-profile one was

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:20.880
Tim Longo who is the creative director for Halo Infinite but no no we'll see what happens I mean

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.160
I wish him the best but he was also the same person that defended anthem so I'm kinda like

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.840
later bitch he was doing his job to be fair yeah but I'm still a steaming pile of shit I know but

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:41.120
anyway I it's just one of those things was like it's a like all these corporate departures are

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.880
just kind of like what the fuck's going on what's in the water are they just trying to all get out

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.600
of politics like what no okay a bad joke but you know it's very what if Shawn Layden and him just

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:58.320
switch places okay I doubt it's that I love how everyone though is giving a oh crap I mean his

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:05.720
name is spelled differently yeah but I still think it's funny yeah it's funny all right yeah

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.520
I knew this other Jamie Summers she was a bionic woman apparently and spelled it different

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:17.480
differently yes you know as funny as it at work one of the the senior advisors in my team in a

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:24.480
completely different location by the way has my maiden name oh and so people get us confused all

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.280
the time because even though I'm still first level I was a senior advisor before and have

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.440
like that guess that same tone of voice oh yeah this person talked to you no they didn't they

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.800
taught to the other Jamie you know what's so funny it took me a minute to remember your maiden name

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:48.120
like I had to sit here and go oh yeah and by the way my last name ain't really summers it's just

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.280
a mind yeah mine's not really Roberts I think everybody knows that at this point and just names

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:57.640
not really his birth name isn't Loki I think most people know that and smooshy's stage name is

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:03.000
actually this mushy no his name really is mr. smoosh it is mr. smoosh and he's vocalizing actually

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.160
no because remember mr. smoosh was a rescue cat and when they read the chip it had his original

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:14.440
name on it but that's not actually his name he did have a legal name change yeah you do not

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.040
legally change your name to Rob Roberts no I did not really change my name to Rob Roberts so that's

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:25.400
what we have yeah so mr. smooshy's name is mr. smoosh and I call him the smooshy's because he's

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:33.840
the smooshiest cat he's so cute all right let's move on and talk a little bit about a game that's

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:40.720
causing a little bit of controversy out there or did I I think I skipped a story I'm sorry

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.400
there's a story missing from our little sidebar oops awkward Loki has something to talk about

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:52.640
first yes we're gonna talk about theft and valve and now this isn't anything valve is stealing it

01:05:52.640 --> 01:06:00.440
is people stealing stuff from valve so apparently there was this 32 year old guy Sean the shop of

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:09.280
who burglarized I guess valve and stole a bunch of games and computers and accessories yay so he

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:17.680
apparently stole 48 PlayStation 4 and Xbox one games and about yeah they said $40,000 worth of

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:26.480
games and equipment from valve um he it's among other things that he stole from other stuff he

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:37.440
saw a FedEx truck I guess at one time he also you know stole stuff from public restaurants so yeah

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:44.640
so basically he gained access to valve I guess by through a public restaurant and then through

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:52.280
a non-functioning stairwell door and then he stole you know all those games from them wait

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.040
so like valve is a big building that probably has some type of cafe or public restaurant the

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:01.120
first floor this guy went into the cafe then like found a stair access in the cafe or yeah

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:06.080
they got him into the rest of the building yeah and so then that's your solid along with that

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.520
he also stole 15 to 20 laptops some Nintendo switch and steam machine consoles see machine

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:17.800
consoles aren't worth much and then he well it's it's video games dark soccer he can carry as much

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:24.480
as he wants he doesn't exceed the number of he still gave Newell's metal minigun looking thing

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:36.080
yes so did they recover it apparently yes he did get that they did recover that stuff so he'd been

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:44.080
he says he'd been throwing some random items into a rolling recycling bin which he used to store all

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:51.120
the stolen goods but yeah they show like his haul there and there's quite a bit of stuff he

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:59.480
sold a signed copy of heavy metal that's random yeah don't steal things folks even though it's

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.960
kind of like interesting and very video game plot like that he did it you know you probably shouldn't

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:11.120
steal it's generally a bad idea he didn't steal Half-Life 3 and that's really what he means yeah

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.480
that that was what he should have stolen was the source code for Half-Life 3 all right damn it

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:22.640
next time all right let's move on let's talk about this Kickstarter for a new game coming

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.320
out called enchanted portals but the thing is if you actually look at the game enchanted

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.320
portals I'm sorry I didn't have time to get b-roll tonight because I see bags that have been really

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:36.640
awesome I'm sorry but with enchanted portals you'll just have to google it and look it up

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.800
yourself there was a Kickstarter going on for this and the game really looks a lot like cuphead

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:49.040
like a lot like cuphead but it's not a real they're not cups because they're little witches

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.880
and it's not technically it's just a ripoff of the style and like genre yeah well I mean no one's

01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:03.440
got a copyright on the 1930s no they don't and technically no my god does look a lot like it

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.600
though no one has a copyright on shooter like shooters either honestly like cuphead is dr.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.640
pepper and this is dr. slice like that or what's the one they sell at Walmart called what's that

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:19.800
brand it's you know what I mean though it's it's the it's the lower quality version of the I play

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:30.200
a doctor on TV mr. P but a lot of folks went to Twitter to say basically like hey screw you you

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.280
guys are trying to make money and like totally ripping off cuphead like what's going on well

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.240
the two-man team behind this game am I saying this right she show xixo she show I guess would

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:46.040
be the way to say that she show has been commented has commented on the issue saying yes cuphead was

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.960
a huge inspiration for enchanted portals we're both avid fans we would make something similar

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.120
but always from a place of respect and admiration for the original we were prepared for some

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.760
backlash but the trailer definitely reached way more people than we could ever anticipate

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.720
and all the hate and negativity coming our way has definitely had a huge impact on us that being

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.920
said along with all those negative responses a lot of people have also reached out to us to say

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.840
they adore the game and would love to see it succeed so we're trying to turn our attention

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:16.600
more towards all those who are supporting us and sending their love for the game look I can respect

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.800
the angle of just cut out the haters and embrace the positivity versus the negativity but I also

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.880
do think it's important like look I get the whole like the art style can be flattering so forth but

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.880
there were like they were like showing some bosses that were really similar to bosses and cuphead

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.480
and things like that like do something a little bit different you know I mean like take something

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.720
you wish was better about cuphead and do that you know like there there is a way where you can kind

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.360
of take a take cuphead as a template and then like do your own thing on it it's not like there aren't

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:50.200
tons of video games out there that are derivative of each other and this goes all the way back to

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.720
fucking pac-man right like after pac-man came out how many fucking maze games came out what like

01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.080
ladybug mousetrap and even crazy auto which eventually turned into miss pac-man yeah for

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.720
amadar there was like a million like pac-man clones right or things inspired but they they

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.440
all kind of did something a little bit different didn't they so you know that that's I think what

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.600
people would really appreciate about cuphead and I think excuse me about I can't even get the name

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.680
of the game right enchanted portals and here's the thing that makes it dicey when you go to

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:24.520
kickstarter and ask for money when it's one of these things where it's like I would like to make

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:31.640
these dolls and I would like to put out my pack a chump dolls here and here's my prototype pack a

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.360
chump doll that I'm going to be selling and for those team pokemon that for those of you that are

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.720
watching the podcast feed I'm holding up a certain yellow creature that may look very familiar to one

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.320
that you know from a go game on your mobile phone or a sword and shield game coming on your switch

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:55.320
but my pack a chump uh is uh it's it's just inspired by pokemon I would never just directly

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:03.080
steal so what you have to do is you have to put a little mustache on it and glasses

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.720
and make it your own put a beard on him then he's evil package you

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:14.600
uh slidekick in chat says pack a chunk is the obese pikachu oh hey wait a minute just stop

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:20.600
pikachu is not a skinny little rat mind you thank you slidekick also doing the real work

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.760
that we need to know here saying walmart is apparently dr thunder thank you that's what

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.480
I was trying to think of dr thunder all right anyway that's always still sounds like a porn

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.840
name uh and then dr thunder in chat this is also very important because I talked about the name

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:43.560
of the company shisho act theft was asking is he related to shusha no I don't think so and

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:49.800
act after is asking does anyone know who the fuck shusha yes I do and of course I'm going to give

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:57.000
you my keys that was how she would end the show and give an extra lipsticky kiss on the cheek

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.120
to some kid yes now she's wanted for police several years later I want to make a game based

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.680
on shusha I'm gonna see where she is now yeah where is shusha please don't say dead I feel like

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.800
the answer is going to be dead

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:19.480
in prison no not in prison shusha american tv program okay 1993 my god

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.400
and it was based on shu de shusha which was the original show it looks like

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:32.520
all right her name is shusha mening meningale dijaroma s is saying thank god she's not dead

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.840
brazilian tv host film actress blah blah blah she's the queen of the short ones

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:43.000
but is she is the bitch alive yes okay good uh see a tiberian chat that should be a website is

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.520
the bitch alive and then you have a drop down and it's just a bunch of different celebrities

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:58.520
she is right now among brazil's most prominent celebrities and is worth over 400 million us

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:02.760
she's one of the highest net worth of any woman entertainer in brazil

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.560
metal mayhem in chat says shusha sells seashells by the seashore

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.560
that's actually pretty funny metal mayhem all right uh see a tiberian chat says someone should

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:18.280
make a video game about wing and she was on dancing brazil which is a brazilian version of

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:24.920
dancing with stars really and she is a big social uh activist as well working with brazil's poorest

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:34.280
communities oh so yeah she turns out shusha is a pretty pretty good and she had an affair with

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:42.600
pele oh back in the day when she was 16 scandalous i i just now i now i really want that website is

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:49.960
the bitch alive or is the bit excuse me is the bitch dead yes well hey and it's got the number

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:56.040
the default search has to be very wide and for people who want to look up shusha it's xu xa

01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.360
and honestly the show is so on drugs that it's worth watching a little bit of it

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.920
because all the children programming we loved and adore especially in the 80s was probably derived

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:12.200
from cocaine oh speaking of things that were probably derived from cocaine pleased because

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.200
this was linked in the vog network discord and i probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise but

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.600
we do have our own discord server at vog network.com vognetwork.com slash discord

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.880
somebody she's on instagram what hold on somebody linked this uh saturday night live sketch that was

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:32.600
a parody of the joker movie trailer but it was for oscar the grouch and first off it was starring

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:40.040
david harbor yes you know david harbor was in the trailer becoming oscar the grouch but what killed

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:44.200
me was that they had all these real life interpretations of all these characters from

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:49.720
sesame street and like the count was counting his pills as he was taking them yes fucking like ernie

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.760
got stabbed by somebody and burt's crying over it it's really funny and i haven't said that about

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:59.240
saturday night live in a long time but that was a really funny trailer so thank you for sharing

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:08.120
that yeah the grouch trailer so there it is all right moving on let's get to another story uh

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:14.600
this is uh edutainment possible edutainment title right yeah um and actually it was the link was

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:21.800
provided to me by uh our dear ronma um but it's and now i'm really loath to say anything positive

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:27.720
about kickstarter right now but the union organizers and um have been saying please

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:33.400
continue to support it because it's how a lot of people get their money so i did actually back this

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:41.560
one for the sake of supporting their creators i am still however speaking out against their

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:48.680
practices and wanting to hold of course the corporate people responsible so um like i said

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:54.920
we gotta pick our battles right um shujinko is a game coming out that's supposed to teach you

01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:03.960
japanese um it's going to have a release on switch and ps4 and um it's basically set in

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:09.320
a world where the japanese language is being erased by demons and you have to save it so it's

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:15.160
sort of a roleplay slash metroidvania style game and you have to react to different situations on

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:21.400
screen and it familiarizes you with the language as you go um and i'll put it this way it sounded

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.120
like a really good concept especially for someone like me who's trying to eventually pass the glpt

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.680
so i backed it it sounds like a neat concept especially you know for somebody that might

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:38.520
want to learn a little japanese um lord knows i could use it so well and i said that i was going

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.080
to teach me how to read like say it pronounce it i had well i hope so but i you know i personally

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.920
said that i wasn't gonna back anything until i found something worth backing because i do want

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:57.480
to support the content creator it's just i am still also you know visibly protesting the actions

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:01.240
of the corporation are you able to just reach out to the content creator directly and say hey can i

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:06.920
have your paypal you know that i didn't find out i should do that but yeah but you know the amount

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.480
that i pledged gets me my copy of the game so i should see if they have any other way to do that

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.280
and then i can withdraw my pledge yeah so i'll do that because i'd feel better about that than doing

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:21.880
it any other way um but that's cool i i think that's uh pretty awesome that uh you know it's

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.440
like an edutainment game but it's something a little more mainstream sounding so best of luck

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:30.600
to them on that i think that's uh cool i would love it would be fun yeah hopefully if the game's

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:36.040
you know kind of fun i'd love to learn japanese that way anyway let's move on loki all right um

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:42.600
so this is pretty exciting so steam is af um adding a new service soon that's called remote

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:48.680
play together and what that is is basically allows you to play any couch co-op games

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:57.480
online with other players so you'll be able to do uh launch up to four players in a specific game

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:02.120
and you'll play with other people that aren't in the room with you so so it's playstation 4 share

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:08.840
play sort of yeah exactly um so i'm down with this because if i release a game on steam i don't know

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:14.440
how to fucking code your code online gameplay this will make it much easier for me so um

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.960
i think it's pretty awesome and so they're gonna offer that it's gonna be something that they're

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:25.400
implementing very soon and it's just gonna be built into any game that's on steam i think they

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:32.120
have a few yeah it's in beta right now so they're launching around october 21st and they said it

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:38.680
includes split screen and local co-op play but and apparently it's all done through the steam

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:43.720
overlay you can accept invitations from friends to join and block people if you don't want them

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:49.240
to come in and there's other limitations you can set like um blocking certain inputs on a shared

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.800
keyboard and mouse and stuff like that they see can't just hit alt f4 on somebody else's keyboard

01:19:54.520 --> 01:20:01.160
something like that and draw delete those types of things yeah so um i think this is very exciting

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:09.640
it'd be cool to see how you know we can use this but neat i i'm always for more um accessibility

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.720
for people to play over the internet friends yeah it's kind of neat i mean the playstation

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:18.040
4 share play is probably one of those features is like really underutilized and i think people

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.760
forget it's there so uh yeah it'd be really cool uh bonds 006 says i have some co-workers that

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.440
would be into couch play on steam yeah i think there'd be especially the the ability to like

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.440
kind of like try a game because share play is also only limited yeah that was the other thing

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.160
yeah this one is it's you don't have to own a copy of the game to be able to do that too

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.320
uh to play with somebody else if they have a copy of the game then you can play it and it'll stream

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:46.040
it to you so um pretty cool how about yeah that's kind of neat i like that all right well let's um

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:52.760
move on and let's talk about uh some things that are going on with the new atari vcs that is uh

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:58.200
maybe coming out i don't know uh because the reason why i say i don't know which is interesting

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.200
we just last week had that story about how ant stream was going to have like an atari

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:09.800
exclusive edition right well the atari vcs the architect of the system quit that's right uh not

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:16.120
only did he quit but he quit saying he hasn't been paid in six months oh no yikes uh rob wyatt is the

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.560
system architect uh he's the architect behind the system he was also one of the founding team

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.040
members behind the xbox should be pointing out and in an interview he told the register as of

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.000
friday october 4th i've officially resigned as the architect of atari vcs atari haven't paid

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.880
invoices going back over six months to the consultant firm that he runs tin giant as a

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:41.880
small company we've been lucky to survive this long um all they had so far was a prototype

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:47.240
motherboard last month and the team was in the middle of debugging said uh motherboard before

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:52.680
he decided to quit uh now it will probably fall to a different organization surface inc

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:57.320
uh which atari contracted with to complete the console but who knows how long that is going to

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:07.960
take yikes and it sounds this just sounds to me a lot like the whole um calico debacle that was

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:14.120
out there except a little a little different story because with the clica one it was i think

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:19.480
it was the clica where they had like fake hardware they were trying to like fake that the hardware

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.840
was actually done whereas this sounds like that he's actually been working on hardware they're

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:30.360
just not paying him so but still not a good sign uh dj rama s says what happened to that kickstarter

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:40.280
money uh-oh for those backers well to be continued i suppose anyhow now we're going to take a trip

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.480
down memory lane to better times to better games i'm literally tripping and falling over my feet

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:51.560
so we're going to uh get to our classic soundtrack of the month because once a month dark soccer goes

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.240
in the gaming vault and not only says here's the game you should check out but she's actually says

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.920
here's a soundtrack that we don't talk about enough although i don't know about this one we

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:02.680
talk about this one a lot so it was worth mentioning yeah and remember i'm trying to avoid

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:07.480
like the rpg ones and the ones like that but yeah this one just couldn't go without a mention you

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:12.360
really can't do this segment especially if you're gonna highlight 8-bit games and not talk about

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.160
this one uh for those i am putting the 16-bit thing on hiatus uh-huh and i'll go ahead and

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:24.680
make the announcement now next year we are doing classic pinball of the month all right

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.720
which is basically going to be 90 percent you know uh tables you own no because we have some

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.560
ones i don't like like i hate judge dread and we own that i hate creature from the black lagoon

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:41.160
we own that so is there a halo pinball table i'd hate that if it existed but it's not going to be

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:46.680
any of the current stern ones it's going to be everything like prior to the whole pinball 2000

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:52.520
thing so i'm using that as my marker for what constitutes classic pinball fair enough okay

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:57.000
for those watching on twitch because i i had all gonna be john papadook and steve richie games

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.440
there was a lot of stuff that i did before tonight's show with the system and trying to

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:07.000
upgrade some things that didn't work um so it's gonna go blank on twitch for just a minute because

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.760
i forgot to load the b-roll in advance oopsie daisy um but for the podcast folks you can listen

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:18.520
to jamie start to talk about this game so what did you pick for the classic game or excuse me

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:26.200
the classic soundtrack of the month ducktales ooh ducktales because of the moon it's all about the

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:33.400
moon i mean the whole game has an epic soundtrack um the uh the ducktail soundtrack was composed by

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:40.360
tonomura um hiroshige and it was actually one of the first soundtracks he ever worked on can you

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:47.000
believe this is early work from this guy actually oh i did fix things where i can turn this up and

01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:00.440
down on demand here we go so now we all know the beauty that is this particular soundtrack

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:09.400
um it was um he also did compose um uh some of the various uh you know background tracks

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:16.920
in the game he also rearranged the ducktail scene for this so um and he took moments to get the

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:20.920
theme kind of incorporated back into some of the other tracks so at least that same feel of the

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:28.120
themes um it also has different uh little fanfares and jingles that were played off of the ducktail

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:34.520
like you know when you die or when you finish a stage or something um and all of these songs were

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:43.080
completely of course remastered for ducktales remastered um it was coded in uh 6502 assembly

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:51.400
and using a sound driver created by um uh sakaguchi uh yoshihiro a yoshihiro sorry so it's

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:57.160
really um you know some other things i'd like to highlight what the um composer has done he also

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:05.080
did um legendary wings for nes he did um some baseball games destiny of the emperor for nes

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:15.640
he did the ninja kids he did uh bust a move for uh in 1994 as nah he didn't do all that

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:23.880
and uh he no he was the sound producer for bust a move and he also was uh the sound director for

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:30.600
raystorm one of the you know best shooters out there um so he he's really you know i wouldn't

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:37.000
say he had like a very long list of things but he's done some very good things um and of course

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.920
the music is one of the things that people completely know this game for i mean apart

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:49.080
from it just being a really solid game um they also did um different versions of the music he

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.040
there was a transylvania stage that didn't make it into the final one um a slower version of the

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:58.680
moon stage and um you know just a bunch of different things that you can find there's a

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:03.080
beta version out there that has some of these things in it that you can listen to um and of

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:08.760
course uh as the game was uh ported over to game boy the uh the same music went along with it so

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:15.400
it was all all his work so we really you know again this is one of those games that the moment

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:20.120
you bring up oh yeah i really like playing duck tales people go oh my god but the music

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:28.120
right so that's that's our game is duck tales so anyone have some good memories of music

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.600
i remember i don't think you know i can't remember if i owned duck tales or rented it a lot but i

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:38.840
remember playing a lot of duck tales how many games did we have that we just rented it a lot

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.200
that it felt like we owned them or maybe i borrowed it so that's back when like we had

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.840
swapped games with friends in the neighborhood and stuff like that and so i just i do remember

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.560
playing this quite a bit maybe i did own it yeah it's a really good game i mean it's one of the

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:57.480
ones that when dan and i were rebuilding our nest collection we we had to have this one and i don't

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.560
know if it's just because it's like a capcom game or something like that but a lot of this music

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:09.080
reminds me of megan well you know who was the um the uh hold on let me pull up the list yeah the

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:18.280
one of the main uh artists um of the game was uh you know june so i mean he didn't really do much

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:24.040
else in the game but he was uh one of the main artists in this game so there you go that's who

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:29.400
we need to get in a marvel versus capcom game scrooge mcduck yeah he'd just poke off of people

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:36.040
scrooge for smash and he'd uh he'd smack gems at them hell yes and then but after you smack them

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.720
then he would run around the screen and go go save it because that's the kind of duck he is

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:46.120
i was reading actually a few other things about that beta version of um duck tales like um gizmo

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:52.680
ducks uh name from the japanese version uh was in a lot of it is robo duck it's funny i was

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:57.720
actually looking at the name um the original name of the game and it's called uh one paku

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:03.880
uh one paku daku yume boken which is naughty ducks dream adventures i just like the name

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:12.760
naughty ducks it it denotes like some unruly ducks it's the porn parody hockey team either

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:18.040
that or they like it's like the precursor to the untitled goose game bobby blackwolf in our chat

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.680
points out duck tales was the only nes game i could be as a kid without a game genie it's still

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.040
the only nes game i can be without a game yeah there there's a lot of games that i don't remember

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:33.560
really i mean i'm kidding i'm kidding i mean i'm just like i'm thinking back to beating the

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:39.240
guardian legend as a kid oh you know something else yes i did beat that you know something else

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.760
i played this week in a completely random tangent i forgot about it because it was earlier the week

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:48.040
it was like monday that you remember that mashup of uh zelda and metroid that they put out the

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:53.560
randomizer yeah the one they do for the speedrun z1 m1 or something like that um i i downloaded

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.960
that and i started playing that that's neat i like that i said the problem with it is then i tried to

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:03.560
figure out how do i run that program that automatically plots the map and i couldn't

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:07.240
figure that part out and i got frustrated i couldn't figure out the mapping software so i

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.880
stopped somebody's gotta hold my hand and walk me through it on discord if i can figure it out if

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:16.920
people look up the old gdq streams though there's a lot of really good um the other things that i

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:24.280
like are like the game bingos i would love for us to put together like um a run what's a game bingo

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.600
game bingo so you've got your bingo card set with different objectives to do in the game

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:33.320
and either you have to do like a particular line of them like you pick which ones you can do

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:38.360
different tasks along the way but when you hit your straight line of everything then it's bingo

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.160
there are some who do blackout bingo okay that's kind of fun yeah um there's there's a few on the

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:49.320
gdq twitch channel you can find some really good bingo streams as well um for the last uh

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:56.040
gdq thing that they did they did an ocarina of time uh bingo i want to like live stream some of

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.560
that stuff i think i know when we get into like emulators and stuff things get a little dicey

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:06.280
but here's the thing i legally own a copy of zelda i legally own a copy of metroid i don't think i'm

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.120
in the wrong like several copies of all this shit i think we all do at this point because we've all

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.120
had to rebuy i have a snest class it gets fine i'm covered for all super nintendo games now well

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:20.440
i wouldn't say all super no it's all of them all right anyway uh bobby buckle says yeah they did

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:25.160
a super mario sunshine bingo at the last gdq that was the one i was thinking of yeah um but i know

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:29.880
that they've done an ocarina one so good times all right well let's move on and talk a little bit

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:37.160
about some rapid fire news quickly um some things going on in the uh gaming industry so uh loki uh

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:44.280
doom eternal has been delayed to march that's unfortunate the delay the march 20th 2020

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:50.840
and it's because they have to add some polish so they can live up to their standards of speed

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:58.120
and i guess polish so please understand um take the time to get it right it's cool i'm down with

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:06.200
that you know that's fine uh let's see what else and then um they have a new cross sorry i have to

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:13.320
say that act deaf to chat says bethesda's delaying a game to fix it why it's id software just because

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.320
they're owned by bethesda doesn't mean they necessarily operate in the same standards but

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:25.000

landfill i'm not gonna i'm not gonna fight about oatmeal cookies i love oatmeal cookies i hate

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.400
raisins though yeah the thing is is that you just need to clearly label like i'm fine with oatmeal

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:18.120
raisin cookies as long as they are clearly labeled oatmeal raisins raisins are deceptive

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:22.360
little assholes i'm fine with oatmeal raisin but like if i eat that thinking oh that's a chocolate

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.400
chip cookie and then i bite into it and i surprise it's a raisin i'm gonna be dissatisfied but as long

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:32.120
as you tell me up front yo it's an oatmeal cookie then we're fine if i be prepared i will not make

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:37.080
oatmeal raisin cookies but i will make oatmeal craisin cookies you made those ones they were

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.560

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:55.080
apple has added five new arcade games to apple arcade including inmost uh which is uh by the

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.880
makers of uh stardew valley and war groove i didn't know that from uh hidden lair games

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:06.040
is a very different type of game they're neat uh the publisher was those other games uh shock rods

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:11.480
uh is another game that has been added it's kind of like a racing game uh stella is another

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:17.640
game that's been released as well as decoherence and mind symphony uh i believe those of you that

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.360
started your free trial it's going to be running out soon so just a heads up on that if you are

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:26.440
on your free month trial and you do or do not whatever wish to keep it but it's five bucks and

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.760
you can share it with your whole family through family sharing so i mean it's like one of the

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:36.200
cheapest subs you'll ever have out there for that much and there's a lot more games coming out i'm

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:41.240
really excited i haven't got it yet just because i don't want to add to my gaming backlog but once

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.160
i make some progress in my gaming backlog i'll probably do it it's a lot of the things on there

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:50.360
there were things that you can play in bursts so if you're out and about it's really easy to do

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:58.600
it's fair except i'm usually just playing ingress pokemon go harry potter all at once oh you owe me

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:04.040
all right uh oh and one other thing to mention here from me uh there is a very scary halloween

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:10.600
mask that's been spotted out there it is a is a sonic the hedgehog movie mask that's right even

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.400
though the sonic the hedgehog movie got delayed until next year you know it didn't get delayed

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:20.760
licensing agreements so if you want to be the scariest person on the whole block you can get

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:26.200
the sonic the hedgehog mask you gotta buy one and wear it on the show are we gonna have a dress-up

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:34.440
night here at olr for halloween now that we're video my co-workers want to do 80s and that's

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.120

because i want to eat these candy corns let me know how they are because i like candy corn too

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:08.120
um so they are doing retro style ghosts and goblins figures in japan or as it was called their

makamura um and they are selling them through uh the uh e-capcom online store and hot toys um in

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:25.560
japan but they have two three packs in a single pack and the three packs include um you know uh

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.040
the big monster the little monster and arthur and then there's another one with arthur in his

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:37.000
underwear and there's a single one that's arthur in the gold armor so cool i already started

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:43.160
looking on how to buy those and i don't think i can yet and then mega man or ruckman as we're

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:53.160
uh maybe knowing him as they're getting a six album vinyl collection um that has uh the uh

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.040

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:34.680
the oh god i'm actually looking at this and it's really really pretty artwork um yeah i i want this

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:39.400

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:16.360
talking about the um sonic thing oh no see it to be very lengthy of rupaul wigline thing that's at

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.760
party city because now people are taking like in so much information from drag race they're

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:26.040
dressing up like drag queens and stuff and rupaul has his own line of wigs you know what

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:33.640

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:28.440
do you see what you get those nuts out of my face what's your verdict um believe it or not the apple

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.920
pie ones are really good like the pumpkin ones are good of course but like the flavor is a little

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.600
more subtle but the apple pie ones look really good all right well let's hear from the dollar

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:43.000
store i can't throw it at you okay my stomach's upset all right well let's move on uh to the mail

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.120
bag question oh there's nothing in the mail bag this week bummer you guys should get on that

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:53.720
participate at orange lounge rita.com although i'm understanding we may have somehow lost some

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.920
emails i don't so it's weird to me that we keep not having emails so i will look into like what

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:04.360
the bleep is going on um but this is also part of the reason why i'm kind of like maybe we need

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:08.120
to have something besides emails for people to interact with us but i don't know i don't know

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.480
how to do that yet i i kind of want to have a text message thing or like an app or something

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:16.840
i don't know i'm gonna look into that you guys i'm not saying mail is going away so please send your

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:21.080
mails participate at orange laundry.com but i'm getting to that point where i'm like maybe we can

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:26.600
do this better so anyway for now though doing things better that's what new consoles are

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.160
supposed to do or or console less consoles right and i'm sure that they're totally not

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:37.640
promising things that they can't deliver on but google stadia claims that they're gonna be um

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:45.960
it's gonna get faster and uh more responsive than local gaming hardware they say they're going to do

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:53.960
this with some sort of um trickery that they're saying is like negative latency so they're

01:46:53.960 --> 01:47:00.760
basically going to use predictive technology to figure out what you're going to press before you

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:05.240
actually press it that doesn't sound like that's going to work but that they say in a year or two

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:12.040
that's what's going to happen it's going to make music games super easy exactly they predict i'm

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:17.000
going to hit it right every time perfect so people were worried about the latency making music games

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.600
possible on a game like on a console like google stadia but you're gonna get perfect every time

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:28.600
now exactly uh call me skeptical but i don't think that's gonna work out and also a year or two into

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:38.040
the console life i don't know i mean well to be fair this just reminds me of the console launches

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.920
like next month right yeah early adopters with the chrome cast and that whole thing but this like

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:48.120
this just totally screams the console we all know like was it the playstation 3 when they were

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:53.240
saying oh yeah it's gonna be you know 10 ap on everything or like i think they were even saying

01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:58.840
like higher than 10 ep like and 120 frames per second on like a lot of the games or whatever

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:07.400
i just i'm skeptical that this will be a thing but i guess anything they could do to reduce latency

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:13.080
would be nice but i'm just anything negative latency i'm sorry that's just kind of ridiculous

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:20.120
ssj100 matt in chat says this story is nonsense bobby blackwolf in chat says believe it or not

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.880
loki and i agree on this topic

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:30.600
i i feel like you're not oh my goding at that revelation even though i was

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:35.400
what we did get an email oh we did you just missed it like four minutes ago okay hold on

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:41.000
we'll backtrack you can't you can't interrupt now all right uh bobby blackwolf continues on and says

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:47.720
negative latent latency equals blast processing it's a buzzword i would i would agree that this

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:51.800
is the blast processing of the year 2019 because they could try to predict what you're gonna press

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:57.400
but like it's not a guarantee so that's just gonna throw all sorts of problems into the mix

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:02.600
so i don't know i just don't see it happening it's it's a weird comment that's really all i have to

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:07.640
say all right let's backtrack we can go to the email it's really short okay that's fine all

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:16.120
right so this comes from ryan and it's all in caps never do that to me 2020 is quickly approaching

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:20.040
there are just over two months left in this decade what are your favorite games of the 2010s

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:26.040
oh god this we could do a whole episode on this topic um let's table that one to do a whole

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:33.960
episode on that topic do me a favor save that for a taped show next week okay okay if we do that

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:40.040
mass effect all the things my list is probably pretty similar but to hold that thought because

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.640
i want to have a longer discussion on that now i need time to think about it because i need to

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:49.800
think like what came out in 2009 and what came out in 2010 okay because i need to kind of plan that

01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:54.760
out a little bit so all right anyway bobby blackwolf says is this the first time we've

01:49:54.760 --> 01:50:01.240
used the backward headline button on air uh no you think this is the first time i fucked up that's

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:09.320
cute no we never fuck up all the time on purpose fuckery and and backing up doesn't have the smooth

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.520
animation you've seen it all tonight you got to see the backup you got to see me insert a headline

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.720
live on air last week i changed a headline live on air because it said classic soundtrack of the

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.600
month when we had to change that out at the last minute but no it doesn't do an animation when

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.240
you backtrack but that's okay all right anyway that was fun playing with the sidebar especially

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:32.680
for those on the podcast they can't see what we're doing um but you just have to check out the

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:37.400
archives over at twitch tv slash vog network but we can move on to our next story which has to do

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:43.960
with uh moral combat 11 and you know the way a lot of these uh characters from world combat 11

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.360
have been leaked is through data mining so people will go in the files and that's how they found

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:55.000
that oh things characters like ash and spawn and nightwolf and the terminator are going to be

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.320
inside mortal combat terminator is fucking hilarious by the way yeah it's it's interesting

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:05.240
it's like uh it's looks very arnoldy and all that but anyway um apparently what they've done for

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:11.400
data miners is they've trolled a little bit with a combat pack two in one of the outros for the

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:16.440
terminator yes you get a first person view where you see kind of the red scan style and then some

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:22.120
text comes up on the screen really quickly and one of the things that comes up is data mine in

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:30.360
progress and it shows melina rain lee may serena meat and mocap now some of those are actually

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.920
characters that people would like to see added like melina and rain but other ones like they're

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:40.280
not going to do meat give me a break that would be ridiculous mocap i i think would break the game so

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:47.800
but it's it's it's a cute little thing that they what's mocap mocap was the character um it was

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:52.200
just really overpowered i think what could do everything keep something like that oh of course

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:58.360
my hubby that is mortal combat obsessive instantly knows the answer to this who is hi alan how are

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:03.480
you okay uh speak into the mic and tell us you can grab loki's mic here yes have a seat with a

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:10.360
pack of chonk uh who is mocap i don't know what game he was from but he was a gag

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:16.360
character and it's a guy in a morph suit like a green morph suit with the little ping pong balls

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:23.640
on him like a mocap like they do the mocap for the character fighting it's just that guy so all

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:30.120
right dumb well it's like an easter egg on my head but like as far as like oh iconic punder

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:35.160
money is a dlc that's like a deep cut character that's like a fan favorite no he isn't like if

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:38.680
mocap comes to the game before melina people are going to be really mad yeah it's like

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:41.960
guys come on who do they need to add to mortal kombat 11

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:49.400
i they still play mortal kombat 11 no not i haven't in ages no you've been playing doom i've

01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:55.240
watched because it's halloween it's how spooky season doom is your spooky game yeah okay i can

01:52:55.240 --> 01:53:03.640
play doom i can't play outlast shut it down i can manage with doom okay yeah all right but you also

01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:06.840
mod the shit out of doom like i look at your computer it doesn't even look like you're playing

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:11.080
doom it looks like oh it's disgusting like there's like killing blows they're like glory kills like

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:15.800
a doom 2016 where you're like ripping the sprites in half and there's like intestine sprites you'd

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:24.040
love it yeah no i'll stick with my everyone look up project brutality 3.0 and that's my advice to

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:27.400
you real quick before i let you go unpack groceries or whatever you were trying to do

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:33.480
in one sentence tell me your thoughts on blizzard this week

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:43.720
if it stinks real bad and you keep hearing seagulls you're probably standing in garbage

01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:49.880
and it's been smelling real bad and the seagulls have been chirping for

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:53.400
decades now and you look down and it's like oh i'm in garbage

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:58.840
thank you alan yes all right enjoy your night all right let's move on

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:09.000
and uh we'll get to our next story which has to do with a classic series coming back

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:19.880
anyway bubble bubble yay bubble bubble for friends is going to have the 1986 version

01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:26.440
a bubble bobble like so many classic versions have um but apparently it's going to have some

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:30.040
other stuff floating around in it so that seems like it could be pretty good it's going to come

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:36.440
out on switch in europe on november 19th and then um we'll be out in north america early

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:45.160
um next year so yeah we're getting this one a little bit late um but i mean it it's bubble

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:51.720
bobble i like bubble bobble um but it's going to also be out by in games as in the end that you

01:54:51.720 --> 01:55:01.000
dine at i and then in the games there you go hopefully the boss on level 30 works yeah but

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.280
this isn't like a completely redone version no i know this this will be fine uh but i yeah i i'm

01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:11.560
all for revisiting bubble bobble it's a fun series but i liked i i liked parasol stars and all the

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:16.360
rainbow or yeah it's parasol rainbow rainbow islands yeah parasol stars was the one where

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.440
they jump up and down on no that was rainbow islands yeah the one where they jump up and

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:25.800
they're human again parasol stars was a weird game uh cuz you know in chat says they need to

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.840
add blood effects to bubble bobble maybe uh dartitsia says i'm disappointed they haven't

01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:34.840
done a new title compilation like i know they've done some of the arcade archive ones but i don't

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:39.000
think bubble bobble has been done yet uh true i you know it's funny i think i have it sitting

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.680
right over there on the original xbox there was a title compilation it was pretty good but you're

01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:46.120
right they haven't really done one in a while which is kind of surprising i think there's a

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:51.640
mini cab like if you go to an electronics store and look in that section where the nes classic

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:57.000
and the snes classic used to be where everybody's ripping it off now like especially fries oh my

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.520
god if you have a fries in your town i know they're not everywhere but if you have a fries

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:06.120
electronics like look for that part of fries electronics it's gigantic with all these like

01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:11.400
mini consoles and things like that it's crazy fries though has been looking like an empty ass

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:17.480
warehouse lately yes i i really i fear that fries is gonna go under there yeah i went to their game

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:22.680
section the other day and i was like there's nothing here yeah it's it's uh you know they're

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:27.480
getting killed with online stuff i hope they're able to turn it around because i love fries

01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:35.480
all right anyway let's move on and uh talk uh to loki about something uh that i think is on

01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:41.640
they're saying in chat is is going something's going on with this right now yes it's so season

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:49.240
10 of fortnight uh just ended which it basically ended in a singularity so there was this event

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:53.960
that happens kind of at the end of each season um there's different like kind of almost like a cut

01:56:53.960 --> 01:57:00.600
scene event that happens so this one they launched the rocket which then ended up um going through

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:06.520
one of the rifts and eventually you saw a bunch of rockets come back and then the meteor ended up

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.320
all kind of just hitting the planet at once everything got sucked into a big black hole

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:18.120
including the entire map everything just like got sucked in and that's it the game is over for now

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:24.520
but it's funny though is even if you um try to play now you can't play in fact if you go to the

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:30.040
lobby screen to go load into it all of the lobby menu and everything gets sucked into this big

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:35.720
void and everything is gone all of the social media stuff for fortnight and everything all

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:42.040
gone all of the you know their bug fix pages all gone all of the their social media and everything

01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:48.360
is just now this this black hole basically but there's of course that's a hell of a way to take

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.800
your game down for maintenance for a day let me just say yes but there is this um there's a lot

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:59.320
of stuff going along with it so right now um they've been they have a live stream that's going

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:04.440
on with this just little portal thing so if you want something to do in the meantime which is

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:11.080
kind of cool they do have a konami code built into um the game if you actually go into the actual

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:15.320
launcher and play the game um there's that but there's been these numbers that have been flashing

01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:20.280
on the screen stuff and people have decoded the message so the message right now is i was not

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:28.040
alone others were outside the loop this was not calculated that nothing is now inevitable and so

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:34.040
the thought is that they're going to do like a fortnight chapter two by tuesday and it's going

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:38.840
to launch with a whole new map and they're going to have like different content in there as well

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:42.840
interesting but they people were worried well now am i going to lose all the progress they

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:49.000
had everything and uh playstation put out a thing saying don't worry all your v bucks and everything

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.720
are still fine all your inventory is still fine just it's like an event thing that's going on

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:58.360
right now so but right now you cannot play fortnite it's the most clever pull your game

01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:02.840
down for maintenance thing i've ever seen but think about all that lost money you know they're

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:08.360
not making money if they have the they have to shut it down to do this update anyways this is

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:16.040
the way to do you know and they've gotten the focus onto fortnite for the time being so yeah

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:20.120
all right well we'll see what develops i'm sure we'll know by tuesday if not sooner in fact

01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:23.800
actually they're seeing right now like this was uh one of the comments you know on the stream 4.5

01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:30.840
million plus on youtube 1.5 million on twitch 1 million on twitter um just the amount of people

01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:36.200
watching 50 fucking people on twitch there's 1.5 million watching a black fucking hole yeah

01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:44.840
anyway all right it's interesting i i watched the video of like what happened and even like

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:49.400
i think it was a couple seasons ago with the giant mechs and stuff was pretty awesome

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:57.400
um i don't know it's interesting all right let's move on and talk a little bit about uh a new

01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:01.480
silent hill game that's right we're going to talk about a brand new silent hill that was just

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:09.720
announced but it's not really a playstation game or an xbox game or even a freaking cell phone game

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:15.720
nope it's a brand new game that was announced at the global gaming expo in las vegas you know what

02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:21.640
that means it's a slot machine that's right silent hill escape is one of those slot machines that

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:26.040
kind of has different sides to it so that three people can play it at the same time and it's a

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:32.200
slot experience and it's talking about uh it's one of the first on konami's new video slot cabinet

02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:40.760
which is a 49 inch j curve 4k uhd display so it looks really pretty basically uh let's see it's

02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.240
a first glimpse of great things to come from konami that according to the executive vice

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:49.640
president of konami as we all know and i think we've talked about before on the show konami is

02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:54.520
no stranger to the gambling industry if you ever go to a casino um in your neck of the woods i mean

02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:59.400
i don't know what gambling laws are like in your state but we have a lot of um uh native american

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:04.680
like land here where they have casinos and uh if you ever look at the machines a lot of them are

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:08.840
by konami and have a konami logo on but i'm just surprised like this is doesn't seem like the

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:14.600
property that you would want to make out of a slot machine like i just don't like i would think of

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:20.360
anything like more of like the music based stuff like is a lot more flashier and stuff i think

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:26.760
would draw more attention than silent hill which honestly the demographic i think for a lot of like

02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:30.600
gamblers is a little bit older like i don't think they're going to know what that is keep in mind

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.000
there's a certain generation that kind of grew up with those games you know yeah but i don't think

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.120
these machines are just for they're not just for the u.s obviously there's a lot of gambling in

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:46.440
asia in um places like makao and places like that so i don't see like i already yelled over this so

02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:52.200
you already had your scream and your cry no i i yeah i pretty much did my usual tell off konami

02:01:52.200 --> 02:02:01.960
on twitter but i mean honestly it's at this point that we we can count konami is no longer a

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:11.160
a friend of gamers well i don't know because like i mean obviously they've gone lost a lot

02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:15.880
either their contour game is really shitty oh i haven't played the country yeah it's really bad

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:19.960
oh that's too bad that's too bad to hear because the castlevania those collections turned out

02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:25.000
pretty good the bomber man games people seem to be really well received and they supported it

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.400
will really well after the fact so it's a bummer if that contour game didn't turn out that great

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:35.720
but i haven't played it myself it's not yeah it's like a game that is not contra that they threw

02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:41.800
the contra name on uh captain spike in our chat hi captain spike and welcome back to our pals

02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:45.480
at gameboy.org i noticed they've had two new episodes which means they must be back on a

02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:50.680
regular schedule uh so it's good to have you guys back captain spike says been to japan parlors are

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:56.840
trending younger the ip has value so that's that's what it is you know it's just different stuff

02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:01.320
whereas like if you go to japan you're probably not going to see dolly parton machines

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:06.200
unfortunately because those machines are the ones i play every time i'm going through the vegas

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:13.880
airport um but anyway let's open up uh the discord for your calls and then also the chat room if you

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:21.960
in the you know what so yeah and i've already mentally prepared for effective i have to start

02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:30.360
all over with everything so be it well what's on your mind tonight horizon zero dawn oh yeah

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:37.720
what's that horizon zero dawn that game is so gorgeous oh my god that game is so good yeah

02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:43.640
how long ago did you play through it i haven't finished but i bought the game like the weekend

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:49.160
i got my ps4 um games i've had it for like 10 bucks so i shimmied my way over there so i was

02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:56.200
like let's see how this is 10 minutes into the game i'm like why didn't i get up here sooner for

02:05:56.200 --> 02:06:00.680
this game it's it's amazing yeah it's kind of where i'm at where i'm like wow i really should

02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:04.680
have got on this train sooner even though people were telling me to do that but it's just like no

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:13.080
i want to keep playing mmos and you know but sometimes the nice i was just saying the nice

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:17.160
thing about getting to the game late is that now all the expansions and everything are already

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:24.920
included and the thing is when somebody says something is so good and like your entire squad

02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.960
is all over the game i'm the type of person i'm like nope i don't want it i will wait i will jump

02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:40.360
onto the game order series in my own time you know so how far did you get oh god it's been a

02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:48.520
while since i played because i i have gamers add um i think i'm still on the path some path or

02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:52.440
something like that i just know i'll be able to pick up right where i left them i honestly don't

02:06:52.440 --> 02:07:01.160
remember god well i'm really gonna try to be in on this game for the long haul i want to try to

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:06.040
get really far in it maybe even beat it um i and i guess there's a whole expansion there's this

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:09.880
frozen wilds expansion i don't know how that plays into things yet i guess i'll find out when i get

02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:15.640
far enough in the game uh but yeah i definitely want to play through the game definitely oh and

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:20.200
one more thing before i go um did you get the thing that was sent to you

02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.640
oh you mean this thing right here

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:32.040
yes yes yes i did thank you very much uh for those that can't see of course because i'm uh

02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:38.840
i'm holding something up it is uh some postcards from that golden girls show a puppet parody and

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:44.040
um i'm sorry i didn't text you yesterday but when this arrived yesterday rama that was during the

02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:50.200
ingress event so i wasn't even home until like 11 o'clock last night okay cool but so tell us

02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:57.400
about the golden girls puppet parody show okay so it was about an hour hour ten they talked about

02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:06.920
um dorothy not believing into superstitions uh blanche wanting to get liposuction and sofia dying

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:11.960
did they actually take episodes of the show and do it that way or what

02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:16.840
i don't think they took from the show but they just took like some of the major plot points

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:22.120
and rolled it together with the tropes and just and it just played out so well that's fun that

02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:25.080
would be a thing i want to see if it's still going in new york when i'm there because i'm

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:31.480
going to be in new york in like three weeks four weeks i know but they just finished up out of new

02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:43.160
help coming up with cosplay because none of my costumes fit anymore i'm kind of starting to know

what that feels all right take care rama have a good one you too all right we're gonna so yeah

02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:56.120
i'm apparently making it to derpy con next year after working on the book for six years you should

02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:00.760
go it'd be fun all right hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is act deaf

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:06.600
hey act deaf it's good to hear from you what's up well i kind of wanted to talk about the blizzard

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:12.600
thing but it well most of what you said everyone has said already has been said so it's like kind

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:18.600
of redundant so fair enough i want to talk about something uh that don't know if you talked about

02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:26.600
last week but uh pokemon go and the the ticket they're gonna sell for for an event i don't know

02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:32.520
if you talked about uh that already no not really i may have touched on it but i didn't really super

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:37.880
get into it and can i just also say about pokemon go i couldn't do trap inch day because the ingress

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.520
thing was at the same time now both those games are niantic and a lot of people that play ingress

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:46.440
play pokemon go why the hell did they schedule those two things at the same time it's so

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:51.720
irritating i tried to do some trap inch catching with my bluetooth but i didn't get any shinies

02:10:53.000 --> 02:11:02.120
boo hoo um well i know isn't that bad garbage mon anyway so i don't even like the evolutions

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:07.400
so whatever all right anyway the shiny does look great but okay uh tell us uh from your perspective

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.600
so so if i'm not mistaking that nothing official has been announced this is all through data mining

02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:16.920
which i think is important to note because that means subject to change but apparently they're

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:23.160
looking at doing potentially a raid for a generation five legendary pokemon that may be

02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:28.840
something that you have to pay for a virtual ticket to do so it would be like oh you can do like a go

02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:33.480
fest wherever you are in the world which we know they have the capability of doing because when

02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:38.440
they had all those issues at go fest was it last year the year before you had the ability to do a

02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:43.080
makeup day wherever you were in the world and those those mobs would spawn where you're at

02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:47.400
so they're talking about you know through the data mining doing something like that where you'd buy a

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:53.400
ticket to a virtual festival and you might be able to catch a special gen 5 legendary with this

02:11:53.400 --> 02:12:01.160
virtual ticket yeah basically the gist of it is there on the 15 at least uh it seems that they're

02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:08.440
gonna launch this ticket a colossal can i remember the the exact name but it's colossal ticket or

02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:15.480
something like that and the thing is yeah most people are thinking about this is gonna be a

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:23.240
ticket uh uh kind of rate a ticket for uh dredgy gigas which is one of the legendary pokemon from

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:30.760
the four generation and probably probably but it's not necessarily confirmed uh there's gonna be

02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:39.400
tied to a go fest safari zone type event that if you buy the ticket you will get like a special

02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:46.120
uh research task like with yurashi mu celiby and all that all those more pokemon

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:52.760
uh you're gonna get something like that and that like uh when you complete all the tasks you will

02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:59.240
get uh probably the chance to uh to get ready gigas it's not necessarily confirmed and again

02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:06.520
like you said it's all that data mining but uh i was gonna ask you because this uh something

02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:13.160
kind of similar happened with ingress you already talked about this i think but what's your opinion

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:19.880
on on something like this like another paid event from niantic this time with pokemon go which is

02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:26.120
kind of more popular well they have to make money right niantic's got to pay for their employees

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:30.600
they got to keep the lights on right so we can't expect that everything is going to be 100 free in

02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:36.040
these games and i get that but sometimes and where i've taken issue with niantic especially in ingress

02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:41.160
is the way that they tell people you know people plan for months to do these things like anomalies

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:46.520
or you know pokemon go fest or whatever the case is and so uh the thing i got really agitated with

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:51.240
niantic about was that they announced a month before the anomaly 30 days before that oh by the

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.560
way if you want to get a badge that proved you participated in the anomaly you're gonna have to

02:13:55.560 --> 02:14:01.560
pay for it which they've never done before never ever and there's people that will be here on the

02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:07.160
ground playing in sacramento or wherever the anomaly is there's also lots of people helping

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.880
in other places around the world because somebody's got to be like like looking at the

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:15.560
bird's eye view telling people where to go and what they see because you can only see so much

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:19.320
around you on the ground you can see more stuff from the air and there's other ways people can

02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:25.480
support remotely as well and niantic wanted to charge those people too and look i understand they

02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:31.480
got to make money okay fine so they want to charge a fee to you know do these things but give tell

02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:35.880
people give them better notice give them proper more advanced notice about it and we have this

02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:41.400
whole issue with the 1.0 scanner was just it's gone the 1.0 scanner or redacted is gone it's

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:47.320
only prime now so this anomaly we did yesterday was all in ingress prime i kind of think the

02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:52.920
people that hate ingress prime aren't giving it enough of a chance or are looking through redacted

02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:57.640
a little bit too much with rose colored glasses because let me tell you especially on ios redacted

02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:02.440
had a shit ton of issues too like i have not been able to upload stats to agent stats until they

02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.320
finally got it in prime because redacted you couldn't do it it had so many issues um but

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:13.240
anyway i digress um i also understand a lot of people want to use this just as their reason to

02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.240
quit ingress when they need a reason to get off the game and that's fine too you know whatever

02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:23.960
whatever the case is back to the issue of uh paying for particular raid monsters or whatever

02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:29.800
in pokemon go i think a lot of it is in the way they announcement announce it if they do this

02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:34.040
announcement where they go it's coming out tomorrow and you got to pay 10 bucks to do it

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:39.880
that's going to be really shitty and i'm going to be kind of upset but if they announce it's going

02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:44.440
to be happening on november 15th or something like that let's say they announced it this week

02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:50.040
and they say it's going to happen on november 15th and you can purchase it with in-game currency

02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:57.800
i think that's all right because that gives you plenty of time to start saving up those gym coins

02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:03.240
and you can buy a ticket that way if you like um or if you're just lazy or a casual player then

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:06.840
fine maybe you'll pony up the 10 bucks and participate that way but at least you'll have

02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:11.240
a little more choice and you'll have time to decide what you want to do to make that choice

02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:18.200
um but that would be the way i would prefer to see them do it is via in-game gold which you can

02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:22.440
technically earn for free it's just that it would be kind of shitty if they don't give you an

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:29.240
opportunity to start saving that's all and and yeah that's one of the things that the other thing

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:35.480
that kind of bothers me is that we don't know exactly what is going to be the event

02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:42.760
it may be just a rate pass and if it's a eight dollar eight rate pass for a pokemon that's

02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:47.800
probably not going to be that great either that's the thing that's worrying a lot because

02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:53.320
because the ticket is going to be like on sale for like at least two weeks and the event is

02:16:53.320 --> 02:17:00.040
scheduled to be on the second on november 2nd so that gives people time that that's okay

02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:06.520
but the thing for me at least the the thing that worries me is how they're gonna do the event what

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:13.000
the event is going to be because if it's only like okay you're gonna get a special access for access

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.880
to to regigigas and again that pokemon isn't that great either it's not something that you're

02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:27.640
probably gonna use even on raids or other like in even pvp so it's like it's useless but mostly

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:33.240
it's useless it's gonna be it's gonna look great but it's gonna be useless yeah so again if it if

02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:39.960
it's tied to a go fest safari zone type event i think that's gonna be like really really great

02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:47.080
especially for people like in rural areas that which still with the spawn changes that have

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:52.520
happened in the past in the past few weeks they still have problems and they and people like

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.120
would really actually like i i would actually be glad to pay the the eight dollars or how

02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:04.280
how much uh it's gonna be in mexico for for this even if i have to pay up money up front or with

02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:10.920
uh in-game currency it's gonna be okay on my part uh if it's done like that but if it's just like

02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:16.920
that rate pass like a normal rate pass for this pokemon in particular yeah i'm just gonna skip on

02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:22.040
it because it's not gonna be that worth it right i kind of think you know again this is kind of the

02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:26.280
problem with data mining in some ways is that you know you see the beginning point you see the end

02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:31.880
point and we're left to fill in the gaps with either our fantasies or based on what we think

02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:35.320
they've done before they're going to do again i mean there's a million different ways you connect

02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:40.600
point a to point b but we don't really know until niantic says something so i'm going to give them

02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:45.720
the benefit of the doubt and not make too many decisions about it until we hear the bottom line

02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:50.600
and niantic says this is what it is this is what we're selling it's a virtual festival

02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:55.880
that you know climaxes with this pokemon or whatever i i just need to hear the details and

02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:00.280
then i can really kind of make a fair assessment but um i think it's a fair question to ask you

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:05.560
know how does niantic continue to make money especially when ingress is having a lot of

02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:09.560
issues right now a lot of the player base seems to not be into it and you know they're they're

02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:16.520
having problems having that game make money harry potter well i think it's doing okay it's not at

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:23.720
nearly at the same level pokemon go is not by a mile so who knows maybe there'll be more games

02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:27.160
in the future i'm sure i'm sure that's inevitable there's gonna be even more niantic games in the

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:33.000
future but we'll see and that's the thing pokemon go is already making tons of money so it's like

02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:40.280
do they really need more but yeah they do well and to be fair technically harry potter is not

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:44.840
really niantic's game yes niantic has a stake in it that's really that's really warner brothers

02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:48.520
game portkey you know that's you know that's why their logos show up in the beginning of the game

02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:53.240
too niantic's just providing that location database and maybe you know helped him out

02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:56.520
with some of the map coding and things like that but ultimately that game really kind of

02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:00.920
wrestled warner brothers so anyway uh i'm gonna let you go my friend so we can wrap up but thanks

02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:05.160
so much for the call appreciate it hey thanks for having me like always you're welcome take care

02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:22.120
before we wrap up and uh call it a night do we have any last minute stories um this isn't really

02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:28.600
much of anything but it's the producer of simpsons hit and run so he's up for a remake of the game so

02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:37.160
we'll see if they ever get the license to do that um that's about it okay fair enough

02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:42.680
then i think we'll uh go around and start to wrap up for the night and get folks final thoughts uh
