00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Since your last spoke, the gaming storefront and launcher world is getting a little bit

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,840
smaller with EA choosing to relinquish their exclusivity.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,440
Balance has shifted in the force.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,800
This is just one headline to catch up on.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,920
Stay tuned for the rest of the stories we have time for starting right now on the show

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,240
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,160
where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,040
It is Orange Lounge Radio back again, back, back, back again.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,820
Episode number 797 for this November the 3rd of 2019.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,280
My name Rob Roberts, her name DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Hi.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,760
And his name, Techmaster Loki.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Hello.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,440
We have you guys in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
tape live at the Voice of Geeks network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,400
Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,560
Insert your name here.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
That's right.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,720
So, and we appreciate of course all the hosts and all you guys that support our show.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,600
And even if you're listening on the podcast feed, welcome back.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,360
Hope you weren't thrown off by us being gone for two weeks.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,720
We'll address all that a little bit later in the show.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,700
But since we have been gone for a little bit, I want to jump right into gaming news tonight.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,540
Let's talk about BlizzCon because ironically, the last time that we did have a show, we

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,140
were kind of talking about this whole Blizzard made a big boo-boo with the banning of the

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,300
Hearthstone player and so forth.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,140
So BlizzCon happened and many folks were surprised.

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,460
I don't know if I was surprised, but I think many folks were surprised that BlizzCon opened

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,780
with a little bit of this.

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,260
Before we start the opening ceremony, I want to say a few words.

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,780
You know, Blizzard had the opportunity to bring the world together in a tough Hearthstone

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,380
esports moment about a month ago and we did not.

34
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:15,580
We moved too quickly in our decision making and then to make matters worse, we were too

35
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,260
slow to talk with all of you.

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,580
When I think about what I'm most unhappy about, there's really two things.

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:32,620
The first one is we didn't live up to the high standards that we really set for ourselves.

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,000
And the second is we failed in our purpose.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,580
And for that, I am sorry and I accept accountability.

40
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,580
So there it is.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,220
The new CEO of Blizzard, J. Allen Brack, sorry I'm butchering the last name there.

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,340
I don't have it right in front of me.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,340
And he's accepting accountability for what happened with the whole issue.

44
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,500
But to quote Jim Sterling, what are you apologizing for?

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,220
Because you're being incredibly vague about everything.

46
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,580
You're not mentioning the specific things that you did wrong and the specific things

47
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,100
that you need changed and the specific things that you're not living up to standards on.

48
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,980
You're just seeing a tough esports moment.

49
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,560
You know what the fucking thing is.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,500
It was a little weird to be so blunt.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
It's such bullshit.

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,020
It is such bullshit because they say they're apologizing about it, but are they unbanned?

53
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
Nope.

54
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,260
They are still banned.

55
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,900
So they're just they're just appeasing you because they're like, yeah, see, we're apologizing

56
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,900
for it.

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,420
Here's some new things that you like and you're totally going to forget about it months down

58
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,900
the road when this stuff comes out and you're going to purchase it anyways.

59
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,380
I understand you would like some smoke for your ass.

60
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,380
Let me blow it for you.

61
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,380
I don't know.

62
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,420
I think you guys are using harsher language than even I might.

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,700
And I took a lot of shit on Twitter this week for my stance, but I'm I'm OK with it.

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,900
You know, like, again, I'm not saying that like we need to boycott Blizzard.

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,060
That's not the word I'm choosing to use in this whole situation.

66
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,380
I am seeing other people right now.

67
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,020
That's where I am about Blizzard, because look, and in many ways, yes, it is about the

68
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,180
issue of banning Blitzchung and more so I'm at least I'm at least thankful.

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,660
That this that Jay Allen got up there and said it wasn't just what we did, but it was

70
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,180
how slow we were to respond to respond.

71
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,620
So I do want to give credit for acknowledging that, because I do feel like and I it's not

72
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,620
that I disagree with you.

73
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,620
I don't know.

74
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,620
They're pretty quick.

75
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,660
They're pretty quick to respond to the was that the college team also got banned for

76
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
six months.

77
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,660
All right.

78
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,220
And I and that's the thing is, it's like I do appreciate that at least he called that

79
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
portion of it out by name.

80
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,740
But Eddie, though, didn't shut up and let me talk.

81
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,740
But like you, I am kind of like, why don't they just call exactly what it is?

82
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,020
And for me in that, I mean, great, you accepted accountability.

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
It's a nice start.

84
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,900
But what's the real difference that's going to change?

85
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,100
And if they're not going to sit here and say, we're going to unban those casters who didn't

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,340
deserve it, even though there's some people out there that feel the casters did deserve

87
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,060
it because they feel like the casters lobbed the ball or whatever, I as as somebody who

88
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,500
has been in the position similar to what would a caster would go through lives of worth,

89
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,420
I completely disagree with that assessment.

90
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,420
That's fine.

91
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
Everybody's entitled to their opinion.

92
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,240
And that is also important to this scenario.

93
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,000
If you want to keep playing Blizzard games, go off, sis.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,340
I'm totally fine with that.

95
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
It's your money.

96
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
Spend it on how you want.

97
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,140
But for me, it's not just about what's happening or what's happened with the Blitzchung scenario.

98
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,620
That was more like the final straw for me because we're forgetting there's been a lot

99
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,380
of comedy of Blizzard errors that has been happening over the last two years, namely

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,660
the last BlizzCon and everything that happened there, namely remember when at this exact

101
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,840
same time, this was all going down, there was a guild that got banned for being called

102
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,100
gay boys because the automated system, you know, threw it out, whatever, fine blame it

103
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,060
on the automated system, but that's still like a thing that happened that shouldn't

104
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
have.

105
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,320
And it's, it's more like a culmination of all of these things.

106
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,500
And I think what really irritates me about this whole situation, this is what it really

107
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,780
is for me, is that, and it's funny because these folks, you know, on Twitter, and again,

108
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,100
I'm not trying to like shade anybody and everybody's welcome to their opinion and so forth want

109
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,100
to say, well, if you're mad at Blizzard, you should be mad at Apple.

110
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,060
You should be mad at Microsoft.

111
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,340
You should be mad at Sony and whatever other companies are having the perception of embed

112
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,420
with China.

113
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,180
And that argument, I suppose, would be something you could do if, if that is the only issue

114
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,740
I have with Blizzard.

115
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:41,180
But the problem is that it's not because what's really irritating to me, here's what it is.

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:47,480
It's that they were so fast to ban all these folks that said things about China.

117
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,420
But do you remember when that Overwatch League player made the homophobic remarks on his

118
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
stream?

119
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,580
How long did that guy get banned for?

120
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,060
Did he get a lifetime ban?

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
No.

122
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,500
Did he get a six month ban?

123
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
No.

124
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
He got a four game ban.

125
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,980
That was the equivalent of a month.

126
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,100
That is why I'm mad.

127
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Because the China thing was like way overcompensating compared to what they've done in other situations.

128
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,700
That was the straw that broke the camel's back.

129
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,860
But if you want to continue to play Blizzard games, that's fine.

130
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,160
Because I also understand there's a tricky line here.

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,700
There's many employees, many people I know that work for Blizzard that have nothing to

132
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
do with any of this.

133
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,140
In fact, they get very frustrated by this stuff as well.

134
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,820
And yeah, I don't really want to hurt those people.

135
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,280
But the reality is I already bought Diablo 3, I bought Overwatch and so forth, and I

136
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,540
just don't really see the need to continue my World of Warcraft subscription right now.

137
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,860
And not playing two MMOs right now is really great for freeing up my plate for doing other

138
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,860
things.

139
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,460
Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2, which we'll get into in a minute, because admittedly they

140
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,540
look pretty sweet.

141
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,100
I'll evaluate those games and whether I want to buy them or not when they come out.

142
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,340
They're not coming out tomorrow.

143
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,900
They're not coming out by the end of the year.

144
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,300
They're probably not coming out by summer.

145
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,780
Because where's Warcraft 3 remastered?

146
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,060
For all the shit it got, where's Diablo Immortal?

147
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,820
I think they maybe acknowledged, I think Warcraft 3 they said is doing the beta.

148
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,160
I think they acknowledged Diablo Immortal, but for all intents and purposes, those games

149
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,880
that were their big flagship things last year, for better or for far, far worse, still

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,800
aren't out.

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,220
So we have a whole year at least.

152
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,080
Did they say that these games, because I saw a tweet that was something like, wow, all

153
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,040
these games are coming out in 2020, Blizzard's got a huge year ahead.

154
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,960
Did they say these games are coming out in 2020?

155
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't think so.

156
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I don't think they did.

157
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,360
And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in chat.

158
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,200
I don't think they said, I would imagine the Warcraft expansion, yeah, it's got to be because

159
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,620
that's their timetable.

160
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,740
And maybe one of these games, probably Overwatch 2 is going to be next year.

161
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
That's a guess.

162
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,620
But is it all coming next year?

163
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,860
I don't necessarily think so.

164
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,420
Blizzard don't always work on those types of timetables.

165
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,900
Again, it's been a year.

166
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,300
Where's Warcraft 3 remastered?

167
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,380
Where's Diablo Immortal?

168
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,200
Those games still aren't out.

169
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,100
So that's where it is for me.

170
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,260
Blizzard, we're seeing other people for a little bit and I'm going to continue to see

171
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,440
other people.

172
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,900
Let's see how you do in the next year.

173
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,840
Let's see the action behind those words that you just said.

174
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,100
And then in a year when these games are out, I'll decide what I want to do.

175
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,100
But more importantly though, at the very end of his little apology, if you will, he talked

176
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,900
about like, we have players from, you know, around the world, like, you know, I want to

177
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,500
say like 69 countries or 65 countries or whatever in there, or they're talking about their company

178
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,020
and stuff and about people everywhere around the world and that they want those voices

179
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,500
heard.

180
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,460
Except if it's about China, in which case then we're going to ban your ass.

181
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,140
Well, did you notice though that, okay, so there was a panel and I forgot to grab the

182
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,020
video of it, but there was a panel, somebody posted this in our discord actually, so shout

183
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,140
out to vognetwork.com slash discord because it's actually where I first saw it.

184
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,500
There actually was a World of Warcraft Q and A panel where somebody asked this question

185
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,300
and then at the very end of it said, you know, free Hong Kong revolution of our times.

186
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,580
The exact same quote that got Blitzchung in trouble, he said that right at the end of

187
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,380
his question, then promptly walked off and sat down and the host just kind of had one

188
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,900
of those like smiles, like not, yep, this is what they taught me in training might happen

189
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,140
and just kind of smiled and acknowledged it and moved on.

190
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,420
Like they just kind of, it was very obvious they had a game plan for what they were going

191
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,500
to do if a Hong Kong thing started and it was going to be very much shut the fuck up

192
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,460
and just let it take its course and then get the, get the car moving again because that's

193
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,460
exactly what that hosted.

194
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,860
And then there was, there were, it got awkward.

195
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,300
I thought what the guy did was very like, just very like bam, just slap, like just thwack

196
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,140
the table and then left.

197
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,180
Then there, I thought it was a little awkward cause then somebody kind of tried to piggyback

198
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
on that.

199
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
It was like free Hong Kong, free Hong Kong.

200
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,780
And there was like dancing in front of the camera.

201
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,780
And then the guy said, did you have anything you want to say?

202
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,540
And it said free Hong Kong.

203
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,020
And I, I feel like the second individual kind of messed up that opportunity a little bit.

204
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,540
And you know, when the adrenaline's going, there's a lot of things you do.

205
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,340
It just, the second person came off a little bit more immature.

206
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,560
I think the first one was very cool and calculated.

207
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,020
The second one was very much like Muppet Flail and it didn't read very well at all, but again,

208
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,380
the way they responded to it very much the host, would you like to say anything that

209
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,060
did it like very, like they knew that was, there was very much an action plan for that

210
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,540
scenario and you saw it play out there as kind of awkward-ish as it was.

211
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:41,900
So which that's better than maybe like cutting away and trying to shut it down and everything.

212
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,600
So I'll give them that, like they seem to be learning in that regard.

213
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,580
You know, they didn't, they didn't try to like shut it down completely.

214
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
I suppose.

215
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,580
I don't know.

216
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,140
Anyway, I do want to get to some comments in our chat Questbuster over at a Twitch TV

217
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,500
slash a VOG network says on Rob's note about Blizzard employees feeling frustrated.

218
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,060
A few of them did stage a small walkout of their own on campus when this broke.

219
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,780
Yes, very important to note.

220
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,180
And I think that is so cool.

221
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,720
And I really applaud those folks because you know what?

222
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,680
Angry internet dorks only go so far like that type of behavior.

223
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,120
That's what's really going to affect the change.

224
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,620
So when you know that those people on the inside are really on your side too, that is

225
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,060
a really, really good feeling.

226
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,500
So I fully support what those guys are doing.

227
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,760
And I think, I think that's, that's fantastic.

228
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,760
And hopefully the change will continue from within.

229
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,860
You know, I guess I can talk a little more openly about this now because I used to work

230
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,760
in for many years, I no longer work in, I worked in the health insurance industry.

231
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,140
And believe me, I've heard a lot of shit about health insurance over the years.

232
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,440
It is a pretty messed up system.

233
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,000
But you know what, all I could really do in that scenario, I had to do what I could do

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,200
from the inside to try to make it better for the customers to try to make it better for

235
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,240
people to understand to try to make sure that people weren't getting screwed over and all

236
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,560
that type of stuff.

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,160
Sometimes it's, it's the folks on the inside have to kind of do what they can.

238
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,680
But every like big fuck up that's ever happened in gaming, it happened in a boardroom somewhere.

239
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,600
It didn't happen because some hard working developer that's working crunch time and all

240
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,000
that stuff, you know, decided they were going to screw something up.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,520
Anyway, let me get to more comments.

242
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,800
SG100Matt says, we all know what they were talking about in reference to Jay Allen's

243
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
speech there.

244
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,320
They admitted to acting too quickly.

245
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
They admitted to acting too slowly to speak.

246
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,000
Do they really need to name names?

247
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
In my opinion, I don't think so.

248
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,680
It's going to take a long time for Blizzard to win back people's trust and rightfully

249
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
so.

250
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,920
But this apology is a start.

251
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
They need to act and not use nice words and heartfelt speeches.

252
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,440
They need to do more and prove to us they will be better to win back our trust.

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Exactly.

254
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,540
And the way I see it as much as Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 do look great, and I hope, I hope

255
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,920
they do make better and do better so I can feel good about supporting those games and

256
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,480
supporting my friends that work at the company.

257
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,920
I don't feel the need to pre-purchase today.

258
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,560
Is that so wrong?

259
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,880
Don't feel the need to pre-purchase the new WoW expansion today, which believe me is something

260
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
you can do.

261
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
You want to get your level 60?

262
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
Because it's 60 again because everybody's getting a squish.

263
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,860
You want to get your level 60 WoW character boost right now?

264
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,680
You can pre-purchase Shadowlands today.

265
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,720
I just, maybe not now.

266
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Maybe not, not today.

267
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,120
Anyway, let's see, trying to go to some other comments here.

268
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,060
Questbuster in chat says, open forum, public space, little doubt Blizzard likely drilled

269
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,700
everyone manning their stations at the con on what to expect.

270
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Absolutely.

271
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
They knew it was coming.

272
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,980
Somebody on Twitter commented that it sounded like they had a separate mic volume for the

273
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:45,900
crowd, that they had a way to kill the crowd mics and kill the crowd speech if need be.

274
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,580
Which you know, as much as you might want to say like, yo, fuck Blizzard for that type

275
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,580
of thing.

276
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,700
Like real talk y'all, there's a lot of things on TV that are like that and a lot of things

277
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,860
where if there's pre-pand...

278
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,340
I mean, even any sporting event knows how to cut away from a streaker, right?

279
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,180
Because you don't want to give the streaker attention.

280
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,100
You don't want to broadcast the booty on TV since it's running by.

281
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,740
You know, those types of things, like anybody putting on a professional presentation knows

282
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,580
how to cut away from this stuff like that.

283
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,260
So I mean, I'm not surprised to hear it.

284
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,660
It's just weird to hear it with BlizzCon, but I mean, BlizzCon is a massive media production,

285
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,020
is it not?

286
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,960
Tigerclaw is saying, was the red shirt guy back at BlizzCon?

287
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,800
I wonder what comment he made.

288
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,760
Remember his comment about Diablo Immortal being a late April Fool's joke?

289
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,580
It actually wasn't the same red shirt guy.

290
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,200
Wearing a red shirt has become some sort of interesting symbol.

291
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,240
And it's interesting that all these people that get up on the mic and do interesting

292
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,840
things are often wearing red shirts.

293
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,720
But believe it or not, the guy who asked the lore question started the whole red shirt

294
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
thing.

295
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,680
The guy who said, is this an April Fool's joke?

296
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,480
And the guy who just said free Hong Kong are all different red shirt guys.

297
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
I wish I had a graphic.

298
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,800
This is a more professional TV operation, I'd have a graphic that would show them side

299
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
by side.

300
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,440
Lore nerd, guy making shitty comment, guy saying free Hong Kong.

301
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,720
Very different people.

302
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:16,280
Anyway, anything else you guys want to say about the apology and all that stuff?

303
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,600
Darsakha, Loki, I know I've said a lot there, I want to open it up to you guys too.

304
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,160
It's just vague corporate speak.

305
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
That's seriously what it is.

306
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,520
There's no good way for them to get out of it.

307
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Really there's not.

308
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,400
They fucked up, they've kept fucking up, and they're trying to do distraction tactics.

309
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,520
Now it's this sort of fake accountability thing.

310
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,220
And I don't believe words anymore, I believe actions.

311
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,480
I want to see action before I remotely even consider anything else.

312
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,520
Because as it stands, I'm pretty done with Blizzard.

313
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,880
I was already done with WoW in general, and now I'm done, done.

314
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:05,080
No, this is definitely one of the final straws for me, especially exactly for the same reason

315
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
that you said.

316
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:13,000
And remember, every time there's a controversy, even with Bethesda, they always give the,

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,900
we're going to do better, we need to do better, it's not up to our expectations.

318
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,840
Everybody has that fucking line.

319
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,000
It doesn't fucking matter what they say, it's about what they do.

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So let's see them do something about it, because right now they haven't done shit.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,380
And in regards to people comparing company A to company B to whatever, I look at the

322
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,120
past record and look at the integrity.

323
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,040
Has this company actually made good on what they say?

324
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,520
If they found something has gone awry with their services or whatever, how quickly were

325
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,740
they to make a change?

326
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,540
So that being said, I don't really care about anyone throwing out comparisons.

327
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
What about this?

328
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,540
What about that?

329
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,240
That is a fallacious argument in and of itself.

330
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,660
And trust me, if you want me to list the general fallacious arguments and why I don't respect

331
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,980
them, I can do that in another time.

332
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,500
But it is inherently a fallacious argument.

333
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,060
The only thing that you can look at is the company itself, what it is doing, and only

334
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,100
compare it to its own actions.

335
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,460
End of story.

336
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I saw a very interesting tweet that was very kind of like this kind of like shady thing

337
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,780
that was like, and it didn't name names, but I could, you know, sometimes you got to feel

338
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,980
the, you feel the shade a little bit, right?

339
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,260
It's like that, that gif of the shade moving over the city.

340
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,740
And it was something like, interesting all of these people tweeting their criticisms

341
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,040
of Blizzard from their iPhones when Apple has done all this stuff too.

342
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,340
And I'm like, okay, look, I can, I can understand why folks may have a criticism of Apple and

343
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
China.

344
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
That's fine.

345
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,180
And that is your choice to make.

346
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,180
That's fine.

347
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,020
I'm going to tell you why I didn't make that choice, because it's not the same thing.

348
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,380
I just said Blizzard's thing is a history of these things going on.

349
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,140
And it's also the Apples and, or excuse me, the, the what happened here versus what that

350
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
happened there.

351
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,780
And there was a big disconnect between the two bands and what happened there, despite

352
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,420
all this other stuff in between.

353
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,300
With Apple, yes, I realized they pulled an app that, you know, was very controversial,

354
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,820
but for what it's worth, at least when it happened immediately, Tim Cook put out, the

355
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,560
CEO put out a statement saying, this is why we did it.

356
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,460
This is the policy that it broke.

357
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,800
And this is what it was.

358
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,180
They didn't wait a week.

359
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,900
They said, here's the word straight from the top when it happened.

360
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,860
Now I'm not like, again, if you have decided you can't support Apple because of that or

361
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,100
whatever, that's fine.

362
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,060
That's your call to make and so forth.

363
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:42,940
But I just want to say where this is not the same as this in my viewpoint.

364
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,340
And I think to kind of throw out there that like, oh, you got to ban all these companies

365
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,300
because they all do business in China.

366
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,380
Yo, China's got 1 billion people.

367
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,400
Of course, everybody wants to do business in China.

368
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,660
But again, it's about how you do that business.

369
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,840
And again, you know, when this ban doesn't match that ban, and so on and so on.

370
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:10,560
Is it as much of a crime to say free Hong Kong as it is to say F A G G O T on a stream?

371
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:18,040
So you know, that's, that's, that's why I feel for me that argument doesn't work.

372
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,040
And also one other thing I'd say about that whole thing is that Apple, I don't mean, it

373
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,960
could be Apple, it could be Microsoft, it could be Samsung, it could be, you know, and

374
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
insert whoever you want here.

375
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,040
That is a device that I use to stay in contact with family and all that stuff.

376
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,240
We're talking about that versus a video game.

377
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,320
One is a little more easier to cut out than the other.

378
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,600
I think that's why you have so much activism against Chick-fil-A, for example.

379
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,620
It's really easy to cut out fast food.

380
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,420
I don't want to dive down that whole well right now, but I think that's what makes that

381
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,760
particular boycott really easy.

382
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,160
It's fast food.

383
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,480
Most people shouldn't be eating it anyway.

384
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,920
Anyhow, other comments in chat.

385
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:09,120
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network, a zet in our chat says, watch what they do, not

386
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
what they say.

387
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,300
Very, very well said.

388
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
That's exactly what it is.

389
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,200
And we've got, and what I'm trying to say is, look, y'all, we've got like a year.

390
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,540
So Blizzard's got a whole chance to be awesome.

391
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,800
And I will say that little rainbow pan, at least that he was wearing, that was cool.

392
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,960
That was a nice gesture.

393
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,160
That's a little baby step.

394
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
That's a cool thing.

395
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Yay.

396
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,000
But we got a ways to go.

397
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
All right.

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Anyway, fifth dream today in chat says other companies make phones, you guys.

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes.

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,280
And I've seen every single one of those other companies used in a don't support X company

401
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
because China.

402
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
You name it.

403
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Samsung, there's a reason.

404
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Google, there's a reason.

405
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
Microsoft, you still using a Windows phone?

406
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
There's a reason.

407
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,040
Everybody's got a reason.

408
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,320
I would also look at, and just back to that, look at all of these various companies' interactions

409
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,120
with the government where they operate out of, and also look at the action.

410
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Just saying.

411
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
All right.

412
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,340
Let's get back to games because, you know, let's talk about the games that were announced

413
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,340
at BlizzCon.

414
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,360
Because I will say, of course, you know, despite all this stuff, I still want to be, I'm still

415
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,580
a fan of gaming.

416
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,560
And I got to say, some of these games look pretty darn cool.

417
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,100
Let's talk first about Overwatch 2.

418
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,860
So on Twitch right now, we're playing some of the gameplay trailer that they put out

419
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,300
for Overwatch 2, which shows some of the new features that are going to be in the game,

420
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,860
such as there's a new Toronto map, but it looks like they're kind of reusing some maps,

421
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,140
but they are going to be some new modes.

422
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,420
They've kind of redone what the characters look like.

423
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,620
There's going to be more of a focus on PvE.

424
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,340
Didn't I say before that if Overwatch were to ever do an expansion, they could do something

425
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,660
on PvE?

426
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Just saying.

427
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
Yes.

428
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,780
I'm not trying to be that guy that's like, I was right.

429
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,820
But anyway.

430
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,300
And then they're revealing a new hero in this trailer as well, a new type of map that you

431
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,260
can fight on, like a push map, which is actually really funny.

432
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,220
Blizzard is a master at putting together these types of trailers.

433
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,560
You'll notice I'm not showing this.

434
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,660
I love this part of the trailer, the push mode where the little robot is like, I am

435
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,140
really good at pushing, like says these, it's really cute.

436
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,220
It's very Disney and it's very, very well done.

437
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,180
And you can't help but get goosebumps when you see something like this.

438
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,620
I mean, and if you're an Overwatch fan, I mean, double so.

439
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,260
This looks really, really, really good, I got to say.

440
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,500
You know, especially if you're an Overwatch fan.

441
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Very interesting though.

442
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Oh, and there we go.

443
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,620
And you know, a lot of folks out there saying, when are we going to get a black woman in

444
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,780
Overwatch?

445
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,860
And there we have people of color, women in Overwatch.

446
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,260
We don't have a black woman in Overwatch, but Blizzard did announce they're going to

447
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,860
handle that with us, is her name Sojour, Sojourne.

448
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,860
When are we going to goose in Overwatch, dammit?

449
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,060
I want the goose.

450
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
The goose?

451
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
The goose has to be in Overwatch.

452
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Oh, for the goose game?

453
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Yes.

454
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,540
I think the goose would be better suited for Smash.

455
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Just saying.

456
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
All the games.

457
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
I don't care.

458
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
All of them.

459
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,380
Smash, Pokemon, Animal Crossing.

460
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,180
It turns out the goose is doing the pushing on the new Toronto map.

461
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Anyway.

462
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,340
Uh, but no, I will say the game looks really good.

463
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:25,180
Here was the hot take I had on Twitter that, um, I don't know, I, I said that Overwatch

464
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:32,140
2, well, okay, here's why, because they mentioned, oh, if you have Overwatch 1, you can play

465
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,220
with people in Overwatch 2 and Overwatch 1 will still get the new heroes and it'll still

466
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,700
get, I think some of the new stuff, but it's not going to get the new play modes.

467
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,240
It's not going to have, like some stuff is still going to be locked out.

468
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,960
And I was kind of like, you know why this is so easy for Overwatch 2 to be cross play

469
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,880
with Overwatch 1, because it's an expansion.

470
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,460
It's a really well branded expansion to Overwatch 1.

471
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,200
That's not a bad thing, y'all.

472
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Don't come for me.

473
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Okay.

474
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
I didn't send for you.

475
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Okay.

476
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
It's, it's not a bad thing.

477
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,160
And I think we see this type of thing happen quite often in the sports game world, right?

478
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,920
But an Overwatch is a giant e-sport.

479
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,000
You know, who's an expert at reselling old content.

480
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,560
I'll give you a hint.

481
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,280
It's part of the company name.

482
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,840
So that's a, that's an Activision playbook.

483
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Yeah. Right.

484
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,800
Um, so you know what I, I, and maybe under the hood, maybe it is a sequel, maybe it is

485
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,580
an all new graphical engine or something under the hood.

486
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,680
I'm glad that at least letting your like, you know, skins and stuff transfer over because

487
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,560
if it were Activision, it would just make you buy those things again.

488
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,960
But I, you know, well, and you know, hello, let's celebrate that.

489
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,100
That is something to note.

490
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,040
And I think it is, it, I will say this, that's actually not shade.

491
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,480
What I'm saying there is that, oh, Overwatch 2 is kind of like an expansion for Overwatch

492
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
1.

493
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,120
It actually does seem like the smart and only possible way to not so much fragment the fan

494
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,600
base, especially when you're still trying to push this Overwatch league thing.

495
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,900
And how is the Overwatch league going to, like, let's say Overwatch 2 did come out and

496
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,040
it was a completely new engine, completely new game.

497
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,800
Didn't work with the first game or anything because it's all new stuff.

498
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,400
It would be like, how would you, which game would they play in Overwatch league?

499
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,720
What would, how would they sell it?

500
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,160
Like would they just completely leave Overwatch 1 behind and say, oh, it's all about that

501
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Overwatch 2 shit.

502
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,360
Now I don't understand if the Overwatch loyalists features that they're adding are PvE.

503
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Who cares?

504
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,560
Like if it fragments, it's not, I love the PvE stuff.

505
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,520
But yeah, but like, I don't see how this would, this wouldn't be any different than

506
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,760
just selling an expansion except now they can sell it for like $40 instead of $20.

507
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,800
Well, and there are there to be fair, it's not solely PvE because there are new PvP map

508
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:01,040
types and those will be, uh, locked such as a new map and world of Warcraft will be locked

509
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,880
if you don't get the shadow lands expansion when that comes out, because that's how expansions

510
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,000
work cash grab to me.

511
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,760
I actually completely disagree with as critical as I've been a blizzard.

512
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,520
I don't say, I don't think it's a cash grab.

513
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,200
I think this is very blizzards model.

514
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,880
They do, they do expansions with Diablo all the time.

515
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,160
They do expansions with world of Warcraft.

516
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,960
They do expansions with Warcraft 3.

517
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,160
No, no, I'm not saying that I'm not saying that's wrong that they do an expansion.

518
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm talking about, yes, I have Overwatch 1.

519
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I buy an expansion for the adds additional content to the game.

520
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,400
Yes, I understand what an expansion is.

521
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,120
This is, hey, you like this game while you want the additional content to re-buy the

522
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,480
whole fucking game again is what I mean.

523
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,440
I actually don't think it's that at all because they are saying the original Overwatch will

524
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,600
still get the new heroes and enough to be cross compatible with Overwatch 2.

525
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,760
It's just if you want these extra PvE, you want these extra new skins, you want these

526
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,920
new PvP modes, then you're going to have to buy this expansion, which is called 2.

527
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:17,200
Arguably this expansion is going to be the cost of a full game versus what I feel DLC

528
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,000
would be priced at.

529
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,240
I'm going to some comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network and Bobby does say clearly

530
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
they didn't announce price.

531
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
I figured they did because again, we're a year out.

532
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,120
I mean, games prices may change overall in a year, who knows at least.

533
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,560
Matt Defton chat says PvE is what Overwatch needed so badly.

534
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,800
Fifth Dream Today says just pull a DOA and make 3000 of the same DLC for the next game.

535
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,960
S2100 Matt says the PvE stuff they did in Overwatch was one was only for a limited time

536
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,280
and was limited in what they did with it.

537
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,640
From what they are showing, this broadens everything.

538
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,120
Quest Buster says, speaking of fragmentation, Activision also wanted to avoid fragmenting

539
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,360
the base with the new Modern Warfare and the upcoming content with free maps and no season

540
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
passes.

541
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,000
Ooh, I like this comment from Matt Deft who says what we suggested on GFM cast is that

542
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,520
probably Overwatch one is going free to play or that Overwatch two will include Overwatch

543
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
one for free.

544
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,320
Well, I think it kind of has to.

545
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,480
I think Overwatch two by default kind of has to, but I really like that theory that Overwatch

546
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
one might just straight up go free to play.

547
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,480
I don't think it will.

548
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,880
I I'm not going to be so quick to shoot that theory down.

549
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,080
I'm not going to say, Oh, you're right.

550
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
You're right.

551
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,440
I don't think it'll happen at the same time.

552
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,440
I think Overwatch two will come out first.

553
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,280
Then maybe after a year, that might be like the long-term plan.

554
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,280
I could see that, but I don't know.

555
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
We'll see.

556
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,640
So that's Overwatch two.

557
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,120
You know, again, Blizzard does a great job at putting together the trailers, really kind

558
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,480
of hit you in the feels with all that stuff.

559
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,040
And you know, yeah, like I, I would love to play the PvE stuff in Overwatch, quite frankly.

560
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
So I'm curious to hear more about that.

561
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,320
And then of course, the other big reveal, the thing I didn't grab video for was World

562
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,040
of Warcraft Shadowlands, just because, you know, we do have a lot, a lot, a lot of news

563
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,040
to get into tonight, so I can't do all the BlizzCon stuff, but yes, there is a new World

564
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,200
of Warcraft expansion coming.

565
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
It's called Shadowlands.

566
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,840
You know, it's going to allow you to level your character from 50 to 60.

567
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Why?

568
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,120
Because the level squish is incoming.

569
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,080
So a current level 120 character will be squished to level 50.

570
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,880
And it's going to be very interesting because apparently you're going to level to 10 in

571
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
a new zone.

572
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,280
And then from 10 to 50, you can level in any of the expansions because it was getting to

573
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,320
be too much.

574
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,820
Like I kind of figured this had to be coming.

575
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,920
Like Warcraft has had so many expansions now that like, if you want to level an alt, it

576
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,860
can really be a slog.

577
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,400
So I actually think this is a good thing.

578
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,760
It's just going to be interesting to see how this plays out.

579
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,400
But they're saying that everything, I mean, like you're not going to get screwed out of

580
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,760
being able to hunt for transmog gear and stuff.

581
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,880
Like you can still run the old dungeons and really overpower it.

582
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,160
I think the official lines was something like, we want the level ups to feel more meaningful

583
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,120
in scale and blah, blah, blah.

584
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,680
But the reality is like, it's like if they had up the level cap to 130, it's too fucking

585
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
much.

586
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,840
This takes too long and it's too much of a slog through old ass expansions.

587
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
So you know what?

588
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,240
I honestly think this is actually a better idea.

589
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
So cool.

590
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,320
Anyway, but the other big game that was announced, of course, was finally Diablo 4.

591
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,100
And here's some gameplay of Diablo 4 that they showed, which, you know, looks very similar

592
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,480
to any other Diablo game I've seen.

593
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,080
But it just, you know, you can see the years of upgraded graphics and so forth.

594
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,240
A lot of people are talking about how the new Diablo has like a darker tone.

595
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't know if I, I guess, I mean, it's, I think people hate on Diablo 3 too much,

596
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,320
to be quite honest.

597
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't think what I'm seeing in this Diablo 4 is like some massive color palette shift

598
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,260
from Diablo 3.

599
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,520
I don't see that.

600
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,440
What I do see is riding horsies and I do see the druid shifting into a bear, which looked

601
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
really cool.

602
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,980
And I think a lot of those classes are coming back and yeah, I mean, I, I've always been

603
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,200
a big fan of the Diablo games.

604
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,500
It took a little bit for Diablo 3 to get there, but it got there and it's really fun to play.

605
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,140
And I'm curious to hear more about Diablo 4.

606
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,940
I think it is still like really early on me again, it looks really good.

607
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,140
We see things in the snow and, you know, we do see like a real kind of varied amount of

608
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,520
different environments that the Diablo game is taking place in.

609
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,940
So that does seem really cool.

610
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,500
I think one thing that they did very well in Diablo 3 was that they really created this

611
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,540
end game in the expansion with running the rifts and all that stuff that of course they

612
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,260
didn't really have time to get into with this Diablo 4 discussion and everything that they

613
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,380
were showing at BlizzCon with Diablo 4.

614
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,580
You know, because there's just so much to get into with the game and they probably want

615
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,020
to focus a little bit on the story mode and the base and the demo that people were going

616
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,500
to play while they were there.

617
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,860
So they're not ready to talk about end game yet because this game is still forever out

618
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,980
and that's fine.

619
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,780
But I'm curious to hear more about that when the time gets closer.

620
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,580
But this will be the thing that I will really want to get so why I am, believe it or not,

621
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,540
really rooting for Blizzard to make those internal changes they need to take and for

622
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,260
Jay Allen to mean it when he says he's going to take accountability and shift those changes

623
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,020
the way they need to be shifted so that I can feel good about buying Diablo 4 when it

624
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,540
comes out because it does look pretty hot.

625
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,640
And honestly I'll probably buy Overwatch 2 as well with the same bullet point that

626
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,820
I put on the last one.

627
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,660
Any thoughts on Diablo 4 from you guys and our chat?

628
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,220
It looks pretty but it's more fucking Diablo.

629
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,420
But is more fucking Diablo a bad thing?

630
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:00,100
I don't know, I got bored with Diablo 3, I got bored with Diablo 2, just Diablo is kind

631
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
of boring.

632
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,340
The clicks and destruction and loot and gold, it's very soothing in a weird way.

633
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,700
It didn't gather any of my interest, it really didn't.

634
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,580
Loki, I don't think you've really ever super been into Diablo but now what I didn't show

635
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,300
here was there was a very long cinematic that was very gory and so forth.

636
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,340
And you know what, Blizzard's cinematics team always does a great job.

637
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,980
I just didn't show it here because it wasn't the game.

638
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:35,100
But it was a great announced trailer and it always baffles my mind why the Blizzard cinematics

639
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,060
team just doesn't make a movie.

640
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,380
Imagine if they had just made the World of Warcraft movie.

641
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,780
It would probably have been better than it was.

642
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,660
Honestly, it very much might have.

643
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,580
So I don't know what's up with that.

644
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,920
Thank you, now I just remembered that they made a Warcraft movie.

645
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,080
You know what movie they ought to- I liked it by the way, I liked the movie.

646
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,740
I didn't think it was terrible but here's the thing.

647
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,940
The movie they ought to make, Blizzard's cinematic team ought to make an Overwatch movie.

648
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,060
I really think that's a missed opportunity.

649
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,860
It seems ridiculous that that- maybe that's a thing that will happen in a few years.

650
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:16,780
But an Overwatch movie seems like the biggest opportunity that they're not taking.

651
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,420
I don't know why they share movies now.

652
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,140
You know who kind of picked up on that opportunity and decided to go ahead and run with that?

653
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
Riot Games.

654
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,860
Did you see their announcement?

655
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,860
No I didn't.

656
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,500
So Riot Games, they always do these really cool cinematics and music videos and stuff

657
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,220
around their League of Legends tournaments and everything.

658
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:40,820
So now they have their animation studio working on a series called Arcane which is their animated

659
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,180
series that kind of ties in all the cinematics that they've been doing.

660
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,620
But they do some pretty awesome stuff.

661
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,780
I remember the KDA music video and everything and they've had a bunch of cool things that

662
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
they put out.

663
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,380
So I'm looking forward to anything that they've done.

664
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,860
But yes, they should do that too.

665
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,660
I think it would be very fitting.

666
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Agree.

667
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,260
Now I want to get into something else that was posted on our Discord actually.

668
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,140
I want to talk a little bit about this.

669
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,860
So a shout out for our Discord server at voggenetwork.com slash Discord because sometimes you guys post

670
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
stories there.

671
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,300
This is kind of like a completely different note.

672
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,500
It's not necessarily about BlizzCon itself but I thought this was very interesting.

673
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,780
I wanted to get your guys' take on this including in our chat room.

674
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,260
But it's a story about the Overwatch 2 leak.

675
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,940
Now we've been off for the past two weeks so we did not get a chance to talk about the

676
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,940
leaks.

677
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,540
But I think most of you generally know at this point that it was pretty much out there

678
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,420
that Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 were going to be happening because there was an ESPN related

679
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
leak with Overwatch.

680
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,980
There was like a foreign guide art book or something that leaked the Diablo 4.

681
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,060
But we knew these things were coming, right?

682
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,380
But there was an interesting interview with Jeff Kaplan who of course is the creative

683
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,100
guy behind Overwatch that talked about how those leaks were very frustrating for the

684
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,460
Overwatch 2 team.

685
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,340
Because what happened, here's the quote, our artists are heartbroken.

686
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,100
They take such care to make the art look beautiful.

687
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,620
And then we get some crappy version of what the art looks like, because somebody had like

688
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,520
taken a cell phone pic or something, I don't know.

689
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,460
And then people are like, I don't know, it doesn't look that good.

690
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,680
And we're like, no, it does.

691
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
It looks amazing.

692
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,620
It's just a crappy screenshot that someone took.

693
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,760
So it can be a bit demoralizing.

694
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,940
That's a very interesting comment, especially when you consider many people were theorizing

695
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,260
that the leaks were intentional on Blizzard's part to try to deflect.

696
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,180
I don't know if I buy into that, but I'll just put it out there because it is something

697
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,620
gamers are talking about.

698
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:40,700
That Blizzard potentially put those leaks out there themselves in order to get the focus

699
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,460
off of what was happening with the Hearthstone competition and the results.

700
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,200
And instead to talk about the future of Blizzard things.

701
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,420
So it's very interesting the whole leaks and how they can be damaging for the game.

702
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,420
What do you guys think?

703
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,140
Good thing or are leaks a bad thing?

704
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Depends.

705
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Depends.

706
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,140
It's good for me.

707
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,780
It's really, it's really situational because in some cases it builds hype for something

708
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,220
that makes people even more interested in it.

709
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Yeah.

710
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:12,800
I mean, like for me, if there's a movie that I want to see, I might go look for like leaked

711
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,980
reviews or, you know, things like, or I might see like, does the dog die or something?

712
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,260
Well, I'm giggling because speaking of discord, I feel like, and I'm not being shady, I promise,

713
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,060
but I feel like every week there's the weekly tiger claw update on what's going on with

714
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,500
the Sonic the Hedgehog movie based off what's leaked from either a standee that showed up

715
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,020
in a cinema or what junkie XL doing the soundtrack has made a comment about the redesign.

716
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,860
I think that was the thing this week and so on and so on.

717
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,440
So it's interesting because I mean, you know, for, for fans and folks, even though I'm,

718
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,260
I'm very much, when it comes to that, I'm very much like, I'll wait for the new tree.

719
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,500
You had me at junkie XL doing the soundtrack.

720
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,860
I mean, that's already like that Jim Carrey being in it.

721
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,260
I mean, I totally see it.

722
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,420
So it's, so it's interesting.

723
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,460
So those leaks can sometimes be, uh, well, I just didn't realize he was doing the soundtrack.

724
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,940
That's okay.

725
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,980
But that is something, right?

726
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:14,620
So anyway, uh, let's see, uh, going to, uh, comment from YYR in our Twitch chat who says, uh,

727
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,820
leaks make a game healthier.

728
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,020
Green vegetables are great for your health because it's L E E K S get, get it.

729
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:21,820
Get it.

730
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,620
Thanks, dad.

731
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,100
YYR officially making dad jokes in the chat.

732
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,580
Thank you.

733
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,660
Officially, um, act.

734
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,820
Defton chat says speaking of leaks, how about them Pokemon leaks?

735
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,980
Well, that's one that's going on right now, right?

736
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,820
I know some people are trying to avoid those leaks, so I'm not going to get into them in great detail.

737
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,500
I will just point out, I have a text message from Shane about an hour ago talking about that.

738
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,380
I guess the pokey decks has leaked.

739
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,620
So I'm like, which Pokemon got cut and he's kind of explaining it to me again.

740
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,980
I'm going to respect the wishes of those that are trying to avoid the leaks.

741
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:59,260
So I don't want to get into those details, but, um, I mean, it is causing us to talk about Pokemon and get that

742
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,180
whole like hype building a little bit there.

743
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,820
I mean, in Shane's case, not that any additional hype is needed, but I suppose, you know, I'm a little bit more of a

744
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,580
filthy casual when it comes to Pokemon.

745
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,660
So talking about it does make me go, oh yeah, that Pokemon games in like two weeks.

746
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,900
It's going to be here before I know it.

747
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,900
Crazy stuff.

748
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,660
So anyway.

749
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,620
All right.

750
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,140
Bobby Blackwood from chat says, how do you know when a joke becomes a dad joke when it becomes a parent?

751
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,220
All right.

752
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,660
Anyway,

753
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,180
womp, womp.

754
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,860
All right, uh, let's move on.

755
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:39,340
We've spent a long time on that topic, but there's, that's honestly, I feel like outside of Blizzcon, that's like all anybody's been talking about this weekend.

756
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,180
There is some other stuff that's been going on in the world that we will get into.

757
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,820
Um, but we were gone for a couple of weeks, right?

758
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,780
This is our first show back since I think October 13th.

759
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,700
Um, not completely by our design.

760
00:40:51,980 --> 00:41:00,020
Um, I'll explain a little bit more about that in a moment, but I thought we could take an opportunity to talk about what were some of the big headlines we missed in our time off.

761
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,820
So Loki, what were some of the things we missed while we were gone for two weeks?

762
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:15,780
Um, so apparently we have a new system coming out from analog, so they're doing a portable system that looks kind of like a original Game Boy, but it plays most portable games.

763
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,980
I've reached out to try to get a demo, by the way.

764
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,060
Oh.

765
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,180
Um, so it looks pretty awesome.

766
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,020
It's got like a 1600 by 1440 resolution, three and a half inch screen.

767
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:36,020
It plays Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games out of the gate, and then they're going to have adapters for the game gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, Atari Lynx, and more.

768
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:44,620
And with the, you know, resolutions on the screen, I can imagine they could play quite a bit more, but the system's going to cost $200 and it's coming out sometime in 2020.

769
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,980
And it looks so nice.

770
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,900
I mean, I'm not even really interested in handheld games, but I kind of want one.

771
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:58,900
I feel like I have so many like retro things that like, as neat as this looks, I'm like, if I have, if I buy one more of these things, honestly, I need less shit in this house, not more.

772
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,140
Well, this plays like original cartridges.

773
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:12,620
This isn't like one of those, you know, uh, classic mini systems or anything like that, which really I'm surprised Nintendo's not doing a classic mini Game Boy or something like that, but I guess we'll have to wait and see on that.

774
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,780
Um, so then Capcom also mentioned that they want to bring back some old dead franchises.

775
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,900
Uh, one that sounds like they may be batting around is Akami.

776
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,100
So we may see a new Akami game pretty soon.

777
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:33,860
And apparently, uh, Japanese arcade, Anata no Warehouse is closing down and they apparently were pretty legendary interesting arcade.

778
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:40,700
Um, and it's unfortunate that they're going down because of a change to the sales tax laws in Japan.

779
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,140
And let's see what else.

780
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:54,740
So we had some announcements regarding, um, Panzer Dragoon remake is getting a physical edition, which I know that was teased also come into PC.

781
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,460
Yeah, I'm excited about that.

782
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,780
That's a pretty soon, isn't it?

783
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:58,820
I think so.

784
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,620
Yeah, I think so too.

785
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,460
I think it is a holiday for this year game, believe it or not.

786
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,420
Uh, now that Halloween's over, we're in the holidays.

787
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,140
Apparently some people say we've skipped Thanksgiving.

788
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,940
I've always kind of considered Thanksgiving a holiday.

789
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,180
So I sort of thought this period was always the holidays.

790
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:25,180
I kind of got mad, like, like, or at least an annoyed look in my face the other day because it was like the middle of October and they were wearing Santa hats at the grocery store I went to to get a sandwich.

791
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,980
I'm like, really?

792
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,260
Like it's not even fucking Halloween yet.

793
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,620
Really?

794
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,180
You got fucking Santa hats?

795
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,100
I mean, what the hell?

796
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:32,780
Back to games.

797
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,420
Anyway, sorry.

798
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,860
Um, so then what else?

799
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,940
Uh, they're going to have used to acknowledge your weird pagan holiday.

800
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,420
They're going to be doing physical releases of the Aladdin and Lion King games.

801
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,980
Uh, yeah, I heard about that.

802
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,900
Uh, so those are going to be coming out as well.

803
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:55,620
Uh, I'm surprised the licensing got all worked out for that, especially how both those movies got the real life remakes.

804
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:01,980
Disney's been some real dicks too about their old properties, especially the stuff they just got from Fox.

805
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:19,420
There's this whole thing, and I don't want to deviate too much from games, but I think this is kind of adjacent because like, like there would be cinemas in town that would do like late night screenings of the princess bride or Ghostbusters or, and I don't, you know, like all these, I don't even know if those are actually Fox or Disney, but like classic movies and stuff.

806
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:19,660
Right?

807
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:19,980
Yeah.

808
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,140
Disney's pulled all that.

809
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:27,420
They're not allowing theaters to show those old movies anymore with one notable exception.

810
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:33,980
There is one exception that they haven't touched, and that's a little movie called the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is still a Fox movie.

811
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:49,740
And I think, I think the reason why is because they know if they touch that they're going to be fucked with a capital F because there will be some angry cross dressers out there acting out the rock or picture show, which I've been a proud member of that scene for a long, long time.

812
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,100
Uh, that will be very upset at that whole thing.

813
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,220
So, uh, I think Disney is rightfully so stayed away from the rock or picture show.

814
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,660
But everything else they've been like not renewing rights, not granting.

815
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,940
And it's all because of fucking Disney Plus.

816
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,980
Because why, why go to the theater to see it when you can buy Disney Plus?

817
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,980
Well, it's kind of like, that's the other thing that kind of annoying for me.

818
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:19,100
Cause most of the MCU, this next phase of it is they're Disney Plus shows, which I'm like, okay, well, the cinematic universe.

819
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:25,780
I kind of was hoping more than being the cinemas, but I guess TV now, cinematic universe, whatever.

820
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,180
Tiger Claw says, I'm sure you're still giddy that the rock your picture show is now a Disney movie.

821
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,100
Actually, Tiger Claw, I feel the exact opposite of that remark, especially in light of everything I just talked about.

822
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,060
Fuck Disney right now with a whole lot of this, this sucks.

823
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:49,540
I was going to get Disney Plus, but now I kind of don't want to because I don't want to support this.

824
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,620
Oh, there goes Rob again, talking about boycotts.

825
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,020
I don't know if it's, it's not a, I don't think it's a boycott so much as it is.

826
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,580
I don't want to buy that.

827
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,060
Yeah, I don't want to buy that.

828
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:08,100
So they did a piece on Conan O'Brien about Death Stranding in his visit to Kojima Studios.

829
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,580
And of course, predictably so, he's in the game.

830
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,340
So that's awesome.

831
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,820
Last of Us 2 got delayed to spring of 2020.

832
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,100
I heard it got another little delay.

833
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,020
That's all right.

834
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,740
Well, you know, honestly, again, if you need the delay to get it right, delay it.

835
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,260
Cool.

836
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:25,980
Yep.

837
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,620
And then, um,

838
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,340
We should start celebrating delays.

839
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:36,820
We should, I maybe I'm going to put that on the list of things to do, uh, make a bumper to celebrate video game delays.

840
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,100
I'm going to, I'll get on that for 2020.

841
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,100
Okay.

842
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:49,060
And then I was going to say, um, last but not least, uh, let's see, we'll talk about how Sony has confirmed that PlayStation,

843
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:53,100
um, six through 10 in Japan, at least the trademarks for those are in place.

844
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,620
I think we're actually getting into that a little later in tonight's show.

845
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,900
Well, now I spoiled it for you.

846
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,380
So there you go.

847
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,660
We'll come into it a little later.

848
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,740
See how it says this week at the top of that.

849
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,780
That's whatever.

850
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,100
You know what?

851
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,300
I'm not paying attention to this shit.

852
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,180
All right.

853
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,860
Anyway, our shows as broken as WWE 2K20.

854
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,020
All right.

855
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,820
Let's get into, uh, another segment here.

856
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,740
We're gonna talk a little bit about our gaming weeks, but we're gonna do it a little bit

857
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,580
differently because, um, we've been gone for three weeks, so there's been a lot going on.

858
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,980
So I want to do a segment called how is your week?

859
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,900
How is your day?

860
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,180
And those long time OLR fans may recognize that name.

861
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:35,820
I've brought it back from the dead, uh, tonight just because it's been so long and I know a lot has been going on.

862
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:42,300
So first collectively before I go to dark soccer, because of course I'll, I'll let her go first, but generally I want to speak to what happened to the show.

863
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:52,380
So, um, two weeks ago we knew we weren't going to be here kind of because I found out for work about two or three weeks prior I was going to need to be gone.

864
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:58,940
I was going to be on my way to Vegas for some work related things and I had to fly out on a Sunday because it started Monday morning.

865
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,860
So we knew two weeks ago we wouldn't be here.

866
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,580
The reality is day job.

867
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,980
Most important thing.

868
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,380
It pays the bills without this, the lights aren't on, so got to do the J job stuff.

869
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,180
So I think y'all understand and know about that.

870
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,900
Last week was a little shittier because believe it or not, we were pre, we were here, we were prepping to do a show.

871
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,820
We were all going to be here.

872
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,580
It was going to be great.

873
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,620
We're going to do the show.

874
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:25,220
And then, um, we had some crazy ass wind here in the Sacramento area and really up and down California.

875
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,140
I'm sure you guys have heard about those really horrific fires that have been happening up and down the state.

876
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,020
Um, and, uh, luckily not so much here in our area in Sacramento.

877
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:44,260
Yes, there were some fires in Sacramento, but I don't believe any structures or most importantly, people, maybe a few structures, but no people in the Sacramento area.

878
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,460
So for the most part, we were fine, except I'm so glad there wasn't any spontaneous combustion.

879
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,380
The, the problem was is those high winds killed the cable.

880
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:56,660
And so without the cable, we couldn't broadcast our show on Twitch.

881
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:02,940
And I did give thought to, well, we could all sit here and at least record something and we could just put it on the podcast feed.

882
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:09,380
But the problem is without cable, we can't pull up our stories to look at and do that whole thing.

883
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,020
And it just would have been really weird.

884
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,500
And honestly, guys, the whole thing was really frustrating.

885
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,620
So I was just like, fuck it.

886
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,380
We're just not going to do OLR again tonight.

887
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,140
So thank God we're here tonight because I shit you not.

888
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,020
Do you know what happened at one o'clock earlier today?

889
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,700
The power went out for about, luckily it was only about 15 minutes.

890
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:31,260
But like I wrote this tweet that thankfully didn't go through probably because the power outage was probably trying to send it to my router or something.

891
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,740
Well, no, because the router would've been off.

892
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,940
But for whatever reason, it didn't send.

893
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,900
And it said, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

894
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,940
The power just went out.

895
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,700
It's like, God does not want to hear any more OLR.

896
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,380
God is done with this show.

897
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,500
The end.

898
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,180
Thankfully, power came back on 15 minutes later.

899
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,420
So a crisis averted and here we are.

900
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:50,860
Hooray.

901
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,500
I will warn you guys, though, next week, guess what?

902
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,860
I'm not going to be here live.

903
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,340
But here's the thing.

904
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,860
I've been planning a trip to New York City for like six months.

905
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,740
I'm my gay ass is going to see some Broadway.

906
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,380
I'm fucking hyped about it.

907
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,140
You know, sorry, not sorry.

908
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:08,940
But here's the thing.

909
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,660
Luckily, we're able to make it work myself.

910
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,700
Dark Soccer Loki.

911
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,740
We're going to tape a special show midweek and we're going to air that on Sunday.

912
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,740
So we're going to do an OLR bonus stage episode this weekend.

913
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,940
And that will also go on the podcast feed, of course.

914
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,500
So it'll be a lot easier than it was to miss two shows in a row.

915
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,820
But that's why we've been gone.

916
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,340
It's very nice to be back because, of course,

917
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,620
it's very frustrating to not be here for a couple of weeks.

918
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,100
I will say a couple of things that have

919
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,620
happened housekeeping wise on the VOG network front.

920
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,900
Our Discord server is now a boosted server because a very kind individual just

921
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,340
got Discord Nitro and used his two boosts on the VOG network server.

922
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,020
So now we have the higher sound quality and all that fun stuff.

923
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,420
And you can use the can you use the emote?

924
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,060
No, I think that's that I can do that because I'm a Nitro person.

925
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,260
It's supposed to unlock more stuff.

926
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,260
Bottom line, join the VOG network Discord,

927
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:09,220
VOG network dot com slash Discord, that's VOG network dot com slash Discord.

928
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,540
Act F says God wanted OLR.

929
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,260
That's because the power went back that fast.

930
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,020
Yes, that's true. Bobby Blackwolf says the final premiere.

931
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,860
Yeah, because Twitch TV premieres are going away on November 12th.

932
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,620
And

933
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,020
Kaijuto in chat says you guys need to let Bobby fill in for you.

934
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,500
I'm sure he won't mind recording for four hours.

935
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,580
I actually I think Bobby actually would mind that maybe if he had some co-hosts

936
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:37,100
to help him, but I don't know if he'd want to go for four hours unless he gets

937
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,380
Tommy Tallarico on his show next week, then he'll be fine going for four hours.

938
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,980
Yeah, Tommy could go for like ten hours, so that's fine.

939
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,700
That's no shade. I love Tommy.

940
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,860
And I want to hear all about his in television, which has no shade.

941
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,500
But he certainly talks because he's enthusiastic about what he's talking about.

942
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,620
Let's see. So, yeah.

943
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,820
And D'Artesia says, so not numbered?

944
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:00,340
No, we're not going to number the next show because I'm specifically delaying

945
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,460
episode eight hundred until December 1st.

946
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,940
So that way,

947
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:11,140
episode eight hundred is the same month as our one year anniversary on Twitch.

948
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,740
I don't want to say too much about this right now because I don't know what will

949
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,940
be in place or what won't be in place, but behind the scenes,

950
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:22,940
we're plotting a sort of soft relaunch, if you will, of Orange Lounge Radio,

951
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,500
because reality is, you know, there's a lot of great people

952
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,540
out there that are still listening and so forth.

953
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,620
But we've really been kind of struggling to get the word out about our show,

954
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,420
get some of the longtime listeners from a long time ago to come back.

955
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,620
And I bet a lot of people don't even know we're on Twitch now and so forth.

956
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,860
So we want to do kind of like just like

957
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:44,500
a soft relaunch and kind of a creative reboot, if you will, of our show.

958
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,380
Not saying we're going to like change everything and so forth,

959
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,580
but maybe there'll be some new art, maybe some new promo pics of us,

960
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,380
because it's been a while.

961
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,420
I'm going to stop wearing pants.

962
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,820
Maybe we'll wear pants, maybe not.

963
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,620
Maybe we'll have some new sound effects,

964
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,300
maybe some new videos and things like that.

965
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,220
So just some creative kind of like, you know, like a makeover.

966
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,300
Who doesn't love a makeover, right?

967
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,380
Y'all watch your daytime TV and see those fabulous makeovers.

968
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,660
That's what we're looking at for episode number eight hundred.

969
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,860
So anyway, Sia Tabiri says smush cam.

970
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,580
Don't count anything out.

971
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,980
Don't count anything out.

972
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,140
All right.

973
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,060
Dark Tits Sia says hashtag bring back the soundboard.

974
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,740
I can give that an enthusiastic no.

975
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,580
All right. Anyway, let's move on with how is your week?

976
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,220
How is your day?

977
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,300
Dark Sakura, you've had a bit going on.

978
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:33,900
I have.

979
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,620
I'm actually surprised you're here tonight.

980
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,260
And I don't mean that in a shady way, but you know why I'm saying that.

981
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,260
Well, and I'll just go ahead and come out with it.

982
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,820
But I'm not going to define what it is.

983
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,660
I had a salpingectomy, salpingectomy.

984
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,740
Look it up if you care.

985
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,820
But I it was a laparoscopic procedure.

986
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,900
I had it on Wednesday.

987
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,020
I'm on my last bit of medication for it.

988
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,820
So, yeah, I hurt quite a bit,

989
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,260
but I couldn't miss this after not having been here for two years.

990
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,420
Two years.

991
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,740
You're definitely on drugs.

992
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,340
Definitely. Oh, my God.

993
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,420
Well, OK, so they gave me the big oxy.

994
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,460
Right. And I've never taken it before.

995
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,140
Oh, that's fun.

996
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,700
I've never taken it before.

997
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,060
And like for for like a while, I'm like, I don't feel anything.

998
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,660
I don't feel anything. Oh, oh, oh.

999
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,580
And then that's that's what it's been like on that shit.

1000
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,060
By the way, thank you to our soccer,

1001
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,580
because when you came to the show, you brought me a little bag of candy corn,

1002
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,940
which you talked about on the last hour, a little bag of maple candy corn.

1003
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,220
So I'm feeling my Canadian self tonight.

1004
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,780
I'm actually not Canadian at all, but I love Canada so much.

1005
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,740
This maple candy corn is really good store just for you.

1006
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,900
OK, but what cracks me up,

1007
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,540
it's in the same type of packaging that like trail mix would be in.

1008
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,580
It's like not a big bag of candy corn,

1009
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,940
but it's one of those like little snack bags of candy corn.

1010
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,020
So that was funny. The only size I saw that.

1011
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,980
And I got you the other thing, the other thing that you never get.

1012
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,980
Oh, yeah, I love vanilla tootsie rolls.

1013
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,780
So she brought me a whole thing of them.

1014
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,220
I found those trick or treat.

1015
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,060
But by the way, would you dress up?

1016
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,140
Oh, you didn't do Halloween because I did procedure.

1017
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,820
Oh, did it work? What'd you do?

1018
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,540
OK, so I got at the thrift store because I thrift for everything now because I

1019
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,660
don't know what fucking fits me and I'm cheap.

1020
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,780
So I got it was like a Forever 21 skater dress, like three quarter sleeve.

1021
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,580
But it had it was black with pentagrams all over it.

1022
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,500
So I wore that and my woven witch hat.

1023
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,980
I'll find a picture and put it in chat or something.

1024
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,660
And then just did like hardcore, really awesome makeup.

1025
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,340
And I made cookies.

1026
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,540
My cookies were I got

1027
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,780
dehydrated strawberries.

1028
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,340
So I took half of the big bag of them

1029
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,300
and just powdered them to make my flavoring in my sugar cookies.

1030
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,020
And the other half I soaked in water and they got kind of leathery and chewy,

1031
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,580
you know, like when you get the pink drink at Starbucks, it's the same thing.

1032
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,140
They get kind of leathery and chewy.

1033
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,340
And so I add a lot of red food dye to it.

1034
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,300
And I made visceral cookies because it

1035
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,380
was kind of like what I would imagine eating intestines like.

1036
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,100
So I made visceral cookies and had everybody

1037
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,820
with like red mouths and everything from the food dye.

1038
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,940
It was pretty cool.

1039
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,860
And I'm still waiting for Detroit Become

1040
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,460
Human to come out on an epic thingy, so it's not out.

1041
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,340
I did get my legit physical copy of River City Girls.

1042
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,500
And so Dan and I are going to play that.

1043
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,660
We talked about setting up the stream and everything.

1044
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,580
But like right now, I'd probably just

1045
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,540
start falling over into a giggle fit trying to play it.

1046
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,180
And I'm back into Sims.

1047
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,420
I've been playing Sims with my computer being a little shit.

1048
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:35,260
So I've already put together my next computer.

1049
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,260
It's going to be great.

1050
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,620
I'm getting an iMac Pro.

1051
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,340
It's about four grand, has sixty four

1052
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,580
gig of RAM with a really nice graphics card.

1053
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,300
And it will be well enough that I can

1054
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,260
do it for still playing some of my other games.

1055
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,180
Buy me one too.

1056
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,460
Did y'all can't see the look I'm giving Rob right now.

1057
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,140
And it's called, do you know how much sushi you'd have to buy me?

1058
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,860
Four thousand dollars, four thousand dollars worth, two hundred and sixty

1059
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,660
dollars worth of pudding. I was just in Vegas.

1060
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,900
So the type with the real gold flakes on it, the edible ones.

1061
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,620
Also, you know what I just did before I came here?

1062
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,500
But I had chocolate with edible gold in it.

1063
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,540
Yum, it was great. Good times.

1064
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,620
And you've also given me candy and coffee while I'm kind of high.

1065
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,300
So I just want to make sure you are in a good mood for tonight.

1066
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,820
I'm in a mood. All right.

1067
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,300
I'm in some kind of mood.

1068
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,220
I love everybody.

1069
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,340
Mostly Loki. How was your week?

1070
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,500
How was your day?

1071
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,220
What you dress up as for Halloween?

1072
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,860
I had well for work.

1073
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,860
They made us do well, they wanted me to do like an 80s costume.

1074
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,300
So I went to the Halloween store the night before Halloween.

1075
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,620
And the first costume I saw that reminded

1076
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,980
me of the 80s was a double dare contestant costume.

1077
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,100
That's awesome. Did you get pics?

1078
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,740
I didn't see any.

1079
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,980
I took a picture of the costume, like, but it's great because not only do I get

1080
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,340
to wear this costume for one day because it was really just like a T-shirt and like

1081
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:04,380
some elbow pads and they have like a helmet and stuff with like a magnetic cup.

1082
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,420
It's like the cup that they normally wear

1083
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,380
on top of their head when they're filling it full of crap.

1084
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,380
Yeah. Yeah.

1085
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:13,060
So but now I have a double dare T-shirt that I can wear any time.

1086
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,820
So it's like the kids shirts and the wife a shirt.

1087
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,140
And you guys could have been family. Yeah.

1088
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,700
They didn't have they only had it like the adult sizes.

1089
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,260
So they had large and extra large.

1090
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,980
So I and there was like two left.

1091
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,380
I'm shocked you didn't get a picture.

1092
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,700
Yeah, I should have.

1093
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,340
But I got to go get my costume and get my costume.

1094
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,180
OK, because mine's very so I'm going to go get it for the people.

1095
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,860
OK, why you continue to tell us about your week and your day.

1096
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,100
All right.

1097
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,380
So my week I did well, I mean, it was a lot of Halloween stuff.

1098
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,740
So like the first week that we weren't here, I went to we had like a local

1099
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,700
haunted house that we took the kids to and that was all right.

1100
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,020
And then the kids went trick or treating on Halloween.

1101
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,820
And we did all that. And what else?

1102
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,340
I mean, we did some school field trip,

1103
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:06,140
so I have been playing a lot of Pokemon Go and Ingress because I was up in Grass

1104
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:10,660
Valley and there's a bunch of portals and stuff that I have never tagged before.

1105
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,620
So I say, yeah, what the hell?

1106
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,260
Because this is boring.

1107
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,300
So I'm going to do this as I walk around.

1108
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,980
And then other games I actually played to I played more Borderlands three.

1109
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,420
So I think I'm pretty far into that.

1110
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,300
I did manage to play what the golf I was

1111
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,460
many thinking about streaming it, but I just didn't get around to it.

1112
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,860
So I've been playing that.

1113
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,020
And you ready? You ready?

1114
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,900
I'm ready.

1115
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,660
It's because Rob is the greatest.

1116
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,180
Hello.

1117
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,740
I can't even do an Australian accent, but I've just I've dressed as Sia for Halloween.

1118
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:53,020
And the minute I saw the wig, I was like, that's so incredibly random and ridiculous.

1119
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,340
I have to do it.

1120
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:59,500
So anyway, not to interrupt your story, but I interrupted it.

1121
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,940
OK, but I did it in a Sia wig, so it's awesome, right?

1122
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,580
I should have worn my costume today.

1123
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,020
I forgot. You really should.

1124
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,940
We didn't we got robbed of a Halloween edition of OLR.

1125
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,660
Yeah, we really did.

1126
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,900
But yeah, so I played Borderlands three

1127
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,220
and what the golf and I'm really digging what the golf.

1128
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,940
It's a pretty fun non golf game.

1129
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,220
It's really strange.

1130
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,660
And there's a lot of images like other games in there.

1131
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,420
Definitely worth checking out.

1132
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:31,980
And then I've been working on my game a little bit, not making much progress in it

1133
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,620
or I should say I've been working on it quite a bit.

1134
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,980
Yeah, the progress I'm making is very minimal, which is unfortunate because it's

1135
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,500
kind of frustrating, but it's still progress.

1136
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:47,060
So doing that and then what else?

1137
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,340
That's pretty much it. Yeah.

1138
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,300
All right.

1139
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,460
Let's see my my week in my day, I went to a conference that was about

1140
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,820
learning and I talked a little bit about this on Bobby show.

1141
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,620
So I'll kind of like throw you back to Bobby show last week because we still did

1142
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,980
a call even though the power was out.

1143
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,900
I could still use my excuse me, the cable was down.

1144
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,020
I could still use my phone, but I went to a learning conference.

1145
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,660
I learned a lot like they were talking

1146
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,380
about using A.R. in learning, which I thought was really cool.

1147
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,940
Like the fact that like let's say you're learning how to build a jet engine.

1148
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,420
You could put a pair of glasses on, like say the HoloLens or something,

1149
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,500
and you can use those glasses to like look at the jet engine and it'll show you

1150
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,100
like the outline, like put the piece here and do this.

1151
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,860
And I just I thought it was really cool.

1152
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,620
And then I also had like a VR thing

1153
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,020
that was training about like workplace safety and stuff.

1154
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,500
So anyway, I'll just defer you over to Bob.

1155
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:40,620
It sounds like a valuable use of assets to you know, it was it was interesting

1156
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,940
because I've always associated A.R. and VR with gaming, even though A.R.

1157
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,340
specifically things like HoloLens and stuff, you know, they're saying

1158
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,460
it's not so much like don't think of HoloLens as a gaming device because

1159
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,780
they're finding more and more uses in the real world for it.

1160
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,260
Well, I got to see some of the selling that the people and I got to see some

1161
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,420
of those real world adaptations firsthand.

1162
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:06,140
And I really do think like, you know, in five years, this type of like glasses,

1163
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,660
learning how to do I think you're going to see much more of that.

1164
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,420
I really think that is the type of place we're talking about.

1165
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,900
Even I guess I know Google, the glass hole and Google Glass and all that stuff.

1166
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,300
But I think there'll be some form of that that's going to be a little more standard

1167
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,180
in the next maybe, what, five, 10 years. We'll see.

1168
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,900
That's just kind of something I walked away from.

1169
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:27,020
And I think there will be some sort of gaming because they talked about the A.R.

1170
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,860
can certainly have a place of storytelling.

1171
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:33,020
And certainly, you know, the brief extent of HoloLens I have had,

1172
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,020
I got to play that fragments game, which was kind of like the mystery game.

1173
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,260
And it's it's fucking awesome.

1174
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,940
And like so there's definitely storytelling experiences there.

1175
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,020
I just don't know.

1176
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,620
You know, A.R. is not necessarily a gaming device.

1177
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,620
I think A.R. is just it's going to be new technology.

1178
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:53,660
Yeah. And where there is technology, there will be games and porn people.

1179
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,820
Like, I'm sure I didn't see any of this, but I'm sure A.R. porn.

1180
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,660
It's going to happen.

1181
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:02,340
It's it's going to happen.

1182
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,900
Yeah, it will.

1183
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,740
Like you're going to you're going to see it and you're going to be able to.

1184
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,380
Stick your head right in there.

1185
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:14,340
What? Boink. You can you just it's V Boink.

1186
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,500
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, there you go.

1187
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,500
Anyway, in the games.

1188
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,740
So, OK, because I did decide to scale back the MMO stuff a little bit,

1189
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,540
I'm only playing one MMO right now. I'm playing Final Fantasy 14.

1190
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,220
But even then, it's kind of like, oh, I get on I do some my daily dungeons

1191
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,140
and I've been enjoying the thing like I saw.

1192
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,740
I don't know if it's like playgrounds or something like that.

1193
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:35,420
What the hell is that?

1194
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,220
OK, so they just did a new patch five point one.

1195
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,500
And with that, they did new beast tribe dailies.

1196
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,700
So there's this like fairy tribe, basically, of fairies that you help out.

1197
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,980
And as you are doing the quest

1198
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:52,220
and you gain reputation, you're unlocking dreams in this dreamscape.

1199
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,100
And so the first dream you unlock is this big playground.

1200
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,340
And so it's just like the thing about Final Fantasy 14

1201
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,460
that I'm really kind of loving

1202
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,700
is that they're they're definitely do these things that are very tongue in cheek.

1203
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,060
Like we're going to create this canvas

1204
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,500
because we know our fan base is going to go hog fucking wild with it.

1205
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,740
And so they basically found a way to write into the story

1206
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,500
this way to have this big like cotton candy dreamscape

1207
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,340
where you're sliding down slides and you have chairs that are macarons

1208
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:22,940
like the not macaroons, but the French macaron macaroon.

1209
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,540
Yeah, the French ones that are that are way better.

1210
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,580
Like, don't get me wrong, I love the coconut ones, too,

1211
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,980
those little pastry ones. Oh, so fucking good.

1212
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,540
I had one today. Well, I'm so jealous.

1213
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,780
Well, you can get those as like chairs for your house now

1214
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,860
because of this dreamscape.

1215
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,580
So when you and it's just like this little playground

1216
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,700
that you can go hog wild and play on, it's really cute.

1217
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,220
So I've been doing that type of stuff in Final Fantasy 14, and that's been cool.

1218
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,060
But I've been playing other games, too.

1219
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,540
So I've been checking out the outer worlds thanks to Xbox Game Pass.

1220
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,660
It was out. Yeah.

1221
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:53,620
So I was like, oh, I'm just going to check this out, download it and play it.

1222
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,820
And I've I've been kind of into it.

1223
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,420
Like it's outer worlds is interesting

1224
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:02,460
because I feel like the game part of it, I kind of played it before.

1225
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,660
It's kind of like what?

1226
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,100
Like it's kind of like Fallout meets Bioshock,

1227
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,060
kind of like that type of thing for me.

1228
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,980
And it's it is a little bit shooty shoot.

1229
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,020
But there is a Bobby Black Wolf mode.

1230
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,660
You can play it on like a story based mode.

1231
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,700
That's very easy.

1232
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,500
Your first ability you get lets you slow down time.

1233
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:22,500
So it's really easy to like zoom in and hit people super easy.

1234
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,380
So I'm loving that.

1235
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,620
So I don't have to worry so much about the game side of things

1236
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,820
and experience the story.

1237
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,420
And that's the part where in the outer worlds, it's really, really well done.

1238
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,820
Like almost I mean, I don't know, because I haven't played much more

1239
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,900
in like the first 30 minutes or hour of the game.

1240
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,980
So I can't say like, oh, it's better than Mass Effect.

1241
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:42,300
But like the choices feel like they're richer than like a Mass Effect.

1242
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,060
And you don't necessarily know what's the good choice.

1243
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,500
What's the bad choice?

1244
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,860
You just have choices.

1245
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,420
And it really like plays out the story in different ways.

1246
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,780
So much that I'm like, oh, I wonder what would go

1247
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,140
what would happen if I went back and picked that choice instead?

1248
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:00,060
So, yeah, I've been into the outer worlds for that reason, actually.

1249
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,300
So, yeah, Quest Buster says outer worlds was so fun.

1250
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,540
There are a lot of neat decisions you can make.

1251
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,100
And Bobby says, I like story mode.

1252
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:12,060
I'm about nine hours in that comment from our chat.

1253
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,180
Over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

1254
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,180
Well, here's the thing.

1255
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:19,180
So because I kind of set up Xbox Game Pass so I could play the outer worlds,

1256
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,060
then I was like, oh, yeah, I have Xbox Game Pass.

1257
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,460
I should go play these other games I've been missing out on, too.

1258
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,420
So the one I've actually spent the most time on, I think,

1259
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,660
probably so far this week is a game called Bloodstained.

1260
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,020
I love Bloodstained.

1261
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:32,620
Now, wait a minute.

1262
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,740
Didn't I talk about this before when it came out on the Switch?

1263
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,820
Yes, but I kind of put it away really quick

1264
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,860
because the Switch version had its issues.

1265
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,540
And all I was reading, which the issues weren't like gigantic,

1266
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:49,020
but it was just everything I was reading was, hey, just we're working on it.

1267
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:50,260
We're going to put out some patches.

1268
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,860
So I was like, well, if they're going to patch the game, then fuck it.

1269
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,740
I'll wait for the patches to come out.

1270
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:59,260
Well, in the meantime, I it came out on Xbox Game Pass and I was like, well,

1271
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,740
I'm just I want to just play on the PC. I'm going to check it out here.

1272
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,260
So I've been playing it.

1273
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:06,740
I'm actually like I'm really enjoying it now that I'm like finally getting into it

1274
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:10,820
and playing it like I got past the little pirate ship level

1275
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,660
or whatever you'd call it that was first got to the actual castle.

1276
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:17,300
That first boss was so hard.

1277
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,380
Like, am I am I just bad?

1278
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:22,220
Because it took me a while to figure out how to beat that guy.

1279
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,100
My God. Like for a first boss down.

1280
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,460
Yeah, you really like and I think that's what it took.

1281
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,340
I really had to study like, wow, what is OK, why don't why am I doing so bad?

1282
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,820
You really have to pay attention to that pattern.

1283
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:37,300
And then I also I got a soul that really helped.

1284
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,780
Like it made this giant drill type of thing.

1285
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,220
Oh, yeah, that's the best.

1286
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,700
Then use that most of the game.

1287
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,940
OK, that drill made it so much easier to beat that guy.

1288
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:49,220
So that was that was about that. So, yeah.

1289
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,980
So now I was checking out bloodstain and I've been really into that.

1290
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,660
So as far as like, you know,

1291
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,380
having that Symphony of the Night feel and so forth.

1292
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:00,220
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if any game is ever going to touch

1293
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,980
Symphony of the Night, but bloodstains pretty rad.

1294
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,580
Like, I'll give it that.

1295
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,020
I am going to shade one thing, though.

1296
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,660
So for all like the shit this game has gotten for technical issues and stuff.

1297
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,820
Sure enough, as I'm playing the game

1298
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,540
and I had maybe been like 10 minutes since my last save,

1299
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,180
I'm going through the castle.

1300
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:21,340
I go up to read a library book because you can read these books

1301
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,780
and it's how you learn how to do some of the special moves and stuff.

1302
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,380
You might get a little bit more of the lore.

1303
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,100
I go up to read the book and game crashes.

1304
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,780
Yeah, which I thought was supposed to be a problem

1305
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,460
with the switch version that they were fixing.

1306
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,420
But apparently it was in the PC version, too,

1307
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,780
or at least the version I was getting on Xbox Game Pass,

1308
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:40,260
because somebody either tweeted me or told me on Discord like,

1309
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:44,540
oh, it might be a Steam version versus a, you know, something,

1310
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,860
whatever is Epic Store, wherever else the game is out.

1311
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,820
And I'm like, oh, there's actually another one

1312
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,260
because I'm getting it on Xbox Game Pass.

1313
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:55,820
So anyway, that was annoying, but it only happened to me the one time.

1314
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,460
And now I've just been really good about saving as much as I can,

1315
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,700
which I really try to do in games.

1316
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,860
Save often.

1317
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:04,660
I know, but that was really that was irritating.

1318
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:09,900
Another game I checked out was a game called Minit, M-I-N-I-T.

1319
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,900
So it's like it's like a black and white RPG.

1320
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,740
It has very much an old school computer look to it.

1321
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:18,780
Like it looks like you're playing on an Apple 2e or like, you know,

1322
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,100
one of those really old computers.

1323
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,100
But obviously you're playing like your Xbox controller.

1324
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,740
And the whole catch is that once you pick up the sword

1325
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,380
that kind of officially starts the game, every minute you die

1326
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,980
and you restart.

1327
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:36,220
Now, as irritating as that sounds, like most roguelikes,

1328
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:39,380
although this game is not a roguelike, it's a it's a it's a very linear type

1329
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:43,900
of thing, any like let's say you go into a new house,

1330
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,180
you'll start from that house.

1331
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,940
Let's say you find a new item.

1332
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,220
You'll have that new item when you start your game.

1333
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:54,460
Let's say you got so, you know, so everything you kind of do

1334
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,620
makes sense that you don't have to progress that part again

1335
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,580
after you die and restart.

1336
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,660
So it's an interesting little twist in it.

1337
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,820
So it's kind of like part roguelike, part adventure game.

1338
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:08,620
I do feel like it is a very simple type of game where it's like

1339
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,700
go to the lighthouse.

1340
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,660
The lighthouse has the flashlight so you can get through the cave.

1341
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,060
The cave gets the death.

1342
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,420
And this is kind of like, you know, the one thing leads to another.

1343
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,140
But it's not too linear.

1344
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,620
Like there definitely seems to be some branching, some ways to go.

1345
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,180
You can explore the map and so forth.

1346
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,140
So it is like it's a cute game.

1347
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,420
I think it only retails for like eight bucks,

1348
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,220
which is probably about the right price.

1349
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:29,660
Which one again?

1350
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,340
Minit.

1351
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:33,420
It was free just a few weeks ago on Epic.

1352
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:34,340
Oh, was it Epic?

1353
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,140
I don't know if I grabbed it when it was free on Epic,

1354
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,340
but it's on the Game Pass.

1355
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,700
So I just grabbed it there.

1356
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,180
It was like, I thought I heard about this game.

1357
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,300
So I and it sounded like something up my alley.

1358
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:42,940
So I checked it out.

1359
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,460
It's on Switch.

1360
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,620
Yeah, and I've been into it.

1361
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,780
So that's for sure.

1362
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,780
Metal Mayhem is confirming what you said.

1363
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,740
Minit was a freebie on Epic a while back.

1364
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,580
YYR is telling me to play Supermarket Shriek on Game Pass.

1365
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,140
I downloaded it and I just haven't gotten to it yet.

1366
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,740
But it is in my list of like things that's going to be awesome.

1367
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,540
Yeah.

1368
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:03,260
Um, now the other game I checked out was

1369
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:05,940
and I don't know why I downloaded this game.

1370
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,580
I was just like, oh, it's free.

1371
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,220
Well, I can finally try it.

1372
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:13,300
So I decided to play Marvel versus Capcom Unlimited because.

1373
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:14,580
Yeah.

1374
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,100
Was it?

1375
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,700
Oh, Lord, worthy.

1376
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,980
It was it was a choice.

1377
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,860
Was it New Infinite?

1378
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,540
I was like, well, that was forty five gigs.

1379
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,380
I just wasted.

1380
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,180
Look, this it has a story, I don't know.

1381
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,940
It's I want to sit here and go, it's not that bad.

1382
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,060
There's other fighting games I could be playing.

1383
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,300
Why not just do Capcom versus SNK two on Game Pass?

1384
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:39,780
How about that?

1385
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,700
That would have been a better use of my bandwidth.

1386
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,500
I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

1387
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,700
I put on. Yes, thank you.

1388
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,140
Marvel's Capcom Infinite.

1389
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,700
I said infinite. Thank you.

1390
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,580
Yeah, well, I don't know why I put unlimited.

1391
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,780
Yeah, Marvel's Capcom Infinite.

1392
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,020
That's the one I've been playing.

1393
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,220
So, um, yeah, I loved it.

1394
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,580
So much I couldn't even remember the name.

1395
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,820
Metal Mayhem says free where not really free.

1396
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,420
It's Xbox Game Pass.

1397
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,740
So you have to be paying for the game pass and then you get it there.

1398
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:08,380
But I mean, I am as I'm using it more and more.

1399
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,420
I'm definitely like getting some of the value out of Game Pass.

1400
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:14,940
So that part I'm appreciating because I'm not dropping 20 bucks

1401
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,260
or 10 bucks on a copy of Marvel's Capcom Infinite

1402
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,140
just because it's on sale.

1403
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,140
Like, I appreciate that.

1404
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,740
I was able to download that and try it for myself and be like,

1405
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,500
oh, I'll just play Street Fighter four next time.

1406
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,860
I want to play a game like that.

1407
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,460
So anyway.

1408
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,540
Oh, D'Artecio says get Dragonball fighters.

1409
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,820
That's that's probably better.

1410
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:36,820
I don't think it's on that.

1411
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,500
It's not on Game Pass yet.

1412
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
That's kind of the reason I've been visiting these games,

1413
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,220
because I'm like, well, I should get some value out of this.

1414
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,860
So I've been trying to get the value.

1415
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,860
So there you go.

1416
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:48,780
That was my gaming week and essentially my week in my day.

1417
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,260
So let's move on.

1418
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,460
We still have some news to get into.

1419
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,820
And I want to get into the news.

1420
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,100
So costume quest is free right now.

1421
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,540
I want that. Oh, on the epic store, right?

1422
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,900
Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

1423
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,820
And so my Loki, let's get into some gaming news.

1424
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,820
So you know what Bethesda needs to do for Fallout 76?

1425
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,580
What everybody's been asking them to do?

1426
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,260
Paywall some more bullshit for it.

1427
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,420
That's what they need to do.

1428
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:16,500
And that's what they did with Fallout first.

1429
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:21,020
Their ninety nine dollar subscription service.

1430
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,180
That's ninety nine dollars for a year or twelve ninety nine a month

1431
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,500
because it's super affordable.

1432
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,380
So what do you get for your ninety nine dollars a year?

1433
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,420
You get private worlds so you can play in a private world

1434
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,820
exclusively for you and up to seven friends.

1435
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,700
Problem is, it doesn't fucking work

1436
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:41,020
because anybody on your friends list can join your game.

1437
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,380
So that's all fucked.

1438
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:48,260
Unlimited storage for crafting components in your own new scrap box container.

1439
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,980
It was deleting your items.

1440
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:57,940
It's great. A new survival tent, a place full fast travel point

1441
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:02,180
with a stash sleeping bag and more for basic needs.

1442
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,580
I don't believe that was working either.

1443
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:09,420
You get some stupid Adams, sixteen or one thousand six hundred fifty

1444
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,940
Adams per month, which the quote Angry Joe.

1445
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,140
You can't even buy blue for that.

1446
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:19,860
One of the colors for your armors is actually more than what that is there.

1447
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:23,380
It's twenty dollars for blue. That's stupid.

1448
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,060
Ranger armor outfits.

1449
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:32,300
So they had the special ranger armor that we're going to get into this,

1450
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,580
how this is also kind of working against people that bought that.

1451
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,260
And then some unique emotes.

1452
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,980
So obviously, people were not too thrilled about that.

1453
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,060
And unfortunately, because of that,

1454
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,620
actually, people that are paying for this service.

1455
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:54,580
Are actually getting some shit from people that aren't buying the service.

1456
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,620
So when they see, you know, players wearing these exclusive armors or whatever,

1457
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,900
they're kind of getting harassed a little bit, which is not a good thing.

1458
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:10,580
But basically, you know, one of the things

1459
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:14,580
that also kind of goes against is they're talking about before that.

1460
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:18,580
The they've even promised that all of the enhancements

1461
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,460
that they would do the games are all the sell stuff

1462
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,300
they would sell through the atomic shop would not be.

1463
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:27,180
It would just be cosmetics only, not like pay to win.

1464
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:31,980
But then again, they're giving you now the ability to basically

1465
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:36,580
have private servers and have unlimited storage because storage is a problem

1466
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,940
in the game, and now you can pay for that problem to go away.

1467
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,740
A problem that they created, by the way.

1468
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:47,900
So it's just it's ridiculous.

1469
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,900
I don't know why they thought this was a great idea, but.

1470
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,620
I don't know, and now the people, you know,

1471
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:59,740
some fans of the game are saying, well, this is kind of a slippery slope

1472
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,620
because now that you have this service, if people take advantage of it,

1473
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,740
they're going to start piecemealing more things off of it.

1474
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,660
And here's the even the worst part about it.

1475
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:11,420
Like, so to go along with this, they have that whole update

1476
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,820
that they were going to do where they were going to be

1477
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:15,500
introducing NPCs back to the game.

1478
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,260
Well, that got delayed.

1479
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,900
It got that part got delayed.

1480
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,500
So the actual meaningful updates to the game delayed.

1481
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,460
But let me sell you something else.

1482
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,540
I don't want to disrespect the Fallout fans out there.

1483
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,660
And I'm really sorry that your game has turned out this way.

1484
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,740
But like, shouldn't Bethesda at their point just cut their losses and move on?

1485
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,340
Like, shouldn't they just like, let's just they're going to milk this thing dry.

1486
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,740
Let's just take what we've learned from this experience

1487
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,100
and apply it to future games

1488
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,660
so that we don't end up in this type of situation ever again.

1489
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,540
Like, wouldn't that just be the best course of action for this?

1490
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:44,660
Or is it just one of these?

1491
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:48,500
They must be facing such pressure from their investors to make this game happen.

1492
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:52,780
And to be fair, other games have turned their asses around,

1493
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,740
like Diablo three fixed itself.

1494
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,540
No Man's Sky fixed itself.

1495
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,020
Final Fantasy 14 fixed itself.

1496
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:03,740
So like Fallout 76, like I feel like desperately wants to join that club.

1497
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,540
But then they make moves like this where it's like, oh, PS,

1498
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:09,500
your whole stash gets deleted when you use it, where it's just like,

1499
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,380
that's that's not how you're going to win the people over.

1500
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,020
That's not how it's done.

1501
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:18,500
And it's like, who like who who even wants to give this a try anymore?

1502
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,780
Like there's been so much shit regarding this.

1503
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,300
So much, in fact, that Australia has said, you know what?

1504
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,740
We think that some consumers were misled.

1505
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:31,140
And that we're going to actually

1506
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:34,700
require that Bethesda or Zenimax in this case to

1507
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,340
actually refund some of these players.

1508
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,780
So apparently, if anyone asked for a refund in Australia

1509
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:45,620
between November 24th, 2018 and June 1st, 2019 can now receive that refund.

1510
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,260
They said that, of course,

1511
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:53,860
if you receive the refund, you'll be no longer entitled access to play the game.

1512
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:57,540
But apparently, you know, some people that were asking for refunds,

1513
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,540
you know, with, you know, problems with servers lagging,

1514
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:04,380
graphical visual problems, we're told that they couldn't get one.

1515
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,940
But apparently, Australian consumer law says otherwise.

1516
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:12,340
So if you had made that request,

1517
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,780
now it's time to actually get that refund.

1518
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,540
If you haven't, you're kind of out of luck.

1519
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,700
Questbuster in chat says it goes deeper than that.

1520
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,660
Some fans were upset with Bethesda's direction of the Fallout series

1521
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:27,500
for a while now, and the bugs and Fallout 76 was the last straw for them.

1522
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:30,340
Fallout first just made things a lot worse.

1523
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:34,340
And some folks in chat bringing up that everybody wants to be Fortnite.

1524
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,660
YYR saying the investors and higher ups want games as a service.

1525
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,860
Every game should be a service with recurring charges.

1526
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:42,900
Ideally, Bobby says exactly works for Fortnite.

1527
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,540
Act Def says Fortnite is popular and making money.

1528
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,660
Do the Fortnite so we can get more money.

1529
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,860
That quote attributed to investors.

1530
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:52,140
But then you can't sell your game for $60.

1531
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:56,060
Like if Fallout 76 was a free to play game and they wanted to go the Fortnite route,

1532
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,580
I think people wouldn't be so harsh about the, you know,

1533
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,780
the $99 subscription fee or anything else.

1534
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,660
I'm sorry. A Fortnite is not a $60 game.

1535
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,900
It's the problem is that it's like, here's a $60 game.

1536
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,900
Oh, and then we want to sell you these cosmetics.

1537
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:14,100
They're like $20 each. Oh, and then we want you to buy this shit.

1538
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:18,260
Oh, and then we want you to buy a $99 subscription service to a game that like

1539
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,980
is this going to be even functioning in a year?

1540
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:26,100
I mean, like, why why should I drop $99 on this game?

1541
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,060
Like, I don't know.

1542
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:30,420
And look, I do understand to an extent that there's going to be boardroom

1543
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,340
pressure to mirror the successes of other games.

1544
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,100
But like Fortnite started from somewhere.

1545
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,580
Why not create the next big thing in gaming?

1546
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,980
Because believe it or not, you know, every year

1547
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:44,500
we're talking about these new games, these new things that happen in gaming.

1548
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,700
They come from somewhere.

1549
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:51,100
And I feel like, you know, I think Fallout 76 is kind of a gone thing at this point.

1550
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:55,300
But let's say this Starfield or this Elder Scrolls six comes out.

1551
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,420
If Elder Scrolls six is a great fucking game,

1552
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,140
then that's what people are going to be talking about.

1553
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:01,100
And people are going to want to play it and talk about it.

1554
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:04,260
But look, it's like, OK, if you want to compare your game to Fortnite

1555
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,460
and you want to compare, you know, like how they have it.

1556
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:08,540
Don't just look at the microtransactions.

1557
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,540
Look at how the game plays. The game is polished.

1558
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:15,100
The game doesn't have that many bugs in it.

1559
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:19,380
Fallout 76 was fucking broken when it came out there.

1560
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,460
You cannot compare it.

1561
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:21,980
You can't say, well, we're going to put

1562
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,980
we're going to set the same same type of shop

1563
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,100
and we're going to have the same type of success.

1564
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,780
You got to have the good game to get the people there,

1565
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:32,340
the one to actually play your game, because right now it's fucking broken

1566
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,220
and just promises of like roadmaps of and that's the bad thing about it.

1567
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,220
It's like a lot of these games of service stuff, even with Anthem,

1568
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:43,420
have these roadmaps because they come out incomplete, broken pieces of rush shit.

1569
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:47,260
And then now it's like, oh, but we promise we'll get, you know, better later.

1570
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,620
Pay us another hundred dollars.

1571
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,180
I mean, fuck that.

1572
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,420
Why should I waste my time?

1573
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:54,860
Bobby Blackwell in chat says wasn't Final Fantasy 14, 60 dollars

1574
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:56,020
and then a monthly fee.

1575
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:58,140
To be fair, I think it was 40 dollars and then a monthly fee.

1576
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:02,140
But I think it is worth saying there are two games, maybe three.

1577
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,260
If you want to get technical, they can get away with doing that right now

1578
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:09,100
that can charge an upfront fee and then a monthly fee on top of that.

1579
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,380
But it didn't stop everybody else from trying to mirror that. Right.

1580
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,540
Hello. What was it?

1581
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:19,700
Rift. Hello. God, there's so many other tabula rasa.

1582
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,220
Star Wars, Old Republic,

1583
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,300
Elder Scrolls Online and all these games that tried to do the same thing and flopped

1584
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,100
and credit games, two games have succeeded with that model.

1585
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:33,020
And there's a little difference, too, because we understand with I'm putting

1586
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,660
eleven and fourteen in the same bucket.

1587
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:38,180
We understand that like a game like Final Fantasy 14 is an MMO,

1588
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,980
which I know you could say that, you know, well,

1589
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,860
Anthem and these other games could be like an MMO.

1590
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:46,580
But I believe that Final Fantasy and I know that was the case for eleven.

1591
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,900
They're not selling cosmetic items.

1592
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,180
It's that monthly fee.

1593
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:53,220
That's your price to entry. Incorrect. OK.

1594
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,140
But they're not shoving it down your throat. Correct.

1595
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,260
Like these other games. Correct. OK.

1596
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,060
Eleven didn't sell cosmic items.

1597
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,820
That's all I have to go by.

1598
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,180
No, fourteen definitely does.

1599
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:09,740
But like it's a fucking fat cat as a mount, like it's fucking adorable.

1600
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,820
And they I mean, they do say that.

1601
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,740
But so does Wow Wow has their mount store, too.

1602
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,420
So they and they sell expansions.

1603
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,220
So it is it's a different model than this game to the service.

1604
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,980
But here's the thing. It's like the games of service stuff.

1605
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,500
Like you have Fortnite, which is free to play.

1606
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,820
And then they have their, you know, season pass or not their passes,

1607
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,820
but they're kind of different

1608
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:33,460
seasons that they do with different things that you can get for loot

1609
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,460
and you can pay for skins and stuff like that.

1610
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,060
So they have that model.

1611
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:40,540
Then they have the model where you buy the game and you play online

1612
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,780
and there's other like cosmetics and stuff.

1613
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,700
And then you have like subscription services and stuff.

1614
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,300
Fallout 76 wants to do all of those models at once.

1615
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,100
And that's where it's fucked up.

1616
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,820
And here's the thing also about 14 that's very unique is that

1617
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,420
the original product came out. It was garbage.

1618
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,940
The company had to apologize for it and they fixed it.

1619
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:04,540
And, you know, I know not everybody is going to understand this or believe this.

1620
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,980
But this this is a hill I'm willing to die on.

1621
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,260
This is this is a hill.

1622
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,860
I'm going to I'm going to die on this hill. I'm dying.

1623
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:12,220
I'm dying on my hill.

1624
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,860
Final Fantasy 14. That was my microphone.

1625
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,100
Killing Pikachu.

1626
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:19,220
Final Fantasy 14, I'm dead.

1627
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:23,980
But I wanted to say my final words on my tombstone are Final Fantasy

1628
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:29,860
14 has some of the best story in any MMO or any Final Fantasy game.

1629
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:33,020
Put it on my tombstone, pepperoni and sausage.

1630
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,220
All right. Now I want pizza. Thanks, Rob.

1631
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,340
And that's why Final Fantasy 14 gets away with it.

1632
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,980
And in many ways, World of Warcraft is the same thing.

1633
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,180
It's got a story that many,

1634
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:50,500
many people love and adore, and they've made their guildmates and all this stuff.

1635
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,980
And it's it's their life.

1636
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:56,220
And I mean that in a negative way, like when Alan and I were first dating,

1637
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:00,060
we used to quest in World of Warcraft and that was like our date.

1638
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,580
I know it sounds weird, but that's the type of stuff you do

1639
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:05,500
when you have like long distance between you sometimes.

1640
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,260
And so like, you know, World of Warcraft

1641
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,340
had a really engrossing story where you could do things like that, too.

1642
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:12,620
I think that's why in particular, those two games have gotten away with it

1643
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,980
as well as they have, because they're both extremely polished games.

1644
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:18,780
So anyway.

1645
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,340
Moving on, where were we?

1646
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:23,500
Oh, it was that it on Fallout 76? Yes.

1647
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,900
OK, let's move on before I before I die again.

1648
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:28,780
Let's rather you not die.

1649
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:32,140
Let's talk about Death Stranding, because that game is kind of like

1650
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,260
going to be the hot new thing of this week.

1651
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:37,060
And the reviews are finally coming out on Death Stranding.

1652
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:40,180
And we finally kind of fucking know what the game is.

1653
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,660
And it sounds like Death Stranding.

1654
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,940
I still don't know what it is after hearing the reviews.

1655
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,700
It's Fetch Quest is what Death Stranding is.

1656
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,740
It's Fetch Quest, the game.

1657
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:50,980
It's Amazon Delivery Boy, the game with babies, with babies.

1658
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,740
But it sounds like Amazon babies.

1659
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,620
It sounds like it's obviously I'm oversimplifying it.

1660
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:00,580
It sounds very interesting that you have to kind of like actually balance yourself

1661
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:04,220
as you're going through terrain because of the big load that you're carrying.

1662
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,740
But, you know, you have to like be very careful not to fall in the baby.

1663
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:11,460
Yeah, or kill the baby or I don't know, things like that.

1664
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:17,060
It's interesting because the more and more I read these reviews about like, wow,

1665
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:20,940
this game story is up its own ass so deep.

1666
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:24,020
I'm all I'm like more and more like I really want to play it.

1667
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,740
Yeah, I kind of do too.

1668
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:32,140
The more I hear about like Kojima has successfully eaten his own ass

1669
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,940
in a video game and he's put it on screen for us all to enjoy.

1670
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,100
I'm like, I want to play that.

1671
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,380
This self-indulgent garbage.

1672
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:43,100
It's art. I want to play it.

1673
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,420
It is time to indulge in some Kojima ass.

1674
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:51,100
It kind of is like the more and more I hear people hating on this game.

1675
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,260
I'm like, it sounds awesome.

1676
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,180
Like when somebody said, what was the review?

1677
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,020
I read somewhere where it was like,

1678
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:03,300
it's the classiest walking simulator you'll ever play.

1679
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,980
I'm like, I love walking simulators.

1680
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,340
There was one. There was one I read.

1681
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,060
I got to find the

1682
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,220
I got to find the quote.

1683
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:15,020
It was something about like it was from a giant ball.

1684
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:18,660
They had they had a great quote.

1685
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,220
I'll get this for you.

1686
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,660
But it was oh, here we go.

1687
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,020
Giant ball with death stranding.

1688
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,100
Johnny Woofay in our chat says,

1689
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,300
I have my life size baby in a jar with absurd game preordered.

1690
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,180
That's where I'm at.

1691
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:33,540
I'm at this point where I'm like, OK,

1692
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,740
like I can appreciate really bad cinema.

1693
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:41,100
Like if this is that like as a game, I'm kind of into it.

1694
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,260
Like right now, I can't believe I'm saying this,

1695
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,540
especially after giving this game shit for so many years of like,

1696
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,660
where's the game? Right.

1697
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:52,460
Like now I'm like, I kind of now that I know what the game is

1698
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,980
and that it's apparently really ridiculous, I really want it.

1699
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,540
I don't know what it is. I can't explain it.

1700
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,420
That sounds a lot like me winning my pink Game Boy advance.

1701
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:06,020
I don't like pink, but I wanted it for reasons.

1702
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,980
Bobby Black Wolf with this comment says,

1703
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,860
apparently it's the Dark Souls of Walking.

1704
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,940
A little rock can trip you up if you don't hold L2 and R2

1705
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,820
perfectly. The Dark Souls of Walking?

1706
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:22,180
That is put that on the box.

1707
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,940
That's amazing.

1708
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,300
The Dark Souls of Walking.

1709
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:33,460
Uh, where's that quote?

1710
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,580
I got to find it. It was hilarious when I read it.

1711
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:39,780
Here we go. Jeff Gerstmann, 2019.

1712
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:43,460
It's part American Truck Simulator, but also QWOP.

1713
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:49,380
I fucking love QWOP. Let's do this.

1714
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:51,620
Oh, my God. I can't wait for Death Stranding.

1715
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,700
This is really fucking ridiculous.

1716
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,020
Don't you kind of want it, though?

1717
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,580
I know. I told you already that I want it.

1718
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,580
I don't even know what the game...

1719
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:06,540
Look, look, even Dark Sakura, even the harshest of harsh in this house,

1720
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:10,860
even her cold black recently operated heart.

1721
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,980
They didn't work on my heart.

1722
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,340
That's what you were unconscious.

1723
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:20,460
They might have. Even she is like, I'm kind of into Death Stranding

1724
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,540
all of a sudden.

1725
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,060
It's not an all of the sudden thing.

1726
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,300
I was already really into it.

1727
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,660
I still don't know what it's about.

1728
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:29,700
I'm just going to have my psychological fix for what I'm lacking

1729
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:33,180
from Silent Hill not existing in real life anymore.

1730
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:35,700
Loki, we're going to explain what this game is about.

1731
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,620
Look at me, Loki. Look at me. Look at me.

1732
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,700
The Dark Souls of walking.

1733
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:43,820
It's a metaphor.

1734
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:47,060
As all Kojima things are, it's a metaphor.

1735
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,780
Tiger Claw on chat says, Who knows?

1736
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:52,340
Death Stranding could be your game of the year for 2019.

1737
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,940
It might be. But isn't that going to be interesting

1738
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,140
if it ends up winning awards at the game awards?

1739
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:58,500
How's that going to work?

1740
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,180
I should also. Jeff Keeley's in the game and he produces the game awards.

1741
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:05,100
Like, aren't they going to say shenanigans if this game wins?

1742
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:08,020
I mean, it could also be the violent diarrhea of video games.

1743
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,580
No, but we won't know until we try it.

1744
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,540
It's like ice cream.

1745
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:17,420
You look at the ice cream, you think, wow, that could be really bad for me.

1746
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:19,820
This is really rich and I'm lactose intolerant. Right.

1747
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,100
But you eat the ice cream, not knowing if it maybe has some acidophilus

1748
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:27,620
strains in there that will help offset the the lactose.

1749
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:31,060
But then again, you might also have violent diarrhea because of it.

1750
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:33,540
That's Death Stranding.

1751
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:37,460
Potential violent diarrhea, but delicious while you're consuming it.

1752
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:43,980
Did she just say never mind, Eurogamer calls it Hideo Kojima's

1753
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:47,940
first post Metal Gear game is a messy, indulgent vanity project,

1754
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,780
but also true original. I'll go for it.

1755
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:53,620
Yeah, I'm all about vanity projects anyway.

1756
01:29:55,100 --> 01:30:00,300
I mean, Madonna's Madam X was kind of a vanity project as well, right?

1757
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:00,820
Kinda.

1758
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:08,100
Why, why, orange hat is asking, why is the diarrhea violent?

1759
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,260
Apparently, you're not lactose intolerant.

1760
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:15,460
All right, moving on.

1761
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:16,820
I think, wow, look at that.

1762
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:17,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1763
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,580
My stream deck just showed we just lost three viewers.

1764
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,740
Good job there, Sakura.

1765
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,900
You know what, they can get over it.

1766
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,540
All right, moving on. You know what?

1767
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:32,100
They'll just have to rejoin and watch that pre roll ad and we'll get the coin.

1768
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,740
All right, moving on.

1769
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:41,180
Dr. Sakura, fucking get us back on topic topic like we ever had one.

1770
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:46,620
So how about something that doesn't have anything to do with violent diarrhea?

1771
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:49,180
Nintendo Switch.

1772
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:55,900
It actually has already, of course, surpassed the Nintendo 64 sales in April.

1773
01:30:56,180 --> 01:31:01,860
And now it looks like over the holidays, it's going to pass over the SNES for sales.

1774
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:09,780
It will need 7.43 million more sales to pass the sales figures of the Super Nintendo.

1775
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:15,220
And I mean, in last year, the Switch sold 9.41 million units.

1776
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:17,580
So two quarters to go.

1777
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,260
We need to see what's going to happen.

1778
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:29,100
So that means it's right now 11 million away from its target, which is by fiscal year ending in March 2020,

1779
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,020
which would be 18 million Switch units.

1780
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:40,060
So, of course, we also have the Switch Lite, you know, definitely cutting into the expense of the full unit.

1781
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,620
I mean, but, you know, they've also been doing just really quality games.

1782
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:49,860
I mean, not just, you know, Link's Awakening that just came out, like, not long ago.

1783
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,980
But there's the Fire Emblem, Three Houses got great reviews.

1784
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,260
You know, it's a pretty great system.

1785
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:01,140
And on top of that, it's very versatile because you can carry it with you and play it on your big screen,

1786
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,780
which is what everybody wanted.

1787
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:05,100
So there you go.

1788
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,180
Yeah, and Nintendo Switch is great.

1789
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:13,900
And it's so weird to think that, like, it's at the point where there's going to be more of those out there than there were

1790
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:18,140
Super Nintendo, because it always feels like Super Nintendo is like the greatest system of all time.

1791
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,380
I still feel that in my heart.

1792
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:23,100
But maybe that's because I was 12 years old and Super Nintendo was like the new thing.

1793
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,420
And so I think whatever system like you associate with like your junior high and your early high school,

1794
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:31,580
like formative years, you're going to think is the greatest console of all time, too, probably.

1795
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:33,980
Well, I don't know. Maybe. I don't know.

1796
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:35,300
There's always the Sega Saturn.

1797
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:42,260
But anyway, I'm just I'm kind of like, oh, it's weird to think that we're already at a point where the Switch is

1798
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:46,700
going to outsell that. But that also is because more and more people are gaming.

1799
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:51,300
Right. You know, like the only people that don't understand gaming at this point are boomers.

1800
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:54,060
OK, boomer. Yeah, you would be surprised.

1801
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:58,420
No, I know. And I'm just I just wanted an opportunity to make a cheap joke at the boomers expense.

1802
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:04,460
But I think I think more and more even and even in that age group are getting into gaming.

1803
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:11,100
And I think more and more people gaming is just a part of culture now and is is a part of art art that we partake in.

1804
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:16,860
So it's just interesting, like how fast the switch has hit that point when it sometimes felt like, oh,

1805
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:23,140
there's nothing could ever top the Super Nintendo, even though actually a lot of systems have since taught the Super Nintendo in sales.

1806
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:28,860
Yeah. So anyway, by the way, do you know why I started smirking while you were reading that story?

1807
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:35,980
Because I realized the whole point of me bringing up Death Stranding was to tell you guys that, oh, yeah, it's also coming out on PC.

1808
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,260
And you forgot to mention that.

1809
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:40,700
And I never mentioned what the actual story was about.

1810
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:45,740
It was up on the. So we're clear just to back up a little bit here.

1811
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:49,900
Oh, yes. Death Stranding is to get a PC release.

1812
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,700
Yes, that was that was the original point of the summer 2020.

1813
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:56,300
Yes. If if the PlayStation 4, for whatever reason, you still have one.

1814
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,900
You're like, oh, I'm going to skip it.

1815
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:01,380
I'm going to wait for PlayStation five or you're just a strictly a PC gamer.

1816
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:06,380
Well, guess what? Death Stranding will also be out on PC next year from what?

1817
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,580
Five or five games is doing it right.

1818
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:14,260
Some people are actually pissed off about this news because they were promised that it would be a PlayStation exclusive.

1819
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,460
And now they're very.

1820
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,580
Why are you mad at something that's not exclusive?

1821
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,100
I don't I don't know.

1822
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,780
How dare you get to play the game?

1823
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,020
I like to on another platform. Damn it.

1824
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,380
I think it's a fanboy thing.

1825
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:30,620
Like when you've been defending Sony and all this stuff all this time and you're like, well, they're the ones that OKed it.

1826
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:35,460
I I mean, if you think about it, are you mad that like, you know,

1827
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:41,060
Detroit become human and all those other aquatic dream games are on Epic Store?

1828
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:45,060
I was at first, but then I didn't care.

1829
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,740
At first I was afraid.

1830
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:49,340
I was such a no stop it.

1831
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,340
But yeah, I don't I don't.

1832
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:56,300
Maybe somebody in our chat wants to give insight on that because I just don't think that way.

1833
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,140
I'm just like, yeah, more people get to play the game. That's cool.

1834
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:03,700
And honestly, the PlayStation still has a big old six month window for people to experience.

1835
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:08,180
The Dark Souls of walking all to themselves.

1836
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,340
So I can't wait to check out the Dark Souls.

1837
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:16,380
I don't know. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they are afraid this means that Sony isn't committed to the console.

1838
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:23,740
What the news about the PlayStation five didn't show that the PlayStation four is has has a lifespan.

1839
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:27,060
The PlayStation five is indeed coming.

1840
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:32,460
I don't I honestly like to to Bobby's point and everybody else out there,

1841
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:40,980
like Sony kind of has to be a little more committed to PC because of where Microsoft is positioning themselves,

1842
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,980
because Microsoft is about to step into this world where it's going to be.

1843
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:56,540
You know, Xbox is more the ecosystem that you experience either on your PC or on your television via an Xbox console as a delivery or via the cloud.

1844
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:08,260
I actually would go so far as to say it would be foolish of Sony to not consider getting in on the PC side of things as well and finding that right partner to do so.

1845
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:11,860
That maybe isn't necessarily Microsoft or depends how they want to play that game.

1846
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:18,140
So anyway. All right, let's move on.

1847
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:20,900
Loki, let's talk about games that won't happen.

1848
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,900
And this is not the first time this has happened.

1849
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:29,940
But EA has canceled NBA 2K20 or NBA, I'm sorry, NBA Live 20.

1850
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:36,340
I can't believe I'm confused at what two NBA franchises are out there.

1851
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:39,700
But yes, NBA Live 20 is not coming out.

1852
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:43,980
They said we're not launching a new NBA Live HD product this season.

1853
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:56,820
Instead, we are expanding our vision, learning are leaning hard into the new leading edge platforms and taking the time to ensure we deliver against the opportunity for our players.

1854
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:05,380
So maybe extra time to, I don't know, develop for the new platforms that come in next year.

1855
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:12,140
I mean, that's good, I guess, instead of just rehashing, you know, roster update 2020 or something like that.

1856
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:18,820
Yeah, it would be very disappointing if like the PlayStation 5 version was just like the PlayStation 4 copied with some upgrades.

1857
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:30,420
So if they're taking the year off to really bring us like a really souped up NBA, because I could see this, you know, as much as we here at OLR don't always get into the sports games, you know, we don't do the deep dive on those all the time.

1858
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,860
Although I don't know, like, I still love NBA Jam.

1859
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:34,780
And, you know, there's always going to be Tecmo Bowl.

1860
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:37,180
There's always going to be those sports games that kind of like buck the trend.

1861
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:38,020
Right. Blade and steal.

1862
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:42,260
But the reality is we don't usually do the deep dive on the sports games.

1863
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:52,260
But the reality is when it comes to E3, when it comes to that big press conference or whatever it is where Sony is going to unveil the new console and so forth, it is going to help them to be able to show off.

1864
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:59,660
Look how pretty the sports ball is, because there are a lot of people out there that the consoles are, it's their Madden machine.

1865
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,740
It's their NBA machine.

1866
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,780
These are the games they fucking play.

1867
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:07,380
Live has been kind of think they're weaker of the sports franchises that they had.

1868
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:11,940
I mean, really, 2K kind of rules the NBA franchises stuff.

1869
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:13,860
But I don't know.

1870
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:17,900
I know it's been kind of iffy in the past and 2K kind of gives it a run for its money.

1871
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:22,780
But 2K has been kind of second to some folks and I don't I have really low standards for sports games.

1872
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:29,420
Some folks in chatter are quick to bring up WWE 2K20, which no, no, no, I know that's a hot piece of shit.

1873
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,940
I mean, I've seen the videos, so yes.

1874
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,740
And that's what happens when you have no competition.

1875
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:38,100
It's just it's completely fucked.

1876
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:42,220
It's the Dark Souls of wrestling games, the challenge, playing it.

1877
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:45,460
It's just it's it's all sorts of messed up.

1878
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:51,940
Yeah, all right, well, I pour one out, I guess, for NBA Live 20.

1879
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:58,740
But I mean, if it makes the next NBA game that much better, I think we can do I think we can go one year without.

1880
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:01,300
I think it'll be OK, so we'll see what happens.

1881
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:06,500
Anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about since we're talking about the next round of consoles,

1882
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:11,940
our next story has to do a little bit with the next round of Xbox and what Microsoft might have in store.

1883
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:16,900
And one of the people that's going to be helping them out with the development of games to their console, it's Ubisoft.

1884
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:22,420
Apparently, Ubisoft is developing five games for Microsoft's new console.

1885
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:29,380
This is from an earnings call where Yves Guillemot, I hope I said his name right, who is the Ubisoft CEO.

1886
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:33,940
He announced that they are working on five games for Microsoft's next Xbox console.

1887
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:40,660
Three of the five titles are Watch Dogs, Legion, Gods and Monsters and Rainbow Six Quarantine.

1888
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,740
They've talked about these games previously.

1889
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:46,020
For example, I know that Watch Dogs was a big part of their E3 this year.

1890
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:53,180
So these three games will be released both on Xbox one and the Project Scarlet, whatever that is.

1891
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:57,100
But apparently the other two games have yet to be announced.

1892
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:04,260
Now, the only other thing about this whole thing is that I thought all Scarlet games were still going to work on the old Xbox hardware.

1893
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,140
I thought that was the thing that Microsoft promised.

1894
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:10,380
Or was that only for their own games and they can't talk about third parties?

1895
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:12,420
Did I misinterpret that?

1896
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:13,300
I thought, I don't know.

1897
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:20,340
So to be determined, well, we really won't know until they unveil the console because they could change any of the rules, quite frankly.

1898
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:26,140
It should also be noted Ubisoft has delayed several games that they've been working on.

1899
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:35,500
And this could be part of the reason for the delay is that developers now have time to create next-gen versions of the game because we're in this interesting little in-between period.

1900
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:36,460
I don't know.

1901
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:44,020
But it should also be mentioned that as part of this earnings call, only Xbox Scarlet was mentioned, not PlayStation 5.

1902
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:46,820
Ubisoft has typically supported both.

1903
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:49,100
So this could mean something.

1904
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,540
It could mean nothing.

1905
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:59,500
We don't really know until they officially unveil these things outside of just an earnings call where they're trying to tell the investors we're working on something, but we can't get all the details just yet.

1906
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:01,740
So, interesting.

1907
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,340
We'll see what develops from here.

1908
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:12,540
But I don't know, anything you guys are reading in the tea leaves about this with Ubisoft working on the next Xbox, but not being so explicit about PlayStation or any of this?

1909
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,540
And I open this up to the chat room as well for your thoughts.

1910
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,260
I don't, I'm so sick of rumors.

1911
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:20,580
I mean, I...

1912
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,220
Well, to be fair, this isn't a rumor.

1913
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:23,620
It's on an earnings call.

1914
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,060
It's just like, what do you read into it?

1915
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:29,580
But still, I don't want to read anything into it until I have something concrete.

1916
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:35,900
I mean, that's really how I am with any of this stuff now, because we've been burned before trying to follow this.

1917
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,580
So I'm really just reserving judgment.

1918
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,260
Some comments from our chat.

1919
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:47,900
Questbuster says those are the same three games that they delayed following Breakpoint's less than stellar reception.

1920
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:52,580
Yeah, the Breakpoint game did not quite live up to the expectations they were hoping for.

1921
01:41:52,580 --> 01:42:00,100
So, you know, but I mean, every studio has that one game, it seems like, that doesn't seem to go over so well.

1922
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:03,460
So I don't know, maybe, but certainly they don't want to do it again.

1923
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:04,020
We'll see.

1924
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,940
So, all right, moving on.

1925
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:09,260
Let's get into our next story, Dark Sakura.

1926
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,180
Wheel.

1927
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:19,180
Speaking of things that are getting out, Kohl's has their Black Friday 2019 ad leaked.

1928
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:22,020
It's got stuff in it that's very interesting.

1929
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:26,700
So their deals are going to be actually pretty good.

1930
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,500
I think last year's were really good too.

1931
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:36,340
But right now is, you know, they've also been pretty universal for what they do.

1932
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:42,820
So what their Black Friday promotion is right now is that you get $15 in Kohl's cash for every $50 that you spend.

1933
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:54,620
And so this means that when you put that along with your doorbusters, you're getting like another like 60 to whatever bucks that you can spend on other things too.

1934
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:57,220
I mean, not that I'm putting theirs up, but theirs was the leaked list.

1935
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:06,260
So for the doorbusters that they're having this year is a PS4 one terabyte Fortnite Neo versa bundle for $200 with $60 in Kohl's cash.

1936
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:10,260
So effectively, when you apply that cash to it, it's $139.99.

1937
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:17,420
Xbox One S one terabyte with Jedi Fallen Order for $200, again with the same deal.

1938
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:25,460
And then a switch with a carrying case and controller charging dock for $319.99 with $90 in their Kohl's cash.

1939
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:27,220
So $229.99.

1940
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:40,700
The Jedi Fallen Order bundle looks like it's probably going to be the big one a lot of people go to, but the switch one is pretty okay, especially with, you know, the incentive of their little Kohl's cash deal.

1941
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:44,020
Yeah, I was gonna say, I think a switch is normally about $300 anyway.

1942
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:47,580
But yeah, if you're like, you're like, oh, I want to buy new clothes on top of it.

1943
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:51,340
It's a pretty good like the cash back or whatever the Kohl's card or whatever it's called.

1944
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:52,500
It's pretty, pretty good deal.

1945
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:56,820
And it doesn't it looks like the that not everyone's going to be super aggressive on it.

1946
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:05,500
Because I think that people are already kind of agro on winning the the new the systems anyway, if they're going to buy them, they're going to buy them.

1947
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:15,660
Yeah, I was gonna say this is this is I mean, and this is this year is the swan song apparently for these consoles, because next year we'll be talking about PlayStation five, whatever the next Xbox is a come the holidays.

1948
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:19,740
So I mean, that's a real like they're that's a deep discount on both those consoles.

1949
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:23,820
So if you have stopped for you have still not got on board, which is fine.

1950
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:27,260
And not every gamer has that kind of income to buy the latest and greatest consoles.

1951
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:29,860
Sometimes you have to get your games to garage, which is pretty steady.

1952
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:37,660
And that's fine. But these Yeah, these consoles are a way to get on board if you you know, and especially now with the rich libraries, both these platforms have

1953
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,260
Well, both I'm talking about the switch. That's three.

1954
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:44,300
Well, well, but this is also a little newer, which isn't spot

1955
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:51,980
They're not really advertising, they're not really pushing anything super aggressive for their marketing for the switch, because they know the switch is going to be a seller.

1956
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:58,500
I mean, that's just going to go without saying, but I mean, the other two, I don't know that that's really a super aggressive.

1957
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:02,820
Like deal for either of those either.

1958
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:05,380
I mean, I said, I'm repeating my words now.

1959
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:13,660
But I'm really I'm not really convinced that that's like the most aggressive way they can push it like as the we need you to buy these because they're going to be gone, blah, blah, blah.

1960
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:15,500
I don't think I don't get that feel off of it.

1961
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:21,460
Well, and but to be fair, this is also only the first of what is many Black Friday postings to come.

1962
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:24,260
And, you know, the rest of the holidays as well.

1963
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:30,940
You know, this is going to be the time still sub 200 is a pretty, pretty darn good way to get in to both these systems.

1964
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:35,660
So, yeah, I'm sure the deals are just going to be even better at other places, too.

1965
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:39,660
So it's that time of year when we get into the sales.

1966
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:41,300
I can't believe November's like already here.

1967
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:45,540
It's crazy. My mommy's birthday's in two days and I don't know what to get her.

1968
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,380
Well, happy early birthday. Get her Nintendo Switch.

1969
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:51,420
I'm just kidding. My mom would be like, maybe I'll get her an NES.

1970
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,780
Well, I mean, you can always get a device.

1971
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:58,540
I mean, as silly as it is to have a PlayStation or an Xbox, she wouldn't be into it.

1972
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:03,660
But you could you use them as media centers, but maybe she's already got a Blu-ray player for my brother.

1973
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:07,180
Yeah. And I was going to say maybe a Roku or something like that is a better I'll send her an S.

1974
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,740
Yeah. She used to sneak into my room and play mine enough.

1975
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:13,700
Oh, there you go. Now, get her one of the NES classics, if you can find one.

1976
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:16,340
We'll see. All right. We'll see.

1977
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:19,540
All right. Well, moving on to something that is sunsetting.

1978
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:21,300
It's no longer going to be around.

1979
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:24,860
And actually, I got to say, this one kind of surprises me, kind of doesn't.

1980
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,860
Oh, I'm sorry. This is your story, Loki. My bad.

1981
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:30,100
I was like bringing it up going. Oh, hold on.

1982
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:36,380
Yes. So apparently PlayStation Vue is going to be done at the end of January.

1983
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:44,420
So it was there Sony's kind of TV offering, and I did try it out for a little bit.

1984
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:47,780
Wasn't all that impressed, especially when Comedy Central went away.

1985
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:51,740
And apparently it just hasn't been doing that well, I guess.

1986
01:46:51,820 --> 01:47:00,380
So they said that for the inactive paid subscriptions will receive their final charge for PlayStation Vue in December 2019.

1987
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:05,460
Unless they cancel prior to their billing date, they'll be able to watch until January 30th.

1988
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:13,500
Well, yeah, they said they're going to remain focused on their core gaming business instead of this.

1989
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:23,980
Interesting way to set the tone in advance of the PlayStation V, because I would have thought, oh, maybe.

1990
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:29,620
I mean, I realize PlayStation Vue has not been doing so hot, especially because they have not been landing the right channels.

1991
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,500
Yeah, it's been kind of like, yeah.

1992
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:44,380
Yeah. So, you know, and maybe that has more to do with the general shift with people are kind of canceling their cable in favor of piecemealing the Netflix, Hulu, CBS, Disney, all this stuff.

1993
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:49,580
Somebody added it all up. It's like 90 bucks if you want to get everything that's out there right now, a month.

1994
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:52,660
So but anyway, people are kind of piecemealing what they want that way.

1995
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:58,020
I don't know if it has to do with the cable going away or whatever, but it's going to be interesting when the PlayStation V kind of rolls out.

1996
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:02,340
Like, is there going to be an emphasis on TV and media and that sort of thing?

1997
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:05,860
We all know famously when the Xbox One was debuted.

1998
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:15,580
And this was part of the reason that, you know, they kind of got shit for that reveal, especially Don Mattrick, because the message from that early, early reveal, if you guys remember, was TV, TV, sports, sports, sports.

1999
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:24,380
But I don't even know if the Xbox One ever, like, kind of fulfilled that promise that they were going to do with like their even like the Windows Universal apps and stuff like that.

2000
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:26,260
They had to dial back that whole introduction, remember?

2001
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:32,140
Yeah, but yeah, but even like with the Windows 10 Universal apps, do they have like the support that they promised to have in there?

2002
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:42,620
Because like I thought there was supposed to be all this additional functionality being added to the Xbox One with those Universal Windows platform apps that were supposed to run on the Xbox One natively.

2003
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:52,220
But I don't think that ever happened to I mean, I know Skype and stuff sort of works in there, but I don't think there's been like a large support for that.

2004
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:58,220
I don't think so either, but it's probably something that just isn't a priority right now while we wait on the next Xbox. That's my guess.

2005
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:02,980
Some people are going to miss view, by the way, because you know, in chat says I'm going to miss view.

2006
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:06,500
It was great. It had HBO, Cinemax, Starz, all the Disney channels.

2007
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,020
Just scroll off it.

2008
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:09,980
Darn it.

2009
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,940
Disney's not going to be on there anymore.

2010
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,180
It had picture in picture.

2011
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:14,460
The basic plan was worth it.

2012
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:18,220
All they were missing was Viacom, but no one watches MTV and all that trash.

2013
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:22,620
Well, Disney is not going to be on there anymore, I'm assuming, so they're going to lose that.

2014
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:24,020
And then who knows?

2015
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:24,860
I mean, the other ones.

2016
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:29,940
Yeah, by the way, Bobby wants to point out there has been support for that, what you're talking about.

2017
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:32,620
That's how Antstream Arcade is on Xbox One.

2018
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:35,780
For instance, it's the same Universal Windows app that's on PC.

2019
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:38,220
HoloLens will also run the Universal Windows app.

2020
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:40,420
Does Antstream work on HoloLens?

2021
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:42,140
That's kind of kind of silly, but fun.

2022
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:44,940
So, OK, so that's so I guess they can.

2023
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:52,380
That actually does that does make sense because there have been other things I've played on PC that are just like 360 or excuse me, Xbox One.

2024
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:54,700
So, yeah, interesting.

2025
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,620
Anyway, let's move on now.

2026
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:02,180
Loki kind of stole the thunder on this earlier, but that's OK, because this is more of a silly, quick thing.

2027
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:09,580
But the official trademarks have been filed for PlayStation six, seven, eight, nine and 10.

2028
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:10,300
That's right.

2029
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:14,220
Trademark applications have been submitted for PlayStation six through 10 in Japan.

2030
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:15,860
Obviously, they already did five.

2031
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:21,300
But you know what? PlayStation can keep this naming convention all the way through PlayStation 10 if they want.

2032
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:29,780
And I fully look forward to the wonderful gaming articles we'll see once the PlayStation nine comes around based on the original commercials that they had.

2033
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:30,380
Oh, yeah.

2034
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:32,460
Dark Tetsuya linked that old commercial.

2035
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:38,300
I didn't I thought it was a little bit too much of a deep dive to play here, but you can Google it if you want.

2036
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:44,380
And it is interesting, there was a commercial around the PlayStation two era that was trying to show off.

2037
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,420
Here's what the PlayStation nine will be like.

2038
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:48,220
And it was trying to show like the future of gaming.

2039
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:54,940
And I think the whole point of the commercial was the future starts here with the upgrade from PlayStation to PlayStation two.

2040
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:57,660
And then they set this path for PlayStation nine.

2041
01:50:57,660 --> 01:51:03,740
That was, you know, that was the holodeck, basically, as gaming gets one one step closer and closer to the holodeck.

2042
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:10,460
So, yeah, it is interesting to note that PlayStation may keep these naming conventions all the way through PlayStation 10.

2043
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:15,980
Of course, they don't have to trademark these names and not, you know, there's nothing making them do that.

2044
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:22,340
So it's it's a little bit of a nonstarter starter, but people are, you know, making some jokes about it.

2045
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:27,340
And that's why I made a little joke about it in the sidebar with my extreme enthusiasm for this news.

2046
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:36,380
But it should be noted that Sony does have a history of future proofing the console strategy in 2006, which was the year that PlayStation three was released.

2047
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:41,300
That is when they trademarked both PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

2048
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:47,660
So PlayStation five was confirmed 14 years ago from when it's going to be released, basically.

2049
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:54,260
So anyway, not to you know, at PlayStation has that mechanism.

2050
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:56,220
It works for them. So why not?

2051
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:00,740
Bonds 006 in our chat says name squatting.

2052
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:07,020
It's not so much squatting when it's you doing it, but I can also see where they want to prevent other people from doing it.

2053
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:14,020
But at the same time, I don't think I could just go in there and say, oh, I'm going to go trademark PlayStation 11 because they haven't gotten to that one yet.

2054
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:24,180
Like, I wouldn't pass the test because Sony would be able to challenge that and it would cost me a lot of money in fees unless I had used the name PlayStation somewhere else.

2055
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:26,660
So it would be it would be very, very silly.

2056
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:31,020
But I do get what you're saying, like domain squatting and all that stuff is a very serious issue out there.

2057
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:36,140
And, you know, something that is a bigger problem on the Internet, but bigger than we get into right now.

2058
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:39,100
But what we can get into right now is a much simpler time.

2059
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:43,020
Why? Why? Why talk about the PlayStation six or the PlayStation 10?

2060
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:49,980
Well, we can all go all go back to an era before even the PlayStation one, a very good go back to something that didn't come out in America.

2061
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:51,580
That's right. We can go all the way back.

2062
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:59,660
So every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this out, the classic game of the week.

2063
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:07,300
But once a month, Dark Soccer has to find a soundtrack as she mixes it up a little bit and does the classic soundtrack of the month.

2064
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:11,940
And since we've been gone for so long, I think we hopped from soundtrack to soundtrack.

2065
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:16,700
Right. Because I kind of did we did we get a September or excuse me, do we get an October soundtrack?

2066
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:20,380
I think we did. Yeah, I'd have to look.

2067
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:22,180
But I could always do another one, whatever.

2068
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:27,700
I know. Well, anyway, I'll go check our wiki because they know more about the show than I do.

2069
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:30,300
But I know we have a classic soundtrack of the month tonight.

2070
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:34,780
And this is this is interesting because you're still seeing with your eight bit theme, but you went to a very different console.

2071
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:38,740
I did, because, I mean, most of the people are familiar more with the NES of this.

2072
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:41,540
But I think the better soundtrack is on the MSX, too.

2073
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:48,740
And so, of course, I picked Metal Gear, kind of on a weird Kojima kick for reasons I can't imagine why.

2074
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:54,140
Well, it's art, explosive diarrhea anyway.

2075
01:53:54,820 --> 01:54:01,940
But anyway, and I specifically went, though, for the MSX one, because the MSX two really did have a much better sound processor.

2076
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,780
I mean, it was a damn computer, for fuck's sake.

2077
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:08,060
So I mean, but I really enjoy the music.

2078
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:20,020
It actually said that it's had a three person composer team of Mizutani Iku, Take no Uchi Shigahiru and Furukawa Motouaki.

2079
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:26,860
And then I wouldn't say that the the NES version was a bad translation, but it wasn't all that good.

2080
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:39,020
So going back to Mizutani, he actually did quite a bit of music for other games and created the sound driver at Natsume

2081
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:43,380
and did a lot of work for the Super Nintendo.

2082
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:47,380
But other games he did was Russian Attack.

2083
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:48,980
Of course, there's Metal Gear.

2084
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:53,380
There was Snatcher for PC-88, Snatcher for MSX.

2085
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:58,660
I'm looking for a few other games that people might know better.

2086
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:02,580
Shatterhand, he did some Sentai games.

2087
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:05,980
Dragon Fighter, quite a few other ones.

2088
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,540
Renegade, sound director.

2089
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:16,060
And then Furukawa did looks like worked on Gradius and Salamander.

2090
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:23,740
So I mean, we got some pretty good talent working on this game before some of the other titles came out.

2091
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:30,340
And as for the MSX itself, the audio for it was actually really, really good.

2092
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:35,700
They had MSX audio, which was released.

2093
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:51,540
So it had the Yamaha Y8950, nine channels of FM or six channels of FM and five drums had hardware acceleration to bump up the sample rate to 256k for audio RAM.

2094
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:56,340
So I mean, it was really just a good little machine for when it came out.

2095
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:04,380
And a lot of the music ability was standard for all the MSX Turbo-R computers.

2096
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:06,980
But it was built in on all the MSX2 systems.

2097
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:11,220
So really good music.

2098
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:27,060
And I think that Metal Gear being such an early title for Kojima, he had such in-depth direction over the whole game that you can feel his influence in with the music composition as well.

2099
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:38,300
I mean, really, it's one of, I'd say, the better video game soundtracks out there, not just, you know, for MSX, but in general, it really fit the game.

2100
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:46,420
It brought, you know, the action to life that that music really felt the stuff felt like it belonged to the stealth genre in particular.

2101
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:50,340
So and of course, we got some what, some boss fight music in here.

2102
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:54,980
I thought I had it within that first minute, but I don't have been talking.

2103
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:56,300
Yeah, I think you were talking over it.

2104
01:56:56,300 --> 01:57:00,620
But yeah, I mean, I love the boss fight music in this game.

2105
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:05,380
I think the clip I got ends with a boss theme too, but it's like a nine minute clip.

2106
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:06,460
So we may not get there.

2107
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:10,580
And I wouldn't say that the NES music was bad by any...

2108
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:13,700
No, and it's what we all kind of remember too.

2109
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:22,500
It's very interesting how butchered this game was in the US, but yet it still sold so well here.

2110
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:30,020
It sold so well, in fact, that they ended up making that whole Snake's Revenge that like Kojima kind of was like, that wasn't my game.

2111
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:32,940
I wish I could find that documentary that we watched.

2112
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:38,620
But the really interesting thing about it is that like, basically people were like, yeah, this version isn't good.

2113
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,860
We want you to do another, please, please, please, please, like fine.

2114
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:42,100
And he did another.

2115
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:49,380
And then, of course, it became really the one of the series that totally pushed his career.

2116
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:57,020
And then, of course, you know, Snatcher didn't really sell that well when it came out, but it, you know, of course, picked up that cult following.

2117
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:05,700
And then we got, you know, the more deluxe versions of Snatcher and then, you know, Policenauts was really out there and then we got Metal Gear Solid.

2118
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:22,100
So, you know, I think that all of those games really, though, have this to thank for it in the direction of just that level of storytelling and the environment that was created.

2119
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:24,540
And I think music goes a long way to creating that environment.

2120
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:25,620
Is there a way to play?

2121
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:29,940
Because I noticed this particular streamer is using like an English version of the MSX.

2122
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:32,140
Oh, yeah, there's translated ROMs out there.

2123
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:38,940
I thought I remember hearing there was a, like, they put the MSX version of Metal Gear in like Metal Gear Solid 3 or something like that.

2124
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:39,580
Yes.

2125
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:41,900
Um, so I remember that was the thing that I heard.

2126
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:43,100
Going back to that.

2127
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:45,700
Because I've never played the MSX version.

2128
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:50,380
I would really like to, just because I loved the original Metal Gear when I was a kid.

2129
01:58:50,540 --> 01:59:00,580
But then when I found out, you know, obviously years later that like, holy shit, like they completely changed the last boss in the game to like, I always thought it was weird.

2130
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:04,300
I was like, why is Metal Gear just like this big computer you kill with explosives?

2131
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:11,140
Because they, the mapper they used or something couldn't handle the actual Metal Gear looking mech thing.

2132
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:23,020
So just as an FYI, there was a port of the MSX2 Metal Gear for phones through Konami's NetDX service in Japan as a promo for Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater.

2133
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:43,620
Um, and it, uh, the updated port also, uh, it says it served as a basis for the version included on the second disc of subsistence, which is the expanded edition of Metal Gear Solid 3 for PS2 and then HD edition for PS3 also included it and the Vita version.

2134
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:48,900
The MSX2 Metal Gear was also released as a virtual console download for Wii in Japan.

2135
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:54,860
Um, the ROM used the, uh, the ROM was used for an emulated rerelease.

2136
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:57,340
Um, so there you go.

2137
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:05,180
Um, and they're confirming that in chat active says, um, MGS3 subsistence has it, uh, Johnny Wu-Fei says it should be on the HD collection.

2138
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:06,220
Yeah.

2139
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:10,740
And I know that, you know, Dan certainly has played through it.

2140
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:14,900
I, I sat and played through it for a little bit, but honestly it's.

2141
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:19,700
If you're in the house and someone else is already playing some of this, or like, why the fuck am I playing it?

2142
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:24,140
But, well, neat, neat to highlight the MSX version too.

2143
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:30,540
So you can hear the differences, especially when I think so many of us are familiar with the NES version, which again, isn't bad.

2144
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:34,580
Uh, but it just wasn't quite the same thing as the MSX version.

2145
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:38,700
So it's kind of interesting to go back to the roots of where the series was at.

2146
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:45,180
Well, and also, I mean, the, there was so much cut out in the, the NES version.

2147
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:50,180
And I think that of course, graphically, the MSX two just ran circles around it.

2148
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:54,500
Cause I mean, hello, it's a computer and it had more capability than the nested.

2149
02:00:55,100 --> 02:01:05,260
So, and honestly, I think that if this game had been made originally for NES instead of MSX two, it might not have even gotten the following that it did.

2150
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:11,180
So I think because it has such a big following for MSX two in Japan, that it led the way for the next one.

2151
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:14,620
And then, you know, that's my theory.

2152
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:17,900
I can't articulate it quite well right now because of drugs.

2153
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:18,740
No, you're fine.

2154
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:20,620
All right.

2155
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:30,140
So there it is your classic soundtrack of the month, metal gear, but specifically the MSX version, MSX two, excuse me, version of metal gear.

2156
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:30,740
So there you go.

2157
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:41,060
Um, and I did want to say just to just clarify, I did, I did a little research and the very last OLR we did before the break, you highlighted DuckTales as October's pick for South course.

2158
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:45,940
Yeah, I know what, how much we forget and, uh, three weeks of being gone, but there you go.

2159
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:47,180
So, all right.

2160
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:48,220
I think anymore coffee.

2161
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:49,420
So, all right.

2162
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:50,300
You need more coffee?

2163
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:50,820
Yeah, I think so.

2164
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:52,300
Well, sadly, I don't have a break tonight.

2165
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:53,980
We're going to get right into rapid fire news.

2166
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:55,140
Maybe Alan can help.

2167
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:56,260
Cause I hear Alan just got back.

2168
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:57,740
Oh, Alan, somebody in chat.

2169
02:01:57,740 --> 02:01:58,500
Wanted your take on this.

2170
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,220
Can you, can I bug you to come on the show?

2171
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:01,980
Come sit on Pikachu's lap.

2172
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:03,420
Okay.

2173
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:04,340
Hi Alan.

2174
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:05,420
It's always nice to have you here.

2175
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:07,900
This is, um, this is my other half Alan.

2176
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:08,260
Hi.

2177
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:09,140
Um, thank you, Matt.

2178
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:18,420
So, uh, so with some, uh, questions in chat, cause we were talking about Diablo earlier in the show and I don't know, have you been following the news that came out of Blizzcon and all that stuff would like Diablo and all that?

2179
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:20,060
Not with Diablo.

2180
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:20,980
I just know that it's a thing.

2181
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:22,460
They finally are given a Diablo four.

2182
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:24,940
Well, cause you were super into Diablo three.

2183
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:29,660
So somebody in our chat specifically asked, what was Alan's take on Diablo four?

2184
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:32,460
I haven't seen any, like, I've never seen this.

2185
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:34,460
Oh, you didn't even look at this game play trail or anything?

2186
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:40,860
Well, now that you've seen, I mean, it's, it's Diablo, but look, druids, they have druids now and he turns into a bear.

2187
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:42,620
He goes rawr and he smashes everybody.

2188
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:53,700
Well, I mean, it's kind of, I mean, it's probably like witch doctor reskinned a little bit or barbarian reskinned a little bit.

2189
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:57,700
Like, I mean, there's only so many powers, but however, like I'm, I'm not being a hater.

2190
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:58,660
It's just, you know,

2191
02:02:58,820 --> 02:02:59,340
Oh, that's okay.

2192
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:00,940
So you're just not well-researched on Diablo.

2193
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:02,340
What have you been playing then?

2194
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:03,340
I'll bug you on that real quick.

2195
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:10,940
Um, I've been playing lots of, uh, I mentioned this last time I was on the show, um, doom with project brutality three.

2196
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:15,140
I've been playing, uh, postal too.

2197
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:16,940
Cause I found that is random.

2198
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:18,780
What made you get into postal too?

2199
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:22,100
Cause I can't not associate that series with the terrible movie.

2200
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:26,020
Well, um, is that guy still around that director?

2201
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:26,660
Uwe Boll?

2202
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:26,980
Yeah.

2203
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:28,660
He pretty much got laughed out of the industry.

2204
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:28,980
Okay.

2205
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:29,420
It's fine.

2206
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:39,260
Um, because I watch, I basically, I subscribe to a bunch of modding channels, like Skyrim.

2207
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:40,980
Watches a lot of YouTube guys.

2208
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:41,340
Yeah.

2209
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:45,860
Like I have YouTube red because I, I forget that you're the only person I know with YouTube red.

2210
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:47,140
Well, it's wait.

2211
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:47,940
Look, he wants to jump in.

2212
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:53,780
I like to add as of 2016, Uwe Boll is no longer a film producer.

2213
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:56,620
He's a restaurant tour and he's a food.

2214
02:03:56,620 --> 02:03:57,660
He's a food critic.

2215
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:58,500
Oh boy.

2216
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:02,420
Anyway, get him on, um, he opened a restaurant called Bauhaus and that makes me happy.

2217
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:05,300
I want to see Gordon Ramsey go to his restaurant.

2218
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,140
I was going to say, get him on kitchen nightmares.

2219
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:13,980
Um, so I'm on these YouTube channels that showcase mods.

2220
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:20,940
And when you watch those in your recommended, it will be like mod for whatever.

2221
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:24,420
And then I'm like, Oh, I didn't know that.

2222
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:28,460
Or like, I haven't thought, like, for example, I have a, um,

2223
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:33,460
I haven't looked at Oblivion or Skyrim mods in like three years.

2224
02:04:33,460 --> 02:04:40,900
So the next time I go onto the nexus, it's going to be like, Oh, there's 2,500 mods that are neat that I can check out.

2225
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:43,900
That's kind of how I discovered project brutality three for doom.

2226
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:50,540
So I saw something, I saw that, um, they patched in running, running with scissors, patched in.

2227
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:57,900
Um, when you go to the mall to meet Gary Coleman, one of the stores said closed for renovations,

2228
02:04:57,900 --> 02:05:04,140
opening October of 20, uh, uh, it was 2016 or 2018 or something.

2229
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:09,220
I, and in 2003, that's funny because that's 13 years from now.

2230
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:09,860
Well, guess what?

2231
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:11,420
It's now 15 years in the future.

2232
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:16,460
So they actually went and made a, well, I guess it's 2016, so we better go patch in.

2233
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:17,500
So I saw that.

2234
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:24,940
And then I realized, Oh, they put out an actual, um, they retcon postal three and they put in an expansion to postal two.

2235
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:27,580
Uh, I think it came out in 2015.

2236
02:05:27,580 --> 02:05:30,100
It's called paradise lost.

2237
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:37,260
Um, so yeah, they supported running with scissors, supported postal two with an expansion 13 years after the fact.

2238
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:38,580
And I was like, Oh, that's neat.

2239
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:41,860
So then I fell down that rabbit hole, especially when they're up to like what I see local looking up.

2240
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:42,140
Yes.

2241
02:05:42,140 --> 02:05:43,660
But have you played postal four?

2242
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,300
No regrets.

2243
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:47,980
I haven't.

2244
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:48,660
I'm going to wait.

2245
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:53,180
Cause right now you pay for early access and they are basically like it's post alpha.

2246
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:55,860
There's not really like there's some quest.

2247
02:05:55,860 --> 02:06:09,420
It's obviously they're trying to recapture the, um, uh, the, um, magic, I guess if you'd call it that of postal two, I'm going to, I'm going to let that, I think that if you eat, if you eat raw dough, you'll get sick.

2248
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,380
So I'm going to let that bake in the oven for a bit.

2249
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:17,380
Um, it looks, I mean, it looks great for like a proof of concept, but I'm not, I'm not that much of an early adopter.

2250
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:24,180
Um, uh, yeah, so no, it looks neat, but I, I'm going to wait for the mod.

2251
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:25,300
I'm going to abstain.

2252
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:28,620
Well, it doesn't have to be modded necessarily, but I just came out.

2253
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:31,140
Um, but yeah, postal four, no regrets.

2254
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:34,580
Um, uh, yeah.

2255
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:35,780
So, all right.

2256
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:39,260
Well, it's you, you are the mod king of OLR as far as, well, I don't know.

2257
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:41,620
Logie likes mods too, but you really like mods.

2258
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:50,140
I feel like maybe it's just cause I live with you, but you, you are really, it's why, it's why it's like, I, there are other reasons why I don't like to play on console.

2259
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:55,180
Just, I like the coziness of my monitor, my two monitors and being at my desk.

2260
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:58,500
And it's like this little bubble that I'm in where it's playing on a couch in a living room.

2261
02:06:58,500 --> 02:06:59,380
Feels weird to me.

2262
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:05,140
Um, cause I will, cause also I like to all tab and like look at Twitter and stuff and not be on my phone.

2263
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:08,260
So I'll just like pause doom and go look at Tumblr or whatever.

2264
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:11,540
Um, I like that you can't really do that on console or you can't do it well.

2265
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,940
You have to have a tablet or something.

2266
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:15,340
One other question for you before we move on with the show.

2267
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:19,740
Have you been, uh, I noticed you've been kind of like watching, we have like that giant screen screen that

2268
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:23,740
separates our office sometimes you have to kind of like poke around to see what I'm doing, I'm doing.

2269
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:27,660
And I noticed you've kind of been like surprised, like, Oh, Rob's playing like bloodstain or he's playing

2270
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:29,340
like things that aren't Final Fantasy 14.

2271
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:30,380
Like how, how has that been?

2272
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:30,580
Yeah.

2273
02:07:30,580 --> 02:07:35,060
Cause I know, you know, you haven't, I can't really recall what the last new game was.

2274
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:35,740
You were really.

2275
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:41,620
Psych because you have gamer ADD and you'll buy, like you'll buy stuff the week it comes out and then

2276
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:44,740
you'll play it for a couple of days and then you won't play it again.

2277
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:45,780
Drag me, expose me.

2278
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:50,460
And then if I'm like, Oh, Oh, when are you going to be no man's sky or when you're going to beat?

2279
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:53,340
And obviously I'm trolling you and you'll say, never fuck off.

2280
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:56,540
Like, you know, that it's, that was 20 days ago.

2281
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:58,820
I never, I'm literally never playing that again.

2282
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:03,860
Um, so yeah, aside from 14, I don't really know what you've been playing.

2283
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:07,060
So when I saw you play bloodstain, I'm like, Oh, that came out like six months ago.

2284
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:08,500
Why are you, why are you playing that?

2285
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:12,140
You play that, you play that the first week it's out and then never at all.

2286
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:13,580
Cause it was on Xbox game pass.

2287
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:15,940
So it was a chance for me to go back and visit.

2288
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:16,860
I'm not playing it on the switch.

2289
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:17,780
I'm playing it on PC.

2290
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:18,300
Gotcha.

2291
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:18,660
Okay.

2292
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:19,260
It makes sense.

2293
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:24,980
Anyway, we got to get back with the show, but thank you for coming on and giving us your updates.

2294
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:25,540
Appreciate it.

2295
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:30,180
It's been a little bit, so, and, uh, you're coming to New York with me next week, so that'll be fun.

2296
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:31,340
Get to meet some of the listeners.

2297
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:35,100
It sounds like we're going to do that and get, get to see some shows.

2298
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:36,500
So I'm really excited about that.

2299
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:36,980
All right.

2300
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:37,420
Thank you, Alan.

2301
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:38,500
All right.

2302
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:45,300
Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk quickly about some other things happening around the, happening around the industry.

2303
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:50,380
Uh, this week, Loki, it's another month, so there's more free things that you get to look forward to.

2304
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:57,820
So if you are a PlayStation plus subscriber, you'll be getting Neo and Outlast 2 for the games for November.

2305
02:08:57,980 --> 02:09:00,660
That's from November 5th through December 3rd.

2306
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:10,620
And then on the Xbox side of things, Sherlock Holmes, the devil's daughter from the first to the 30th and the final station from the 16th through December 15th.

2307
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:12,540
And those are Xbox One games.

2308
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:22,620
And of course the Xbox 360 compatible games, Star Wars, Jedi Starfighter for the first half of November and Joyride Turbo on the second half.

2309
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:29,380
And then last but not least, um, Epic Games has more free games.

2310
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:36,820
Remember to check the back every single week because they've got new games that keep, um, sorting through there or they keep, you know, cycling them through.

2311
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:41,900
This week, of course, uh, to go along with, uh, Halloween, we have Costume Quest and Soma.

2312
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,820
So those are free until November 7th.

2313
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:50,900
And then, uh, they think they had next week's listed as well, but I have to pull these up real fast.

2314
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:52,780
But yeah, definitely keep an eye on that.

2315
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:58,340
I tend to grab things even if I have no interest in actually playing them because you never know.

2316
02:09:58,660 --> 02:10:00,540
You never know when you might want to do that.

2317
02:10:00,580 --> 02:10:04,540
Uh, Nuclear Throne and Ruiner are going to be, um, the week after.

2318
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:06,860
And those actually, I think Ruiner sounded pretty cool.

2319
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:08,260
I think I already have Nuclear Throne though.

2320
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:12,620
I have Soma and Costume Quest on Steam already, but why not?

2321
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:14,820
I have it on all the platforms.

2322
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:16,380
All right.

2323
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:19,220
Uh, moving on, let's talk about The Witcher, which I forgot to mention.

2324
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:22,940
I actually reinstalled Witcher 3 cause I totally forgot to mention on my good old games.

2325
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:25,460
I got on a kick with covert action again.

2326
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:29,700
I just, I had a bug to play Sid Meier's covert action, which I have on GOG.

2327
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,740
Um, and so I was playing that a little bit.

2328
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:33,260
I, that's one of my favorite classics.

2329
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:37,420
I'm going to do a covert action stream sometimes so I can explain why I love this game so fucking much.

2330
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:42,460
Uh, but then I was like, once I installed GOG, I was like, Witcher 3, I need to play that again.

2331
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:46,900
And so I actually spent a little bit with Witcher 3 until I got sucked into Bloodstained.

2332
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:50,900
But I need to go back and play more because I got like past the tutorial and I was doing like the first couple of quests.

2333
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:57,460
And, um, yeah, so I didn't even like get into that in my gaming week, but there's just been so many weeks that we've been gone.

2334
02:10:57,700 --> 02:11:04,100
But a lot of people are still talking about The Witcher because some more information came out about the Netflix series, which to be fair is not based on the game.

2335
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,500
It's based on the books, which also the game was based on.

2336
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:19,500
So it's, it's not directly a video game thing, but then they showed that trailer that has the bathtub scene recreated, which is all anybody ever wanted was for Henry Cavill to recreate the, uh, Geralt bathtub scene.

2337
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:20,860
That will be happening.

2338
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:26,820
In the series, uh, to the delight of many, uh, that will be on December 20th is when The Witcher series is going to be coming out.

2339
02:11:26,820 --> 02:11:28,900
Did some of you guys watch that new trailer that came out?

2340
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:29,220
I did.

2341
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:29,500
It did.

2342
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:31,340
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

2343
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:32,460
So, um, I'll be curious.

2344
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:39,700
There was also a panel that they did recently and that the show is going to focus on Ciri and Yennefer more so than Geralt.

2345
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:42,740
So that's kind of interesting because the games focus on Geralt.

2346
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:47,060
So there's already a little bit of a difference right there, but we'll see what happens with that.

2347
02:11:47,420 --> 02:11:55,620
Uh, the other thing I had to talk about, we kind of got into already earlier in the show, I will just mention Pokemon sword and shield leaks are out there.

2348
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:56,140
That's right.

2349
02:11:56,180 --> 02:11:59,300
Uh, some information is leaking on the new sword and shield games.

2350
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:08,780
Um, again, I want to respect those that are staying away from the leaks, so I'm not going to detail all of those, but if you want to go look out, look at what are all the Gigantamax Pokemon that are in the game.

2351
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:10,260
That information's out there.

2352
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:20,940
It sounds like just before the show, Shane was texting me about the complete Pokedex information is breaking as well as to what Pokemon have been cut and how many Pokemon are there.

2353
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:27,940
Uh, last I heard though, that was still developing as I think it was, there may be more after you beat the game and question mark.

2354
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:34,220
So there may not have the final final version, but at least we have plenty of Pokemon confirmed that are in the game.

2355
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:35,260
So I'll leave it at that.

2356
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:42,340
Um, and then, uh, you can also see some of the new, uh, there's not, uh, uh, I think we all saw the Ponyta or Ponyta.

2357
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:44,700
We saw that new form, the Galar form of that.

2358
02:12:44,820 --> 02:12:49,180
There are some Galar form showing up for other Pokemon, and you can go look at those as well.

2359
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:53,260
Uh, the complete evolution line of the three starter Pokemon are out there as well.

2360
02:12:53,380 --> 02:13:01,260
If you want to go searching for those on Twitter and look that up as well, the internet has a lot of that stuff out there or just private message Shane directly.

2361
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:09,180
He will be happy to talk your ear off about all of the leaks and all that stuff because this is so funny because he told me, he said, I, the leaks are coming out.

2362
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:12,020
I'm getting off the internet for two weeks cause I can't read any of the leaks.

2363
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:17,860
And then I shit you not like four hours later, I read all the leaks and they'd start getting pictures of all that Pokemon.

2364
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:20,660
And yeah, so that didn't last very long, but that's all right.

2365
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:25,820
I understand these games are just around the corner and some people are getting very excited about it, but the leaks are out there.

2366
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:30,900
So if you're trying to stay away from the leaks, you may have to have a little more restraint than Shane had with that.

2367
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:32,580
You're gonna have to really stay off social media.

2368
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:36,380
In fact, some of that is probably already crossing your dashboard.

2369
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:39,340
So, uh, hope you can avoid that, uh, until the game is out.

2370
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:41,700
Uh, anyway, moving on dark soccer, what do you have?

2371
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:48,460
I have just realized that I can actually understand more Spanish while I'm high as a kite than I can when I'm sober.

2372
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:50,260
I don't know.

2373
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:51,980
It's like how I am when I read French.

2374
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:57,140
Um, but, uh, Soul Calibur getting a new character.

2375
02:13:57,140 --> 02:14:09,980
They just revealed, uh, Hilda, who honestly, I totally freaking love her outfit, but she kind of makes me think of Cersei in Game of Thrones chair swords, just with her whole armor and dress and short hair thing.

2376
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:18,460
Um, but anyway, um, there's not a release date, um, for when she's going to be out, but I mean, she looks pretty cool.

2377
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:19,620
Yay.

2378
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:27,420
And then also, um, uh, the outer world, um, has credits that include D and D characters.

2379
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:30,580
That's pretty cool.

2380
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:33,060
I'm actually trying to see, um, uh, yeah.

2381
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:44,740
John Cotto's five, fifth edition campaign have forever after like, okay, well, if you're D and D I have trouble, I've actually written stories based off of D and D characters.

2382
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:51,860
I think that's why they were credited because I think they were playing D and D to get inspiration for their game.

2383
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:59,060
And so, because like, you know, and they actually had characters that died in their thing and they, uh, they have a whole tribute section in their credits.

2384
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:08,860
I think a lot of it is supposed to be for real people, uh, that passed during the making of the game, but they kind of gave the nod to the D and D characters too, because their D the D and D campaigns creatively shaped.

2385
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,700
What ended up being the outer world.

2386
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:12,580
So I just thought it was kind of funny.

2387
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:17,380
Like, you know, you don't always see like fake characters credited in games, but I thought it was cute.

2388
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:22,780
Well, honestly though, there, how there's a lot of, let me start over.

2389
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:23,420
Okay.

2390
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:29,460
There's a lot of stories out there that are based off of people's role plays and fan fiction.

2391
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:36,540
I mean, yes, 50 Shades of Shit was based off of, you know, Twilight fan fiction.

2392
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:46,820
But I mean, if you want to go back further, one of my favorite anime series ever and novel now that I'm reading, Record of Lodoss War was built off of a tabletop role play game.

2393
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:57,820
So, I mean, just as an example, some of the characters that I'm putting into the novel that I'm working, I'm not officially doing the national novel writing thing, but I'm starting on our remote or whatever.

2394
02:15:57,860 --> 02:15:58,500
Yeah, whatever it is.

2395
02:15:58,700 --> 02:15:59,580
I'll try this November.

2396
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:02,740
It's supposed to be not a pod mode for some people to the daily podcast thing.

2397
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:05,060
I always say I'm going to do that some year and then I forget.

2398
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:12,740
Oh, at any rate, I, uh, words, um, God, I can't speak D and D.

2399
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:13,300
Yeah.

2400
02:16:13,340 --> 02:16:18,300
Um, but there are characters from old D and D campaigns of mine that are totally ending up in my story.

2401
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:19,900
So same.

2402
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:24,940
Uh, pixel pox, uh, pixel pockets and chat says daily podcast.

2403
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:31,460
Yeah, it's more, it's not so much for like gaming podcasters and news related things, but there's a lot of like personal podcasts out there.

2404
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:32,260
That was a rabbit hole.

2405
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:34,740
I fell down some time ago and I thought it was very fascinating.

2406
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:44,300
Like, especially like some, uh, folks in the LGBTQ plus community that I know, like had like daily podcasts that were more like, they're almost like blogs maybe, but they're like audio blogs.

2407
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:52,180
And so there would be some folks that would do these that would participate in this daily, you know, November thing where they basically putting out a podcast every day.

2408
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:53,260
And it was just, it was interesting.

2409
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:57,580
It was like hearing somebody read their live journal entries, but they were kind of like talking through it.

2410
02:16:57,900 --> 02:17:12,620
I, I always thought a podcast like that might be interesting, but I don't, I also don't think I'm that interesting, but I thought maybe if I had like some topics I could talk about every day where I could like mix in like, here's my life and here's my funniest moment from the second grade or something.

2411
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:20,580
Like I could maybe fill out 30 days, but then I, then I'm like, eh, I should take that energy and focus on the podcast I have or several.

2412
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:24,820
Cause I mean, there's been, oftentimes I have two or three podcasts running at once, but you know.

2413
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:27,020
Oh, we still have things to talk about.

2414
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:29,500
I know there's, and there's always more ideas out there on the table.

2415
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:30,100
That's for sure.

2416
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:34,780
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that will be coming out very, very soon.

2417
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:36,140
We'll start in the U S Loki.

2418
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:36,940
He has lots of stuff.

2419
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:44,980
So just stands 2020 coming out on the Wii Nintendo switch PlayStation four X-Box one and Stadia.

2420
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:46,420
That's right.

2421
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:56,540
Isn't Stadia right around the corner, the 19th question mark, uh, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games, Tokyo 2020 on Nintendo switch.

2422
02:17:56,780 --> 02:18:13,100
Planet zoo on the PC red dead redemption two on PC, uh, volferrous on PlayStation four death, stranding on PlayStation four Disney zoom, zoom festival on Nintendo switch.

2423
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:18,980
Goloma on PlayStation four Layton's mysterious or mystery journey.

2424
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:25,700
Um, cat real and the millionaires conspiracy deluxe edition on Nintendo switch.

2425
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:26,820
That's a mouthful there.

2426
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:38,660
Need for speed heat on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one new super lucky tale on Nintendo switch and volferrous also coming to X-Box one.

2427
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:40,460
All right.

2428
02:18:41,060 --> 02:18:47,580
Heading over to Japan, uh, looking at the PlayStation four, uh, death stranding is clearly the big release this week in Japan as well.

2429
02:18:47,620 --> 02:19:01,340
Uh, there's also a brand new PlayStation four, like a, it's a like one terabyte, a PlayStation four pro one terabyte hard drive death stranding limited edition also coming out in Japan, which I think we're also getting anyway here in the U S so it's, I don't think there's any major differences between the two.

2430
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:02,820
Uh, but death stranding is the big release.

2431
02:19:02,820 --> 02:19:07,420
There are a few other minor releases in Japan this week, such as a Fortnite dark fire bundle.

2432
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:13,700
I don't know if Fortnite quite enjoys the same popularity in Japan, but they do have a localized version of it themselves.

2433
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:19,220
So you can pick up the dark file fire bundle, which I guess would be more like physical release of the game.

2434
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:24,820
You can pick that up for about 30 bucks, uh, but the equivalent in yen, uh, over in Japan this week.

2435
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:28,100
Uh, and then I think that's, I think that's really it.

2436
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:30,580
Oh, there's a need for speed game this week too in Japan.

2437
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:33,380
Need for speed heat is also out this week in Japan.

2438
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:36,820
That's for PlayStation four looking quickly at Nintendo switch.

2439
02:19:36,820 --> 02:19:38,580
I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything there.

2440
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:40,740
Uh, the Fortnite bundle is there as well.

2441
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:43,100
And then there is a, this is a mouthful.

2442
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:46,700
You're ready for this Sumiko Gurashi, the movie.

2443
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:49,180
Oh, that's, I have a notebook with those little animals on it.

2444
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:49,300
Yeah.

2445
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:51,420
The pop-up book and the secret child.

2446
02:19:51,460 --> 02:19:53,660
Let's play the worlds of picture books in a game.

2447
02:19:53,780 --> 02:20:02,500
That is the full title that is out on the switch this week, as well as the fruit labyrinth and Eden of Grisaia full package.

2448
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:07,140
I don't know some people like a full package, the fruit, the labyrinth.

2449
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:08,380
Oh, it's an anime game.

2450
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:09,260
Of course it is.

2451
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:10,060
Of course it is.

2452
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:10,660
Of course it is.

2453
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:17,860
That will include the prologue, the after story, the short scenario, the leisure of Grisaia, the afterglow of Grisaia and the melody of Grisaia.

2454
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:22,860
I wonder if it's a repackaging of older games, but anyway, that is what your release dates look like in Japan this week.

2455
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:23,940
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

2456
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:30,900
On the fourth, we have grip combat racing, ultimate edition, uh, just dance 2020.

2457
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:34,020
We have north guard, uh, on the seventh.

2458
02:20:34,060 --> 02:20:37,700
Also on the seventh is will a wonderful world, which actually looks kind of cute.

2459
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:49,220
Jumanji the video game because of reasons, stranded sails, um, golem only on PlayStation looks like, um, a Siberia trilogy.

2460
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:53,420
I wonder if it's the old Siberia games.

2461
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:53,940
I have to look.

2462
02:20:54,420 --> 02:21:04,740
Um, horizon chase turbo for PlayStation, Capcom home arcade on the seventh, need for speed heat, um, and intend to switch light.

2463
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:07,540
Is that, uh, how do you pronounce the fuck out of these?

2464
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:21,780
Zacian and Zamazenta edition, uh, Tokyo and Sonic at the Olympics games, Tokyo 2020, super street, the game, death stranding, uh, Disney Tsum Tsum festival.

2465
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:30,100
Uh, there's a bunch Layton's mystery journey, catch rail and the millionaire's conspiracy words.

2466
02:21:30,660 --> 02:21:36,860
Um, that is it for this portion of the week, although there's a game coming out next week that just is absolutely fascinating.

2467
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:38,340
The unicorn princess.

2468
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:39,180
Yay.

2469
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:41,420
I kind of want to play it just cause it's the unicorn princess.

2470
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:42,140
Why not?

2471
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:45,300
All right, let me get into a few comments and then we're going to get into the mailbag.

2472
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:46,580
Cause I think we're a little bit behind.

2473
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:47,180
Oh, nevermind.

2474
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:48,420
It's a shitty little tween game.

2475
02:21:48,580 --> 02:21:48,860
Okay.

2476
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:53,660
We have a lot of emails to get into tonight, which we're going to participate at orange on Trudy.com.

2477
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:55,820
But first I want to read some comments on the release date stuff.

2478
02:21:56,100 --> 02:22:00,460
Uh, Johnny Woo face says, I'm glad doom got delayed too many releases this month.

2479
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:01,100
LOL.

2480
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:01,660
Yeah.

2481
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:04,740
What death stranding is this week and the next week is Pokemon.

2482
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:12,660
And so it's, it's really ramping up as we get closer to, uh, you know, Thanksgiving and the official kickoff of the holiday season, uh, shopping season anyway.

2483
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:14,940
So yeah, November is always a crazy month.

2484
02:22:14,940 --> 02:22:20,100
And then pixel pockets confirming that Grisaia that game I was talking about in Japan is a visual novel series.

2485
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:21,940
Some are available in English.

2486
02:22:22,140 --> 02:22:25,660
Bobby Blackoff also pointing out Google Stadia is next weekend as well.

2487
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:27,260
So you also have a console.

2488
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:35,220
I'm using my quotey fingers also this weekend, although that is only the like pro one that, or the Chromecast one, right?

2489
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:39,980
Not you get the 2020 is when you can just fire up your browser and do Stadia that way.

2490
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:40,260
Right.

2491
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:42,620
This is the special Chromecast bundle one.

2492
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:44,260
So, um,

2493
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:46,580
I'm rushing right out to go get one of those.

2494
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:50,740
I'm curious to hear what other, or other early adopters think of it.

2495
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:55,380
Uh, and I'll, you know, make, I just went destiny too is like the game.

2496
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:56,900
I'm just kind of like, okay.

2497
02:22:56,940 --> 02:23:03,100
I'm like, I can already play destiny too on PC, but I, I still am very anxious to hear about the technology and all that.

2498
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:04,180
So I'm trying to keep an open mind.

2499
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:06,500
So very curious to hear what all that is in store.

2500
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:07,140
Okay.

2501
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,820
So we are going to get to the mailbag.

2502
02:23:09,820 --> 02:23:11,420
I think we have a lot of emails to get to tonight.

2503
02:23:11,660 --> 02:23:20,900
And because we have three, because we forgot to do it during the classic game of the week segment, I want to make sure we open up the community gift chest here on Twitch.

2504
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:36,340
So for those of you that are watching live on Twitch TV, you can contribute to the gift chest and you can actually, if you're a prime person, you can contribute some gifts to the gift chest and we will give them away in our chat here.

2505
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:38,940
It's all through the Twitch mechanism of the community gift chest.

2506
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:42,940
So that is open and we'll stay open through our mailbag segment.

2507
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:44,460
And hopefully I did that right.

2508
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:50,780
And it is actually open because I'm not, I'm just looking at it on my screen right now on the dashboard.

2509
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:53,100
Bobby will tell me if I did it wrong and he'll fix it.

2510
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:57,660
In the meantime, Dark Soccer, let's get to the emails.

2511
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:00,140
Hey guys, it's Flea here.

2512
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:03,020
By the way, this one is from the 20th.

2513
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:06,420
First off, I want to say how much I enjoy your podcast.

2514
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:07,780
Look forward to listening every week.

2515
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:08,460
Oops.

2516
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:13,900
I was listening to your discussion last week about the Blizzard China controversy and I'd like to put my two cents in.

2517
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:18,900
I'm a little baffled at the outrage online regarding the action that Blizzard took against this player.

2518
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:27,980
While I support free speech, Blizzchung signed a contract that he would not speak in a way that could offend anyone or damage Blizzard as a company.

2519
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:35,820
And the contract specifically mentions that doing so would lead to a forfeiture of the prize money and removal from grandmasters.

2520
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:38,780
Blizzard has a legal obligation to follow through and these terms are not met.

2521
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:52,700
It's very obvious now that what Blizzchung said has dragged them into political discourse of what is happening in Hong Kong and Blizzard upholding their contract has damaged their reputation, which is ironically what this cause in the contract was meant to avoid.

2522
02:24:53,660 --> 02:25:00,820
I will say that I'm glad Blizzard walked back their penalty in the end and I hope they amend their contract to be more forgiving in the future.

2523
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:11,140
I really find it disingenuous, I can't make words, disingenuous that the gamer population who in September were tripping over themselves to buy the new iPhone.

2524
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:18,660
I'm not, fuck, we already just, it's another one of the Apple whatever, you know, are doing that.

2525
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:20,460
I don't want to fucking read this.

2526
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:25,300
No, we, Dark Soccer is a little bit on the meds.

2527
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:29,540
We did address many of the points in the email, but I do want to make sure the listeners.

2528
02:25:29,540 --> 02:25:39,420
Were tripping over themselves to buy the new iPhone from Apple, are also holding bullshit to a separate standard when all they did was take away prize money for an e-sport, which Apple banned an app designed to keep protesters safe and could actually save lives.

2529
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:40,660
No, that's not the fucking point.

2530
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:52,060
This is a tough time as companies are navigating if they're going to uphold the standards of free democratic internet or if they will censor themselves to comply with the censorship of the Chinese internet.

2531
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:56,260
We need to remember that there are people behind these difficult decisions and mistakes will be made.

2532
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:57,660
Anyway, enough ranting for me.

2533
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:59,700
Thanks for everything you guys do.

2534
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,340
It's flee.

2535
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:04,940
PS included the text from the contract below that pertains to why he was banned.

2536
02:26:05,540 --> 02:26:19,180
Engaging any act that in Blizzard's sole discretion brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages Blizzard's image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player's prize total to zero USD.

2537
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:24,820
In addition to other remedies which may be provided under the handbook and Blizzard's website terms are still so subjective.

2538
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:29,620
Yeah, you know, and I feel like I did address a lot of these points earlier in the show.

2539
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:32,580
I just want to make sure you know what, it's where every gamer has a voice.

2540
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:36,340
So I'm just like, it's my brain right now.

2541
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:37,700
Just yeah, it's fine.

2542
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:47,580
But here's the thing I do want to make this very clear is that I'm a little less on the blitzchung thing, especially ever since they dialed it back to the six months.

2543
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:57,140
I still think it's a little bit much, but what really irritated me is when you put this side by side with how they treated the Overwatch League issues and what's been going on over there.

2544
02:26:57,180 --> 02:27:01,100
I felt that this was way too extreme compared to what was going on over there.

2545
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:03,220
And that is really kind of like the root cause.

2546
02:27:03,460 --> 02:27:08,780
And I mean, just add that onto the pile of, you know, everything else where Blizzard is misstepped.

2547
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:15,740
I just feel like I've given Blizzard so much loyalty and a lot of these things, these actions are starting to make me question, well, why is that?

2548
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:25,900
And so again, I'm not, I'm not personally, I'm not boycotting Blizzard, but I just want to see other people for a little while and on top of that, Blizzard handle their issues.

2549
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:33,660
Keep in mind, people are so quick to point the finger at the biggest other company there is, but they're not the only one doing this.

2550
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:37,140
You know, they're two completely different things.

2551
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:38,060
It's a game.

2552
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:48,820
And it's also, it's also the thing where it's like, you can invoke Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, you can invoke whoever you want to invoke, but they are separate issues.

2553
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:52,860
And I think you have to kind of assess what works for you and what doesn't work.

2554
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:56,620
And again, like I said, in its core, it's a fallacious argument.

2555
02:27:57,060 --> 02:27:58,220
It's absolutely fallacious.

2556
02:27:58,420 --> 02:28:05,860
I also completely understand, for example, like I know the gals from Girls Gone Wow, because they just put out two episodes from being at BlizzCon.

2557
02:28:05,940 --> 02:28:10,660
I haven't been able to listen to them yet just because I've had a busy weekend, but I know they went and they had a great time.

2558
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:12,380
They were smiling big in their pictures.

2559
02:28:12,580 --> 02:28:15,180
They got to meet a lot of community members for the first time.

2560
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:20,180
Am I going to be upset at them for supporting Blizzard because they shut down?

2561
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:21,620
No, I'm not.

2562
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:22,580
Absolutely not.

2563
02:28:22,620 --> 02:28:34,380
I'm actually like super happy for them that they got to like be celebrities, the celebrities that they are at BlizzCon and meet all those new people, because I also realized at the end of the day, BlizzCon is very much like a family gathering for some people.

2564
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:38,340
And so that is, you know, like their moment.

2565
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:46,740
I think the Blizzard handled the protests and all that appropriately, such as we mentioned earlier in the show, and the protester kind of went to take the mic.

2566
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:52,540
They had their system set up to just let that person talk, not shut it down, you know, and do that whole thing.

2567
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:54,660
They were pretty professional about all that.

2568
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:57,380
And we didn't even talk about the protests outside.

2569
02:28:57,980 --> 02:29:03,460
But I was actually surprised that a respectable number of people showed up.

2570
02:29:03,460 --> 02:29:11,020
It wasn't like massive protests, but there was like 30, 40 people that showed up and they were chanting and they had signs and they were giving out.

2571
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:12,420
I thought this was very smart.

2572
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:16,740
They were giving out free T-shirts for people to wear inside.

2573
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:25,900
So that way, when they showed up on the cameras and stuff and they would have the messages on there, I thought that was really an intelligent way to do a peaceful protest.

2574
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:28,420
And I think at the end of the day, that is also the most important thing.

2575
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:30,300
All the protests was very, very peaceful.

2576
02:29:30,460 --> 02:29:38,940
We're not hearing about any type of like, you know, unfortunately, we're not hearing the level of the protests we're hearing about in Hong Kong, just very matter of factly.

2577
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:41,460
And so that part is really cool.

2578
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:45,500
And I am not one to judge anybody on how they want to spend their money and so forth.

2579
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:49,500
But I'm just saying, this is why Blizzard and I are getting a divorce for now.

2580
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:53,300
But maybe in six months, we'll get back together.

2581
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:56,020
Oh, I didn't fully address the part of the email, the Blitzchung thing.

2582
02:29:57,020 --> 02:30:12,700
And I kind of said this on the last episode, so I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself, but I feel like a more appropriate punishment would have been suspended for one or two games and just have him not be able to do on camera interviews for six months.

2583
02:30:12,700 --> 02:30:15,940
If that had been the ban, I would have totally understood it.

2584
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:27,820
But one more thing I'm going to say, look at what a company like Wizards of the Coast, who by the way, also is distributed by Tencent in China, has handled a very similar issue recently.

2585
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:33,700
Wizards of the Coast had a player that won that made a very similar statement in his winning thing.

2586
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:35,340
And you know what Wizards of the Coast did about it?

2587
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:36,060
Nothing.

2588
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:39,140
And they also have the Tencent presence in China.

2589
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:52,660
So it's just but maybe, but one could argue it's because of what's happened at Blizzard has caused this conversation and other companies to look at it and in, in fact, has had a positive change in that regard.

2590
02:30:52,860 --> 02:30:57,300
So anyway, I will shut up now and not double back on this topic too much.

2591
02:30:57,460 --> 02:31:00,460
But I just want to get that out and give a respectful response to the email.

2592
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:03,100
I'm not trying to be to be bitchy about it right now.

2593
02:31:03,100 --> 02:31:10,780
I'm, it's just that I, I think people are trying to pull an argument that has nothing to do with it.

2594
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:15,820
So that's, um, anyway, I do want to also mention this because this is geo 100.

2595
02:31:15,820 --> 02:31:18,460
Matt says there was some positive Hearthstone news from Blizzcon.

2596
02:31:18,460 --> 02:31:19,620
And I did hear about this.

2597
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:20,500
This is really cool.

2598
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:24,020
Uh, Leooon, I hope I said the name right.

2599
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:31,580
I'm sorry if I butchered that, has become the first woman to win a Blizzcon title because she won the, um, uh, Hearthstone championship.

2600
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:32,300
Oh, good.

2601
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:33,180
Congratulations.

2602
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:33,980
Mazel tov.

2603
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:34,540
That's right.

2604
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:35,940
Next email.

2605
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:36,660
Break the ceiling.

2606
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:37,900
Yep.

2607
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:38,340
Next email.

2608
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:39,660
Hey, OLR.

2609
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:43,900
I had read so many glowing reviews of Link's Awakening that I decided to pick it up on lunch day.

2610
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:46,940
I may be in the minority, but the game hasn't lived up to the hype for me.

2611
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:48,740
It's certainly a faithful remake.

2612
02:31:48,740 --> 02:31:59,460
If anything, Nintendo stuck too closely to the original, by the way, Nintendo didn't do it, um, keeping its dated gameplay intact and having to constantly consult guides to find the next dungeon or even the next key.

2613
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:07,820
The, um, items are so far fairly rubbish and the NPCs feel like random cardboard cut out, stabled together from different games.

2614
02:32:08,340 --> 02:32:13,180
What is new are the toy box style graphics, which are beautiful until they begin to move.

2615
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:16,100
When outdoors, the frame rate drops to a distracting level.

2616
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:22,140
And I say that as someone who doesn't normally even pay attention to technical details like that, I didn't notice any frame rate issues.

2617
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:22,860
Did you?

2618
02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:29,420
I've noticed some stuttering, like it's not major, but it's enough to go, Oh, that was a, that was a rough transition.

2619
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:30,540
Yeah, weird.

2620
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:35,020
Um, I vaguely remember playing Link's Awakening DX on Game Boy Color back in the day.

2621
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:42,540
I'm sure it was good compared to your average Game Boy title, but to be a $60 Switch game, I think it needed a little modernization.

2622
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:43,740
What do you think of the game?

2623
02:32:43,740 --> 02:32:45,060
Am I being overly harsh?

2624
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:47,260
Forever a loyal listener, Elliot B.

2625
02:32:47,980 --> 02:32:51,620
Um, everyone's opinion is their own opinion.

2626
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:54,820
If that's how you felt about it, that's how you felt about it.

2627
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:59,220
Um, you know, for, for us, we were pretty excited about it.

2628
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:00,420
We wanted the nostalgia.

2629
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:04,140
And I think a lot of that money that you're paying for it is for nostalgia.

2630
02:33:04,700 --> 02:33:07,420
Um, the dungeon maker thing is pretty fun.

2631
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:16,060
Um, you know, Dan and I just like went around looking for Easter eggs and try, he, we did the whole thing from memory.

2632
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:18,180
No guides at all.

2633
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:22,980
We didn't do any guide until like doing the hero playthrough.

2634
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:26,780
So, I mean, that's the fun of those old style games.

2635
02:33:26,780 --> 02:33:28,420
Like that is the exploration.

2636
02:33:28,420 --> 02:33:38,580
We didn't have guides yonder and when that was the fun of it is that it brought back that sense of how much this do we remember?

2637
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:40,660
Is it really the old friend that we knew?

2638
02:33:40,980 --> 02:33:46,180
And, you know, I think that that's where the game was really banking on is that nostalgia factor.

2639
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:53,380
And if you didn't have the nostalgia for the original game that the other, that other people do, then it's definitely going to color your experience with it.

2640
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:53,860
Yeah.

2641
02:33:54,380 --> 02:33:58,540
Honestly, bottom line, dude, you're, you're allowed to like, and not like whatever you want.

2642
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:01,260
And it doesn't mean like, you're allowed to be wrong once in a while.

2643
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:02,260
No, I'm just, I'm totally kidding.

2644
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:04,900
Like, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't mean that you're wrong.

2645
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:06,660
Uh, you know, that's what opinions are.

2646
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:15,700
And you know, like, I know I've seen that movie that like everybody loved and I was just like, what, why, why does everybody love this movie?

2647
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:17,500
I'm going to give you a good example.

2648
02:34:17,820 --> 02:34:19,060
Uh, I love Xanadu.

2649
02:34:19,100 --> 02:34:21,140
I feel like I'm, everyone else is wrong.

2650
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:21,380
Okay.

2651
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:23,500
I feel like I'm expected to love this movie.

2652
02:34:23,540 --> 02:34:29,700
But when I saw Call Me By Your Name, I was like, it's not like, it took, it was slow.

2653
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:31,220
I didn't, it's very artsy.

2654
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:34,340
I didn't really like it until the dad's speech at the end.

2655
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:37,420
I'm not going to say anything about that, but I was like, that was the best part of the whole movie.

2656
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:38,540
And that was only like two minutes of it.

2657
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:41,620
You know, there's always going to be, it's art.

2658
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:43,300
Art is subject to interpretation, right?

2659
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:44,860
And sometimes your interpretation is going to be different.

2660
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:47,140
To be fair, it's different when you're seeing it with Shane.

2661
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:53,140
He has a way of influencing, but, um, well, I'm sure there's plenty of video games.

2662
02:34:53,220 --> 02:34:54,220
Is there a video game?

2663
02:34:54,220 --> 02:34:55,420
And I opened this up to you guys in chat too.

2664
02:34:55,420 --> 02:35:00,220
Is there a video game that everybody loved, but then you played it and you were like, I don't get it.

2665
02:35:00,260 --> 02:35:03,380
Like, why does everybody like, I don't really like bionic commando that much.

2666
02:35:04,060 --> 02:35:04,740
The original.

2667
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:05,100
Yeah.

2668
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:06,460
Oh, girl.

2669
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:07,020
Okay.

2670
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:07,460
All right.

2671
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:08,020
We all had a pain.

2672
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:09,580
I didn't like Metroid when I first played it.

2673
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:12,260
I'm just being honest.

2674
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:12,660
I didn't care.

2675
02:35:14,060 --> 02:35:15,460
I didn't like it when I first played it.

2676
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:16,900
No, I liked it better.

2677
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:21,900
Now as an adult, I actually didn't like Metroid until I played through the guardian legend.

2678
02:35:22,540 --> 02:35:23,940
It's also interesting to point out.

2679
02:35:23,940 --> 02:35:28,980
And I would be curious, Elliot, if this ends up being your experience too, and not that you're obligated to go back and play it again, but you might.

2680
02:35:29,140 --> 02:35:34,620
But like, I know that like one game I played and I didn't get it at first and I didn't go back and play it till like five years later.

2681
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:35,580
And then I loved it.

2682
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:36,500
Mass Effect.

2683
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:39,620
The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, I don't get it.

2684
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:40,500
Why do people love this?

2685
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:41,020
Here's the thing.

2686
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:43,420
I didn't actually like Link's Awakening the first time I played it.

2687
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:45,700
I didn't think it was very fun.

2688
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:47,820
I like it now as an adult.

2689
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:51,900
I thought it was a much more solid game now that I can come into it as a mature gamer.

2690
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:52,140
Yeah.

2691
02:35:52,980 --> 02:35:58,140
You know, but like there's people who'd be like, I don't like Link to the past.

2692
02:35:58,180 --> 02:35:59,500
I mean, some people are like that.

2693
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:02,820
Dan doesn't care for Link to the past that, you know, everyone else loves it.

2694
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:04,420
And it's not that he doesn't like it.

2695
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:06,060
It's just, it's not up there, you know?

2696
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:09,780
But, um, I mean, what about you, Matt?

2697
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:11,660
Uh, Mass Effect.

2698
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:14,140
I didn't really like that game.

2699
02:36:15,740 --> 02:36:17,020
And that's what Bobby says in chat.

2700
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:18,300
Mass Effect and Super Metroid.

2701
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:20,500
I was, is he trolling with the Super Metroid answer?

2702
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:23,260
Cause I don't think Bobby, I never knew Bobby to hate Super Metroid.

2703
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:28,100
He just likes, he just likes to bring up the whole stupid Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid debate.

2704
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:29,620
Every possible opportunity.

2705
02:36:29,820 --> 02:36:33,620
Uh, Shane is still in chat saying, I hated Mass Effect and Dragon Age at first.

2706
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:35,180
Even Shane hated Mass Effect.

2707
02:36:35,220 --> 02:36:37,860
I didn't like the first Dragon Age, but Dragon Age 2 I loved.

2708
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:44,020
I, I'm still not as into Dragon Age as the rest of you, but I did, I did enjoy Inquisition.

2709
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:47,860
I did enjoy Inquisition what, but I never really like played through the whole entire thing.

2710
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:49,100
And that's Splatoon.

2711
02:36:49,700 --> 02:36:53,500
I honestly think I like Mass Effect 3 better than 2.

2712
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:57,740
Because Garris, even more Garris.

2713
02:36:57,820 --> 02:36:59,180
I'm trying to think of a game.

2714
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:07,540
I know there has to be something, but I'm trying to think of something where I was really like, I don't understand why you people obsess over this game.

2715
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:10,660
I have to chew on that for a little bit.

2716
02:37:10,660 --> 02:37:12,020
I know there's gotta be an example.

2717
02:37:12,060 --> 02:37:15,980
So it was like, I can think of so many movies, but I can't think of games as these.

2718
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:19,100
I'm trying to think of games that have won like game of the year type of accolades.

2719
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:20,580
Alan, you're giving me a look.

2720
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:22,500
Dark soul.

2721
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:23,060
Okay.

2722
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:23,780
Dark souls.

2723
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:25,940
I didn't.

2724
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:26,460
Okay.

2725
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:29,260
I didn't hate dark souls, but dark souls isn't for me.

2726
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:34,380
All the jokes from earlier this evening aside, I guess, I guess that could be an example.

2727
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:37,460
There's movies that a lot of people I know, like that I can't stand.

2728
02:37:37,460 --> 02:37:38,860
Like I won't watch face off.

2729
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:43,420
I think because it was really actually very triggering right at the beginning of it.

2730
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:49,820
Oh, um, I, I do not care for the way everybody loves fire emblem and those games.

2731
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:51,260
I don't like, I don't care for those games.

2732
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:54,380
Um, not for me, never liked real time strategy like that.

2733
02:37:54,420 --> 02:37:54,740
Yeah.

2734
02:37:54,740 --> 02:37:59,980
It's like the only types of like tactical games I could really get into is, um, uh, final fantasy tactics.

2735
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:01,780
I don't even like final fantasy tactics.

2736
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:02,380
Hmm.

2737
02:38:03,100 --> 02:38:05,060
I've never liked those games like that.

2738
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:08,940
I mean, and even like Disgaea would be another one.

2739
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:14,940
I mean, I had my hands on the Macross game for PC engine for a while and I didn't like it.

2740
02:38:14,980 --> 02:38:17,180
I really wanted to, cause it was fucking Macross.

2741
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:18,580
I thought of the game.

2742
02:38:18,580 --> 02:38:19,380
I thought of the game.

2743
02:38:20,740 --> 02:38:21,180
Persona.

2744
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:22,940
I haven't played it.

2745
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:23,380
I'm sorry.

2746
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:24,540
I'm sorry guys.

2747
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:25,780
That there it is.

2748
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:26,540
That's the game.

2749
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:29,980
I, I can't get into it the way the rest of you can.

2750
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:30,940
I'm sorry.

2751
02:38:30,980 --> 02:38:31,620
I've tried.

2752
02:38:31,620 --> 02:38:32,420
I need to play though.

2753
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:33,740
Danganronpa.

2754
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:36,380
Maybe.

2755
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:38,740
I don't know if, I don't know if it's for me, but we'll see.

2756
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:41,420
I wasn't super into Danganronpa at first either, but I really like it now.

2757
02:38:41,940 --> 02:38:42,340
All right.

2758
02:38:42,580 --> 02:38:43,700
So there you go, Elliot.

2759
02:38:43,700 --> 02:38:45,380
See, we've made confessions about the games.

2760
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:47,380
We, we don't understand either.

2761
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:49,700
So it happens anyway, but thank you for the email.

2762
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:50,820
Sports games, all of them.

2763
02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:53,140
Except tech mobile.

2764
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:56,300
Um, or actually super high impact for Super Nintendo.

2765
02:38:57,940 --> 02:38:58,940
This is the last email.

2766
02:38:59,340 --> 02:39:00,780
Um, Haya OLR crew.

2767
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:03,060
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act theft.

2768
02:39:03,580 --> 02:39:07,060
My last call to the show was to talk about colossal event for Pokemon go.

2769
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:09,820
I mentioned my expectations and worries about the event.

2770
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:12,260
Now it has happened and I participated in it.

2771
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:14,180
I'll talk about my impressions of the event.

2772
02:39:14,740 --> 02:39:15,780
The event itself was good.

2773
02:39:15,820 --> 02:39:18,180
It was fun doing the special research to get the.

2774
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:22,380
Reggie Gigas along with some of my friends.

2775
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:25,980
We had a great time overall and it was, my eyes are blurry.

2776
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:28,020
It wasn't overly difficult to finish.

2777
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:32,500
We were done after two to three hours tops and continued to raid and do some

2778
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:34,780
researches for special Pokemon.

2779
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:37,340
Even those who were pretty easy to do.

2780
02:39:37,340 --> 02:39:40,260
And again, no, even those were pretty easy to do.

2781
02:39:40,260 --> 02:39:43,300
And again, the Pokemon that were given through those were pretty cool.

2782
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:44,700
I even got a shiny Skarmory.

2783
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:49,180
Um, after I finished the event, I felt unsatisfied again.

2784
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:52,660
It was pretty short and simple, but it was overly simple to do.

2785
02:39:52,660 --> 02:39:55,340
Just catch an evolve, rinse and repeat three times and you were done.

2786
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:58,020
Basically the Pokemon spawning through the event.

2787
02:39:58,020 --> 02:39:58,580
Well, good.

2788
02:39:58,580 --> 02:40:00,420
Wasn't the best or most varied.

2789
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:04,180
I would love to see more rare Pokemon spawn and get more shinies and really

2790
02:40:04,180 --> 02:40:05,820
good ones for raids or PVP.

2791
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:07,540
I haven't done PVP yet.

2792
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:13,620
Many people are complaining about the shiny rates, but I don't think that

2793
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:14,540
should be the case here.

2794
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:16,660
Shinies are supposed to be rare.

2795
02:40:17,420 --> 02:40:20,700
And then again, the lack of variety on the spawns really made it kind of dull

2796
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:24,740
to do even to even do the special research.

2797
02:40:25,020 --> 02:40:28,260
Since again, it was composed of really simple and mundane tasks.

2798
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:31,260
The raid, the raids were perfect though.

2799
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:32,180
Not really difficult.

2800
02:40:32,220 --> 02:40:36,220
They could be taken down by a small group of three people with good or excellent

2801
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:39,460
counters and they appeared everywhere quite often.

2802
02:40:40,540 --> 02:40:45,420
Like really, I think I did like three raids in the same gym during

2803
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:46,860
the time I spent on the event.

2804
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:49,460
The rewards were great.

2805
02:40:49,460 --> 02:40:54,180
Getting rare evolution stones, like the new Unova stone and getting the quote

2806
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:57,380
free raid passes for the duration of the event was good.

2807
02:40:57,700 --> 02:41:01,420
I think the money I paid for all of this wasn't worth it.

2808
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:07,340
We also got a post for Avatar, which is really bad, even though I'm using it

2809
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:08,980
right now, but it seriously doesn't look okay.

2810
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:11,900
And the medal is just for showing off.

2811
02:41:11,980 --> 02:41:16,660
I would prefer to have a Safari zone or go fast one, which had some merit to it.

2812
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:21,260
Overall, I don't regret buying the special ticket and participating in this event.

2813
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:22,420
I had fun.

2814
02:41:22,420 --> 02:41:26,020
I had, and I had a really good time, but what I got was really.

2815
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:29,740
But what I got wasn't really worth the price of admission.

2816
02:41:30,260 --> 02:41:34,260
I would have been okay paying $5 for this, but $8 seemed the wrong price.

2817
02:41:34,260 --> 02:41:38,580
And yeah, it's $3 only, but I could have used it to buy other stuff in game that

2818
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:40,340
is worthwhile or for other games too.

2819
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:42,380
Well, that's all for me right now.

2820
02:41:42,380 --> 02:41:45,260
Thanks for reading PS, sorry for sending this kind of late.

2821
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:46,660
Deft is come Brown.

2822
02:41:47,900 --> 02:41:50,260
Thank you for the email and for the recap of the event, because

2823
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:51,340
admittedly I didn't do it.

2824
02:41:51,340 --> 02:41:52,900
So I'm glad to hear that somebody did.

2825
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:56,660
Um, I just didn't, I don't know.

2826
02:41:56,660 --> 02:42:00,500
Like I just didn't want to pay the money, especially cause you got the raid passes.

2827
02:42:00,540 --> 02:42:02,740
I have like 60 unused raid passes.

2828
02:42:02,740 --> 02:42:04,740
Cause that's how infrequently I've been rating anymore.

2829
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:08,140
In fact, I just realized I just missed that dark cry or whatever

2830
02:42:08,140 --> 02:42:09,380
that most recent one has been.

2831
02:42:09,420 --> 02:42:11,980
I, does somebody have an extra cause they need one?

2832
02:42:12,340 --> 02:42:14,140
Um, cause I didn't raid for it.

2833
02:42:14,140 --> 02:42:17,180
I've just been really slacking on those rates because I've been a little more

2834
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:20,380
like, I've all of a sudden just been more like into Ingress lately.

2835
02:42:20,380 --> 02:42:22,740
Maybe something about the anomaly just kind of made me back into that.

2836
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:24,300
And I was playing Harry Potter a little bit.

2837
02:42:24,580 --> 02:42:27,900
So I try to run my Bluetooth on Pokemon, but the Bluetooth won't

2838
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:31,140
like, let me do the raids.

2839
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:35,420
So, and I just, when I heard that that, uh, Reggie Gigas or whatever was going

2840
02:42:35,420 --> 02:42:39,260
to be in the, uh, EX raids anyway, I was just like, I'll, I guess I'll get

2841
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:40,620
it eventually or they'll be out there.

2842
02:42:40,620 --> 02:42:41,580
I just, I don't know.

2843
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:44,780
I wasn't super interested in paying eight bucks for what they were offering, but

2844
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:46,140
I'm glad to hear about your story.

2845
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:49,860
Uh, and kind of the, the pros and cons about it at the end of the day, honestly.

2846
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:53,420
Uh, Shane might, uh, surprise you in chat.

2847
02:42:53,420 --> 02:42:54,740
They're saying I didn't do it either.

2848
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:58,420
The lack of special spawns all a go Fest was really the deal breaker for me.

2849
02:42:58,700 --> 02:42:59,340
Oh fuck.

2850
02:42:59,340 --> 02:43:02,180
Darkrai can't be traded because it's mythical fucker.

2851
02:43:02,980 --> 02:43:04,180
Well, I'm fucked.

2852
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:08,180
They'll bring it back or it'll be, it'll be in a reward box or something.

2853
02:43:08,180 --> 02:43:12,060
And I, I refuse to believe that Darkrai is going to be gone forever and they'll

2854
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:12,980
bring it back at some point.

2855
02:43:12,980 --> 02:43:13,700
They always do.

2856
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:15,700
So, all right.

2857
02:43:15,740 --> 02:43:17,060
Anyway, so that's it for emails.

2858
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:18,060
Okay.

2859
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:21,260
Uh, if you would like to email us in a future episode, please send us an email.

2860
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:24,020
Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

2861
02:43:24,140 --> 02:43:26,220
And with that, we can stop collecting the gifts.

2862
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:29,900
So Bobby, if you wouldn't mind, go ahead and close the gift box there and

2863
02:43:30,020 --> 02:43:33,020
distribute the freebies there in chat.

2864
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:34,260
Uh, appreciate that.

2865
02:43:34,660 --> 02:43:38,740
Um, And those will go out there shortly in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog

2866
02:43:38,740 --> 02:43:39,140
network.

2867
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:40,740
Sorry to the podcast folk.

2868
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:43,540
We don't have any way to let you guys participate in that as well.

2869
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:46,700
It's just one of the little perks for being able to be here live on, whoa, a

2870
02:43:46,700 --> 02:43:47,860
whole bunch of stuff just went out there.

2871
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:50,620
Be here, be here live on a Sunday night.

2872
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:54,780
I feel like everybody that doesn't have Twitch prime ended up getting one of

2873
02:43:54,780 --> 02:43:55,460
those rewards.

2874
02:43:55,460 --> 02:43:56,060
Well, there you go.

2875
02:43:56,060 --> 02:43:56,940
Congrats, you guys.

2876
02:43:56,940 --> 02:43:57,260
Thanks.

2877
02:43:57,460 --> 02:44:00,700
And thank you to our very generous community for, uh, distributing all those

2878
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:01,140
gifts.

2879
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,420
Super appreciate it.

2880
02:44:02,740 --> 02:44:04,140
All right, let's move on.

2881
02:44:04,140 --> 02:44:05,260
We have some more news for you guys.

2882
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:08,140
I'm actually going to ask us to try to maybe take this a little bit more in

2883
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:09,180
turbo mode here.

2884
02:44:09,380 --> 02:44:10,780
Those were coming up on nine o'clock.

2885
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:11,900
We've had a long show tonight.

2886
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:14,940
I want to make sure we have time to get some calls in and I have to take dark

2887
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:16,460
soccer home tonight cause she's on meds.

2888
02:44:16,460 --> 02:44:17,940
So it's going to be a long night for me.

2889
02:44:17,980 --> 02:44:19,620
So there better be tacos on the way home.

2890
02:44:19,620 --> 02:44:21,260
Let's that can be arranged.

2891
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:22,220
Let's go to turbo mode.

2892
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:23,100
All right.

2893
02:44:23,100 --> 02:44:28,100
So EA has been putting their own games on origin for the longest time.

2894
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:30,460
Well now they're coming back to steam.

2895
02:44:30,780 --> 02:44:35,860
So starting November 15th with the release of star Wars, Jedi fallen order,

2896
02:44:35,900 --> 02:44:38,860
they will be releasing games on steam as well.

2897
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:43,700
And also they're going to be allowing the EA access subscription service to

2898
02:44:43,700 --> 02:44:46,300
be purchased on steam as well.

2899
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:51,660
And going forward, their other games will be, um, put on to steam.

2900
02:44:52,580 --> 02:44:53,860
So that's pretty cool.

2901
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:57,980
And they, according to their official announcement, um, they're going to have

2902
02:44:57,980 --> 02:45:00,740
some older EA releases come back as well.

2903
02:45:00,740 --> 02:45:06,660
The Sims four unravel to apex legends and battlefield five with crossplay

2904
02:45:06,660 --> 02:45:09,380
between steam and origin as well.

2905
02:45:10,180 --> 02:45:11,700
So cool.

2906
02:45:12,500 --> 02:45:16,260
Do you think this is a sign EA is going to let origin kind of go or what do you

2907
02:45:16,300 --> 02:45:19,220
think, or is this, I don't know, actually that wasn't really the first initial

2908
02:45:19,220 --> 02:45:19,980
thought I got from this.

2909
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:24,700
My first initial thought was, Oh, this is a move against Epic because Epic has

2910
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:27,660
really been trying to like get the more and more exclusives and so forth.

2911
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:33,420
So maybe, uh, EA and like EA and steam have this whole, the enemy of my enemy

2912
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:36,100
is my friend type of thing going on.

2913
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:37,260
Does that make sense?

2914
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:39,300
So it's just business, right?

2915
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:40,060
Yeah, maybe.

2916
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:42,540
And Ubisoft left steam to go to Epic.

2917
02:45:42,540 --> 02:45:44,180
So, you know, it makes sense.

2918
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:44,980
Makes sense.

2919
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:47,940
So interesting, interesting how this is all shaking out there.

2920
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:51,620
Um, but how many of these storefronts are we really going to want

2921
02:45:51,620 --> 02:45:52,620
to install on our computer?

2922
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:56,980
Like, I'm not really that concerned by additional storefronts, honestly,

2923
02:45:56,980 --> 02:46:02,180
like even like the Epic store, eh, whatever, it's just a launcher.

2924
02:46:02,180 --> 02:46:06,220
I have, you know, I don't necessarily keep them launched all the time.

2925
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:10,220
If I want to play a game that I don't have that many games on the Epic

2926
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:13,380
storefront and the ones I do like have purchased there, I think I've

2927
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:14,500
purchased like three games.

2928
02:46:14,860 --> 02:46:18,060
Most of the other ones are just free, which I probably have on

2929
02:46:18,060 --> 02:46:19,860
steam anyways, or other consoles.

2930
02:46:20,300 --> 02:46:21,900
Um, I don't know.

2931
02:46:21,900 --> 02:46:23,140
I just, who cares?

2932
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:24,900
It's just launching another fucking thing.

2933
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:27,180
It really doesn't matter at this point.

2934
02:46:27,660 --> 02:46:28,020
All right.

2935
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:31,300
Uh, let's talk a little bit about, uh, mixer.

2936
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:34,060
I know it's weird cause we're broadcasting on Twitch, but, and we're

2937
02:46:34,060 --> 02:46:36,580
going to talk about mixer, which am I even allowed to do that?

2938
02:46:36,580 --> 02:46:37,100
Of course I am.

2939
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:40,220
It's I'm allowed to talk a little bit about the competition because

2940
02:46:40,220 --> 02:46:41,460
competition is healthy.

2941
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:42,380
I think it's a good thing.

2942
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:45,460
And, uh, you know, where one company goes, the other might follow.

2943
02:46:45,460 --> 02:46:47,420
And you know, I think it's all, it's all a good thing.

2944
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:49,500
It's all about the streaming world at the end of the day.

2945
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:52,180
And besides, there's a lot of people that listen to this show on the podcast

2946
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:55,580
feed and don't use either Twitch or mixer, but I think it is worth

2947
02:46:55,580 --> 02:47:00,420
noting that this week mixer has dropped their subscription price down to $4.99.

2948
02:47:00,660 --> 02:47:03,740
This is notable because they were charging $5.99.

2949
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:08,300
That is more than a Twitch subscription, but $4.99 is now at the

2950
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:10,180
same place as a Twitch subscription.

2951
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:14,060
It's now a Twitch and a mixer subscription will cost you the same thing.

2952
02:47:14,380 --> 02:47:18,660
Perhaps this is because the recent move of some big notable streamers

2953
02:47:18,660 --> 02:47:20,340
over to mixer, I don't know.

2954
02:47:20,580 --> 02:47:24,780
Uh, maybe when Ninja went over from Twitch to mixer, perhaps it was one of

2955
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:27,740
those things where, Hey, his followers are gonna have to pay more money to

2956
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:29,140
subscribe to him over on mixer.

2957
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:30,500
Well, they're not going to have to do that anymore.

2958
02:47:30,500 --> 02:47:34,580
So mixer took care of that this week by dropping the price down from a dollar.

2959
02:47:34,860 --> 02:47:38,180
Uh, and you get, I guess, special, I don't, I have to admit, since I do

2960
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:41,220
pretty much exclusively use Twitch myself once in a while, I peek at the

2961
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:44,500
mixer stuff, especially because like in the X-Box app, it's embedded in

2962
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:45,380
there because it's a Microsoft thing.

2963
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:45,660
Right?

2964
02:47:45,820 --> 02:47:49,340
So like when I go to play, uh, something like bloodstained, it'll be like, here

2965
02:47:49,340 --> 02:47:53,340
are the people streaming bloodstained on mixer right now, which I really

2966
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:58,060
wish I hope we see like a Sony and Twitch partnership thing, maybe going

2967
02:47:58,060 --> 02:47:59,100
into the next generation of games.

2968
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:02,780
Cause I know you kind of get that a little bit on Sony now, but it only

2969
02:48:02,780 --> 02:48:06,020
shows you the people streaming natively through the console.

2970
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:07,820
So I hope maybe, I don't know.

2971
02:48:07,820 --> 02:48:09,140
We'll see, we'll see what develops.

2972
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:12,980
But anyway, uh, so yeah, uh, that's, uh, pretty cool that they have

2973
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:16,340
dropped, uh, the, um, subscription down.

2974
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:20,060
Um, I don't know what the split is over there.

2975
02:48:20,060 --> 02:48:22,540
Do their people get half like Twitch does?

2976
02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:23,060
I don't know.

2977
02:48:23,060 --> 02:48:23,860
I don't know either.

2978
02:48:24,100 --> 02:48:26,900
Uh, it should also be noted mixer doesn't have the whole, uh, Amazon

2979
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:28,740
prime thing coming into play either.

2980
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:33,060
Uh, so there's no like freebie chances, by the way, if you are rocking your

2981
02:48:33,060 --> 02:48:36,820
Amazon prime account and, uh, or your Twitch prime or new, what have you, and

2982
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:40,220
you haven't yet used your free subscription, consider using it here at

2983
02:48:40,220 --> 02:48:41,580
the voice geeks network, VOG network.

2984
02:48:41,860 --> 02:48:45,420
Uh, using it here, we'll open up the video archive and you can watch, uh, all

2985
02:48:45,420 --> 02:48:50,700
your, uh, episodes of, uh, OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, the few here and

2986
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:54,380
there specials that we've done over the past year, you can watch all that on video.

2987
02:48:54,380 --> 02:48:57,100
So, um, yeah, there you go.

2988
02:48:57,100 --> 02:49:00,540
Mixer, uh, drop in there to be a little more competitive, especially with some of

2989
02:49:00,540 --> 02:49:03,060
the big name streamers that have left recently dark soccer.

2990
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:03,700
What do you have for us?

2991
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:05,060
Just some stuff.

2992
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:08,180
Um, and I also do have bonus news as well.

2993
02:49:08,700 --> 02:49:14,500
So, um, women in France have, uh, organized, uh, basically in France, about

2994
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:15,940
half of all gamers are women.

2995
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:21,620
And so, um, you know, being that they are completely, uh, underrepresented,

2996
02:49:21,900 --> 02:49:27,260
uh, underrepresented though, for the 10th, uh, edition of the Paris games week fair,

2997
02:49:27,460 --> 02:49:31,660
which, um, is actually just ended today, the organization women in

2998
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:33,420
games had a dedicated soul there.

2999
02:49:33,900 --> 02:49:37,900
Um, it was created in 20, not the stall, but the group was created in 2017.

3000
02:49:37,900 --> 02:49:42,500
It has 1600 members and it promotes involvement of all genders

3001
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:43,780
in the video game community.

3002
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:49,300
Um, and then did I have another thing?

3003
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:52,180
Yeah, that was my story.

3004
02:49:52,660 --> 02:49:54,020
You said you had a bonus thing as well.

3005
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:54,740
A bonus thing.

3006
02:49:55,060 --> 02:49:58,020
Um, they, they apparently did start, um, nevermind.

3007
02:49:58,020 --> 02:49:59,340
This is an old article, so nevermind.

3008
02:49:59,620 --> 02:49:59,980
Okay.

3009
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:05,500
Um, uh, what, what do you think is going to be like the long-term effect

3010
02:50:05,500 --> 02:50:07,100
of this organization in France?

3011
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:12,100
Uh, hopefully, you know, we'll see some serious strides because I mean, the

3012
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:20,140
moment, anytime an organization composed mostly of women and croaches on male

3013
02:50:20,140 --> 02:50:22,660
territory, Oh shit, people get in arms.

3014
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:27,900
And I really want to see the, the binary broken number one.

3015
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:30,100
And I want to see those walls broken down.

3016
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:36,220
I'd like for people to stop mattering what someone has between their legs or,

3017
02:50:36,300 --> 02:50:40,180
you know, how their bodies are built and say, Hey, this is a gamer and

3018
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:41,420
they have something to contribute.

3019
02:50:42,580 --> 02:50:43,540
That's the goal.

3020
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:46,860
Just one minor thing that, cause I don't want the email coming in on it.

3021
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:48,460
Gender is not always about what's between your legs.

3022
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:49,260
That's what I said.

3023
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:49,900
Oh, just making sure.

3024
02:50:49,900 --> 02:50:50,220
Oh, sorry.

3025
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:51,580
I'm I'm misinterpreted what you said.

3026
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:52,020
Okay.

3027
02:50:52,060 --> 02:50:55,900
Well, because I mean, I, I, I phrased it exactly like that because

3028
02:50:55,900 --> 02:50:57,660
that's not what gender is.

3029
02:50:58,220 --> 02:51:00,700
You know, but people focus on that bullshit.

3030
02:51:00,740 --> 02:51:01,140
Got it.

3031
02:51:01,300 --> 02:51:01,660
Got it.

3032
02:51:01,660 --> 02:51:02,540
So whatever.

3033
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:04,580
Um, this is me.

3034
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:05,260
I know.

3035
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:05,660
I know.

3036
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:06,860
That's why I was like, wait a minute.

3037
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:08,580
I think she wanted to phrase that in a different way, but that's okay.

3038
02:51:09,060 --> 02:51:14,060
Um, I wanted to point out though, um, that I, well, I don't know.

3039
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:15,860
Cause maybe it's just from my perspective.

3040
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:16,580
I am a dude.

3041
02:51:16,780 --> 02:51:20,420
So, you know, I don't have the same perspective, but I do feel like, like

3042
02:51:20,460 --> 02:51:25,260
it's getting better than it was even just like three years ago, but I think

3043
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:29,780
it's because more people are speaking up about like, yo, this is fucked up.

3044
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:33,100
And like, you know, that we're starting to see more things like, Oh yay.

3045
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:36,940
We just had, you know, a woman, you know, break or break the streak

3046
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:39,380
and, and win the Hearthstone championship.

3047
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:43,380
And we're seeing, uh, I think more like men and women diversity

3048
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:44,740
in games and things like that.

3049
02:51:44,740 --> 02:51:47,540
I don't know, but I, my perspective is not the one to hear.

3050
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:48,260
What do you think?

3051
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:50,860
Well, I actually, do you think we're going the right way?

3052
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:54,500
We have to take, gain ground when, when we can.

3053
02:51:54,500 --> 02:51:58,220
And I do think that there are some steps being made in the right direction,

3054
02:51:58,220 --> 02:52:02,420
but I would like to also point out, and it's maybe about a year ago, um, one

3055
02:52:02,420 --> 02:52:05,940
of my favorite podcasts, Stuff Mom Never Told You did a series about women in

3056
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:11,380
video games and basically what it's like to be a woman gamer from the perspective

3057
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:13,100
of a gamer and from statistics.

3058
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:19,180
And it really is a very, very good breakdown on just what we experience,

3059
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:21,300
you know, down to the numbers.

3060
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:23,660
The thing that I like is that it had the numbers in it.

3061
02:52:24,180 --> 02:52:29,500
And it's really, I mean, it's really the only way that, like, for example,

3062
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:32,220
if you're a gamer, the only way to really be safe is to conceal your,

3063
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:36,700
your gender or to pick something gender neutral and you still get fucking ratted

3064
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:40,700
on, you know, people still try to give you shit for it, you know, or being

3065
02:52:40,700 --> 02:52:44,500
a voice in the community, you know, they're like, oh, well, well, you're

3066
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:47,420
just saying this because you're, you're a woman or, you know, your opinion

3067
02:52:47,420 --> 02:52:49,580
doesn't matter or go back to the kitchen or whatever the fuck.

3068
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:51,380
It's still fucking happens.

3069
02:52:51,380 --> 02:52:54,060
And as long as it fucking happens, we have not done enough.

3070
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:54,980
That's true.

3071
02:52:54,980 --> 02:52:58,500
And it's still, you know, the, the thing I can come comment on being a gay

3072
02:52:58,500 --> 02:53:02,300
dude is that, you know, we still hear like anti-gay slurs and stuff and

3073
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:04,060
happen and you know, that whole thing.

3074
02:53:04,340 --> 02:53:07,300
I do like to think it's getting better, but you're right.

3075
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:12,700
Imagine what it would be like to be a lesbian of color.

3076
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:14,020
Oh, sure.

3077
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:19,220
You know, I've, I've got friends who have just been absolutely devastated

3078
02:53:19,220 --> 02:53:23,220
by the language that they've received in playing games and trying to be

3079
02:53:23,220 --> 02:53:28,660
outspoken out there on, you know, this rather treacherous water that is,

3080
02:53:28,660 --> 02:53:31,660
you know, the internet cesspool, really.

3081
02:53:31,820 --> 02:53:37,180
But it does feel like for what it's worth it, at least now we have more

3082
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:42,260
games with more representation in them, probably because games are easier

3083
02:53:42,260 --> 02:53:46,220
to make and so games, like not everybody could just sit down and

3084
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:48,500
plunk out an Atari 2,600 game, for example.

3085
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:51,900
And obviously I'm using extreme example here, but now more people are

3086
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:53,300
kind of like able to tell stories.

3087
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:54,740
And I think that like helps.

3088
02:53:54,780 --> 02:53:58,700
I don't necessarily want to, you know, do the big comparison with the civil

3089
02:53:58,700 --> 02:54:00,380
rights movement or anything like that.

3090
02:54:00,660 --> 02:54:03,860
But there is a, it was just a little meme that kind of reminded me of this

3091
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:09,620
fact that major changes in government and in society haven't happened until

3092
02:54:10,020 --> 02:54:14,180
it was made a big inconvenience for the dominant party.

3093
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:18,340
We didn't get ADA until people surrounded the White House with wheelchairs.

3094
02:54:18,380 --> 02:54:24,020
You know, it took a march to Washington and, you know, big fights for school

3095
02:54:24,020 --> 02:54:27,700
integration, the whole civil rights movement to give people of color

3096
02:54:27,900 --> 02:54:29,620
closer to an equal standing.

3097
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:30,260
They don't have it yet.

3098
02:54:30,660 --> 02:54:33,500
It's what's happening, but it's not there yet.

3099
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:34,820
We still have a lot of work to do.

3100
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:38,580
You know, women got the votes because we were jailed.

3101
02:54:38,580 --> 02:54:42,620
We went on hunger strikes, force fed, you know, things that, oh, well, you

3102
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:43,460
just see Susan B.

3103
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:44,820
Anthony and whatever the fuck.

3104
02:54:44,820 --> 02:54:49,900
But people don't know those stories about women who were force fed raw eggs

3105
02:54:49,900 --> 02:54:54,820
through a tube because they dared stand up for suffrage, you know?

3106
02:54:54,820 --> 02:54:56,860
And you're dealing with all of this worldwide.

3107
02:54:56,860 --> 02:55:00,420
You're dealing, well, I mean, I hate Gandhi because he was pretty racist,

3108
02:55:00,420 --> 02:55:06,180
he was pretty racist, but I mean, he would walk, you know, walk works of protest,

3109
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:10,420
you know, and the thing is, is that any kind of injustice like this has

3110
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:12,620
to be fought without rest.

3111
02:55:13,580 --> 02:55:16,940
And if one person falters, someone else has to step up.

3112
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:21,820
And that's why I say all of us, you know, no matter what your gender is, you

3113
02:55:21,820 --> 02:55:25,620
need to stand up and look out for the other oppressed groups because you

3114
02:55:25,620 --> 02:55:27,020
could fucking be next.

3115
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:29,020
And I'm done.

3116
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:30,180
No, you're fine.

3117
02:55:30,380 --> 02:55:31,260
It needed reset.

3118
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:35,460
I mean, so much for turbo mode, but important topic, but a topic we could

3119
02:55:35,460 --> 02:55:37,580
do a whole three hour show on anyway.

3120
02:55:37,580 --> 02:55:40,740
But we got to move on just for time's sake, since we're after 9 p.m.

3121
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:43,020
And we still have some more stories to get to, including what Loki

3122
02:55:43,020 --> 02:55:43,820
is going to talk about next.

3123
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:44,580
Yes.

3124
02:55:44,580 --> 02:55:48,860
And so we had talked about Xbox all access a while back, that whole plan

3125
02:55:48,860 --> 02:55:56,860
where you could basically get an Xbox, uh, one or Xbox one X, um, game pass

3126
02:55:56,900 --> 02:56:01,260
and Xbox live discounted over the course of, uh, two years.

3127
02:56:01,260 --> 02:56:03,020
So you have monthly payments that you pay.

3128
02:56:03,340 --> 02:56:08,740
Well, it's coming back as of November 18th and it's available through, um,

3129
02:56:08,900 --> 02:56:11,940
different partners, depending on where you're purchasing it from.

3130
02:56:11,940 --> 02:56:18,100
I want to say North America is in, uh, Amazon, amazon.com.

3131
02:56:18,180 --> 02:56:21,460
Um, UK would be game or Smith's toys.

3132
02:56:21,940 --> 02:56:27,260
And in Australia, they have that online at Telstra or I think

3133
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:28,620
in their Microsoft stores.

3134
02:56:29,020 --> 02:56:35,740
So, um, the way it works, it could be as little as $19.99 per month for 24 months.

3135
02:56:36,100 --> 02:56:39,220
They are also along with the program.

3136
02:56:40,380 --> 02:56:46,780
Um, you have the opportunity to upgrade to the next, uh, uh, project scarlet

3137
02:56:46,780 --> 02:56:51,740
when it's available in the holiday 2020, although not for the Xbox one X version,

3138
02:56:51,740 --> 02:56:56,100
which is weird, but they don't offer the upgrade that way.

3139
02:56:56,460 --> 02:57:04,380
Um, that's curious, but for the other versions, they like the Xbox one S.

3140
02:57:04,820 --> 02:57:08,860
You can get that, uh, with an upgrade path as well.

3141
02:57:09,460 --> 02:57:13,660
So, um, yeah, they mentioned Xbox one X would be 30 99 a month.

3142
02:57:13,820 --> 02:57:22,420
Um, Xbox one S is 22 99, 19 99 would be for the Xbox one S all digital version.

3143
02:57:23,740 --> 02:57:26,900
So, and no upfront costs and yeah.

3144
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:30,500
Yeah, especially, and I've been commenting on the show myself that, you know, game

3145
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:32,420
passes is getting stronger and stronger.

3146
02:57:32,420 --> 02:57:34,780
Like I'm actually enjoying that more myself as a consumer.

3147
02:57:34,780 --> 02:57:38,500
So this is an interesting, you know, way to kind of jump into this, especially

3148
02:57:38,500 --> 02:57:41,620
going into the holiday season where it's like, you know, if I could just, you

3149
02:57:41,620 --> 02:57:45,380
know, buy somebody a year of this or whatever, I guess you're agreeing to it.

3150
02:57:45,380 --> 02:57:46,220
It's like a contract.

3151
02:57:46,220 --> 02:57:47,060
I mean, it's not so easy.

3152
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:48,020
It is interesting.

3153
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:52,380
And I'd want to see more like how the interactivity with the project scarlet

3154
02:57:52,380 --> 02:57:57,300
stuff and the Xbox one works before I would be like willing to jump into

3155
02:57:57,300 --> 02:58:00,860
something like this, but it's interesting.

3156
02:58:00,860 --> 02:58:06,180
And I'm curious to see why the Xbox one X doesn't have an upgrade path on that,

3157
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:09,300
but, uh, the other ones do so that's weird.

3158
02:58:10,060 --> 02:58:10,540
Yeah.

3159
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:11,540
So, all right.

3160
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:14,380
Well, I'll be curious to see if, uh, it's a successful program.

3161
02:58:14,380 --> 02:58:15,460
And people, I'm sorry.

3162
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:18,060
I especially want to see if they apply this to the next.

3163
02:58:18,060 --> 02:58:18,660
I'm sorry.

3164
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:20,140
They does have an upgrade path.

3165
02:58:20,140 --> 02:58:26,220
The difference is that it, the Xbox one S you have to have it for 18 months.

3166
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:29,260
Whereas the Xbox one X it's for 12 months.

3167
02:58:29,260 --> 02:58:30,420
I see.

3168
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:31,700
All right then.

3169
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:32,620
All right.

3170
02:58:32,620 --> 02:58:35,940
Well, moving on to, uh, one more story for tonight.

3171
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:41,980
It has to do with Pac-Man's 40th anniversary and, uh, Pac-Man is, uh,

3172
02:58:41,980 --> 02:58:45,860
getting some, uh, special new things for the 40th anniversary Namco Bandai

3173
02:58:45,860 --> 02:58:47,220
trying to go all out a little bit.

3174
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:50,260
I'm hoping that means we're going to see some games in the next year.

3175
02:58:50,260 --> 02:58:54,300
But, um, the early thing we have at least is we have a song called

3176
02:58:54,300 --> 02:58:59,740
join the pack by Ken Ishii, who I think is a famous DJ over in Japan.

3177
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:04,260
Uh, there's actually a music video out there for join the pack, uh, by a

3178
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:09,740
famous director, Yuichi Kodama, uh, who won wards at con in 2008, uh,

3179
02:59:09,740 --> 02:59:11,420
the international film festival.

3180
02:59:11,420 --> 02:59:15,700
Uh, he also did the, uh, flag handover ceremony at the Rio Olympics, 2016.

3181
02:59:15,700 --> 02:59:17,180
So some big names behind this.

3182
02:59:17,180 --> 02:59:19,060
Now, sadly, you would think it's a video show.

3183
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:22,180
I would show you the video, but I do have to have concern about

3184
02:59:22,180 --> 02:59:23,260
getting muted here.

3185
02:59:23,260 --> 02:59:25,660
So I can't really play the song cause it is copyright song.

3186
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:27,780
However, if you want to check that out, I listened to it.

3187
02:59:27,780 --> 02:59:28,740
It's okay.

3188
02:59:28,740 --> 02:59:30,900
It's it's no Pac-Man fever.

3189
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:32,860
But maybe I'm just showing my age there.

3190
02:59:32,860 --> 02:59:34,460
Uh, anyway, you can check that out.

3191
02:59:34,460 --> 02:59:36,940
Uh, the, uh, join the pack is the official theme song there.

3192
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:39,740
I'm hoping this leads into some game announcements.

3193
02:59:39,740 --> 02:59:43,060
Cause I don't think that, wow, we made a Pac-Man song.

3194
02:59:43,060 --> 02:59:45,740
I mean, even though they got some talented names behind it, I don't think

3195
02:59:45,740 --> 02:59:48,740
that's really a great anniversary thing, but maybe if it's like, Hey,

3196
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:51,620
we're going to put out like a mega Pac-Man collection, or we're going to

3197
02:59:51,620 --> 02:59:56,140
put out like a lost Pac-Man thing, or, uh, we're going to let arcade one

3198
02:59:56,140 --> 02:59:59,620
up, make a baby Pac-Man table, how they're going to do.

3199
02:59:59,620 --> 03:00:02,620
We're going to make a Pac-Man live action movie.

3200
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:05,380
How they're going to do it because they've never done a pinball table before.

3201
03:00:05,380 --> 03:00:08,380
I don't know, but this is, this is the time to learn how they're going to start.

3202
03:00:08,740 --> 03:00:11,660
Uh, but we'll, we'll see what else comes out of their 40th anniversary,

3203
03:00:11,820 --> 03:00:13,340
but I was still kind of like, wow.

3204
03:00:13,340 --> 03:00:17,020
Is it really like, oh my God, why don't they make like arcade one

3205
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:20,460
up pinball tables, like miniaturized version of pinball tables, dude,

3206
03:00:20,460 --> 03:00:24,980
wait, like if these mini machines are as popular as they're like, like bit

3207
03:00:24,980 --> 03:00:27,900
like they, I feel like the mini arcade one up machines, like there's more

3208
03:00:27,900 --> 03:00:30,340
and more of them and they're getting some bigger and bigger franchises,

3209
03:00:30,340 --> 03:00:33,940
like the Ninja Turtles thing, the star Wars thing, which, um, shout out,

3210
03:00:33,940 --> 03:00:37,100
if you haven't seen Bobby Blackwell's video, he put that up at, uh, on the

3211
03:00:37,100 --> 03:00:39,700
VOG network, YouTube, which we don't talk about a lot because we don't use

3212
03:00:39,700 --> 03:00:43,620
it a lot, but Bobby put a great little clip from his show up there, uh, with

3213
03:00:43,620 --> 03:00:46,700
him, like building the arcade one up star Wars thing.

3214
03:00:46,700 --> 03:00:49,380
So if you haven't seen what these machines look, look like, check it out

3215
03:00:49,380 --> 03:00:51,100
over on our YouTube channel at VOG network.

3216
03:00:51,380 --> 03:00:53,860
Um, but these are kid one ups are getting bigger and bigger names.

3217
03:00:53,900 --> 03:00:55,100
Didn't they get a gauntlet one?

3218
03:00:55,380 --> 03:00:55,860
Nothing like that.

3219
03:00:55,860 --> 03:00:57,060
No, I make that up.

3220
03:00:57,180 --> 03:00:58,180
I think you made that up.

3221
03:00:58,220 --> 03:00:58,780
I made that up.

3222
03:00:58,780 --> 03:00:59,980
Cause I want one, my bad.

3223
03:01:00,180 --> 03:01:05,020
Um, but, uh, that would be really cool, but I, the mortal combat one, I kind of

3224
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:09,060
want to get cause I love the old mortal combat games, so, but it's just, you

3225
03:01:09,060 --> 03:01:13,980
know, again, I need less shit in this house, not more, so the eternal struggle.

3226
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:16,140
All right.

3227
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:17,940
Anyway, uh, there you go.

3228
03:01:17,940 --> 03:01:20,340
So that is, uh, Pac-Man's 40th anniversary.

3229
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:22,900
Uh, let's, let's open up the listener round table.

3230
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:25,780
You guys, uh, we're going to go to our discord and if you want to give us a

3231
03:01:25,780 --> 03:01:30,420
call, you can join the green room over in our discord over at vog network.com

3232
03:01:30,420 --> 03:01:33,980
slash discord, and we're going to get to some calls here on air.

3233
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:36,100
I'm probably not gonna be able to take a lot of calls tonight just because

3234
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:38,740
we're already running a little late, but that's what happens when you take

3235
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:41,780
so much time off and then Blizzcon happens the same week that you come back.

3236
03:01:42,340 --> 03:01:43,260
You feeling okay over there?

3237
03:01:43,340 --> 03:01:43,740
Yeah.

3238
03:01:43,740 --> 03:01:48,300
Had a little bit of a thing to get, uh, kind of having a great discussion.

3239
03:01:48,300 --> 03:01:51,660
I mean, I got a little angry for a moment, but, um, talking about the

3240
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:56,100
experience of women in gaming, you know, uh, Kaijuna was bringing up

3241
03:01:56,100 --> 03:02:00,540
having a friend, well, a former friend who was going off on a woman after

3242
03:02:00,540 --> 03:02:03,300
having been beaten in a game and I'm like, okay, so I'm take that.

3243
03:02:03,300 --> 03:02:07,380
And imagine this is every experience you have with it directed at you.

3244
03:02:07,900 --> 03:02:12,980
Every game, maybe not every game, but just about any time you sit and play

3245
03:02:12,980 --> 03:02:17,500
any kind of multiplayer game, this happens and it's always at you, no

3246
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:20,940
matter what you do, how clean of a game, how little shit you talk about

3247
03:02:20,940 --> 03:02:23,420
people, this is the experience of women in gaming.

3248
03:02:25,020 --> 03:02:29,780
Um, I do want to point out, um, Bobby Black Wolf is, is, uh, justifying my

3249
03:02:29,780 --> 03:02:33,780
gauntlet experience saying I did not make that up in fact, there is a

3250
03:02:33,780 --> 03:02:39,380
rampage cabinet that has rampage joust defender and I have played that one.

3251
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:40,860
I forgot that it had gauntlet.

3252
03:02:40,940 --> 03:02:44,940
So, yeah, but you were, I, I was not, maybe you, maybe your

3253
03:02:44,940 --> 03:02:46,740
brain went to gauntlet legends.

3254
03:02:46,780 --> 03:02:47,140
Yes.

3255
03:02:47,140 --> 03:02:49,460
Unfortunately that is not a thing that they have.

3256
03:02:50,140 --> 03:02:52,060
If they did that, yeah.

3257
03:02:52,100 --> 03:02:52,580
Right.

3258
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:52,820
Yeah.

3259
03:02:52,820 --> 03:02:54,660
I would have been very excited to be pretty amazing.

3260
03:02:54,740 --> 03:02:55,620
That would be pretty amazing.

3261
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:57,620
All right, let's get to, um, some calls.

3262
03:02:57,780 --> 03:03:00,660
So I'm going to try to drop somebody in the on air room and hello.

3263
03:03:00,660 --> 03:03:01,780
You were on orange launch radio.

3264
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:02,300
Who's this?

3265
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:05,500
Amy, uh, this is my lovely him.

3266
03:03:05,540 --> 03:03:06,140
How are you?

3267
03:03:06,460 --> 03:03:07,460
Hey, I am great.

3268
03:03:07,460 --> 03:03:09,780
Except I'm just having to adjust the volume on the fly, but don't

3269
03:03:09,780 --> 03:03:10,220
worry about that.

3270
03:03:10,220 --> 03:03:10,940
That's on my end.

3271
03:03:10,940 --> 03:03:12,060
So sorry about the echo guys.

3272
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:12,860
What's on your mind tonight?

3273
03:03:12,860 --> 03:03:14,180
Raging or excuse me, metal mayhem.

3274
03:03:14,180 --> 03:03:14,660
What's on your mind?

3275
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:19,300
Oh, well, I started to bring up, um, unusual.

3276
03:03:19,300 --> 03:03:24,980
Topic, uh, mainly, uh, hoarding of, uh, digital PC games.

3277
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:32,820
Um, as you know, Nowadays, things do humble bundle sale, uh, bundle

3278
03:03:32,820 --> 03:03:36,820
bundles, uh, steam sales, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

3279
03:03:37,740 --> 03:03:45,700
It's incredibly easy to build up massive amounts of, uh, PC, uh, games.

3280
03:03:45,700 --> 03:03:53,220
Um, and, you know, depending on the person, you know, it can be easily,

3281
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:59,260
you know, justified as, you know, eventually I'll get around to play X

3282
03:03:59,260 --> 03:04:04,660
game or Y game, or you never know if a certain game is going to be

3283
03:04:04,660 --> 03:04:06,980
elicited at some point down the road.

3284
03:04:07,020 --> 03:04:13,140
Like, uh, you know, Doug Tails remastered was fairly recently.

3285
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:20,860
Um, that being said, you know, I, you know, do you think that, you know, the

3286
03:04:20,860 --> 03:04:28,060
building of these massive libraries of games, uh, can be an issue in a sense?

3287
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:28,620
No.

3288
03:04:28,660 --> 03:04:34,140
I mean, you know, case in point, no, not to sound like a bragging, but with

3289
03:04:34,140 --> 03:04:40,580
all the games I have through the various services, I get well over 2000 games.

3290
03:04:41,340 --> 03:04:46,060
Odds are, you know, probably not going to get around to play every single one of

3291
03:04:46,060 --> 03:04:54,020
those games, especially since a lot of them can be upwards is say 50 hours long.

3292
03:04:54,820 --> 03:05:00,740
Um, so do you think that it can be like a serious hoarding issue, even

3293
03:05:00,740 --> 03:05:05,980
though that they don't take a physical room like, uh, cartridges?

3294
03:05:05,980 --> 03:05:13,500
Um, I mean, hoarding is in some ways kind of a part of human nature.

3295
03:05:13,540 --> 03:05:17,460
Like I realized that sometimes we associate that word hoarding with like,

3296
03:05:17,460 --> 03:05:23,460
um, the TV show hoarders when things go to, uh, an extreme of sorts, but I think

3297
03:05:23,460 --> 03:05:27,220
something about the collection and collectibles that's, there's something I

3298
03:05:27,220 --> 03:05:29,420
think that's kind of like fused in us with that whole thing.

3299
03:05:29,660 --> 03:05:32,780
Um, case in point, you know, even though you kind of talk about, oh, we build up

3300
03:05:32,820 --> 03:05:36,540
this huge library of digital games on Steam, uh, or whatever service, you know,

3301
03:05:36,540 --> 03:05:38,980
we're using and we, we may or may not ever getting around to play them.

3302
03:05:39,220 --> 03:05:39,700
You know what?

3303
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:45,180
I think of houses I've gone into that have gigantic bookshelves, lots and lots

3304
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:45,980
of books.

3305
03:05:46,140 --> 03:05:49,860
And I think to myself, you probably have never read all of those books.

3306
03:05:49,860 --> 03:05:52,900
Maybe they have, but I bet there's a lot of books on that shelf that you've never

3307
03:05:52,900 --> 03:05:53,260
read.

3308
03:05:53,460 --> 03:05:56,300
Uh, same thing with the people, you know, that you go into their house and they

3309
03:05:56,300 --> 03:05:59,740
have DVDs that practically wrap around the house.

3310
03:05:59,900 --> 03:06:02,980
Maybe you're seeing less and less of that because of this digital future we're

3311
03:06:02,980 --> 03:06:03,420
living in.

3312
03:06:03,420 --> 03:06:06,580
But I know I went to somebody's house not that long ago who I was meeting, um,

3313
03:06:06,620 --> 03:06:10,180
kind of like, like a new friend I just met and I was like, dang, you got to like

3314
03:06:10,180 --> 03:06:11,380
a lot of DVDs.

3315
03:06:11,620 --> 03:06:15,380
And then I'm thinking, has this person actually watched the DVD or do they buy

3316
03:06:15,380 --> 03:06:15,940
the DVD?

3317
03:06:15,940 --> 03:06:18,380
Because maybe they saw the movie in the theater and they just kind of liked it.

3318
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:19,140
I mean, I don't know.

3319
03:06:19,140 --> 03:06:22,020
And I'm not saying like, oh, everybody who has these collections doesn't actually

3320
03:06:22,020 --> 03:06:22,460
use them.

3321
03:06:22,580 --> 03:06:22,980
Sure.

3322
03:06:22,980 --> 03:06:25,980
I bet there are some people that have watched every single DVD that they own.

3323
03:06:26,140 --> 03:06:28,060
Have you watched every single DVD that you own, Loki?

3324
03:06:28,300 --> 03:06:29,820
I don't know the main DVDs anymore.

3325
03:06:29,820 --> 03:06:30,300
Not anymore.

3326
03:06:30,300 --> 03:06:30,460
Right.

3327
03:06:30,460 --> 03:06:31,500
And when I did know.

3328
03:06:31,540 --> 03:06:35,340
Yeah, but have you played every single game in the vault?

3329
03:06:39,260 --> 03:06:39,700
Okay.

3330
03:06:39,820 --> 03:06:40,460
See what I mean?

3331
03:06:40,780 --> 03:06:42,860
So that's funny, Rob.

3332
03:06:42,940 --> 03:06:48,740
So the digital collection on steam, the digital just makes it easier to do that.

3333
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:52,100
And just, there's something about having that impressive collection.

3334
03:06:52,100 --> 03:06:55,980
Like, oh, remember when it used to be, we have this big binder full of CDs, check

3335
03:06:56,020 --> 03:06:58,260
out my CD collection or, you know, things like that.

3336
03:06:58,260 --> 03:07:01,500
Like, it's just like having the collections as part of nature.

3337
03:07:01,660 --> 03:07:06,380
So I don't think it's like a bad thing to have, like all these games pile up.

3338
03:07:06,380 --> 03:07:11,780
In fact, I mean, sometimes you get the most random bug to go play a certain game

3339
03:07:11,980 --> 03:07:14,740
and then you find out, oh, I have that in my collection.

3340
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:18,540
And then maybe you get to experience this thing that you might collect dust

3341
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:19,300
otherwise.

3342
03:07:19,420 --> 03:07:20,140
So, I don't know.

3343
03:07:20,140 --> 03:07:21,140
Those are my thoughts.

3344
03:07:22,340 --> 03:07:25,900
Did I really address your question, Metal Mayhem, or was there something deeper in

3345
03:07:25,940 --> 03:07:26,140
that?

3346
03:07:28,620 --> 03:07:29,940
More or less you did.

3347
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:35,980
You know, the thing is, you know, at least when I was strictly a console gamer, you

3348
03:07:35,980 --> 03:07:43,660
know, up until that close to the end of the PS3 era, you know, a lot of games,

3349
03:07:43,980 --> 03:07:47,820
you know, especially in physical games, were $60 plus.

3350
03:07:49,300 --> 03:07:54,180
That being said, I didn't buy every single last game that I came across.

3351
03:07:54,700 --> 03:08:01,780
Now, ever since you introduced me to PC games, namely Steam, you mentioned Steam

3352
03:08:01,780 --> 03:08:02,980
sales and all that.

3353
03:08:02,980 --> 03:08:07,780
Now, I kind of caught the bug, you know, where I was in no estate.

3354
03:08:08,060 --> 03:08:11,380
Now, this game is going to weigh $20.

3355
03:08:12,020 --> 03:08:14,300
Now, it's on sale for $2.

3356
03:08:14,300 --> 03:08:20,500
So Humble Bundle has this bundle, you know, I can get all these games for a dollar.

3357
03:08:21,020 --> 03:08:27,540
I was like, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, I'll buy two of that, you know, I'll buy

3358
03:08:27,980 --> 03:08:33,420
whatever, you know, I'll get around to playing these eventually.

3359
03:08:33,420 --> 03:08:39,460
But, you know, the thing is, you know, it kind of go up and, you know, now I got,

3360
03:08:39,460 --> 03:08:42,980
like, like I said, quite, you know, quite, you know, collection.

3361
03:08:42,980 --> 03:08:48,780
And honestly, you know, I probably got more games, you know, more free time than the

3362
03:08:48,820 --> 03:08:52,340
average person because I'm disabled and don't have a nine-to-five job.

3363
03:08:52,820 --> 03:08:55,740
But even with that being said, even if I...

3364
03:08:55,740 --> 03:09:01,300
What you find, despite your limitations, your boundaries in that regard, you've kind

3365
03:09:01,300 --> 03:09:05,980
of found ways to, in a way, still, like, keep your happiness and keep your level of

3366
03:09:05,980 --> 03:09:07,900
happiness because you are a gamer.

3367
03:09:07,900 --> 03:09:11,260
And I know we've talked about this when you first started listening to OLR.

3368
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:15,020
I remember some of your concern was, am I going to fit in here because I'm still

3369
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:19,260
playing Nintendo 64 games when y'all are talking about PlayStation 2 and 3 type of

3370
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:23,300
games? And the answer was an enthusiastic, yes, you still fit in here because you're

3371
03:09:23,300 --> 03:09:24,340
still a gamer.

3372
03:09:24,340 --> 03:09:29,860
And I think that's also, you know, you are working with the cards that you have.

3373
03:09:30,100 --> 03:09:36,060
And in my impression, and I apologize if I'm misstating anything, but my impression

3374
03:09:36,060 --> 03:09:41,260
is you've kind of made a fun hobby out of deal shopping, you know, and I don't...

3375
03:09:41,260 --> 03:09:42,580
There's nothing wrong with that.

3376
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:45,220
Lord, you ever seen any of those extreme coupon shows?

3377
03:09:46,660 --> 03:09:51,380
People make hobbies out of finding those good deals, and that's definitely not a bad

3378
03:09:51,380 --> 03:09:56,140
thing at all. And it allows you to still play a lot of, maybe not games that came out

3379
03:09:56,140 --> 03:09:59,820
yesterday, but a lot of games that came out within the past couple of years that are

3380
03:09:59,820 --> 03:10:04,260
still very, very good and worthy of your attention, whether you got it for free or got

3381
03:10:04,260 --> 03:10:07,220
it on a deep cut for only, like, 99 cents.

3382
03:10:07,900 --> 03:10:13,340
So, yeah, you know, I'll be the first to admit that because I live on Social Security

3383
03:10:13,340 --> 03:10:21,420
disability and which doesn't pay me much per month, you know, I can't afford to go buy,

3384
03:10:22,620 --> 03:10:25,980
you know, expensive games on the regular.

3385
03:10:25,980 --> 03:10:31,460
But, you know, I kind of honed my ability to find the deals, you know, like you

3386
03:10:31,500 --> 03:10:38,660
mentioned, you know, I look all over the place, the humble bundle, you know, the sales,

3387
03:10:38,660 --> 03:10:46,100
you know, read little articles to post, you know, I'll repost the stuff that I find on

3388
03:10:46,100 --> 03:10:47,500
Steam in the one group.

3389
03:10:50,700 --> 03:10:55,460
Sorry. So, yeah, I mean, I can't quite adapt to it.

3390
03:10:55,460 --> 03:11:00,180
So, you know, I mean, if I can find, like, a really good deal and stuff, you know,

3391
03:11:00,180 --> 03:11:04,900
pouring out to get stuff to all the people, because I know I'm probably not the only

3392
03:11:04,900 --> 03:11:08,260
person in the world that has to live on a tight budget, you know.

3393
03:11:08,820 --> 03:11:10,420
Absolutely not.

3394
03:11:10,420 --> 03:11:13,380
And I think there's other people also on a tight budget.

3395
03:11:13,380 --> 03:11:17,860
I'm sure you're not alone in that, that appreciate all those tips and those things that

3396
03:11:17,860 --> 03:11:19,700
you put out there when you find the games.

3397
03:11:19,700 --> 03:11:24,180
And that's why you have sites like, for example, I'll just shout out Cheap Ass Gamer.

3398
03:11:24,180 --> 03:11:26,860
I know they've had a podcast that's been around forever, too.

3399
03:11:27,500 --> 03:11:30,780
And, you know, it's because people love a good deal.

3400
03:11:30,780 --> 03:11:36,060
And to build up those backlogs, because you never know, someday, maybe it'll be easy to

3401
03:11:36,060 --> 03:11:40,620
pass along those digital backlogs to somebody else, just like it would be your library book

3402
03:11:40,620 --> 03:11:42,460
collection or your DVD collection.

3403
03:11:42,460 --> 03:11:45,100
Anyway, Metal Mayhem, I got to let you go because we're running really long tonight.

3404
03:11:45,100 --> 03:11:46,060
But thank you so much for your call.

3405
03:11:46,060 --> 03:11:46,780
I appreciate it, buddy.

3406
03:11:46,780 --> 03:11:47,280
Okay?

3407
03:11:48,380 --> 03:11:49,260
Have a good night.

3408
03:11:49,260 --> 03:11:49,740
Take care.

3409
03:11:49,740 --> 03:11:50,620
Take care.

3410
03:11:50,620 --> 03:11:50,860
All right.

3411
03:11:50,860 --> 03:11:52,780
That was the only call that was waiting on Discord for us.

3412
03:11:52,780 --> 03:11:55,580
So, I am going to go ahead and close up Discord just because we're running over three hours

3413
03:11:55,580 --> 03:12:00,220
right now, and I know everybody's about had it, but that's what happens when you've been

3414
03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:01,500
gone for a few weeks.

3415
03:12:01,500 --> 03:12:06,140
I will still go over to Loki and ask if there's any last minute stories that you might have.

3416
03:12:06,140 --> 03:12:07,100
Yes, there is.

3417
03:12:07,100 --> 03:12:08,380
So, I was going to mention this.

3418
03:12:09,180 --> 03:12:16,780
One of my favorite independent game companies, Bossa, who did the very famous Surgeon Simulator

3419
03:12:16,780 --> 03:12:18,220
games in I Am Bread.

3420
03:12:18,860 --> 03:12:27,420
Well, they have done something kind of in a similar tone as like how we got Goat Simulator

3421
03:12:27,420 --> 03:12:29,660
with Coffee Stain games.

3422
03:12:29,660 --> 03:12:38,060
So, they have these prototypes of games that they're developing that you can download for

3423
03:12:38,060 --> 03:12:42,940
free and try them out and let them know which one you want turned into a real game.

3424
03:12:42,940 --> 03:12:52,700
So, you can go to bossapresents.com and download either they have Pigeon Simulator, I Am Fish,

3425
03:12:53,820 --> 03:12:56,700
or Trash Bandits, and they all look great.

3426
03:12:56,700 --> 03:12:58,460
Oh, Trash Bandits all the way.

3427
03:12:58,460 --> 03:13:03,420
So, Trash Bandits, you're a fox and you collect trash.

3428
03:13:03,420 --> 03:13:06,620
I thought it was like actual like little bandits going through the trash.

3429
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:07,900
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3430
03:13:07,900 --> 03:13:13,820
So, Trash Bandits, it's basically your foxes that you're collecting things and throwing

3431
03:13:13,820 --> 03:13:17,740
in the back of like a garbage truck.

3432
03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:22,140
So, you're doing that and you're actually like, you know, it looks pretty crazy.

3433
03:13:22,140 --> 03:13:24,780
I Am Fish, it's similar to I Am Bread.

3434
03:13:24,780 --> 03:13:28,140
I Am Bread was kind of the game where you control a piece of bread and you try to get

3435
03:13:28,140 --> 03:13:29,180
to the toaster.

3436
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:34,780
In I Am Fish, you're a fish in a fish bowl and you have to roll a fish bowl to get to

3437
03:13:34,780 --> 03:13:40,220
a water source without breaking the fish bowl and dying because you're a fish.

3438
03:13:40,220 --> 03:13:44,940
Pigeon Simulator is this ridiculous game where you're pigeon and poop on things and pigeon

3439
03:13:44,940 --> 03:13:45,420
things.

3440
03:13:45,420 --> 03:13:48,700
So, all look great, all free.

3441
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:52,940
So, go check them out and I'm going to download all of them.

3442
03:13:52,940 --> 03:13:54,780
Yeah, that's great.

3443
03:13:54,780 --> 03:13:55,340
I love that.

3444
03:13:55,980 --> 03:13:57,580
So, that's Trash Bandits.

3445
03:13:57,580 --> 03:13:58,460
That's all I had.

3446
03:13:58,460 --> 03:13:59,100
All right.

3447
03:13:59,100 --> 03:14:00,540
No, that's a great last minute story.

3448
03:14:00,540 --> 03:14:01,980
It's completely appropriate.

3449
03:14:01,980 --> 03:14:05,420
I will ask, I know Darcy, you don't usually have a ton of last minute stories, but sometimes

3450
03:14:05,420 --> 03:14:05,580
you do.

3451
03:14:05,580 --> 03:14:06,460
So, you have anything for us?

3452
03:14:07,020 --> 03:14:07,340
No.

3453
03:14:07,340 --> 03:14:07,420
Okay.

3454
03:14:07,420 --> 03:14:07,820
No.

3455
03:14:07,820 --> 03:14:08,380
Cool.

3456
03:14:08,380 --> 03:14:08,700
All right.

3457
03:14:08,700 --> 03:14:11,500
Then we're going to go ahead and start to make the moves to wrap things up tonight.

3458
03:14:12,140 --> 03:14:13,260
Great show back.

3459
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:17,900
I really, it was hard to be gone an extra week, but I'm really glad to be back.

3460
03:14:18,620 --> 03:14:23,340
As I've mentioned before, we will not be live next week, but we're not, we are going to,

3461
03:14:23,340 --> 03:14:25,260
thankfully it works out, we are going to have a show.

3462
03:14:26,140 --> 03:14:29,580
So, please be on the lookout on our social media because we're going to be soliciting

3463
03:14:29,580 --> 03:14:33,420
your questions to help us build the next show that's coming up.

3464
03:14:33,420 --> 03:14:37,820
And I seem to remember an email that had a question we need to still get to to answer

3465
03:14:37,820 --> 03:14:38,060
that.

3466
03:14:38,060 --> 03:14:40,300
I said we do that the next time we record a show.

3467
03:14:40,300 --> 03:14:45,180
So, we'll handle all of that for our recorded in advance show for next Sunday.

3468
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:48,540
So, we will still have something new on the podcast feed for you guys and something new

3469
03:14:48,540 --> 03:14:53,180
for those of you that are here for Bobby's show live on Twitch Sunday night, something

3470
03:14:53,180 --> 03:14:54,140
to view right after that.

3471
03:14:54,140 --> 03:14:55,100
So, that'll be really good.

3472
03:14:55,900 --> 03:14:58,780
But we have run really long and I think it's time to wrap things up.

3473
03:14:58,780 --> 03:15:01,820
So, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3474
03:15:01,820 --> 03:15:03,740
So, I'll start tonight.

3475
03:15:03,740 --> 03:15:11,820
My final thought is I've been enjoying playing the games like more of them this week, a diverse

3476
03:15:12,380 --> 03:15:14,860
different set of games than just nothing but MMOs.

3477
03:15:14,860 --> 03:15:18,220
And I'm going to try to kind of keep doing that and make really good use of my game pass

3478
03:15:18,220 --> 03:15:20,380
and stuff and have more games to tell you guys about.

3479
03:15:20,380 --> 03:15:25,660
The place where I've been slacking is streaming, which I feel like is always my struggle, but

3480
03:15:25,660 --> 03:15:30,220
just with my new job and the traveling that goes into my new job, it's been a little bit

3481
03:15:30,220 --> 03:15:31,900
harder to get to that regularly.

3482
03:15:31,900 --> 03:15:35,740
But I'm going to hope as we get into the new year, I can really settle down and try to

3483
03:15:35,740 --> 03:15:37,420
do that a little more regularly for you guys.

3484
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:39,820
Because I know you all want to see me play Death Stranding.

3485
03:15:39,820 --> 03:15:41,020
I know you do.

3486
03:15:41,020 --> 03:15:42,540
So, that's my final thought.

3487
03:15:42,540 --> 03:15:43,580
I can't wait.

3488
03:15:43,580 --> 03:15:44,940
Loki, since you left, you go next.

3489
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:45,740
What's your final thought?

3490
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:53,260
Looks like Pigeon Simulator is much of a simulator of pigeons as Surgeon Simulator was a surgical

3491
03:15:53,260 --> 03:15:53,900
simulation.

3492
03:15:54,460 --> 03:15:55,020
It's great.

3493
03:15:55,020 --> 03:15:56,220
I can't wait to try it out.

3494
03:15:56,780 --> 03:15:57,340
All right.

3495
03:15:57,340 --> 03:15:59,500
And last but not least, Dark Sakura, I hope you feel better.

3496
03:15:59,500 --> 03:16:00,300
I'm glad we were able to.

3497
03:16:00,300 --> 03:16:02,140
I would have been really sad if you couldn't be here tonight.

3498
03:16:02,140 --> 03:16:05,180
I mean, I would have completely understood, but that would have meant one month of no

3499
03:16:05,180 --> 03:16:05,900
Dark Sakura.

3500
03:16:05,900 --> 03:16:08,460
So, I'm glad you're here.

3501
03:16:08,460 --> 03:16:09,660
Glad you made it through the show.

3502
03:16:09,660 --> 03:16:11,740
Any final words of tonight from you?

3503
03:16:11,740 --> 03:16:12,700
I have no filter.

3504
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:17,100
I am still completely zoned.

3505
03:16:17,100 --> 03:16:18,780
Especially when on the meds.

3506
03:16:18,780 --> 03:16:20,060
And I have no fucking filter.

3507
03:16:21,100 --> 03:16:22,700
This is the craziest feeling ever.

3508
03:16:22,780 --> 03:16:26,860
And I'm kind of digging it, but I'm sorry if I've been a bitch.

3509
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:28,300
It's okay.

3510
03:16:28,300 --> 03:16:29,100
A bitcher.

3511
03:16:29,100 --> 03:16:31,580
It's a bitchier than usual.

3512
03:16:31,580 --> 03:16:31,980
Yes.

3513
03:16:31,980 --> 03:16:32,300
All right.

3514
03:16:33,340 --> 03:16:34,300
Actually, I'm not really sorry.

3515
03:16:36,220 --> 03:16:36,620
All right.

3516
03:16:37,660 --> 03:16:38,220
That's it.

3517
03:16:38,220 --> 03:16:39,980
Thank you guys so much for joining us here.

3518
03:16:39,980 --> 03:16:41,020
Back live tonight.

3519
03:16:41,020 --> 03:16:42,540
We'll be back live in two weeks.

3520
03:16:42,540 --> 03:16:45,180
We'll be back in a taped form next week.

3521
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:46,220
Thank you guys for being here.

3522
03:16:46,220 --> 03:16:47,020
Thanks for your support.

3523
03:16:47,020 --> 03:16:47,980
Thanks for sticking with us.

3524
03:16:48,540 --> 03:16:53,020
Despite the fact that sometimes the cable knocks out our show for a week or that our

3525
03:16:53,020 --> 03:16:54,300
real lives get in the way.

3526
03:16:54,300 --> 03:16:56,860
Things happen at the end of the day.

3527
03:16:56,860 --> 03:16:57,900
Happy gaming.

3528
03:16:57,900 --> 03:17:02,860
Keep the debate spirited, but keep the debate friendly, positive, and peaceful.

3529
03:17:02,860 --> 03:17:04,220
And don't be a dick.

3530
03:17:04,220 --> 03:17:04,620
That's it.

3531
03:17:04,620 --> 03:17:06,700
I'll get off my high horse and roll the credits.

3532
03:17:06,700 --> 03:17:07,660
Have a great night, everybody.

3533
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:07,900
Bye.

3534
03:17:08,700 --> 03:17:11,340
