7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	This week it's the year of the goose and I'm perfectly okay with that. It's a welcome shake up to the news we've grown sadly accustomed to like studio closures, mind boggling litigation, etc.
22000	27000	This is just one honk in tonight's news, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	48000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 795 for this October the 6th of 2019.
48000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio is Techmaster Loki.
52000	54000	It's me and I'm very close to the camera now.
54000	56000	You are, yeah, extreme close up.
56000	68000	Hello sir, we are taping live of course on Twitch as we always do every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network and yes I'm laughing for those of you that are watching on Twitch because I see right there the title is wrong yet again.
68000	79000	Sorry guys, I had to do a lot of last minute switcheroo for tonight's show because not joining us tonight, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, she was going to be here but she had like kind of like a last minute like sick bout thing.
80000	90000	So I'll let her tell you what she wants next week. It's her business. But sadly she is not here tonight and it was a little more like sudden-ish so we're kind of fixing things on the fly as we go.
90000	94000	As is the joy of doing a live production as we do here at the voice geeks network.
94000	101000	Like I literally had mayonnaise on in my beard just a second ago and I'm all sunburned because I was outside for five hours today.
101000	104000	This does not have to do with video games necessarily.
104000	106000	It sort of, it almost did.
107000	123000	So they had the Sacramento air show this weekend so I took my kids to go see planes because the last air show that they went to, well one of my kids wasn't even born then and the other one he was too small so he was really afraid of everything because it was so loud.
123000	130000	So we went and saw everything today but they had the PlayStation truck there and I meant to go play video games.
130000	139000	In fact you know I had told them because we looked up online to see what games were there and they had like some new games that were only shown at like Comic Con and E3 and stuff like that.
139000	141000	I was like oh cool I want to go play some of those games.
141000	145000	So okay we'll do it on our way out you know since it's on the way to the car.
145000	151000	And sure enough we go walking by you know at least a couple hours before the place is closed and they're all yeah we're done.
151000	154000	I'm like god damn it you know so we missed it.
154000	166000	Unfortunately which is too bad because I want to play the Iron Man VR game but my kids want to play the Iron Man VR game and now they can't ever they can't ever play the well until a while but we'll get to that.
166000	167000	All right.
167000	172000	So yeah unfortunately our soccer not here tonight.
172000	174000	But the air show being in town.
174000	176000	I've been hearing that all day long.
176000	179000	It's very loud flying over the house because I don't live that far.
179000	181000	I mean not to give my home address out on Twitch.
181000	183000	Well they they fly pretty far away.
183000	187000	I mean they're all 400 miles an hour as it takes them a bit of distance to turn around.
187000	188000	So they go by the house.
188000	191000	So good luck napping right.
191000	194000	Yeah yeah exactly.
194000	195000	Anyway should we get into some news.
195000	198000	Sure video game news talk about what's going on in the gaming world.
198000	199000	Sure let's do that.
199000	208000	And we're going to get into our kickoff story tonight which has to do with a pretty big change over at PlayStation kind of a sudden change on Monday.
208000	210000	It was announced via Twitter.
210000	212000	I mean this is the day all the big things.
212000	215000	Yeah all the big things now get announced on Twitter.
215000	219000	Sony announced on Twitter that Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios chairman.
219000	220000	That's a hell of a title.
220000	222000	Shawn Layden left.
222000	223000	That's it.
223000	224000	He's left the gaming division.
224000	225000	I was going to say I don't know who he is.
225000	226000	Yes you do.
226000	228000	When you see the picture you know exactly who he is.
228000	233000	He's always the guy at the start of E3 press conferences and he's the guy that's up on stage.
233000	239000	He's kind of you know he's not the Reggie of Sony but like close at which yes I know Reggie retired.
239000	240000	Come on.
240000	242000	But always in our hearts right.
242000	244000	So he's kind of like that guy for Sony.
244000	246000	I like their fake VP better.
246000	247000	I wish he was back.
247000	249000	Oh from the commercials years ago.
249000	250000	Yeah of course.
250000	251000	Anyway the tweet went like this.
251000	254000	PlayStation tweeted on September 30th on Monday.
254000	261000	It is with great emotion that we announced that worldwide studios chairman Shawn Layden will be departing SIE.
261000	263000	His visionary leadership will be greatly missed.
263000	267000	We wish him success in future endeavors and are deeply grateful for his years of service.
267000	269000	Thanks for everything Shawn.
269000	270000	And that was the tweet.
270000	271000	That that's the tweet.
271000	272000	That was it.
272000	276000	But still can't help but feel kind of sudden.
276000	278000	Shawn Layden was with Sony for 32 years.
278000	279000	That's a long time.
279000	280000	A very long time.
280000	282000	Here's the interesting thing about the tweet.
282000	291000	It didn't say anything like will be leaving or is retiring or it just says not here anymore.
291000	294000	Now you could tinfoil half this a bit.
294000	308000	I mean what happened was he suddenly let go which I don't know why it's not like so did he leave squirt porn in like someplace you know or am I getting him confused with Randy Pitchford.
308000	309000	I'm getting him confused with Randy Pitchford.
309000	311000	Yes you're getting him confused with Randy Pitchford.
311000	313000	Well maybe I don't know who knows.
313000	326000	I mean people are going to make shit up and at the end of the day for all we know he could have could have underlined bolded some type of urgent medical or family issue something we're not aware of that may have pulled him out of that.
326000	330000	And if that's the case then heaven forbid I hope he's OK personally.
330000	335000	Of course there's a lot of people want to theorize he's going to Microsoft or you know something you know.
335000	337000	I don't think they need him to go to Microsoft.
337000	345000	But I still I still think if it was something like that where he left one company to go to another he would announce that he's like or there would have been like a grace period.
345000	350000	He will be retiring and you know or leaving the company in weeks or something like that.
350000	356000	Or by now shit what this happened on Monday like we would have heard the announcement about where he ended up you know.
356000	358000	So it's interesting.
358000	363000	I mean again I don't want to pry too much because this could be a completely 100 percent personal matter.
363000	368000	And that is just the reality. And if that's the case then you know so be it.
368000	370000	And I hope he's OK and his family's OK and all that stuff.
370000	382000	But certainly it does have you kind of going wow especially when we're talking about the ramp up towards PlayStation 5 and kind of the fact that this year Sony's been kind of absent this year right.
382000	392000	They didn't do E3 this year. They've kind of been taking the year off because there is this ramp up happening towards a PlayStation 5 which you know I think we all generally accept as the inevitability.
392000	396000	In 2020 your personal tinfoil hat theory Loki.
396000	403000	I don't know. Maybe he's going to the Coleco team and to launch that console.
403000	408000	Or Atari or Atari. Oh yeah. I forgot they had a console. Is that already out yet.
408000	415000	I don't know. It is not. It's actually on a show roll later. So stay OK. There's actually a pretty big news item with it. So stay tuned.
415000	419000	But it doesn't actually suck. Well we'll see.
419000	426000	But anyway I don't know again it doesn't the mold doesn't feel right for somebody leaving to go to the competition. You know what I mean.
426000	431000	This is this mold doesn't feel right for that. I don't know. So I don't know.
431000	435000	Let's see cause you know in chat says hope it's not for medical reasons. Hope the guy is all right. Yeah.
435000	443000	Why not sit on Twitter though like you think. I don't know. Well because people people are going to notice you know the next time Sony does a public event.
444000	451000	Plus they I think they have a responsibility to report to stockholders things that like it's not the type of thing you wouldn't put on Twitter.
451000	459000	I guess we're waiting for their shareholders meeting or can it could be the type of thing that they have to disclose it or announce it at some point.
459000	472000	I think I don't know all the rules admittedly so but I would theorize that I mean his name's on the Web site and stuff and if he doesn't work there anymore he doesn't represent them especially if it is if it does end up being a competitor thing.
473000	480000	They're going to scrub him pretty quick from all those types of places and people are going to notice that you can't just sweep a major personnel change like this under the rug.
480000	487000	So you can you can time these sorts of announcements a certain way which is most certainly what happened with Reggie fees in May.
487000	498000	You know a lot of the timing there was very deliberate but we know what happened with Reggie fees in May. Yeah he's what he what he wanted to spend more time with his growing children and he'd been in the industry long enough he kind of wanted to retire right.
498000	505000	Yeah so he and he earned it and he kind of wants to think he strikes me as the type now that's going to do the scholarly thing I bet he writes a book.
505000	511000	That's that that seems like the Reggie fees in May thing that's going to happen he's going to write a book and that's you know he I'd fucking buy it.
511000	517000	I'd buy the audio book for that for sure. Would you buy a Reggie audio book. Maybe I would anyway but we don't know what happened here.
517000	527000	You know it's kind of like that and that's the whole that's the whole kind of news worthiness of this I suppose is when you compare it to what happened with Reggie like this is very well compared to like.
527000	537000	Was it Kazari or something like that. You know what are the differences. Oh we we we had plenty of notice that Kazari Kazari was promoted before he left.
537000	547000	Yeah so he was over much more of Sony than just PlayStation at one point. And then I think just within the past couple of years did he retire and I think that was very different.
548000	560000	It should be noted and in this report I'm reading on the whole thing from Engadget. I like their blog even if they got rid of Joysticks still all those years ago but I still check in on Engadget once in a while.
560000	571000	And they do note that there has been frequent changes of leadership over at PlayStation including President Andrew House being replaced with John Corderra who then swapped roles with Jim Ryan this past February.
571000	583000	Ryan is now the front man for worldwide studios news not laden. And this is all of course gearing up for the PlayStation 5 launch. Could this have been something where he was asked to go.
583000	594000	We don't know. I mean there's that dramatic. I think there's always that kind of part of us. We're going to keep making up the same part that can't help but look when you see an accident on the side of the road.
594000	606000	Like there's just that part of us as much as we don't like to admit it that kind of wants to go like oh is it drama when in reality it may just very well be like a personal thing and endeavor and I just don't want to work here anymore.
606000	622000	Well maybe you never know. But again something like that usually wouldn't be so sudden. I don't know. So strange. And I guess this leads to kind of another side conversation you didn't even recognize the name Shawn Layden you had to see a picture of him realize who he was.
623000	635000	So how important to us as gamers are these types of executive figures. I think we've talked in the past plenty about well folks people but let's talk specifically about this way.
635000	647000	The direction that Sony has gone recently. I mean they've had good first party titles but like everything else has been kind of. So like let's see what happens.
647000	664000	I don't know. I don't really know what this how this is going to impact anything. Yeah just different for sure. Well I mean we don't really know until we see the first press conference or you know news flash or whatever that doesn't have Shawn Layden.
664000	677000	It has you know whoever's assumably this other gentleman or somebody that's going to be replacing him. Yeah. Now you know when we talk about executives certainly like you know Reggie Fils-Aime was iconic for Nintendo Doug Bowser.
677000	688000	You know still kind of getting his feet wet a little bit but I think people have been pretty receptive to Doug Bowser in many ways. And then over at Microsoft you know obviously I don't think any of us particularly cared for Don Mattrick.
688000	702000	And he kind of hosed the Xbox one. But now Phil Spencer things are going so much better. Yeah. Over there. So you know everything seems to be coming up better with Microsoft these days.
702000	714000	So yeah at least it seems like recently though with even though just in the last week or so there's been some steps towards the right direction I think on the Sony side.
715000	726000	But yeah overall this year it's been mostly kind of Microsoft making a lot of the good moves but I don't know I don't know what he does. So I really know we'll see we'll see what's different next year.
726000	735000	I mean that's kind of the way I'm not going to try to figure out what he's doing or what he left or why he left. I don't care. I don't care.
735000	748000	Going to our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network She-Hulk 10 says Sony needs help changes etc. But that's the puzzling thing to me. I have to be I have to be candid She-Hulk. I'm not sure I see it the same way.
748000	761000	I don't think Sony I didn't think Sony was in this type of position where they need help. Or is there now this is what I will give you because in the current view perspective it does seem to me Sony is still for the most part leading.
761000	771000	Yeah Nintendo and Switch is definitely like they're a factor now where in the Wii U cycle maybe we could all sleep on Nintendo a little bit for Sony Microsoft. Now we can't really sleep on Nintendo.
771000	790000	So in the current view though it feels like Sony's doing really well. The PlayStation 4 has been a really good success so far. They've had a lot of very well received titles between what God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, the PlayStation VR didn't end up being a flash in the pan which I think many people thought it might as a Sony peripheral.
790000	801000	But I don't think it's really necessarily hit the ground running either with it. I'm glad that they're still supporting it and they're planning on supporting it into you know the PlayStation 5.
801000	814000	But like I want to see them do more with it like because at the very least like let's get some new controllers for it because God we're still using the move controllers and those are old as fuck and they don't work really well.
814000	827000	So it'd be nice to get something better. And I'm you know I know that they're saying that they're going to keep the existing hardware but I can't help imagine that there's not going to be another PlayStation VR at some point that's going to be better.
827000	842000	Well let me ask this question now to you and to all of you out there in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash vog network and those of you listening on the podcast feed if you care to tweet or email us this week let me ask this question because I mentioned everything seems OK in the current view of Sony.
842000	852000	Could the concern be about the future view of Sony because you know you look to the future and again Nintendo has been creeping more and more and more in the gaming industry.
852000	865000	They've come up with this killer product and the switch and so forth. And even though in this last generation you know Microsoft has been lagging behind a little bit I think we all know that Phil Spencer has played a really good game of catch up.
865000	879000	Microsoft has positioned themselves with all these new studios who are developing games. Microsoft has this project x cloud game pass has been I assume doing pretty well for Microsoft or at least they're really pushing it whereas PlayStation Now.
879000	892000	I don't I don't feel like we're hearing as much. You know in fact I think we have a story coming up later that PlayStation Now is getting a little cheaper right. Yeah. So could the concern be about the future view of Sony.
892000	903000	It could be and definitely right now as it stands. I don't know what Microsoft and Sony have the offer for the next generation of consoles other than. Yeah the graphics will be better.
903000	914000	I don't know what they're going to offer. I mean granted with Microsoft at least I know that they've got all those studios are developing games that are probably going to be shown off at E3 this year.
914000	923000	Sony though like I don't know what they have. I don't know what they're working on. I don't know. It's all kind of just a mystery.
923000	932000	I mean I hear you like personally like and it's really weird to say because even though I own an Xbox One it's by far the least of the three consoles I play.
932000	938000	But the reality is like I am really excited for Microsoft's next console.
938000	950000	Those are words I never thought would leave my leave my mouth ever since we were talking about direct Xbox years and years ago right or the very first Xbox in the years the show started.
950000	953000	Let me say it again because I bet some of you are on the same page with me.
953000	960000	I am really excited for Microsoft's next console because I also feel like and this is why this is the why is important.
960000	966000	It has nothing necessarily to do with the Xbox One or this directly but it has to do with this is going to be the console.
966000	976000	This is going to be the punch line of Bill Spencer's leadership and everything that the chess pieces have been maneuvering for the past three years.
976000	986000	It's going to be the cloud gaming you know enabled thing and kind of the resultant of that the marriage to Windows 10 and the PC and the results into that.
986000	991000	I feel like there's a lot kind of like writing in the next Microsoft in a really exciting way.
991000	1002000	When I look at Sony it's not so much a negative but I do admit I do kind of look at the PlayStation 5 and I go okay it's five right.
1002000	1016000	It was four now it's five right. Yeah it's just it's the next increment it's it's more powerful or and you know at the end of the day what's the golden rule of gaming here at all our system is only as good as the games that are on it right.
1016000	1027000	So I mean assuming Sony continues to put out these kickass things like God of War you know our sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn is coming and last of us and you know these different franchises the Sony is does very well.
1027000	1038000	I'm not necessarily sure they have anything to worry about in that regard but maybe there's some type of concern about just like the system itself the hardware the formula starting to feel a little stale.
1038000	1049000	Maybe what Sony needs is to not release a PlayStation 5. Don't misunderstand me. Maybe it's time to release a Sony new thing here.
1049000	1060000	Sony new thing. Sony new thing. Trademark patent pending. Let me go to some of the comments with you guys in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network.
1060000	1066000	SheHulk10 sounds like might have been on the same page with us a little bit saying resting on their past future not good.
1066000	1074000	VGRealness says the thing with Sony as to why they're doing so well is circumstance. They had a head start a cheaper price and both Nintendo and Microsoft flubbed.
1075000	1090000	Next generation might not be the same case for them. The playing field will be much more leveled. I agree with that to an extent although I would add that Sony's game offerings you know they still have been able to really provide things that people just don't get as excited about on the Microsoft side.
1090000	1098000	But is that going to be the story leading into the next generation of consoles now that Microsoft has what nine new studios in their back pocket all working on something.
1098000	1108000	Maybe just we're not hearing about it now because they want to keep it a secret so that they can't counteract. And by they I mean it could be Microsoft or Sony can't counteract whatever the plan is.
1108000	1115000	And so that's why it's like let's keep it close to the chest now and figure out. We'll announce it when we're ready I guess.
1116000	1124000	PlayStation 5 is a mistake. Sony is forced into the competition. PlayStation 4 should be a 10 year console. PlayStation 5 is going to be a mess.
1124000	1137000	Well to be fair to the vision of 10 year consoles when they talk about 10 year console they kind of include the end of life in that right. I mean if you look at PlayStation 3 PlayStation 3 launched what 2006.
1138000	1148000	PlayStation 3 didn't really drop off the market until a couple of years ago. Right. Yeah. Maybe 2017. So there was a 10 year life cycle the PlayStation 3.
1148000	1156000	And I imagine PlayStation 4 will have something similar at the end of the day. Not everybody is going to be able to afford a PlayStation 5 out the gate or whatever it is Sony decides to concoct.
1157000	1162000	Now some other comments here from other chatters. Quest Buster says it's coming down to exclusives at this point.
1162000	1170000	There are some exclusives that I want on the Microsoft side but there are a lot more on the Sony side that have made me spend more time with the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 as an example.
1171000	1179000	Sia Tabiri says Sony still has Japan. It might switch up in the U.S. but Sony will still have a ton of support from Japan.
1179000	1187000	You know what. Damn good point. Microsoft cannot seem to get through in Japan. They've tried time and time again. It's not working out for them.
1187000	1192000	They tried big time with Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey and on it. But you know two games.
1193000	1198000	But did any of those studios that they purchase specialize in Japanese RPGs or anything like that?
1198000	1202000	To my knowledge no but you never know what they might be cooking up.
1202000	1205000	I'm sure they're aware of like what it is. I don't know.
1205000	1213000	Yeah. V.G. Realness says I don't think PlayStation 5 will have as quick of an adoption rate. Kind of talking into that 10 year lifespan a little bit too.
1213000	1220000	Kaijiro says maybe I will get PlayStation 5 when Grand Theft Auto 6 or the next Elder Scrolls. That's about it.
1220000	1224000	Just call me Ms. VR. That's where I will be in the next generation.
1225000	1235000	So lots and lots of great comments you guys tonight. Other comments here. Jim Sally says I can't wait for the PlayStation 5 so I can get cheap PlayStation 4 games.
1235000	1236000	There you go.
1236000	1242000	Kaijiro says PlayStation 3 was a flop. I'm talking about PlayStation 4. It's a great console to which Bobby kind of follows up.
1242000	1249000	Yeah PlayStation 3 did not flop in Japan. PlayStation 3 didn't flop when all was said and done either.
1249000	1256000	PlayStation 3 kind of flopped out the gate. They stumbled when the gun went off and everybody came out the gate.
1256000	1267000	But they kind of had more of a slow burn. I think they were able to catch up a little bit better through some of their strong exclusives and titles that came out in the PlayStation 3 later in its life.
1267000	1272000	I just think that the cell processor wasn't as powerful as they had hoped it would have been.
1272000	1286000	And Bobby says PlayStation 3 redeemed itself in the end. We'll see. It's very interesting. This whole executive departure could just be a sign of the future.
1286000	1293000	It could be nothing. It could be the guy's personal life and again I hope everything is okay with him personally. It's just video games.
1293000	1300000	I certainly don't wish him unwell or anything like that. Nor should anybody out there on the internet, on Twitter and things like that.
1300000	1311000	So I hope the guy is okay at the end of the day. But if it is a business boardroom type of decision, then I'm very curious to see the motivations behind it.
1311000	1318000	Anyway, let's move on. We're going to move on into our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about the types of games that we have been playing this week.
1318000	1320000	Loki, why don't you start us off?
1320000	1331000	So I did play more Borderlands 3. I've been playing that quite a bit. I looked at my progress and I think we had 45% through the game already.
1331000	1343000	I'm enjoying it. It's more Borderlands. I'm definitely looking forward to beating the game and starting back over again with a different class because I think it'll be fun.
1343000	1353000	I also played more Untitled Goose Game and I played a game very briefly because I started playing and I was like, no, this game looks too good.
1353000	1362000	I want to stream it and I don't want to ruin it for myself by not streaming it first. So I started playing What the Golf and it's great.
1362000	1369000	And they have even a streamer mode that's incredibly hard. So I'm going to play that. I'm going to stream it at some point.
1369000	1370000	What's the streamer mode?
1370000	1373000	I don't know because I didn't look at it because I didn't want to spoil it for myself.
1373000	1375000	Okay, but you know it's harder or something.
1375000	1384000	It says it's harder and they score you. It's supposed to be harder and they score you based on how many strokes it takes you to get through the whole thing because it's like all.
1384000	1392000	So I didn't want to ruin it for myself, but the game is silly and kind of has that. I don't know.
1392000	1399000	A lot of these games have this kind of Katamari feel to them, but this is like a really silly idea.
1399000	1409000	Ironically enough, it's almost like that time the car type of concept where it's a racing game, but it's like a puzzle.
1409000	1420000	Every level is different or broken in some way. It's kind of like What the Golf is. They tout it as a golf game for people who hate golf.
1421000	1427000	It's weird though. It's a great game and I really want to stream it, but I did play a little bit of it and it was awesome.
1427000	1430000	Fifth Dream today says I'm in the credits of What the Golf. Kickstarter thing?
1430000	1431000	Yes, I think it was.
1431000	1434000	Got it. Makes sense. Anything else?
1434000	1437000	A little bit of Pokemon Go and that was it.
1437000	1442000	Alright, my gaming week then. Yeah, I kind of say a little bit of Pokemon Go and all that stuff.
1442000	1446000	The AR world games or whatever you want to call it on cell phones.
1446000	1453000	Also, it's kind of been a bit of an MMO week. I'm continuing on Final Fantasy XIV still.
1453000	1459000	My Gunbreaker is just about to hit 77, but then I was playing a little bit of WoW Classic.
1459000	1463000	And then because I was playing WoW Classic, then the conversation kind of turned to,
1463000	1469000	Well, why not just dip back into WoW retail for a little bit, even though I was just playing in the current expansion.
1469000	1473000	And I was like, I'm going to start a new character because this is what I do.
1473000	1478000	And I was streaming the other night and I'm like, I think this is just kind of what I do in World of Warcraft.
1478000	1484000	I really like just leveling characters because then when I get to the end of the game and I'm in like the end game content and stuff,
1484000	1488000	I'm like, I have commitment issues. I don't want to raid. Like, I don't want to go that far down.
1488000	1494000	I don't want to do all that end game content. So I just kind of like, I'm going to just start from the beginning all over again and level up.
1494000	1500000	So that's where I'm at. So I started leveling in Arcane Mage. Why? I don't know. I just felt like it.
1500000	1507000	But Shane's been an influence in that regard, too. We've been leveling up together. So, you know, but then even like when he hasn't been on,
1507000	1511000	then I'm like, all right, well, you know, because we're trying to keep our characters in sync.
1511000	1516000	So I'll go play my Horde Rogue for a little bit and go level that on my own.
1516000	1519000	So it's just kind of like, all right. So that's just been a thing.
1519000	1527000	But I have been saying that probably after October dies down because I have a lot of travel coming up this month.
1527000	1532000	I'm going to be out of town for two days next week. I'm going to be out of town for three days the week after.
1532000	1539000	And then the week after that is the week I'm in Vegas. So that's why we don't have a show October 20th, because I'll be out of town at a conference there.
1539000	1547000	But I am talking about for a week at some point, maybe in early November, I'm going to have a MMOs are banned week.
1547000	1556000	I'm not going to allow myself to play MMOs for an entire week. All right. Force myself to play some of the other stuff that I need to catch up on.
1556000	1561000	You know, I'm not even talking about things like Untitled Goose Game, although that certainly is in the backlog.
1561000	1567000	But I mean, like I decided to pick up Horizon Zero Dawn because it was 15 bucks on that latest PlayStation sale.
1567000	1569000	So I really need to sit down and start playing that.
1569000	1577000	So I'm going to I'm going to be giving myself a self-imposed ban on MMOs coming up in the near future, just for a week to catch up on other games.
1577000	1584000	But also, the other thing about traveling is that I can't really play, you know, anything but Nintendo Switch when I'm traveling.
1584000	1588000	Hey, you can get your progress in Legend of Zelda.
1588000	1596000	Exactly. I can finally finish the Zelda Link's Awakening, that whole thing. I can finish that and maybe some Mario Maker as well.
1596000	1600000	Although hotel Wi-Fi can be hit and miss. So I kind of just have to be the single player.
1600000	1607000	Yeah, my son keeps making levels for me to play in Mario Maker and because he thinks it's really funny to make impossible levels.
1607000	1611000	And I don't know. It's just cute.
1612000	1617000	Bonz006 in chat says you could play a PSP while on the road. I don't even know if my PSP works anymore.
1617000	1620000	I do still have two PlayStation Vita's, though.
1620000	1621000	A what?
1621000	1624000	Play... Vita? You remember that? Back in the day, V-I-T-E.
1624000	1627000	See that little guy over there sitting on the shelf? That's a PlayStation Vita.
1627000	1628000	Oh, I thought that was a PSP.
1628000	1629000	No, no.
1629000	1630000	No, I'm kidding. I know what a Vita is.
1630000	1632000	That is my heaven's word, Vita.
1632000	1634000	Yeah, I remember you had two of them.
1634000	1635000	Remember that?
1635000	1642000	So, um, yeah. So I could play the Vita. I don't know what I'd play on it. But I could play PSP games on the Vita, actually.
1642000	1647000	I have one of those PlayStation TVs somewhere. Buried somewhere.
1647000	1653000	Actually, that's what I should do is I should fire up that Vita. Just convert it to an American Vita or whatever.
1653000	1658000	Sign into my account and download, like, some of those PSP games. Like the Final Fantasy IV reimagining and stuff.
1658000	1661000	That would actually be... I might... You know what? You might have inspired something.
1661000	1664000	I might actually charge up that Vita and play that when I'm on the road.
1664000	1673000	I was gonna say, you know, like, you have, you know, you know all those, like, PlayStation Plus games that you have back when they used to offer, like, the Vita and the PSP games.
1673000	1678000	I have a library of stuff that I don't even know what's out there. Like, I probably have all these Vita games that I'm unaware of.
1678000	1683000	Like, oh, hey, I got all this stuff I can play on my PlayStation.
1683000	1687000	Now to just find a charging cable for that. But I think it's just a standard USB.
1687000	1688000	I think, yeah.
1688000	1691000	It's the same thing you charge your controllers with on a PlayStation 4. So, yeah. There you go.
1691000	1698000	Alright. Anyway, so, well, to be continued. I'm out of town for two days this week, so I'll be doing portable gaming of some type.
1698000	1703000	While I'm... I don't want to say where I'm going, but it's not a very exciting place.
1704000	1711000	I'll message you later, Loki. Alright, anyway. There's... Let me put it this way. There's gonna be nothing else for me to do there.
1711000	1713000	So, wait, wait, Loki. Loki. Loki.
1715000	1716000	Ah. Yeah, right?
1716000	1717000	Yeah.
1718000	1727000	Anyway, Bonds006 says, what about Ingress? Maybe. I don't know. Alright. Anyhow, let's move on.
1727000	1733000	Let's get into some other gaming stories and what's going on around the gaming industry. Loki, start us off.
1733000	1740000	So, this is unfortunate. Apparently, the developer of Mario and Luigi, that series, AlphaDream, they've gone bankrupt.
1740000	1749000	So, of course, they were originally known as AlphaStar and it had been a team of former Square employees.
1749000	1751000	That's right. Square, not Square Enix.
1753000	1758000	Apparently, I guess, after releasing some of these... I don't know if they've done anything recently.
1758000	1767000	The last one that they did was Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga plus Bowser's Minions, Mario and Luigi, Bowser's Inside Story plus Bowser Jr. Story.
1767000	1773000	I guess this is the last game they did. Not sure why they went bankrupt, but apparently, that's the case.
1773000	1781000	They were 400 million yen in debt, I guess, due to sluggish revenue in the last few years.
1782000	1785000	So, that's unfortunate because those games are pretty good.
1785000	1795000	Yeah, those games were pretty good. Although, I have to admit, I kind of started to lose track of them because I kind of felt like it was kind of like the same formula again.
1795000	1800000	I know, it's bad because a lot of fans of those games are going to not like that I said that, but I don't know.
1800000	1804000	If you asked me to name all the games in the series, I couldn't do it.
1804000	1810000	As much as I did enjoy the ones that I played and thought it was a cute and clever little series, but it's still sad to hear.
1810000	1815000	I thought those games did well enough that I'm kind of surprised to hear this has happened.
1816000	1822000	I don't know. I'm surprised they haven't... I know some of those came... Have they ported any of those to the Switch?
1822000	1827000	I know that you can download some of those, and I think those are our 3DS, but I'm surprised they haven't ported.
1827000	1832000	3DS, yes, for sure. Switch, I don't think so, which is a bummer.
1832000	1833000	Yeah.
1833000	1838000	Unless somebody in chat wants to correct, but I don't believe any of those games are on the Switch right now.
1838000	1842000	Well, $3.7 million in debt, or 400 million yen, that's not that much.
1842000	1850000	Can Nintendo absorb that with their vast amount of money and just bring another... have another first-party studio under their wing? I don't know.
1850000	1854000	Really, Sears owes, like, 20 times that amount of money to somebody.
1854000	1855000	I mean, like, in the print...
1855000	1860000	Oh my god, wait. Quick aside. I'm sorry, I have to. So, I went to Sears this week because...
1860000	1861000	Where?
1861000	1863000	At Arden, because it's still over there.
1863000	1864000	Oh, I was going to say, there's like...
1864000	1871000	Because, you're going to love this, Loki, I was at Arden Mall because, count the number of cameras on the back of that boy, that's right.
1871000	1875000	There's three cameras on that, so you know what that means. So, I was at Arden Mall anyway.
1875000	1884000	And then the topic came up where it was, hey, we should go... because we needed to replace luggage because Alan was on a business trip.
1884000	1891000	He went out to Denver and a certain airline carrier, who I otherwise really like, really shredded the shit out of his luggage.
1891000	1894000	And, like, we can't use it anymore because they, like, broke it.
1894000	1898000	And I wish he had said something within 24 hours because then they would have had to replace it.
1898000	1902000	But that's another story. So, long story short, we had to replace luggage.
1902000	1908000	So, I was like, well, like, you know, you can go to the fancy luggage places in the malls, but those places are so freaking expensive, right?
1908000	1912000	But then I was like, well, what about Sears or JCPenney? They sell luggage, right?
1912000	1914000	So, we went to Sears. Oh, my God.
1914000	1917000	Tuesday morning. You should go there. They have tons of luggage.
1917000	1920000	Oh, do they? Well, we went to Sears. No, we actually found something at Sears.
1920000	1924000	We found a gigantic piece of luggage, like, exactly what we needed for, like, 50 bucks.
1924000	1925000	Oh, yeah.
1925000	1927000	That was less than what we paid at Target. You know what I mean?
1927000	1928000	Yeah.
1928000	1933000	Like, I was like, dang. So, for one, they're having to, like, really, you know, sell things, like, you know.
1933000	1938000	And I'm like, well, maybe this is a piece of shit luggage. I don't know. It looks nice. It seemed to, you know, do whatever.
1938000	1942000	I mean, it's not, like, leather. It's not a fucking coach bag or something, but it gets the job done.
1942000	1944000	It's going to get shredded anyways, so, I mean.
1944000	1950000	Exactly. The south, excuse me, Nameless Airlines is going to shred the bag again anyway.
1951000	1960000	But anyway, but we were in there. It was, like, empty, sad, and they were down to one register because it was, like, 30 minutes before closing.
1960000	1964000	And so, we go to the register. There's, like, 10 people in line and, like, two people checking out.
1964000	1969000	I swear to God, I was like, can we just scan this barcode and buy it on Amazon? Because I've, like, had it.
1969000	1972000	I, like, don't. We did wait and we bought it, but I'm like, no.
1972000	1978000	I ever remember joking to Alan. I was like, no wonder this place is going bankrupt. Like, they don't know how to run it.
1979000	1982000	Anyway, sorry. I had to do a quick aside.
1982000	1986000	But yes, how about the other, the Sears of gaming?
1987000	1991000	I was like, when I thought you said you were going to Sears, I was like, to the Halloween store?
1991000	1996000	Because that's what, that's what Sears become lately. It's a Halloween store.
1996000	1999000	No, I think there's, like, one Sears left in Sacramento, but Lord knows how much.
1999000	2001000	Yeah, the other one, the other one is becoming much better.
2001000	2010000	Yeah, there's going to be a round one in the movie theater, which, like, aside here, like, I get round one in movie theater,
2010000	2015000	but I don't understand how the movie theater is going to be on the second story, whereas the round one is going to be on the bottom.
2015000	2021000	You know, I was like, I guess everything nowadays is, like, the stadium seating, but, like, I just, I can't imagine,
2021000	2024000	like, you normally would think that those would be flopped.
2024000	2026000	Well, maybe they're going to have more space.
2026000	2027000	Maybe, I guess.
2027000	2031000	Some of those, like, super big screens, because the Metreon, same way, right, in San Francisco?
2031000	2032000	True.
2032000	2035000	The Metreon has the movie theater up on the highest floor, and I think that's because some of those screens.
2035000	2040000	Yeah, and everything's stadium seating nowadays, so it's not, it's not, like, sunk into the ground anymore.
2040000	2045000	Yeah, that's, that's what's up. Because, yeah, the, the Metreon, speaking of, like, Sony things from the past,
2045000	2049000	the Metreon in San Francisco is, like, nothing. It's, it's Target is what it is.
2049000	2052000	It's, like, Target, Chipotle, and there's a movie theater up on the top floor.
2052000	2055000	Like, it's nothing what it used to be back in the day.
2055000	2059000	But back in the day, when this show, you know, was first starting, that was, like, Sony headquarters,
2059000	2065000	and there was a fucking nice Sony store on the first floor, like, back when there was a Sony store,
2065000	2067000	and it was really cool, and then it's, like, the Sony movie theater.
2067000	2069000	Do they still have the Walk of Fame there?
2069000	2070000	Oh, no, they took that out a lot.
2070000	2071000	Aw.
2071000	2073000	Yeah, no, it's, it's part, because it's part of Target.
2073000	2076000	Target, like, I'm telling you, Metreon is now Target.
2076000	2082000	We went to Target yesterday, and they've remodeled Target. They've, like, rebranded them, and now they're really weird.
2082000	2085000	Yeah, they're a little, they're trying to be more boutique-y, like a JCPenney or something.
2085000	2088000	It's weird. They had a huge section for Frozen 2.
2088000	2094000	Well, that's what they do now. They have, like, sections, instead of, like, here's clothing, here's electronics,
2094000	2100000	here's housewares and stuff. It's, like, here's Frozen 2, here's Star Wars, here's some other bullshit.
2100000	2104000	You know, it's, like, but I'm just trying to find this. Good luck.
2104000	2110000	Like, my kids are trying to find, because the Switch console there, the demo kiosk wasn't working,
2110000	2116000	so they're all, where's the 3DS? I'm, like, I don't know. I think they got rid of it.
2116000	2122000	Well, I think the answer is that it's the 3DS, and Nintendo is quietly sharing.
2122000	2123000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good point.
2123000	2127000	Yeah, I think, I think it's more about that than about Target, Loki. I think it's that the 3DS is...
2127000	2128000	Good point, yes.
2128000	2130000	...quietly being taken out back.
2130000	2133000	No, what 3DS?
2133000	2138000	They're cooking in a real nice meal. That's, uh, that's kinda, I don't think...
2138000	2142000	Come here, boy. There's something in the bushes over there. I'll have to take a look.
2142000	2148000	Look at the flowers. I think, I think, uh, I don't think that's a Target thing, Loki.
2148000	2150000	Ah, that makes sense. I didn't think of that.
2150000	2152000	All right, let me now...
2152000	2157000	All right, let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about something going on in Microsoft's world.
2157000	2162000	Microsoft filing an interesting patent. Now, here's the thing about patents. They may be nothing.
2162000	2164000	Yes, Illumeroom, remember that?
2164000	2167000	Oh, man. Actually, Illumeroom kinda sounded cool, though.
2167000	2173000	It was cool, but, like, it's just completely unfeasible, you know, with the projector system that you would need and...
2173000	2179000	How long until the patent runs out? How long before VOG presents the Illumeroom?
2179000	2183000	How long until that patent runs out and someone else can snatch it up?
2183000	2185000	Because I'll buy it for YYR.
2185000	2187000	Illumeroom?
2187000	2191000	The pixel shit is literally everywhere.
2191000	2192000	Surrounds you.
2192000	2193000	It's coming out of the wall.
2193000	2195000	All right, anyway.
2195000	2199000	Microsoft has put in a patent for a floor mat.
2199000	2205000	So, the interesting idea about this floor mat is that it would kind of be a very specified zone,
2205000	2208000	so that you're not, like, running into furniture, couches.
2208000	2213000	I mean, you might still run into Mr. Smoosh, because he'll run on that floor mat, but you never know.
2213000	2216000	But it's a virtual reality related floor mat.
2216000	2222000	But the interesting thing about this is that, wait a minute, this shows that Microsoft may still have an interest in virtual reality
2222000	2226000	when I think many folks thought, oh, they were going to go towards HoloLens.
2226000	2230000	But then, of course, you know, I think we kind of realized, oh, maybe HoloLens...
2230000	2235000	Even though they showed Minecraft at 103, I think HoloLens is not so much a gaming thing now.
2235000	2240000	Like, for tracking, though, that just seems like a bad idea.
2240000	2245000	Like, that's like an idea I would think of before I thought of inside-out tracking.
2245000	2250000	It's like, well, I'm going to put a floor mat down, and that way we don't have to worry about tracking where the player is,
2250000	2254000	because the floor mat will know where it is. But it's giant. It is fucking huge.
2254000	2262000	Whereas, like, inside-out tracking, I think, is much more contained, smaller, and I don't need to buy a goddamn floor mat that's, like, huge.
2262000	2270000	Now, in the little patent, though, what's also very interesting about this is that there's a little camera device on top of the television.
2270000	2273000	There's a little 162 pointing at it. It's a Kinect.
2273000	2280000	So, that's the other weird thing about this, because speaking about, you know, sunsetting things and leaving them out back and so forth,
2280000	2285000	we kind of thought Microsoft had distanced themselves from Kinect for gaming.
2285000	2290000	Yes, I realize Kinect is still a thing in, you know, medicine and, you know, other types of...
2290000	2300000	It's going to be... I mean, granted, technology for cameras has gotten way, way, way better, but that's going to be a hard sell if they try to sell a Kinect 3 type of thing.
2301000	2304000	Everyone's going to be like, fuck that, I ain't buying that shit.
2304000	2314000	So, anyway. So, I guess there would be, like, in this application, there'd be a start position that you stand on, and then you go into VR, and there's pressure sensors in the mat,
2314000	2321000	and there could be haptic vibrations in the mat. So, imagine, like, you get shot, and it's going to shake the ground or something.
2321000	2326000	That actually kind of sounds like it might be kind of cool. So, I don't know. Like, as long as it's not, like, earthquake and you fall on your ass.
2326000	2328000	That's a neat idea.
2328000	2331000	It's a neat idea. I'd have to see it in motion.
2331000	2340000	But I just don't know, like, where that would add value to, like, the amount of, like, haptic sensors that would need to be all over the place in there.
2340000	2346000	Like, for a floor mat that looks like that's a huge floor mat. I just can't imagine that would be a thing.
2346000	2351000	Well, now, Microsoft did say that, or excuse me, in the patent, they haven't said anything officially on this,
2351000	2360000	but if you don't think you have enough square foots to put this thing down, apparently the mat may be interlocking floor tiles,
2360000	2367000	and you could set it up in a way that works for you. That could be very interesting if, like, maybe you can do, like, a...
2367000	2370000	I think it's just, it's the wrong approach, but that's a cool idea that they came up with.
2370000	2376000	Yeah, we'll see. I mean, again, it's a patent. It might not mean a damn thing, but it is still fun to think about.
2376000	2379000	You can put it in one of those VR gyms.
2379000	2386000	It reminds us that Microsoft may do something with VR in the next Xbox, when they haven't really talked a lot about it.
2386000	2394000	Now, of course, Bobby, he loves his VR. Bobby Blackwolf is in the chat, and always quick to point out the things on VR,
2394000	2398000	saying, Microsoft has a VR headset. They call it Windows Mixed Reality.
2398000	2403000	Microsoft never abandoned Kinect. They just retooled it for business uses. Well, I kind of did say that.
2403000	2407000	They even finally put out a true dev kit. Well, I did, I think I made it pretty clear.
2407000	2413000	I said for gaming, but Kinect is still a thing. But it would be very interesting if Kinect came back to gaming,
2413000	2419000	kind of in the way, I mean, when you think about PlayStation VR, I think we thought Sony was done with Move,
2419000	2422000	and then they kind of repurposed, and we all loved that, right?
2422000	2426000	It was like, oh, I don't have to buy new controllers, because I happened to invest in the Move early on,
2426000	2433000	so I kind of had those already. So maybe, and it's a big maybe, bolded, underlined, italicized,
2433000	2439000	you know, if the Kinect is to be a thing with VR, maybe existing Kinects of a certain type would work.
2439000	2445000	I would want that to happen. Like, I would want them to be brand new tech,
2445000	2452000	because like, the camera tech alone is just going to be so much better now than it was in the previous Kinect.
2452000	2457000	But at the end of the day, this is all wank and speculating based off of a patent,
2457000	2461000	which, you know, most of the time ends up being nothing, as we mentioned before,
2462000	2468000	Oh my god! The next Xbox is the floor mat. The whole system is the floor mat.
2469000	2474000	What was that? Was that Nintendo or something, where it was like, it used to be the console is this.
2474000	2477000	The Nintendo Revolution is the Wii.
2477000	2479000	The helmet. It's a giant helmet.
2479000	2480000	Was it Nintendo Revolution?
2480000	2483000	Yeah, that was the revolution, the concept video.
2483000	2486000	It ended up being the Wii. It was like, nobody knew what it was, there was all these rumors about...
2486000	2488000	It's a VR headset.
2488000	2492000	You put it on the table, and Princess Leia shows up, and that's how you play your games.
2492000	2495000	Like, there was all this crazy shit about the Wii back in the day.
2495000	2497000	I swear to god, that was the thing about the Wii, right?
2497000	2499000	That was the holographic images that it projected.
2499000	2501000	And then the Luma Room was right around that same time.
2501000	2503000	They had a bunch of weird stuff.
2503000	2504000	Remember that?
2504000	2506000	Yeah, I remember. We were dumb.
2506000	2508000	People were dumb.
2509000	2511000	Alright, let's move on.
2511000	2515000	We have a cool little story about somebody from Nintendo, right?
2515000	2518000	Yes. So, this is pretty cool.
2518000	2524000	So, Reggie is actually being inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame.
2524000	2527000	Now, I'm not sure which hall of fame that is, because there's so many of them.
2527000	2529000	But, he's being inducted into that one.
2529000	2531000	Oh, I'm sorry, that's the one in Iowa, that's right.
2531000	2533000	They're the ones that first...
2533000	2535000	Oh god, is that the one that's not even near a major airport?
2535000	2537000	Yes, they're the ones that...
2537000	2540000	Where like, Walter Day is like, no, this is the capital of video games,
2540000	2544000	and because I talk the loudest, that's what you're all gonna go with, right?
2544000	2546000	Yes, that's pretty much what happened.
2546000	2547000	Am I wrong?
2547000	2552000	Yes, it's Ottumwa, Iowa is where it's in.
2552000	2555000	They established it in 2010.
2556000	2558000	We called it first, though, I think.
2558000	2560000	We said that we're gonna be the Video Game Hall of Fame.
2560000	2561000	Did we?
2561000	2563000	Well, we called it at the same time.
2563000	2567000	When they announced it, we double announced it, so it doesn't count.
2568000	2574000	So apparently, they inducted several Guinness World Record holders.
2574000	2575000	See, right there, come on.
2575000	2578000	Right there, that is why it can't be the Hall of Fame.
2578000	2581000	You can't put Guinness World Record holders there.
2583000	2588000	So, anyways, Reggie Fils-Aime, though, has been inducted into it.
2588000	2591000	And, that's awesome.
2591000	2594000	So, are you gonna go?
2594000	2595000	Is he gonna go?
2595000	2598000	That's the question I want to know the answer to.
2598000	2599000	Is he gonna go?
2599000	2604000	I don't think he went, because he did make a video about it.
2604000	2605000	Oh, he made a video.
2605000	2609000	But it's the Walter Day Lifetime Achievement Award is what he got.
2609000	2611000	Wait, Walter Day named the award?
2611000	2612000	Okay.
2612000	2613000	Okay.
2613000	2614000	All right.
2614000	2615000	Neat.
2615000	2616000	Yeah.
2616000	2620000	So, neat that he got it, but I ain't going to Iowa.
2621000	2623000	I wonder how many visitors you have.
2623000	2624000	Have they published visitation numbers?
2624000	2628000	Like, how many visitors a year come through the video game Hall of Fame?
2628000	2629000	I don't know.
2629000	2630000	Let's take a look and see if they do.
2630000	2631000	I bet they don't.
2631000	2634000	Low-key, I have to admit, I kind of want to go.
2634000	2640000	So, here's what they, yeah, so this year they inducted, let's see here.
2640000	2645000	Have any of our listeners been to the video game Hall of Fame in Iowa?
2645000	2647000	Have any of you been there?
2647000	2650000	So, some of the things that they inducted this year.
2650000	2653000	So, Reggie Fils-Aime for the Walter Day Lifetime Achievement Award.
2653000	2659000	Community Action Award, they gave it to Don Mack, who's founder of Galloping Ghost Productions,
2659000	2661000	and he has the Galloping Ghost Arcade.
2661000	2663000	Well, that's a pretty big arcade.
2663000	2664000	I recognize that.
2664000	2671000	The video game Palooza, and they're like a STEM organization.
2671000	2672000	A YouTube channel?
2672000	2673000	No, no, no.
2673000	2674000	It's like a STEM organization.
2674000	2675000	Okay.
2675000	2676000	Industry leader.
2676000	2678000	They had game developers.
2678000	2682000	They gave it to Fortnite, Smash Brothers Melee.
2682000	2684000	Assassin's Creed, they inducted in there.
2684000	2687000	Doom, Super Mario 64, Street Fighter II.
2687000	2690000	Actually, they said Street Fighter franchise, but whatever.
2690000	2693000	Ms. Pac-Man, Computer Space, Tetris, and Galaga.
2693000	2699000	They have 90s gamer, 2000 gamer, Golden Age gamers.
2699000	2701000	I don't know, no podcasts on there.
2701000	2709000	We'll change our opinion of you once, you know, you contact us, but like, in the meantime.
2709000	2711000	Yeah, I'm thinking our chances are real good.
2712000	2713000	I'll go.
2713000	2714000	No, you know what?
2714000	2715000	Yeah, induct us.
2715000	2716000	I'll go.
2716000	2717000	I'll go.
2717000	2718000	Why not?
2718000	2721000	How hard can it be to get to, what is it, Otuma?
2721000	2723000	How hard can it be to get there?
2723000	2724000	Is it connected by a freeway?
2724000	2725000	I don't know.
2725000	2726000	Highway?
2728000	2731000	Yeah, in fact, they did the induction ceremony this weekend.
2731000	2732000	Oh.
2733000	2735000	So, yeah.
2735000	2736000	Well.
2736000	2737000	Good times.
2737000	2738000	All right.
2738000	2740000	They even have a Facebook event for it.
2740000	2742000	So that's how you know it's legit.
2742000	2743000	Okay.
2743000	2745000	Yeah, all right.
2745000	2747000	Well, we'll have to plan a trip out there someday.
2747000	2748000	All right.
2748000	2749000	No.
2749000	2751000	Anyhow, let's move on, shall we, to the next story?
2751000	2753000	I don't want to go there.
2753000	2754000	Super Mario Maker 2.
2754000	2758000	So you may remember when it launched, one of the things that people were asking is like,
2758000	2762000	hey, you know, this playing with friends thing is kind of cool, but I got to have them all
2762000	2764000	in my house in order to play with them.
2764000	2767000	Why is there no online matchmaking?
2767000	2768000	Well, now there is.
2768000	2774000	So they've added online matchmaking with friends, and you can actually now challenge,
2774000	2779000	you know, the global challenge levels that they have.
2779000	2787000	They have multiplayer co-op, multiplayer versus, and you can create a room or join a room as well.
2787000	2788000	So that's kind of cool.
2788000	2792000	And then, of course, the nearby play is still there as well.
2792000	2793000	And, yeah.
2793000	2794000	So that's neat.
2794000	2795000	Good.
2795000	2797000	It's a reason to definitely fire up Mario Maker 2 again.
2797000	2798000	I wish I'd done that this week.
2798000	2804000	But, yeah, I forgot that this is something that kind of went into the game until it was
2804000	2805000	a little too late and it was showtime.
2805000	2809000	But I think it'll be a really fun stream to do with a friend or two, you know, go in there
2809000	2812000	and, yeah, I really wish the feature had been there when the game launched.
2812000	2816000	So I'm kind of curious out there, those of you listening, are you guys still playing
2816000	2817000	Mario Maker 2?
2817000	2820000	Like, you know, the first one seemed like it had legs that went on for a very long time,
2820000	2824000	but I feel like the second one, I don't know if it's because of the new Zelda game that
2824000	2828000	came out not long after or what have you, but I feel like not as many people really
2828000	2829000	talking about this one.
2829000	2831000	I still feel like the game was strong.
2831000	2832000	It was a good game.
2832000	2839000	But I feel like I'm not hearing as much about this second game as I was the first game.
2839000	2842000	Or maybe people found the formula tired the second time around.
2842000	2843000	I'm not sure.
2843000	2844000	I still enjoyed it.
2844000	2845000	Yeah, I don't know.
2845000	2848000	Like, it seems like some of the stuff that they I wish they had not removed, like the
2848000	2853000	different Meebo skins and stuff like that that they had.
2853000	2855000	So that's kind of lame, but I don't know.
2855000	2859000	I haven't really been into it like the first one.
2859000	2862000	Bobby Blackwell, who seems to be the only chatter right now.
2862000	2863000	Y'all doing OK?
2863000	2864000	Knock, knock.
2864000	2870000	Bobby in chat says, I stopped playing Mario Maker 2, but we'll open it back up.
2870000	2872000	So, yeah, it's a reason to go revisit it.
2872000	2873000	So that's always nice.
2873000	2876000	That's the nice thing about the post patches.
2876000	2880000	You know, say what you will about these patches that deliver content after the game has been
2880000	2884000	out, especially when it's like fixing bugs that should have been gone in the first place.
2884000	2888000	But when they add new things like this is doing, it's always a nice little treat, nice
2888000	2890000	little reason to go back and visit the game, right?
2890000	2891000	Yeah.
2891000	2892000	Yeah.
2892000	2893000	So I'll definitely have to do that at some moment.
2893000	2894000	So.
2894000	2895000	All right.
2895000	2897000	So let's move on and talk about I kind of referenced this a little earlier in the show,
2897000	2901000	but the price of PlayStation Now has dropped.
2901000	2906000	So PlayStation Now's price is now ten dollars a month and they've added some new games of
2906000	2907000	it.
2907000	2911000	Earlier this week, Sony cut the twenty dollar a month subscription fee down to ten dollars
2911000	2912000	a month.
2912000	2916000	I don't know if this could be in response to all these cheap deals people are getting
2916000	2917000	on Microsoft Game Pass.
2917000	2920000	We don't really know the motivation for it.
2920000	2923000	We just know that the price did come down.
2923000	2928000	And of course, with that, Sony actually added some games to it, including God of War.
2928000	2929000	That's a pretty big deal.
2929000	2930000	Grand Theft Auto 5.
2930000	2931000	That's a very big deal.
2931000	2935000	Infamous Second Son and Uncharted 4.
2935000	2937000	They're saying this is on for a limited time, though.
2937000	2942000	They're just saying these four games are available on the service through January 2020.
2942000	2946000	And they're saying they're going to rotate games in and out on a regular basis.
2946000	2948000	It's a I find that a little weird.
2948000	2952000	I mean, I get it was something more third party like Grand Theft Auto 5, I suppose.
2952000	2955000	But it does seem weird to be like I feel like God of War is a game they're going to end
2955000	2958000	up giving away on PlayStation Plus next year anyway.
2958000	2959000	Yeah.
2959000	2963000	And Infamous Infamous Second Son was that's they are super old and they did get that way
2963000	2964000	a long time ago.
2964000	2969000	So here's my thing with this is that is kind of where they're lacking versus the whole
2969000	2974000	Game Pass stuff, because Game Pass, it's all first party is included with that like day
2974000	2975000	one.
2975000	2976000	It's right in there.
2976000	2978000	Whereas this like, oh, we're rotating those first parties in.
2978000	2980000	I think that's a mistake.
2980000	2982000	Like, I'm still not interested in this.
2982000	2988000	Yeah, I got to admit, I'm not still really sold on this idea, especially because I have
2988000	2991000	the Microsoft one right now that I got that deal with.
2991000	2996000	So I'm not particularly feeling motivated to get this PlayStation one.
2996000	2997000	You're right.
2997000	3002000	If they were maybe adding games to it day one or maybe things a little more recent,
3002000	3003000	I might be more into it.
3003000	3007000	Well, most of the thing with Game Pass I'd like to is that you can you don't have to
3007000	3009000	well, they don't have streaming for one.
3009000	3012000	It's you download the game and then you play it.
3012000	3013000	And that's that's it.
3013000	3018000	But like I get it, like if you're you know, you can't do that with PlayStation three games
3018000	3020000	because it's streaming it.
3020000	3023000	It doesn't play PlayStation three games natively anyways.
3023000	3025000	So I get that there's that there.
3025000	3031000	But I just don't think, you know, cycling in PlayStation four games, especially first
3031000	3033000	party stuff is a good idea.
3033000	3035000	I think they should just keep adding to the libraries.
3035000	3039000	Now, Bobby wants to point out the big thing on this is that you can get it without having
3039000	3040000	a PlayStation four.
3040000	3043000	You can play all the games on your PC.
3043000	3045000	So that is, you know, because that is cool.
3045000	3049000	Microsoft has a different list for PC versus Xbox one.
3049000	3050000	I mean, there's a lot a lot of similar.
3050000	3053000	Well, true are different, but that's comparing different services.
3053000	3059000	This is basically be like comparing X cloud to this, whereas this is games pass to this.
3059000	3061000	So, yeah, I do see an advantage to that.
3061000	3062000	That is kind of nice.
3062000	3068000	But still, I don't I'm not really interested right now because there's not anything I would
3068000	3071000	want to pay nine ninety nine a month for.
3071000	3073000	I have so many damn games in PlayStation anyways.
3073000	3078000	Yeah, I feel like I'm more interested about how is this going to tie into PlayStation
3078000	3079000	five?
3079000	3084000	Like this just kind of feels like, you know, PlayStation four little like, you know, goodbye
3084000	3086000	gift or what have you.
3086000	3091000	But on PlayStation five, I'm really curious to see how Sony is going to, you know, integrate
3091000	3093000	something like PlayStation now into PlayStation five.
3093000	3094000	We'll see.
3094000	3095000	So.
3095000	3096000	All right.
3096000	3098000	Well, let's move on.
3098000	3099000	Loki.
3099000	3102000	Sorry, I was looking up how to fly to.
3102000	3104000	What's the closest airport?
3104000	3105000	St. Louis.
3105000	3110000	So then you have to go to the Kirksville Regional Airport, which is an hour flight.
3110000	3111000	Wait.
3111000	3115000	So you have to fly to St. Louis and then another hour flight to a regional airport.
3115000	3116000	Yes.
3116000	3118000	There isn't just some airport closer.
3118000	3120000	No, there's not.
3120000	3121000	Wow.
3121000	3122000	OK.
3122000	3123000	Yeah.
3123000	3127000	And they mentioned below average leg room so that you know, that's going to be a comfortable
3127000	3128000	flight to.
3128000	3129000	That's awesome.
3129000	3130000	Thanks.
3130000	3132000	So that's going to be a no for me.
3132000	3136000	Unfortunately, I will not be flying there anytime soon.
3136000	3141000	So this is a game that I know we've always heard like rumors that, oh, yeah, they're
3141000	3142000	working on it.
3142000	3143000	They're working on it.
3143000	3148000	Bully two and bully two was supposed to be like a planned sequel to the original game.
3148000	3152000	I know there's always been rumors that like each year, oh, they're going to announce bully
3152000	3153000	two.
3153000	3154000	They're going to announce it.
3154000	3160000	Apparently, it was something that they did start development on, but it actually ended
3160000	3163000	development about 18 months later.
3163000	3171000	So they said that sometime between, I guess, 2010, the end of 2013, Rockstar New England
3171000	3177000	spent about a year and 18 months or a year between a year and 18 months working up the
3177000	3182000	concept, but apparently just never really got off the ground.
3182000	3191000	They said they had built a very small vertical slice of the game that was complete, but it
3191000	3198000	was built with the Rage engine, which is being used for Grand Theft Auto IV and V in the
3198000	3204000	Red Dead Redemption games, but it just never kind of got out of that vertical slice.
3204000	3210000	But probably they found out, hey, we're going to have a lot of money being made.
3210000	3214000	Actually, what I think happened is you have like Grand Theft Auto V comes out, and they've
3214000	3220000	made so much money off of just the constant updates to the online services and offering
3220000	3226000	different bits of content for that, and then now Red Dead Redemption 2 adding stuff to
3226000	3227000	that.
3227000	3230000	They're making so much money off those that they probably don't need to make a bully two
3230000	3235000	type of game because the amount of money that they're going to get on return is going to
3235000	3241000	be much smaller than if they just spend time developing more content for those games that
3241000	3243000	are already out there.
3243000	3247000	So that's unfortunate that it's not coming out, although to be honest, I never played the
3247000	3250000	original, although I heard it's good, and I have it.
3250000	3255000	I haven't actually gotten around to playing it, so I will have to maybe check that out
3255000	3259000	someday, but I guess we won't get a sequel.
3259000	3262000	I'm kind of surprised it's a Rockstar game you haven't played.
3262000	3264000	Well, there's that in table tennis, but I haven't played Rockstar.
3264000	3265000	I haven't played table tennis.
3265000	3266000	All right.
3266000	3271000	But anyway, going to some comments from chat, sj100matt says, I don't think it's the right
3271000	3275000	time for a bully game given the current climate when it comes to cyberbullying.
3275000	3278000	So maybe that was part of the reason why they didn't really want to go through with it.
3278000	3279000	I don't know.
3279000	3284000	Rockstar, I'm not really sure, would be one that kind of shy away from that stuff.
3284000	3289000	So I could see them still doing it, but I just think it was less about the ethics of
3289000	3293000	it and more about we're just not going to make as much money as we can with Grand Theft
3293000	3294000	Auto 5.
3294000	3297000	I mean, they're still making money off of Grand Theft Auto 5 and that came out how many
3297000	3298000	years ago?
3298000	3299000	Like five years now.
3299000	3301000	Almost five years.
3301000	3305000	So I think that, no, actually, no, it was even more than five years ago.
3305000	3306000	It was a long time.
3306000	3311000	Interesting conversation in chat because Bobby Blackwolf says, yet untitled goose game is
3311000	3312000	a bestseller.
3312000	3317000	Untitled goose game is literally about bullying.
3317000	3322000	You are being kind of a little asshole goose that honk.
3322000	3324000	And then everybody happened to notice.
3324000	3327000	Of course, Mr. Smoosh came in here and was doing his own honking.
3327000	3332000	So Dad had to go take care of that and put him in timeout for a little bit.
3332000	3333000	Yeah.
3333000	3334000	Yeah.
3334000	3335000	So.
3335000	3339000	Oh, well, I guess we just won't get that game.
3339000	3341000	Pod Culture says I'm waiting for untitled smoosh game.
3341000	3344000	You're a cat that disrupts a podcast.
3344000	3346000	Pretty, pretty, pretty good concept.
3346000	3347000	Yeah.
3347000	3349000	Just add that one to the list, I suppose.
3349000	3350000	All right.
3350000	3351000	Let's move on.
3351000	3352000	Let's move on.
3352000	3355000	Talk about other big projects coming up on Nintendo's side.
3355000	3356000	Yep.
3356000	3359000	So one game that we're going to be getting here in probably a couple of weeks here is
3359000	3361000	Overwatch on the Switch.
3361000	3369000	It is going to be 30 FPS and they have no amiibo support planned for it because why
3369000	3370000	would they?
3370000	3373000	I mean, they're not going to give away any cosmetics on that.
3373000	3380000	So, yeah, no amiibo support and 30 FPS, which 30 FPS.
3380000	3384000	I want to say they talked about that before because that's not really a new thing.
3384000	3385000	Yeah.
3385000	3386000	I remember that coming up.
3386000	3387000	The hardware.
3387000	3388000	So.
3388000	3390000	And this is kind of cool, too.
3390000	3395000	Apparently, Overwatch, the folks behind it, they want to get an Overwatch character into
3395000	3396000	Smash Brothers.
3396000	3399000	So that would be neat.
3399000	3403000	Didn't the guy like that is like the lead designer on Overwatch pretty much come out
3403000	3406000	and say like Nintendo, you can have any character you want.
3406000	3410000	Although I think there was a strong hint that like Tracer would probably be the best
3410000	3414000	one wink wink nudge because she is kind of like the poster girl for.
3414000	3416000	I would say that would be pretty cool.
3416000	3417000	Yeah.
3417000	3421000	Actually, Tracer would be kind of a neat concept for a character in Smash Brothers, especially
3421000	3423000	the whole like if she plays kind of like she does in the game.
3423000	3424000	Could be very interesting.
3424000	3425000	Yeah.
3425000	3426000	Yeah.
3426000	3429000	I think I think a character like that would work better than something like, you know,
3429000	3430000	like Lucio.
3430000	3431000	And don't take me the wrong way.
3431000	3432000	I love Lucio.
3432000	3436000	But like, I don't know if like the healing stuff like or mercy, like mercy is not going
3436000	3440000	to be a great character in Smash Brothers because, you know, they're like more healers
3440000	3441000	and support, although I don't know.
3441000	3444000	Now that I'm saying that, like Lucio's boop would be really fun.
3444000	3445000	So.
3445000	3448000	But mercy, I can't think of a reason why to put mercy in Smash Brothers, unfortunately.
3448000	3450000	But Tracer would be really good.
3450000	3453000	And yeah, Diva would be a lot of fun wrecking ball.
3453000	3455000	Winston might be a fun one, too.
3455000	3461000	So I do think, though, if and this is a giant if a Blizzard character were to suddenly show
3461000	3464000	up in Super Smash Brothers, I do think Tracer just makes the most sense.
3464000	3465000	Yeah, so.
3465000	3466000	But we'll see.
3466000	3469000	I mean, we know that they're going to continue adding DLC characters.
3469000	3471000	They've announced there's even more to come.
3471000	3476000	I would think that Nintendo and Sakurai, they've all kind of figured out what that is.
3476000	3477000	That's already in place.
3477000	3480000	So, like, if a Blizzard character is going to be in there, then Blizzard already knows
3480000	3481000	about it.
3481000	3483000	But anything's possible.
3483000	3484000	Right.
3484000	3485000	That's it.
3485000	3486000	That's how they're going to get him in there.
3486000	3492000	They've got to put Waluigi into Overwatch and then he can then go into Smash Brothers
3492000	3494000	because they're looking.
3494000	3496000	That's that's the only way.
3496000	3500000	S2100 Matt says just not another sword character.
3500000	3503000	I don't think there are any heroes in Overwatch with a sword.
3503000	3505000	But the closest thing I can think of is Reinhardt with the hammer.
3505000	3508000	But because it kind of kind of performs like a sword.
3508000	3513000	But there is no there's no character with a sword that I can think of.
3513000	3514000	Interesting, isn't it?
3514000	3516000	Because, like, there's like all sorts of other weapons in the game.
3516000	3517000	I'm really trying to think.
3517000	3519000	Like, even the characters you would think would have like a sword.
3519000	3523000	Brigitte has like the mace type thing that she has.
3523000	3526000	I don't think anybody has a sword in Overwatch.
3526000	3528000	So maybe an unannounced hero.
3528000	3531000	But I don't think there are any sword heroes in Overwatch, strangely enough.
3531000	3532000	So.
3532000	3534000	Oh, I knew you guys would think of it.
3534000	3535000	Genji.
3535000	3536000	Genji has swords.
3536000	3537000	That's right.
3537000	3539000	I don't play Genji, though.
3539000	3540000	Hanzo.
3540000	3542000	Hanzo has the bow and arrow, not the sword.
3542000	3543000	OK, that's what the sword is.
3543000	3544000	Genji has it.
3544000	3545000	I don't like playing Genji.
3545000	3547000	That's why I didn't think of him.
3547000	3548000	All right.
3548000	3552000	Let's move on and talk about an exciting new game, I think.
3552000	3553000	I think.
3553000	3554000	I think it's exciting.
3554000	3555000	Coming out on the Switch.
3555000	3557000	And that's a return of Brain Age.
3557000	3560000	Haven't you ever asked yourself, what the hell ever happened to Brain Age?
3560000	3561000	No.
3561000	3562000	I know I have.
3562000	3564000	Because those games were huge on the DS.
3564000	3566000	Not even the 3DS, but the original DS.
3566000	3567000	I remember this was a big thing.
3567000	3569000	It was like the whole, like, train your brain.
3569000	3571000	I'm just surprised that this isn't a mobile game.
3571000	3577000	Because this should be a mobile game from Nintendo versus, like, a Switch game.
3577000	3580000	Honestly, a fair counterpoint.
3580000	3584000	Because I don't really care for that Mario Kart game whatsoever that they just put out.
3584000	3585000	It's awful.
3585000	3587000	The Brain Age would make a lot of sense on mobile.
3587000	3588000	You're right.
3588000	3589000	Why don't they do that?
3589000	3593000	But anyway, well, it is going to happen on the Switch, at least in Japan.
3593000	3595000	We don't know anything about the US yet.
3595000	3597000	But, you know, it's a possibility.
3597000	3598000	Anything is, I suppose.
3598000	3602000	Anyway, Dr. Kawashima's Nintendo Switch brain training.
3602000	3606000	Dr. Kawashima was that, you know, doctor head you saw in the early games, too.
3606000	3609000	And I think it's all inspired by a study of his or something.
3609000	3610000	I don't know.
3610000	3613000	But anyway, the brain training will be coming out for Nintendo Switch.
3613000	3617000	What's interesting is that you kind of hold the Switch vertically in this one.
3617000	3622000	So it's kind of like how a DS would have looked when it was open, except it's like this screen.
3622000	3626000	So I kind of like that they're using the Nintendo Switch in a different orientation.
3626000	3627000	That's kind of interesting.
3627000	3633000	It's also interesting that there's very distinctly some games where you're taking one of the Joy-Cons off,
3633000	3636000	which means it's not going to work so well with a Switch Lite.
3636000	3639000	And it's also not going to work in the dock?
3639000	3640000	Yeah.
3640000	3641000	So I don't know.
3641000	3647000	Well, we don't know yet because technically, technically, technically, if you have a Switch Lite,
3647000	3650000	you can still buy Joy-Cons and use them with the Switch Lite.
3650000	3653000	There's no reason you can't pair a second pair of Joy-Cons with a Switch Lite.
3653000	3657000	But I know it's a stretch, but technically you could do that.
3657000	3661000	But yeah, I don't think there was anything in the trailer that showed a dock mode.
3661000	3668000	But anyway, there are some screenshots too that show some hands-on brain training that use the infrared camera to show,
3668000	3669000	like you actually show fingers.
3669000	3674000	So it'll show on the screen like one plus one, and you have to show like two.
3674000	3677000	And the infrared camera actually counts how many fingers you're holding up.
3677000	3682000	So it's kind of, it's silly, but it's a neat use of the technology for sure.
3682000	3686000	And there is versus brain training, which I don't think was a thing originally.
3686000	3692000	Also, there are some written brain training exercises, which obviously is going to be a little difficult,
3692000	3697000	or the difficult thing to translate to English, because that means it's going to be very different between Japanese English.
3697000	3698000	But anyway, yeah.
3698000	3700000	So that's, I think it's kind of neat.
3700000	3701000	I don't know.
3701000	3704000	I hope they do an English version of it, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.
3704000	3706000	I don't know how well those games sold over here.
3707000	3713000	Now Bobby is pointing out that other companies took the Brain Age format and released them to mobile first.
3713000	3718000	It was probably too crowded of a market for Nintendo to devote resources.
3718000	3723000	I get that, but one could argue that many people have ripped off the Mario format.
3723000	3726000	Many, many people have ripped off the Mario format for mobile,
3726000	3729000	and that didn't stop Nintendo from trying their own spin on it,
3729000	3732000	just based on Mario as an intellectual property.
3732000	3735000	Now does Brain Age hold that same weight as Mario?
3735000	3736000	Probably not.
3736000	3739000	So the argument makes a lot more sense in that context,
3739000	3743000	but I think just because somebody else has tried to do it,
3743000	3746000	doesn't necessarily mean that's going to make Nintendo shy away from doing it.
3746000	3748000	And certainly there's been Mario Kart clones as well.
3748000	3751000	And honestly, many of them are better than what Nintendo released.
3752000	3753000	That's sad.
3753000	3755000	Yeah. Anyway.
3755000	3756000	All right.
3756000	3760000	Let's move on, and ooh, we're already at the classic game of the week.
3760000	3761000	Holy moly.
3761000	3764000	All right, we're to that part of the show where we take a trip down memory lane.
3764000	3767000	Usually Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault
3767000	3770000	and find a game for us that we should look back and reflect on.
3770000	3772000	But as we mentioned at the top of the show,
3772000	3774000	she had to cancel on the show last minute tonight,
3774000	3777000	so she is not here tonight, so we've kind of switched her route a little bit.
3777000	3781000	And we have kind of an interesting change tonight.
3781000	3784000	So who picked the game tonight?
3784000	3786000	Was it Loki or was it me that picked the game?
3786000	3788000	We both picked this game.
3788000	3790000	We both agree this should be a classic game of the week, right, Loki?
3790000	3791000	Sure.
3791000	3792000	All right.
3793000	3795000	You told me before the show you were fine with it.
3795000	3797000	I am fine with it. That's an affirmative.
3797000	3799000	All right. Sure.
3799000	3803000	Sure, Rob. I guess we can pick this game.
3803000	3808000	All right, the classic game of the week is the incredible machine
3808000	3813000	is the classic game that we have picked tonight.
3813000	3815000	Do you want to tell us some memories about the incredible machine
3815000	3818000	while I pull up the information about the game?
3818000	3819000	Yes.
3819000	3820000	There's a whole series.
3820000	3821000	I remember.
3821000	3824000	So basically the incredible machine was about making different machines
3824000	3826000	to solve different puzzles.
3826000	3830000	So in this one, you're supposed to get the basketball into the hoop.
3830000	3832000	And how do you do that?
3832000	3836000	Well, you have to power some treadmills using hamster wheels.
3836000	3840000	And the way you get the hamsters running is you have to startle them with bowling balls.
3840000	3843000	And there you go. That's puzzle one.
3843000	3846000	And then, of course, you keep progressing through the game.
3846000	3849000	It gets harder and harder and harder, and then eventually you finish.
3849000	3853000	And then, plus, you can also make your own puzzles, which is a lot of fun as well.
3853000	3856000	So, yeah.
3856000	3858000	And I know. Was this the. . .
3858000	3861000	This looks like the 16-color version, or was it the. . .
3861000	3863000	No, this is 256.
3863000	3864000	I believe this is. . .
3864000	3865000	It's the original from 93.
3865000	3867000	It's the MS-DOS version from 93.
3867000	3868000	But I don't think. . .
3868000	3870000	It's more than 16 colors for sure.
3870000	3871000	I mean, the game was out in 93.
3871000	3873000	We had 256 colors by then.
3873000	3874000	Yeah. I'm trying to remember.
3874000	3876000	But, yeah, I did have the original game.
3876000	3878000	I think I even had the sequel.
3878000	3882000	It's spun off into Contraction Maker now, which is pretty cool.
3882000	3885000	So let's talk a little bit about some of the officials behind this game.
3885000	3888000	So, of course, we're highlighting specifically the first release in the series tonight,
3888000	3891000	The Incredible Machine from 1993,
3891000	3895000	which was formerly abbreviated as T-I-M,
3895000	3898000	and sometimes pronounced T-EAM, something like that.
3898000	3902000	Oh, by the way, not to distract from this too much,
3902000	3907000	but Bobby, go ahead and open the pot for the Twitch reward stuff here on stream.
3907000	3908000	I forgot to mention that beforehand.
3908000	3911000	But there's a Twitch Prime thing going on right now,
3911000	3916000	so if you want to donate, you can actually throw in some things in the pot there
3916000	3919000	to actually give away to viewers here.
3919000	3923000	And I know I'll be donating some of mine here as soon as it's opened up.
3923000	3924000	And there we go. Awesome.
3924000	3928000	So the community gift test is open, and you can actually contribute to that.
3928000	3932000	And, yeah, we're going to give away some of that stuff here in just a little bit.
3932000	3934000	So I see folks adding away to that right now.
3934000	3937000	Unfortunately, apparently, am I not logged in on this machine?
3937000	3939000	What the hell? Why don't I see the thing where I can...
3939000	3941000	Oh, there it goes. Now I got it.
3941000	3942000	Gift more.
3942000	3945000	Sorry, I'm distracting here from this whole thing.
3945000	3946000	All right, anyway.
3946000	3950000	So The Incredible Machine, back on topic.
3950000	3952000	Sorry, it was a very important live announcement there,
3952000	3953000	because I meant to do that earlier.
3953000	3956000	The game was designed and coded by Kevin Ryan,
3956000	3959000	and it was produced by Geoff Tunnell,
3959000	3963000	which was part of the now-defunct Geoff Tunnell Productions.
3963000	3965000	The game was published by Dynamix,
3965000	3968000	which I know made some of those big early 90s games.
3968000	3972000	The same development team was behind the 93 and 95 versions,
3972000	3974000	but later on there were more versions of the game.
3974000	3975000	I mean, this was a whole series,
3975000	3979000	so later on the ones in the 2000 and beyond had different designers.
3979000	3982000	All of the games were published by Sierra.
3982000	3985000	And then, where is the IP rights with this now?
3985000	3988000	As of now, the rights are held by the Walt Disney Company,
3988000	3990000	because, of course, Disney's bought everything.
3990000	3992000	But Geoff Tunnell announced, of course,
3992000	3995000	Contraption Maker was the spiritual successor to this.
3995000	4000000	That was in 2013, and Steam, Windows, OS X,
4000000	4003000	all saw a release of that on July 7th, 2014.
4003000	4005000	But what is The Incredible Machine,
4005000	4006000	especially for those in the podcast feed
4006000	4008000	that can't see the video right now?
4008000	4010000	What you're doing in this game is you're making a series of,
4010000	4013000	have you ever heard of, like, Rube Goldberg devices?
4013000	4016000	Okay, that's like the classic board game Mouse Trap, right?
4016000	4018000	The marble goes down here,
4018000	4021000	and then it sets off this diver that dives into the thing,
4021000	4024000	and then the vibration causes the mouse trap to fall,
4024000	4025000	like all these different things, right?
4025000	4027000	That's those Rube Goldberg devices.
4027000	4029000	If you see those disgusting-ass saw movies,
4029000	4031000	a lot of the traps in those movies
4031000	4033000	are based off that whole type of thing as well.
4033000	4034000	So what you're doing is you're building
4034000	4036000	your own types of machines like this.
4036000	4037000	Oh, an OK Go video.
4037000	4040000	You're making your own OK Go music video.
4040000	4043000	That's another good way to put it.
4043000	4046000	So, you know, you might have to, for example, say,
4046000	4048000	in this one you're trying to build, get a basketball
4048000	4052000	onto a cage to make the hamster move in the cage.
4052000	4053000	It's a mouse, apparently.
4053000	4055000	But you're gonna do it through a series of trampolines.
4055000	4057000	So you have to put all the trampolines.
4057000	4059000	So you get a limited number of items,
4059000	4062000	and you have to lay out those items in a way
4062000	4067000	that makes sense to cause the contraption to work.
4067000	4070000	Kind of an educational game in some ways, if you think about it.
4070000	4072000	I remember playing this when I was younger,
4072000	4075000	and it was an interesting kind of learning and logic type of way.
4075000	4079000	You can also change things like air pressure and gravity,
4079000	4080000	because those puzzles got really hard
4080000	4083000	when you started fucking with things like gravity.
4083000	4086000	So there were many, many versions of the incredible machine.
4086000	4088000	I mean, there were just, I think there was, like,
4088000	4090000	at least what, I'm looking at a list here,
4090000	4092000	one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten games
4092000	4094000	in the main series if you want to count.
4094000	4097000	Well, we're counting the iPad version in 2011.
4097000	4098000	So, yeah, I know.
4098000	4101000	So anyway, but, yeah, the incredible machine
4101000	4104000	was made on a $36,000 budget.
4104000	4109000	Had about 160 levels, and it got a great reception.
4109000	4111000	There was a lot of praise,
4111000	4114000	and you could make your own machines as well,
4114000	4116000	and I think that was the mode that got a lot of people
4116000	4118000	to love it as well.
4118000	4121000	So, yeah, the incredible machine by Sierra,
4121000	4123000	our pick for Classic Game of the Week this week.
4123000	4125000	It was all about torturing the cats.
4125000	4127000	No, don't torture the cat.
4127000	4129000	Like, I realize sometimes the cats are assholes,
4129000	4130000	but you don't torture them.
4130000	4131000	That's what we used to do.
4131000	4132000	Shame on you.
4132000	4133000	I used to put them on.
4133000	4135000	I used to put cats on the trampolines.
4135000	4136000	Gosh.
4136000	4138000	And have them jump around, and then they would hit,
4138000	4141000	like, something.
4141000	4142000	They'd bounce around the trampolines.
4142000	4144000	The cats didn't like the trampolines.
4144000	4148000	So anyway, looking in chat, let's see.
4148000	4152000	Questbuster's saying, yay, incredible machine.
4152000	4153000	Let's see.
4153000	4154000	SG100Matt says Disney owns it.
4154000	4156000	Sounds about right.
4156000	4158000	And, yeah, some folks really into this Classic Game of the Week.
4158000	4160000	A lot of people thinking this hasn't been picked yet.
4160000	4161000	Yeah, somehow this one.
4161000	4163000	I think we've talked about picking it,
4163000	4165000	and it's come up on the show before,
4165000	4167000	but when we had to do a last minute substitute tonight,
4167000	4169000	it definitely came to mind, like, oh, yeah,
4169000	4171000	we kept talking about that we were going to do that
4171000	4173000	as a Classic Game of the Week at some point.
4173000	4175000	So there it is, the incredible machine,
4175000	4177000	your classic game of the week.
4177000	4179000	Okay, so I think you guys have contributed
4179000	4180000	to the community chest.
4180000	4182000	So Bobby, why don't you hit the button,
4182000	4184000	and let's begin the holidays.
4184000	4186000	Let's begin Christmas a little early,
4186000	4188000	and we're going to give away some of those gifts
4188000	4189000	to folks in chat.
4189000	4190000	12 gifts tonight.
4190000	4191000	Wow.
4191000	4192000	That's going to be pretty good.
4192000	4194000	We don't have a huge live turnout tonight.
4194000	4198000	It's under 30, and I've seen it go as high as mid-40s.
4198000	4200000	So that'll still be really cool.
4200000	4201000	Oh, there they go.
4201000	4202000	They just all went out.
4202000	4207000	So a World of Tanks care package was the prize tonight.
4207000	4208000	And there they go.
4208000	4210000	They just all got doled out right there in the chat room.
4210000	4211000	So enjoy that, you guys.
4211000	4212000	Cool.
4212000	4213000	All right.
4213000	4215000	Thank you to everybody who donated gifts.
4215000	4217000	I thought I donated gifts to the treasure chest tonight.
4217000	4218000	Did I not?
4218000	4219000	Gosh darn it.
4219000	4220000	Oh, well.
4220000	4221000	I guess I'll have to do it again in a future week.
4221000	4222000	Oh, well.
4222000	4224000	But yeah, we're going to try to keep doing that here.
4224000	4226000	I know the first week they did those chests,
4226000	4228000	we left it open the entire show.
4228000	4230000	But it kind of made the chat work funky,
4230000	4231000	and it was a little weird.
4231000	4234000	So I think it's better to just do it during one segment.
4234000	4236000	And in that way, it kind of keeps you listening.
4236000	4237000	For those of you that are looking
4237000	4239000	for the free giveaways, right?
4239000	4241000	Metal Mayhem, you like the free stuff, right?
4241000	4243000	So it kind of keeps you listening,
4243000	4245000	and then we'll just give it away at some point.
4246000	4248000	So maybe usually during the Classic Game of the Week
4248000	4249000	or something like that.
4249000	4250000	So cool.
4250000	4253000	Act F says, LOL, VoG Network, want a gift?
4253000	4255000	Yeah, because technically VoG Network
4255000	4256000	doesn't have a Prime account.
4256000	4260000	So I wish there was a way you could opt out of it
4260000	4261000	so that we don't win.
4261000	4263000	We'll have to look into that for a future week.
4263000	4264000	I don't know.
4264000	4265000	Anyway.
4265000	4266000	All right, let's move on.
4266000	4268000	We're going to get into some rapid fire news
4268000	4270000	and talk about some things going on in the industry.
4270000	4272000	Well, we talked about earlier games
4272000	4274000	that aren't coming from Rockstar Games
4274000	4275000	anytime soon.
4275000	4277000	Well, we do have one that is coming from Rockstar Games soon.
4277000	4279000	It's actually already been out.
4279000	4285000	Red Dead Redemption 2 is now coming out on PC.
4285000	4289000	It is going to be out on the Epic Games Store first,
4289000	4292000	but fear not, it is not a long time.
4292000	4294000	It is just actually a few weeks.
4294000	4298000	So they have the PC version coming out on November 5th.
4298000	4300000	At that time, it's also going to be out
4300000	4303000	on some other platforms as well.
4303000	4307000	But the Steam version will be coming later on.
4307000	4309000	Looks like, yeah.
4309000	4312000	So you can get it now.
4312000	4315000	I guess, yeah, the 23rd.
4315000	4318000	It'll be available on Green Man Gaming,
4318000	4321000	Humble Store, and Epic Games Store.
4321000	4323000	And then, of course, December.
4323000	4325000	A little bit later, it'll be coming to that.
4325000	4327000	And then Google Stadia is going to be getting it
4327000	4329000	when that launches.
4329000	4331000	So more ways to play Red Dead Redemption.
4332000	4334000	No, that's a big deal because apparently
4334000	4337000	everybody has been waiting for a Red Dead Redemption game
4337000	4339000	to come out on PC.
4339000	4342000	So we can mod the shit out of it.
4342000	4345000	Exactly. Exactly why.
4345000	4347000	And so apparently, though,
4347000	4350000	and I am totally going to buy it again on PC,
4350000	4353000	because I didn't like some of the survival elements
4353000	4355000	that were on the actual version of the game,
4355000	4356000	and thank God for mods.
4356000	4358000	We'll fix all of that, and it'll be nice.
4358000	4361000	Plus, then I'll be able to spawn a car or a tank in the game,
4361000	4363000	because that's exactly what I want to do,
4363000	4364000	is a tank in the old west.
4364000	4367000	I just want to spawn horses that fall from the sky.
4367000	4369000	Absolutely.
4369000	4371000	So, yes, you'll be able to pre-purchase the game,
4371000	4373000	apparently starting October 9th,
4373000	4376000	exclusively on Rockstar's game launcher,
4376000	4378000	through the October 22nd.
4378000	4380000	And then they had a limited time offer
4380000	4384000	where you get two free Rockstar PC games titles
4384000	4385000	for free if you do that.
4385000	4387000	So Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, San Andreas,
4387000	4389000	Bully, Scholarship Edition,
4389000	4390000	L.A. Noire, the Complete Edition,
4390000	4393000	or Max Payne 3, the Complete Edition, as well.
4393000	4396000	And then, I guess, premium editions as well are available,
4396000	4399000	and then you get a bunch of, like, bullshit,
4399000	4402000	like 50 gold bars for Reddit Online.
4402000	4404000	You know the deal with these premium things.
4404000	4406000	It's just, it's bullshit.
4406000	4407000	Just remember mods.
4407000	4408000	So it doesn't matter.
4408000	4411000	You know, I don't need the Warhorse for story mode,
4411000	4414000	because I can mod that shit in there when it comes out.
4415000	4417000	Yeah, so that's gonna be a thing,
4417000	4418000	and that's kind of exciting.
4418000	4421000	So looking forward to that later this month.
4421000	4425000	And then, a game I am sad I did not get to play today,
4425000	4427000	because I would have had the opportunity to play it,
4427000	4431000	but they finally announced that Iron Man VR
4431000	4433000	is gonna be coming out on PlayStation VR
4433000	4436000	February 28th, 2020.
4436000	4437000	So sad I didn't.
4437000	4439000	I missed it today, the demo.
4439000	4440000	It looks pretty awesome.
4441000	4443000	So yeah, I am looking forward to that.
4443000	4446000	$40 if you want to get the standard edition,
4446000	4448000	and they have digital deluxe edition
4448000	4450000	with some more armor skins,
4450000	4452000	which honestly is just fucking skins.
4452000	4454000	They're just repainting the skins,
4454000	4455000	and who gives a shit?
4455000	4457000	So, standard edition all the way.
4457000	4459000	Iron Man fans might give a shit.
4459000	4460000	No, it's seriously, like,
4460000	4463000	it's not even like that they changed the armor at all.
4463000	4465000	It's literally just changing the colors
4465000	4467000	of the pieces of armor.
4467000	4468000	Yeah, I have to admit,
4468000	4470000	I'm looking at it, it's not that great.
4470000	4471000	It's all the same.
4471000	4472000	So they didn't even like,
4472000	4473000	because they said,
4473000	4476000	oh yeah, you can get the original armor custom deco,
4476000	4478000	but it's just, it's all silver,
4478000	4480000	you know, or the vintage armor.
4480000	4483000	It's just, it's just repainted.
4483000	4484000	Who cares?
4484000	4485000	All right.
4486000	4488000	All right, let's move on.
4488000	4490000	I mentioned we talk about Atari.
4490000	4491000	Yes.
4491000	4492000	So here's the deal with Atari.
4492000	4494000	So of course the Atari VCS console
4494000	4496000	is planning to launch in March 2020,
4496000	4497000	and just announced this week,
4497000	4500000	a partnership with Antstream Arcade.
4500000	4503000	So the streaming service, right,
4503000	4504000	online that, disclaimer,
4504000	4506000	I was a Kickstarter backer for.
4506000	4508000	So not a lot of people in the US can play it right now
4508000	4510000	because it's only out in Europe right now.
4510000	4511000	They still haven't launched officially
4511000	4512000	in other territories.
4512000	4514000	But if you're a Kickstarter backer, you have it.
4514000	4516000	So, you know, and I do,
4516000	4518000	I actually went in there to start looking for ideas
4518000	4519000	for the classic game of the week,
4519000	4521000	although I ended up picking something outside of that.
4521000	4524000	But yeah, I still do check out Antstream once in a while
4524000	4526000	because they are still adding new things.
4526000	4528000	So what's up with the partnership with Atari?
4528000	4530000	Well, Atari, of course, the Atari VCS
4530000	4532000	is going to come out for $250.
4532000	4534000	It's going to be a Linux-based game console.
4534000	4535000	It can play a lot of retro games.
4535000	4537000	And the partnership with Antstream Arcade
4537000	4539000	is going to have an enhanced and exclusive
4539000	4542000	Atari edition of Antstream's streaming service
4542000	4546000	to the Atari VCS gaming system.
4546000	4548000	So the exclusive Atari edition of Antstream Arcade
4548000	4550000	will have an instantly accessible collection
4550000	4552000	of classic video game titles,
4552000	4555000	including the original library of 2000-plus games.
4555000	4559000	There's going to be extra Atari games available on demand.
4559000	4562000	So I have to admit, it's a little disappointing to me
4562000	4564000	as an Antstream person, the Kickstarter thing,
4564000	4567000	that we're not really getting all those Atari games
4567000	4569000	in the regular version of Antstream.
4569000	4571000	I am hearing, though, to be fair,
4571000	4574000	that I guess Atari is going to be having one game a month,
4574000	4577000	ooh, that goes to the main Antstream service.
4577000	4579000	So there'll be a very, very slow trickle.
4579000	4581000	I just hope they're not crap Atari games.
4581000	4583000	Like, let us have the good stuff.
4583000	4585000	But then again, I mean, maybe, you know,
4585000	4587000	a lot of the really, really good Atari stuff,
4587000	4589000	quite honestly, were Activision games anyway.
4589000	4592000	Like, a lot of the best games on the Atari 2600,
4592000	4594000	like Pitfall and, you know, things like that,
4594000	4595000	they were Activision games.
4595000	4597000	So who knows how that's all going to work out.
4597000	4600000	But anyway, there will be at least one game a month
4600000	4603000	that happens on the regular app.
4603000	4606000	But the biggest chunk of that is going to be on the Atari VCS app,
4606000	4608000	where you get all the different Atari games that'll be there.
4608000	4611000	And of course, there'll be a 30-day free trial after that.
4611000	4614000	You can subscribe for $10 a month or $8 a month
4614000	4618000	if you do a yearly subscription.
4618000	4623000	50 classic Atari titles at launch for new Atari VCS users.
4623000	4625000	So, interesting.
4625000	4627000	So does that mean that they're not going to have, like,
4627000	4630000	because I thought the whole point was that they're going to offer,
4630000	4633000	like, those classic games on the Atari system.
4633000	4634000	So now they're not.
4634000	4636000	They're just part of that streaming service.
4636000	4638000	Is that the kind of, like, way, like, yeah, we're kind of lazy.
4638000	4640000	They haven't said.
4641000	4642000	We don't know.
4642000	4643000	We don't know what it is.
4643000	4645000	We don't know if it's the Antstream thing.
4645000	4648000	It's six months away from launch, and we don't know what the fuck it is.
4648000	4649000	Yeah, that's great.
4649000	4650000	All right.
4650000	4654000	Bobby also pointing out that Antstream has recently released the save states.
4654000	4656000	Just came to the system, which is good.
4656000	4658000	Yeah, especially considering it's all streaming.
4658000	4660000	That's really cool.
4660000	4663000	Also, for rapid-fire news on my end,
4663000	4666000	the Death Stranding soundtrack is a thing.
4666000	4667000	That is something that is happening.
4667000	4669000	There's going to be an official soundtrack to Death Stranding.
4669000	4670000	The first song came out.
4670000	4672000	It's a Church's song.
4672000	4673000	I like the band Church's.
4673000	4676000	I don't know about you guys, but it's a really good song.
4676000	4679000	I can't play it for you now because I don't want to get muted on Twitch,
4679000	4683000	but it's really easy to find if you just go to YouTube and type Church's death.
4683000	4687000	Don't forget they do that hipster spelling where it's a V instead of a U.
4687000	4690000	But even if you just type Church's Death Stranding, you're going to find it.
4690000	4692000	And it is a really good song.
4692000	4694000	Like, it's just a really good Church's song.
4694000	4696000	So, you know how sometimes the soundtrack songs are a little bit like,
4696000	4697000	like, they're not as good as those.
4698000	4700000	Like exclusive to.
4700000	4701000	Yeah, it's exclusive to the gate.
4701000	4703000	It's a song called Death Stranding, if I'm not mistaken.
4703000	4706000	So, yeah, really cool.
4706000	4707000	I want the trailer music.
4707000	4709000	So I want to find those tracks.
4709000	4714000	That might be in the actual soundtrack because there is a soundtrack that's coming out called Timefall,
4714000	4716000	original music from the world of Death Stranding.
4716000	4717000	Cool.
4717000	4724000	I have to admit, I'm getting more and more interested in Death Stranding now that we're actually seeing gameplay.
4724000	4727000	And, you know, I got to admit, a good soundtrack will sell me on something.
4727000	4731000	I went and saw David Lynch's Lost Highway based on the soundtrack.
4731000	4733000	And it was, and it hurt my brain.
4733000	4736000	I saw Lost Highway in the theaters.
4736000	4738000	That's probably the most hipster thing I'm going to say all night.
4738000	4743000	So, but it was really based on the strong soundtrack.
4743000	4748000	And Bobby says it's songs inspired by the world of Death Stranding.
4748000	4752000	The Church's song totally sounds like a credit song, though, to me.
4752000	4755000	I mean, it may or may not be, but it totally sounds like a credit song, though.
4755000	4759000	And Bobby says, I felt like I was playing Forza Horizon.
4759000	4760000	That's when I hear Church's.
4760000	4765000	Oh, yeah, I forget that Church's is on the soundtrack to Forza Horizon as well.
4765000	4767000	So, pretty cool.
4767000	4769000	Mish is in chat saying, I love Church's.
4769000	4770000	Yeah, me too.
4770000	4774000	Oh, Bobby says, Kojima did say the Church's song is the end credits.
4774000	4776000	Perfect, because that's what it sounds like to me.
4776000	4777000	But it's a good song.
4777000	4778000	Check it out.
4778000	4781000	So, and yeah, it's songs inspired by.
4781000	4783000	And that's sometimes movie soundtracks, too.
4783000	4788000	Like the Mortal Kombat soundtrack, wasn't that all songs inspired by?
4788000	4790000	It's music from and inspired by the film.
4790000	4792000	Yeah, and they have three hacker soundtracks.
4792000	4794000	Most of those were inspired by the movie.
4794000	4795000	It is that.
4795000	4801000	So, this is not an unheard of thing for the video gaming world to do as well.
4801000	4806000	Didn't No Man's Sky have a soundtrack and it was like a procedurally generated soundtrack, too?
4806000	4807000	No.
4807000	4808000	It was all inspired by?
4808000	4809000	I don't think they have that.
4809000	4810000	I thought that was a thing.
4810000	4812000	There is a No Man's Sky soundtrack, I know that.
4812000	4813000	Probably.
4813000	4814000	Yeah.
4814000	4815000	A lot of it's by one band, though, so.
4815000	4818000	Alright, we have some more rapid fire news.
4818000	4819000	Yes.
4819000	4821000	Which, by the way, these were the things Dark Soccer was going to talk about.
4821000	4826000	She just texted saying, tell everyone I'm high AF and I love them.
4826000	4833000	She doesn't mean, she means legal things, not, well, I guess technically that's all legal in California as well now, too.
4833000	4838000	But she said she was taking medication for her sickness, so.
4838000	4839000	Okay.
4839000	4841000	I'm just passing along the message.
4841000	4843000	She might be watching.
4843000	4845000	Alright, anyways.
4845000	4855000	So, one Untitled Goose Game is looking to get ported over to the Playstation and Xbox and possibly mobile platforms, according to the developer House House.
4855000	4862000	They basically are, you know, as far as the mobile port goes, they said, we're still chewing on this.
4862000	4867000	It'll take a lot of design work to make a version that works good for touch controls.
4867000	4873000	But the other, the other platforms would be a lot more easier to port over to.
4873000	4877000	This seems to be that indie hit of the year.
4877000	4886000	Like, you know, along the lines of, honestly, like a Minecraft or a Five Nights at Freddy's or like one of those, like, indie games that everybody is talking about.
4886000	4889000	Untitled Goose Game is like that for this year.
4889000	4894000	I definitely foresee game awards at the end of the year for this game.
4894000	4900000	Not necessarily maybe like game of the year, but I think a lot of like indie reward type things are going to become in the way of this game.
4900000	4903000	And now, this next story was very much a Jamie thing.
4903000	4905000	Yes, this is very much a Jamie thing.
4905000	4909000	So, they're talking about the reboot of Cotton.
4909000	4923000	So, they have a few different modes that they announced for the Cotton reboot, including the X68000 original mode, which is apparently a faithful port of the original Cotton game.
4923000	4927000	For the Sharp X68000.
4927000	4936000	And then they have a range mode, which supports the 16 by 9 aspect ratio and updated graphics.
4936000	4945000	And then, of course, they have the voice cast and background music composers kind of announced as well.
4945000	4949000	So, I don't know half of these people, but actually, I don't know all of these people.
4950000	4960000	But, yeah, it looks like a pretty decent sized set of people that they have composing music and doing voice acting on it.
4960000	4963000	I'm sure if Jamie was here reading this story, she would give us a squeak.
4963000	4965000	Because I know she loves Cotton. She loves it.
4965000	4967000	So, the fact that they're rebooting it, I know she's going to be annoyed.
4967000	4973000	It's due out. PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam on 2020 in Japan.
4973000	4976000	So, you know, you'll probably be able to get it here too.
4976000	4980000	Well, I mean, yeah, PlayStation 4 and Switch are region free, so you'll be able to play it here if you want.
4980000	4981000	And Steam, I would think you could play it.
4981000	4984000	Oh, yeah, of course Steam, yeah. So, neat.
4984000	4989000	Alright, let's move on and go around the world and check out some release dates.
4989000	4993000	We're going to see what's coming out on a store shelf near you this week.
4993000	4995000	Yeah, we're in the thick of it now.
4995000	5002000	So, this week we've got Alliance Live HD Remaster on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
5002000	5007000	Here's a game that you might like, Rob. Burger Time Party on Nintendo Switch.
5007000	5011000	Concrete Genie on PlayStation 4. That was a pretty neat looking game.
5011000	5017000	Trine 4, The Nightmare Prince on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5017000	5022000	Indivisible on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5022000	5029000	And then Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5029000	5032000	We had Corpse Party, Blood Drive on PC and Switch.
5032000	5038000	River City Melee Mach on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.
5038000	5045000	Spirit Hunter NG on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and some system called the Vita.
5045000	5052000	We have Doraemon's Story of Seasons on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5052000	5056000	Frostpunk coming to consoles on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5056000	5064000	Grid, not to be confused with the original Grid, this is a remake or a new game in the Grid series that they're calling Grid now.
5064000	5067000	On PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5067000	5072000	And Killer Queen Black on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5072000	5074000	That's it.
5074000	5077000	Alright, traveling over to Japan. Not quite as busy of a week.
5077000	5085000	A lot of the things you mentioned are also out in Japan this week, including the Alliance Live HD Remastered, Trine 4, The Nightmare Prince, Concrete Genie.
5085000	5089000	All of those on the PlayStation 4. That's really it on the PlayStation 4.
5089000	5093000	Going to the Nintendo Switch, kind of similar.
5093000	5098000	There's a new Nintendo Switch Tsum Tsum version that's coming out.
5098000	5101000	Yeah, I know, it's kind of neat if you're into that.
5101000	5103000	Alliance Live on the Switch as well.
5103000	5105000	Ark of Alchemist for Nintendo Switch.
5105000	5108000	This is a little bit of a big deal. I would love to see this happen in the US.
5108000	5112000	Yokai Watch 1, now the Switch version.
5112000	5117000	I think we talked about this a little bit last week, but they are remaking Yokai Watch, the original for the Nintendo Switch.
5117000	5119000	But as far as we know, this is only in Japan.
5119000	5122000	But this series is very big in Japan, so they're getting their release of it this next week.
5122000	5124000	Wouldn't be surprised if we see that port over here.
5124000	5129000	Yeah, I hope so. I would like to give Yokai Watch another try, so we'll see.
5129000	5132000	And then Trine 4 also out on the Nintendo Switch.
5132000	5136000	So that is what Japan's release schedule looks like this week.
5136000	5140000	VidPower573 in chat says, there's a new BurgerTime game.
5140000	5142000	Yeah, there is.
5142000	5144000	BurgerTime Party.
5144000	5146000	Does it still play like the arcade?
5146000	5148000	I think it's a party game.
5148000	5150000	Interesting, okay.
5150000	5152000	I would assume based on the title.
5152000	5159000	But I know we talked about it before on another one of the podcasts.
5159000	5164000	But I don't remember what the difference was with it.
5164000	5166000	I was just going to take a look real quick.
5166000	5170000	When I hear BurgerTime Party, it makes me think of that.
5170000	5176000	What was the one game we were talking about the other day with the other games?
5176000	5181000	I can't remember. But it looks interesting.
5181000	5184000	Yeah, I don't know. It looks like they've updated their game.
5184000	5186000	I only sound like that one little trailer.
5186000	5188000	It looks like it plays like BurgerTime.
5188000	5190000	But it's like multiplayer. I think that's why they call it Party.
5190000	5195000	It's multiplayer, and it's definitely updated graphics.
5195000	5199000	See, this is the type of thing that I would think would work with the Amico.
5199000	5206000	Because it's four player, it's single screen, it fits the formula.
5206000	5209000	Let me sidebar a little bit here. Because it didn't make tonight's show roll.
5209000	5211000	But I definitely saw it on our Discord server.
5211000	5213000	And somebody had posted it there.
5213000	5217000	Which, you know, cheap plug for our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
5217000	5218000	V-O-G network.
5218000	5224000	And then, actually, in a way, I kind of like it when Bobby and us pick completely different stories.
5224000	5228000	But I'm going to talk about it anyway, because I want to know Loki's opinion.
5228000	5231000	Bobby talked about it on his show, the Intellivision, what was it?
5231000	5234000	Ten game design principles or something like that?
5234000	5239000	It's the Ten Commandments, basically, but for the Amico.
5239000	5242000	Yes, and I was trying to bring that up real quick.
5242000	5244000	Yeah, you were actually bringing up the list so you could read them.
5244000	5245000	Thou shalt not.
5245000	5247000	That's fine. We're running a little ahead on time tonight.
5247000	5251000	So, the Ten Commandments of game design, they say.
5251000	5255000	This is, I think, mainly pertaining to the Intellivision, obviously.
5255000	5259000	Every game must be rated E or E10+.
5259000	5263000	So, no violence or sex. Well, what fun is that?
5263000	5267000	No Leisure Suit Larry on the Intellivision.
5267000	5270000	At least not a very good version of Leisure Suit Larry.
5270000	5272000	Family friendly. All right, fine. Family friendly.
5272000	5276000	Leisure Suit Larry, a guy who actually sells Leisure Suits, yeah.
5277000	5280000	Yes, just like Al Bundy was just a shoe salesman.
5280000	5282000	That's it. The game is just selling shoes.
5282000	5288000	All right. Every game must be easily playable without the need for complicated or long instructions.
5289000	5295000	Number three. Every game must be balanced to allow players with very different ability levels to still have fun.
5296000	5299000	There's a lot of room for interpretation with that one.
5299000	5306000	Every game must rate 7 out of 10 or above on Intellivision's quality control scale.
5306000	5312000	What the fuck is that? Like, what is that? What are even the criteria of that?
5312000	5319000	Every game must cost less than $10. Every game must support the official Intellivision controllers.
5319000	5321000	I would hope so, yeah.
5321000	5325000	I mean, like, I'm sorry. You can't play the game with this controller that comes with the system.
5325000	5332000	Well, let's back up because weren't you supposed to be able to use your cell phone as a controller and isn't it going to be...
5332000	5333000	But it's optional, though.
5333000	5338000	Wasn't Bluetooth with existing controllers a thing? Like, correct me if I'm wrong. I feel like that was a thing.
5338000	5339000	Yeah.
5339000	5342000	Okay, but they want to say that, like, you can't just say, oh, a PlayStation 4 controller will work.
5342000	5345000	You have to integrate with the official Intellivision controller in some way.
5345000	5346000	Yes.
5346000	5355000	Again, as much as it sounds like a commandment or whatever, I kind of feel like, well, this is actually a rule on Sony's side, on Microsoft's side, even Nintendo's side.
5355000	5358000	Like, this isn't exactly, like, a new thing.
5358000	5372000	Yeah. Every, let's see here, every game, this is number seven, every game must be 2D or 2.5D, 3D models, okay, but no free roaming 3D worlds.
5372000	5375000	I don't know about that.
5375000	5382000	Well, I'm sure a lot of this has to do with, and Bobby talked about it on his show a little bit, the technical limitations of, you know, the Amico.
5382000	5387000	But let that be up to the developers that figure out what the technical limitations are.
5387000	5401000	Well, here's my question. Like, I, believe it or not, I kind of get where this is going because I know, you know, I put myself back in the shoes of the day when Zelda first came out on Nintendo 64, even Mario 64.
5401000	5405000	I was kind of, like, put off by it at first because I was, like, this is weird.
5405000	5410000	This isn't the type of game that I was, like, looking to play. I want something like Mario World or Yoshi Island or something.
5410000	5413000	Like, where's that type of game? I don't want all these 3D things.
5413000	5420000	And I think there were a lot of other gamers, maybe in a certain age range, I don't know, like me, that maybe felt that way at first.
5420000	5426000	Now, I've come around on 3D games since then. Like, I have a lot of love for things like, you know, Elder Scrolls.
5426000	5429000	I love Breath of the Wild if you want to go back to Zelda and so forth.
5429000	5436000	But I also understand there may be a technical limitation. But here's where I start to get, like, question-y. It's, like, well, what about, like, a racing game?
5436000	5442000	I mean, a racing game, yes, could be on a track, but what about, like, an open world racing game?
5442000	5447000	Yeah, or, like, there might be a technical limitation, too, that I'm just not thinking of.
5447000	5452000	And, like, what are we calling, like, a 3D game? Because, like, let's imagine a 3D world, okay, or they're saying 2.5D.
5452000	5461000	Like, a game like Gauntlet Legends, okay, which I would think, I guess you can kind of say that's 2.5D, but that could easily be a multiplayer game.
5461000	5467000	It's 3D, though, but you're going to say no to that because, I mean...
5467000	5472000	Okay, Bobby says, specifically says, Gauntlet is 2.5D and it's perfect.
5472000	5480000	But, like, what if I wanted to make something like Gauntlet but in 3D? Like, I don't understand. It's, like, I think it's a dumb move.
5480000	5493000	I actually don't think I see your point, Loki, because I think it's pretty well accepted that, like, a game like Gauntlet, or let's say this new Zelda reimagining, like, Link's Awakening, is, like, a perfect type of, like, what a 2.5D game should be.
5493000	5501000	I actually think Gauntlet in a full 3D space would look like Wolfenstein 3D and it would be terrible. Like, it's not really a Gauntlet game at that point.
5501000	5507000	So, like, I got a needle back on that one. I don't think you need to make a game like Gauntlet 3D.
5507000	5518000	I don't know. Every game must be an Intellivision exclusive. Even ports must be unique in some way. Wolf, the report, they're not exclusive. I'm sorry. I don't even count that.
5518000	5521000	No in-game purchasing or DLC.
5521000	5525000	Now, you gotta like that one. A lot of people are very excited about that one.
5525000	5533000	I guess. That's fine. Every game must incorporate local multiplayer, couch, co-op, or versus mode.
5533000	5542000	And there's your Ten Commandments. I think they should have teen rated games in there, honestly.
5542000	5549000	It makes the goal of this system very clear. This is for family game night. Period.
5549000	5558000	That is the type of system that Tommy and company want to make. And, you know, there are some things in here that are gonna really turn off the big developers.
5558000	5566000	Like, Activision and EA, they're not gonna develop for this thing. That whole rule on DLC, they're not gonna be able to get the Frostbite engine running on this thing.
5566000	5573000	So, they're not gonna make games for Intellivision. Intellivision is really going to be powered by independent developers.
5573000	5581000	So, you know, there's a lot of great indie games out there. Something like Untitled Goose Game would meet all of these conditions, right?
5581000	5583000	No, it wouldn't. It's a 3D game.
5584000	5587000	I wouldn't technically go under the 2.5D rule.
5587000	5588000	No, it's a 3D game.
5588000	5599000	I would say it's 2.5D. You might be thinking in the programmer sense that it's rendered in 3D or things like that, but I say Untitled Goose Game is 2.5D and would fit.
5599000	5602000	There's depth to it. It's not on rails or anything.
5602000	5603000	Bobby agrees with me. It's 2.5.
5603000	5611000	It is not 2.5D. If that's the case, then the only way you're saying that's 2.5D is based on where the camera's placed.
5611000	5613000	Because the camera's placed overhead.
5613000	5617000	In my opinion, you're being too technical. That's why you're not...
5617000	5622000	But I have to look at it like that because that's the thing. It's like, whatever. You know what? That's fine.
5622000	5629000	I'm just curious to see what games come out on this because if they restrict it too much, they're not gonna get good games on it, I think.
5629000	5631000	But we'll have to wait and see.
5632000	5643000	I don't necessarily hate these commandments, but it does definitely draw some hard lines in a box for Intellivision, and I think it's kind of a risky thing.
5643000	5649000	And to me, there's a lot in here that does seem, and I hate to do this because I know a lot of people are saying this about Intellivision,
5649000	5657000	but there's a lot in here that really is reminiscent of the Ouya in some ways, but the Ouya didn't have Tommy Tallarico.
5657000	5662000	I do think there are some things about gaming that Tommy understands very well.
5662000	5669000	Heck, my husband and I met at a Video Games Live concert, so I suppose I owe Tommy that of some sort.
5669000	5677000	But I still think that it's boxed away a little bit, but there's something about it where I'm just kind of like,
5677000	5680000	you know what? If anybody's gonna pull this off, I think it's gonna be this group.
5680000	5683000	But it really is going to depend on the strength of the games.
5683000	5690000	So, okay, you showed us the rules. We've seen glimpses, frames of some of these games, but like, you know,
5690000	5695000	and I understand this console is still over a year out, right? Or almost a year out.
5695000	5698000	By the time some of you hear this, it'll be a year out because it's 10, 10, 20, right?
5698000	5703000	So, that's why we haven't really seen the games yet, but in the coming months, and as we start to move into 2020,
5703000	5709000	we really need to see the games because that, I mean, rules be damned. If the games suck, they suck.
5709000	5716000	If the games are great, which there can be great games that follow these rules, and I would say Untitled Goose Game is one of them.
5716000	5721000	Although, well, I will say where Untitled Goose Game fails is that you can't do a port. You have to do your own game.
5721000	5725000	And I don't think Goose Game has the multiplayer or any of that stuff.
5725000	5732000	But games like it could still stand to do very well on television. Television could still have a breakout indie hit.
5732000	5736000	So, we'll see. We'll see. It's gonna really depend on the strength of those games.
5736000	5743000	All right. Anyway, that wasn't technically on the show roll, but it was worth discussing just because I think it is something that people are bringing up this week.
5743000	5753000	So, all right. Anyhow, let's talk about, and Bobby says it's their implementation of the Nintendo seal of quality. Interesting.
5753000	5757000	No, I get that, but like they say, it has a score of 7 out of 10 based on what criteria?
5757000	5764000	Well, we don't know yet, but I assume we're going to as we hear about more about what games are going to be on it.
5764000	5770000	I would imagine it would be things like, you know, crashes and, you know, just how it runs and things like that. We'll see.
5770000	5773000	Can we talk about UK release dates?
5773000	5777000	Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I thought you were doing, I thought that's when we got on the Intellivision tangent. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
5777000	5785000	No, we didn't. We got a whole different tangent. So, UK. We've got Call of Cthulhu. That's coming out on Nintendo Switch.
5785000	5791000	Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch.
5791000	5795000	Grid is coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5795000	5801000	They have a World of Warcraft 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition coming out on PC.
5801000	5806000	Trine 4 out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
5806000	5811000	They also have a Trine Ultimate Collection on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch.
5811000	5817000	Concrete Genia on PlayStation 4. Frostpunk on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5817000	5821000	Indivisible on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5821000	5824000	This is going to be a tough one.
5824000	5830000	Eternio Blade, that's on PlayStation 4 and Switch.
5830000	5835000	VR Ping Pong Pro on PlayStation 4.
5835000	5841000	And then we have, looks like, I'm sorry, the one I read before, Grid Ultimate Edition.
5841000	5846000	Now we have just the regular edition of Grid coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
5846000	5852000	Northgard on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch. And that's it.
5852000	5859000	All right. Let's go to the mailbag. Every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
5859000	5865000	And we read our favorites here on the show and discuss whatever questions you guys might bring up.
5865000	5870000	We have one email tonight, and tonight's email is from Robert M., who asks,
5870000	5878000	With Microsoft putting out a dual monitor surface, could Square put out a real The World Ends With You remaster?
5878000	5881000	That's it. That's the tweet. That's the email this week from Robert M.
5881000	5885000	If you want to email us a question, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
5885000	5889000	So, did you see this whole thing with the new Microsoft device, the two screen thing?
5889000	5894000	I just saw the pictures. I didn't see the whole, you know, I saw the tweets basically because, you know, I was busy with work.
5894000	5897000	But I was catching up a little bit and I saw some of the tweets of the device.
5897000	5901000	It is, it's finally that foldable phone a lot of people were talking about.
5901000	5902000	Well, it's not.
5902000	5903000	Or that idea is not phone, but you know.
5903000	5906000	It's not because it's basically two different screens.
5906000	5911000	They don't have it, like, it's not one continuous screen like the foldable phones, which I hear the foldable phones.
5911000	5918000	Still very fragile and breaking after, you know, a much shorter period of time than they said they would break.
5918000	5921000	It's a neat idea, I guess.
5921000	5924000	I don't know about like the two screens on there.
5924000	5926000	One laptop I saw that looked pretty cool.
5926000	5931000	They have one that actually has like the keyboard kind of towards the bottom of the unit.
5931000	5937000	And then there's like a half screen in between, like kind of there to use for like utility.
5937000	5940000	You know, could be like touch screen buttons or something like that.
5940000	5941000	That's kind of cool.
5941000	5945000	I don't know necessarily if I'd need that screen real estate on.
5945000	5946000	I don't know.
5946000	5950000	Maybe I like having three screens at home to work on things.
5950000	5956000	But like with the Surface, I don't know.
5956000	5958000	I need to use my Surface more.
5958000	5964000	I think to answer the question in the email, quite frankly, about the whole world ends with you remake.
5964000	5966000	Square can do whatever the fuck they want.
5966000	5969000	Quite frankly, that's my that's my honest answer is that can they do it?
5969000	5972000	Sure, if they want to.
5972000	5974000	Will they?
5974000	5976000	I don't know if they'll go back and revisit that game.
5976000	5979000	I don't know how well it sold on the Switch.
5979000	5982000	I don't feel like it was as much of a powerhouse as it was on the DS.
5982000	5985000	But I feel like that game might have done OK on tablets and things like that.
5985000	5987000	So who knows?
5987000	5990000	But I would imagine they have to go back and repurpose some things.
5990000	5995000	So I would think that enough of these devices have to sell for Square to be able to say,
5995000	5999000	Oh, there is you know what? How many potential sales could we get?
5999000	6002000	How many devices are there are out there?
6002000	6007000	So I kind of feel like that hurdle has to be crossed first before a company like Square is going to say,
6007000	6011000	Oh, and we're going to make this get we're going to put these resources.
6011000	6015000	Yes, the game's already made, but you still have to adapt it for this resolution.
6015000	6019000	And, you know, the confines of this system and, you know, whatever other challenges there are,
6019000	6026000	it's not just as easy as, you know, oh, select recompile and to phone to screen Microsoft device.
6026000	6029000	You can't do that. You have to actually go in and tweak a whole lot more than that.
6029000	6031000	That's going to take resources.
6031000	6036000	So the question is, is it going to sell enough to recoup for those resources now?
6036000	6041000	And with Microsoft also like do Microsoft devices sell very well in Japan?
6041000	6046000	No. And so I think that's another reason that Square probably not high on their list.
6046000	6050000	But if, you know, 10 billion of these things sell, OK, they're not really going to sell that many.
6050000	6054000	But even if several million of these things sold, then, you know, maybe they'll evaluate that.
6054000	6060000	I mean, shit, we poke fun at the OUYA, but Square did put Final Fantasy three on the OUYA.
6060000	6065000	And a lot of that was based on because everybody was talking about the console at that time
6065000	6070000	and they saw the potential for sales to be very large for that device.
6070000	6072000	And I think they were building it for Android anyway.
6072000	6077000	And I think putting something on OUYA that you had done for an Android was pretty easy.
6077000	6079000	And the resources were very minimal.
6079000	6084000	But I think designing for the two-screen Microsoft device is going to be a little more challenging.
6084000	6090000	And I don't see Square jumping on board unless enough devices exist to make it worth their while.
6090000	6093000	So let's see.
6093000	6096000	Looking in chat, TigerClaw is saying, I got a dual screen setup.
6096000	6100000	I also heard that Loki also got a 144 hertz monitor.
6100000	6104000	Once you go 144, you can never go back to 60. Is this a thing?
6104000	6108000	Yeah. I had one of my monitors die, so I bought a new one that's 144.
6108000	6113000	And then I saw a nicer one that was cheaper, like, literally the day after I bought mine.
6113000	6116000	Oh, well. I'll wait for the other one to die.
6116000	6121000	I have an interesting setup at my new job because I have two monitors at my new job.
6121000	6124000	And one of them is a gigantic monitor, and I love it.
6124000	6128000	Like, the resolution. Oh, my God. Like, I can do so much on that monitor.
6128000	6132000	And then I have kind of, like, the crappy Square monitor, my second monitor.
6132000	6137000	And it's kind of like, oh, it's like watching the movie Twins with Schwarzenegger and DeVito.
6137000	6140000	It's like, one of these monitors is very good.
6140000	6144000	But it's a great email and instant message monitor.
6144000	6147000	Like, my email and instant message is over there while I'm designing my documents and stuff.
6147000	6153000	Right, exactly. So that's why I have, like, I made my main monitor, the 144, so I can play games on it if I want.
6153000	6156000	But I don't really use it a lot for, like, gaming too much anymore.
6156000	6160000	I just, like, I don't know. It's nice to have it because it's also brighter.
6160000	6164000	So, like, I usually do web browsing on it so I can see everything, like, stands out much more.
6164000	6171000	Plus, I had a problem with some of the games and even just, like, YouTube videos and stuff that it would smear.
6171000	6176000	Like, it was just very, like, it was not a very high quality monitor, the first one.
6176000	6180000	And the 144 one is much nicer. I get it. It's not the best panel out there.
6180000	6182000	But I wasn't trying to get a really good monitor.
6182000	6186000	I was just trying to get a cheap monitor that happened to be just something quickly I could replace.
6186000	6188000	That right balance between money and quality.
6188000	6192000	Yeah, exactly. Just something cheap that I wanted to replace the old one with so that I had a new monitor.
6192000	6195000	I want to remind everybody, we don't make money off this show.
6195000	6198000	I mean, yes, yes, you're very kind to give your biddies and your subs and things,
6198000	6202000	but they're not going to pay for Loki to have a $500 monitor.
6202000	6209000	They're going to pay for mic stands and, you know, small festival scholarships.
6209000	6214000	So we can get the name of our shows out there more. So, um, you know, we don't, we don't pocket money.
6214000	6217000	I think it's safe to say we don't pocket money off these shows.
6217000	6220000	So Loki and myself still have to think about the budget.
6220000	6225000	Yeah. All right. So it worked out. It was nice. It's nicer than the one I had.
6225000	6227000	All right, let's move on. We have some more stories to get to,
6227000	6232000	and then we're going to open up our discord for your calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6232000	6234000	But we do have some stories for you first, Loki.
6234000	6238000	So you may remember there was a lawsuit between Randy Pitchford
6238000	6248000	and his company's former lawyer, Wade Callender, that apparently they have now dismissed.
6248000	6253000	And this is becoming, they said, because they've resolved all claims between them.
6253000	6259000	And upon review of the, all of the evidence in the case, it was the opinion of counsel.
6259000	6263000	The evidence exonerated Randy Pitchford from the allegations against him.
6263000	6267000	All misunderstandings between parties have been corrected and we apologize,
6267000	6273000	or the apologies were exchanged because the parties are mutually bound by confidentiality.
6273000	6276000	No additional statements will be forthcoming.
6276000	6281000	So the lawsuit ended the way they always do. It was settled and there's a gag order.
6281000	6285000	That's it. You don't get to find out the finer details of what really happened.
6285000	6287000	Exactly.
6287000	6290000	Just that you probably won't be hearing about this ever again.
6290000	6292000	Yes. For now.
6292000	6294000	For now. All right.
6294000	6298000	Moving on, talking about PlayStation 4 cross-play.
6298000	6300000	Officially out of beta.
6300000	6306000	So yeah, this week Sony has announced that the cross-play feature is out of beta.
6306000	6309000	Now the publisher actually, they didn't make an official announcement about this.
6309000	6313000	This announcement kind of came through like Wired was like doing an interview with them.
6313000	6317000	But kind of interesting that Sony didn't exactly want to blow the lid off of this.
6317000	6320000	But maybe because people, you know, they still are trying to really push that message
6320000	6322000	like Sony is the place to play and all that stuff.
6322000	6327000	But this is really great. So now more games will have that cross-play at least available.
6327000	6329000	It doesn't mean every game is going to do it.
6329000	6332000	Like I don't think Overwatch is suddenly going to have cross-play like we were hoping.
6332000	6334000	But you never know. Never say never.
6334000	6337000	Maybe more things like Elder Scrolls Legends.
6337000	6340000	Bethesda said they weren't going to put it on Sony's platform until this issue was resolved.
6340000	6342000	Well, it's resolved.
6342000	6348000	Oh no! We couldn't get Elder Scrolls Legends on the platform? Oh darn!
6348000	6351000	Nothing of value is lost.
6351000	6355000	I'm giving you one example.
6355000	6361000	That's basically Elder Scrolls Legends is the developer version of that to the players.
6361000	6367000	It's just like, hey, you want a new Elder Scrolls game? Here's some shit for you.
6367000	6374000	Anyway, Sony, of course, doing this in advance of the next round of consoles.
6374000	6379000	Supporting cross-play is going to be very interesting in this as we go into, you know,
6379000	6384000	Microsoft having their own console, Nintendo bringing people back to the Switch and so forth.
6384000	6388000	So it's nice to hear that this is out of beta at this point.
6388000	6392000	SSG100Matt replied to your little Loki with, or excuse me, your little rant there,
6392000	6396000	Loki with Sheesh and the salty multi-con several times.
6396000	6399000	There's no salt at all. The game's crap.
6399000	6400000	It's just not a good game.
6400000	6402000	It's just not a good game. You know, whatever.
6402000	6404000	Yeah. All right.
6404000	6407000	I'm over it. I mean, I wasn't even like interested in playing it.
6407000	6412000	Well, let's move from salt to crack. Let's talk about drugs.
6412000	6418000	Okay, maybe not specifically drugs, but apparently some people say video games are like drugs, right?
6418000	6422000	Yes. According to a legal notice filed in Quebec,
6422000	6427000	on the behalf of two children who became so devoted to the game Fortnite,
6427000	6434000	that they said that it triggered release of reward neurotransmitter dopamine.
6434000	6437000	Really anything you can be addicted to, but whatever.
6437000	6442000	They said the addiction to Fortnite has real consequences of the lives of the players.
6442000	6446000	Several don't eat or shower and no longer socialize.
6446000	6450000	Adding that players have been forced to seek treatment for their addiction.
6452000	6458000	But the question, where are the parents? Because seriously, like it's kids.
6458000	6460000	So where are the fucking parents?
6460000	6465000	You said it very on the nose early on, and I don't give you credit for that.
6465000	6470000	Let's file a lawsuit instead, because then that means I don't have to take responsibility for them.
6470000	6473000	It's the game makers who should take responsibility for my kids.
6473000	6476000	You can be addicted to just about anything. That's it.
6476000	6478000	It's not the game makers fault.
6478000	6482000	And I don't want to make light of addiction issues or addictive personalities or things like that,
6482000	6484000	because that is very serious.
6484000	6488000	And I hope they're able to get treatment and work through that and so forth.
6488000	6491000	So I'm not going to make fun of the kids. I wouldn't do that anyway.
6491000	6495000	But I think it is fair to say, where are the parents?
6495000	6500000	And I think it's also fair to say this is not the game makers problem that this happens.
6500000	6505000	Because if it wasn't this, it would probably have been a different game or something else.
6505000	6508000	It doesn't really specify, like they said there's game mechanics designed to make,
6508000	6511000	I think they're talking about the loot boxes.
6511000	6514000	Although I don't think Fortnite really has loot boxes like that.
6514000	6519000	But they're saying that it's likened to how gamblers get hooked on slot machines.
6519000	6523000	The argument is very weak, but let's just say, for example,
6523000	6527000	it was they were addicted to getting the skins or loot in the game.
6527000	6530000	Who's providing them with the money for that? The parents.
6530000	6538000	I mean, if they don't eat or shower for a long time, who's responsible for that? The parents.
6538000	6545000	If I wasn't doing that stuff as a kid, my mother, she'd always threatened to take the cord, right?
6545000	6551000	If she couldn't figure out the cord, I swear to God, she would go out and turn the master power off to the house if she had to,
6551000	6553000	to get me to stop playing those games.
6553000	6556000	So that is what, you know, there is some responsibility.
6557000	6559000	There's so many things that the parents could do here.
6559000	6563000	Epic has money, everybody talks about Fortnite, so that's why.
6563000	6568000	You know, in one way, I'm a little relieved to hear this isn't just a problem in America.
6568000	6570000	Now it's Canada's problem too.
6570000	6574000	These types of lawsuits. Silly, silly.
6574000	6579000	Yeah, they said the Quebec Superior Court could spend up a year deliberating on whether a class action can proceed.
6579000	6582000	I don't think so. That's stupid.
6582000	6589000	And honestly, the reason why I think it's stupid is because if we're going to make this argument that this game is addictive,
6589000	6593000	therefore they're responsible for everybody, then you can make the argument about all games.
6593000	6600000	And it's just, this is not, I get it, you want to pick battles in the gaming industry, this is not the battle to pick.
6600000	6602000	Pick the battle with the loot boxes and shit.
6602000	6604000	That's the battle that you want to pick.
6604000	6607000	But like saying, oh well this game is good so they're addicted to it.
6608000	6614000	You know, I just don't see this as a problem.
6614000	6619000	Just parents intervene. Seriously.
6619000	6622000	I don't understand why this is a problem.
6622000	6624000	Well it's a parent problem.
6624000	6626000	It is a parent problem.
6626000	6630000	But you would be surprised. There's a lot of parents out there that just don't know how to parent.
6630000	6638000	But honestly, if my kids were addicted to a certain game, and my son, he's really into Roblox, but guess what?
6638000	6642000	He can't buy anything in Roblox if I don't give him money to spend in Roblox.
6642000	6648000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yeah, but nowadays kids can play Fortnite on their cell phone even when the power is still out.
6648000	6649000	So it's so hard.
6649000	6652000	Who the fuck is buying them a goddamn cell phone?
6652000	6655000	Who's paying for that cell phone? It's not them.
6655000	6661000	I think the question was asked with the tongue in the cheek, but I mean, if you want to ask the question real, then yes.
6661000	6662000	Take away the fucking phone.
6662000	6664000	Yeah, who bought them the phone? Take away the phone.
6664000	6670000	Let's just say hypothetically that they're like 16 or something like that and they have a job and they're paying for their own phone.
6670000	6672000	They bought their own phone or something like that.
6672000	6675000	Like, fuck dude.
6675000	6679000	Well they won't be having a job for very long if they're not showering and not doing anything.
6679000	6682000	Not socializing with people and all they're doing is playing Fortnite.
6682000	6685000	And so like that will solve itself right there.
6685000	6689000	But like, ah, parents are dumb.
6689000	6690000	Sometimes.
6690000	6697000	SHO 100 Matt with an interesting perspective, saying my girlfriend is a fifth grade teacher and a lot of her students are Fortnite players.
6697000	6700000	Many of her students' parents have different tactics to limit screen time.
6700000	6709000	The kids who play until 5 a.m. are obsessed like the kids in the suit have parents who are not at home at all times because of different situations.
6710000	6716000	Well, I mean, you've got to, to what priority is raising the kid then?
6716000	6721000	If you're going to rely on Epic Games to raise your kid, then is it really their fault?
6721000	6723000	Like, I don't know.
6723000	6731000	There are things you can do like just saying, well, I can't, you know, then don't give them the computer when they're at home.
6731000	6735000	Or you can set up, you know, options in your router to where you shut off.
6736000	6739000	Like you can do it based on Mac address or something.
6739000	6742000	Shut off the internet to that device during this time period.
6742000	6746000	I mean, there's so many things you can do just giving up and saying, well, I'm not home because I got to work.
6746000	6748000	I'm sorry.
6748000	6756000	That's how your children become crackheads and fucking gang, gang bangers because, well, I guess they were not going to because they're playing Fortnite all the time.
6756000	6763000	So they're never going to go outside and socialize with gang members or do crack because they're not going to have any money because they're too busy.
6763000	6765000	Fortnite keeps your kids off crack.
6765000	6767000	At least I want you to be thankful for that.
6767000	6769000	Fortnite kept your kid off crack.
6769000	6771000	Yeah, that's what they should say.
6771000	6773000	It's like cocaine.
6773000	6775000	Well, at least they're not on real cocaine.
6775000	6777000	Have you thought about that?
6777000	6779000	Oh, I never thought about that.
6779000	6781000	I guess it isn't such a bad thing.
6782000	6785000	It's like things as they were in the 80s haven't changed.
6785000	6794000	It's just instead of kids going off alone to the park without needing parental guidance, now they're meeting strangers online through online games even though the parent might be around.
6794000	6802000	You know, I'm 41 and I was meeting strangers online when I was 13, but I wouldn't really get to meet them in person because my parents would have never.
6802000	6805000	Oh, my mom was convinced everybody I was talking to online was going to kill me.
6805000	6809000	Like think about all the things that are worse for kids to be doing.
6810000	6816000	You could still talk to people online through BBSs and stuff. It wasn't as easy as it is now.
6816000	6822000	Like, are they doing drugs? Are they causing violence in the real world? Are they going around fucking people?
6822000	6826000	I mean, no, they're not doing all those things. They're playing a game. Then fucking lay off of it.
6826000	6830000	Or if you really have a problem with it, parent. I don't understand the problem here.
6830000	6832000	Alright, let's move on.
6834000	6835000	This is stupid.
6835000	6838000	Moving on to the next story. Loki, you have another story for us.
6838000	6845000	So Rocket League, and I guess Epic Games by part, they're trying to let you know, hey, we're the good guys.
6845000	6850000	We're getting rid of loot boxes and instead now you're going to get blueprints.
6850000	6856000	Blueprints, they're different than loot boxes, but not. Sort of.
6856000	6863000	Because apparently you get blueprints at the end of matches and they're unlocked with keys that you have to pay for real money for.
6863000	6869000	But at least you'll know what they're for. And that's how it's different because it's not a surprise.
6870000	6874000	They still have to open them with a key. Sounds like Counter-Strike.
6875000	6882000	Whatever. I guess that's slightly better. But they really want us to praise them because they did the right thing.
6885000	6886000	Good job.
6886000	6899000	Alright, moving on into news that is a little bit sadder. We lost Kirby this week. That's right, Kirby passed away.
6899000	6908000	I'm not talking about that cute little pink thing in Nintendo's series of video games, but I am talking about the namesake for Kirby in those Nintendo games.
6909000	6920000	John Kirby was an actual lawyer who represented Nintendo in the company's 1984 legal case about Donkey Kong and the lawsuit versus King Kong.
6920000	6928000	I don't know if you knew that, but back in the 80s, Universal tried to sue Nintendo saying Donkey Kong is too much like King Kong because they climbed buildings.
6928000	6937000	So anyway, John Kirby, who was a lawyer, helped Nintendo win that case and that's why we still have Donkey Kong and it's gone on all these years.
6937000	6946000	So Kirby ended up with a franchise named after him, basically. So yeah, John Kirby was the namesake for the actual Kirby character.
6946000	6953000	But unfortunately, John Kirby did pass away on October 2nd from a form of blood cancer, so that's sad to hear that.
6953000	6961000	You can read the full obituary in the New York Times and you can hear about some of the other legal things that John Kirby had worked with.
6962000	6971000	But rest in peace, that is always sad to hear. I want to say, didn't we lose the namesake for Mario recently too? I thought that was something kind of recent as well.
6971000	6981000	Anyway, Bobby's pointing out in chat that we also lost Rip Taylor today. There's been several celebrities this week, hasn't there?
6981000	6992000	Rip Taylor. I remember seeing the reruns of, what was it called, the $1.98 beauty pageant. It was like the Gong Show, but it was more like a beauty pageant type of thing.
6992000	7000000	And he was on the 80s Hollywood Squares that was on USA Network all the time. So yeah, rest in peace.
7000000	7002000	Hanging confetti.
7002000	7010000	Yeah, Darticuia says that was last week. I don't think it was last week, but I think it was last month. Yeah, the landlord for Nintendo's original office. That's right, it was Mario and that.
7010000	7019000	Anyway, moving on. I think that's all we have for our officially slated news articles tonight.
7019000	7028000	So we're going to open up our Discord for calls. If you want to call into the show tonight, you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7028000	7035000	We'll be taking calls from our green room here if you want to join in and talk about anything we have talked about tonight or maybe something different.
7035000	7043000	While we wait to see if any calls come in, you can also ask questions in chat if you want. You can say anything you want in the chat, well, within reason.
7043000	7051000	You can ask anything or say anything you want in chat there and we'll bring that up in studio if it necessitates that.
7051000	7053000	But otherwise, do we have any last minute stories you want to talk about tonight?
7053000	7055000	No.
7055000	7068000	It was a little bit of a slower news week, all things considered, so I think that's why we've kind of blown through the news pretty fast tonight because some of these stories like, wow, Gearbox and the lawyers settled out of court. There you go. I guess it's worth bringing up. There's not a lot else to say about it, right?
7068000	7076000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. There wasn't really much that went on this week. I worked on my game some more.
7076000	7083000	Bobby wants us to argue more about 2.5D as indeed a 3D game world with a fixed camera angle, but I don't want to keep fighting.
7084000	7098000	Like 2.5D, I get that, you know, I know what it is and like, I think, but like, okay, let's not even go like 2.5D, but like I'm on board with what you're saying, but like a racing game or something like that, like Rad Racer.
7098000	7105000	I mean, technically it's like a 2D game, but like say a more 3D, let's say like Sega Rally or Daytona or something like that.
7105000	7107000	Yes, Daytona for Intellivision.
7111000	7120000	There you go. Like I'm down with that, but like, see that, that's something like I could totally see as like a, like a game that would be available on that, but you can't because it's 3D.
7121000	7131000	So, I mean, unless it's like simulated 2D, like we're talking like Outrun or the simulated 3D, like Outrun or something like that, you know, maybe then they could do it.
7131000	7141000	So like, I really want to see what games they have because like, I got to be honest, like the trailer that they showed off, I wasn't like, Ooh, I got to get this.
7141000	7147000	I was like, Ooh, that looks like pretty generic shit, but like I need to see what the games are.
7147000	7154000	Not to say that they couldn't do anything good because there's a lot of like really good indie games that are like couch co-op games that I could see would be pretty fun.
7154000	7160000	Well, let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says, I haven't seen Tommy being asked about Daytona or Pole Position.
7160000	7164000	Well, I'm going to do some investigative journalism right now.
7164000	7170000	Tommy, Tommy, does that, does that count? Well, Pole Position was a 2D game, so.
7173000	7179000	And I mean, really, when you think about it, aren't all the games 2D anyways, because they're on a screen, it's just really how it's being rendered.
7179000	7187000	I mean, let's, my games aren't jumping out of the screen, so everything's 2D. All's fair game.
7188000	7195000	You have to keep talking because I'm tweeting. Oh, OK. Does a racing game like Daytona meet the Intellivision Commandments?
7196000	7202000	Because it's kinda 3D, but not.
7204000	7209000	I don't know. It should. But it's a racing game.
7209000	7215000	Well, we'll have to, we'll have to do Ivan Ironman, Stewart's, you know, Super Off-Road or something like that.
7216000	7219000	Why can't there be 3D exploration?
7219000	7223000	Good luck with launch. OK.
7225000	7231000	There's the tweet. Does a racing game like Daytona meet the Intellivision Commandments? Because it's kinda 3D, but it's a racing game now.
7231000	7236000	Oh, see, I had a typo. I'm glad, I'm glad I proof read with you all live on there.
7236000	7240000	Not 3D exploration. Thank you. Good luck with launch.
7240000	7242000	See, I was even polite at the end there.
7242000	7245000	There we go. We're gonna ask some damn questions.
7245000	7253000	All right. Go like it. So, go like the tweet so it bumps up on his feed because he probably gets a lot of tweets.
7253000	7259000	All right. I still don't see anybody in the green room, but let me see some of the questions in chat.
7259000	7263000	Prince Brightstar says, Shovel Knight is technically a 3D game even though it looks 2D.
7263000	7269000	And I think that, I think it's more about how it really looks than how it's necessarily developed behind the scenes.
7269000	7272000	Because isn't that the thing? It's in one of those engines like Unity or something.
7272000	7276000	Like even a 2D game in Unity is actually a 3D game, but it's just like the camera is up top.
7276000	7279000	It's on a 2D playing field, right? Isn't that a thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
7279000	7281000	Let me, the physics and everything.
7281000	7286000	Like, I'm not gonna profess to be an expert game developer, but I've picked up little pieces over the years.
7286000	7292000	That's the only one that I see as a problem for me is that, that commandment. The rest are fine.
7292000	7297000	It's just limiting it to 2D. I get it if your hardware can't run it or if,
7297000	7304000	but like the fact that you say, well, it can't be this because I can't think of any way that you can accomplish the other commandments.
7304000	7308000	Just because you haven't thought of something doesn't mean it's not possible.
7308000	7311000	And I don't think you should limit your developers based on that.
7311000	7317000	I get the intent of it, but I think that he's wrong. That's all I'm saying.
7317000	7321000	I think that there's, I think unlike the Ten Commandments from God,
7321000	7326000	I feel like the Ten Commandments from Talarico have a little bit of room for negotiation.
7326000	7332000	You know what I mean? Like, I feel like anything can kind of violate these rules if it's good enough.
7332000	7335000	You know what I mean? Like, I just, you know what I mean?
7335000	7338000	I feel like there's room for negotiation where it's like thou shall not kill.
7338000	7341000	Probably not a lot of negotiation with something like that.
7341000	7344000	But I feel like the Talarico Commandments, you know, anyway.
7344000	7349000	All right. Let's move on. Oh, I thought I saw someone in the green room, but they disappeared.
7349000	7351000	All right. They got shy. Who knows?
7351000	7355000	All right. We'll give it just a couple more minutes to see if anybody pops in there and then we'll wrap up shop here.
7355000	7360000	Let's see. Bobby does point out the games are still being developed. That's true.
7360000	7363000	I mean, we'll know better, like, what all this means.
7363000	7367000	Again, when we actually see more of the game footage beyond just frames.
7367000	7370000	But you know what? I'll give them this.
7370000	7375000	We've talked about that Amico way more than we've talked about what Atari's doing,
7375000	7378000	what Coleco's doing, or what a lot of other...
7378000	7380000	Coleco's not doing anything.
7380000	7384000	But I can tell you right now that the Atari system is giving me...
7385000	7388000	Well, I mean, but now we have the Anstream thing going on.
7388000	7392000	But I, you know, I kind of think, like, Anstream can kind of stand on its own.
7392000	7393000	It's going to be on, like, everything, isn't it?
7393000	7397000	Yeah. Well, it's on PC. It's on Xbox. You know, it's important, right?
7397000	7399000	So, yeah.
7399000	7403000	Kaijuta says, Tommy Talarico is making games for the flat earth believers.
7403000	7405000	Come on now.
7405000	7408000	Come on. You don't have to be like that.
7409000	7413000	But, like, I'd like to say, like, Star Fox or something like that.
7413000	7415000	Would that work? Because that's 3D.
7415000	7417000	What if it's multiplayer?
7417000	7420000	I feel like we need to have Tommy on the show.
7420000	7426000	And we just need to present, like, we'll have our PowerPoint presentation up on the wall.
7426000	7430000	What about Super Mario 64? So you're saying I can make Super Mario Kart.
7430000	7433000	What about this one? What about this one, Tommy? Is this me?
7433000	7434000	What about this one?
7434000	7435000	No, no, no. I'm sorry.
7435000	7441000	What about Super Mario Kart 64? So I can't make Super Mario Kart 64, but I can make Super Mario Kart, because that's okay.
7441000	7445000	Okay, Bobby says most YouTubers are actually doing that to Tommy.
7445000	7447000	They're going, what about this, this, this?
7447000	7449000	But are they actually asking him?
7449000	7454000	See, I'm going to say that to our credit here at OLR, at least I fucking asked.
7454000	7457000	Like, he may or may not respond. He's a busy guy.
7457000	7459000	At least I tried asking.
7459000	7462000	Shouting into the void on YouTube isn't going to cut it.
7462000	7464000	You have to at least try.
7464000	7467000	Oh, he says yes, he's going on those YouTube channels.
7467000	7472000	God, that man will take any publicity where he can get it. Good for him. Good for him.
7472000	7475000	I actually, I actually take that as a sign of, like, that's a good thing.
7475000	7481000	Like, like, if you're the type of person, like, you believe in your products so much, like, no channel is too big or too small.
7481000	7484000	Like, I actually think that's a big selling point, so.
7484000	7487000	So I'm back on the show. No channel is too big or too small.
7487000	7491000	Open fucking invite. Come on over, Tommy. I'll move Pikachu for you.
7491000	7495000	Come on over. We can get it. I don't expect Tommy to come into Sacramento, California.
7495000	7499000	So I would happily interview Tommy over the Skype or whatever you guys want to do.
7499000	7502000	So. Oh, Bobby says it's my turn.
7502000	7505000	Sure, the night y'all are gone. Yeah, we're not going to be funny enough.
7505000	7507000	Oh, how about this? How about this, Bobby?
7507000	7509000	Look, look. We're all setting up for you.
7509000	7514000	The show we're not going to be here is October 20th this year.
7514000	7517000	One year out. Start playing. You could get them that night.
7517000	7521000	You could get them that night. Why not? We'll probably record something earlier in the week, but I don't care.
7521000	7524000	You can bump us back to seven o'clock. If you're going to ask what?
7524000	7527000	If you ask about Daytona, you can bump us back to seven.
7529000	7533000	All right. All right, let's go to the phones.
7533000	7535000	I see the person that was trying to get in earlier is there now.
7535000	7538000	So let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
7539000	7542000	This is Jim Sally calling in on the show, guy.
7542000	7546000	Hey, Jim Sally. Good to hear from you again. What is on your mind, my friend?
7547000	7551000	You too, man. Let's talk about this Intellivision debacle.
7551000	7553000	Let's talk. Oh, you think it's a debacle?
7553000	7561000	Well, everyone's getting so excited about it, but the people are correct, man. They got to keep this shit simple and eloquent.
7561000	7565000	What do you mean by the people are correct? Do you mean the Intellivision people are correct?
7565000	7568000	The Intellivision people, they're all over it. They're geniuses.
7568000	7576000	I think we should definitely divert some of the money that we spend on the military and just give it to them to give us, you know, our simple games back.
7576000	7582000	Jim Sally, that's easy for you to... Wait a minute, Jim Sally. Hold on. I'm dragging you, exposing you live on air.
7582000	7586000	You're Canadian. You can't tell us how to spend our military money.
7586000	7592000	Listen, I'm telling you, we don't have very much military over here. We always have.
7592000	7603000	We have dope for everybody and some really conscientious video game designers, man, who make the greatest little video, mini video games for you.
7603000	7614000	You know what's eloquent in my family, man? I have a lot of people that can't speak English, can't use a cell phone, can't do an auto check out at the grocery store.
7614000	7622000	These motherfuckers come to my house and say, Johnny, go get the wee bowl. Go get the wee bowl.
7622000	7629000	They come upstairs and, you know, they bowl a turkey and they do that chicken dance, you know, and then the three-year-old comes up and does the same thing.
7629000	7637000	That's game, man. That's a good game, man. And those are the games that, to me, show true game design, that you're able to design that.
7637000	7643000	Everything else is fireworks and razzmatazz, you know?
7643000	7649000	You know what? You raise a damn good point in what you're saying there about the whole fact.
7649000	7652000	You mentioned that you have a lot of family members who don't speak English.
7652000	7662000	And I've said this about Intellivision before is that this is the type of console I could see doing very well in international markets and other parts of the world.
7662000	7674000	You know, when we talk about things like PlayStation, Xbox, and so forth, you know, yes, those things are pretty easy to find in the US, Canada, Japan, and most European territories.
7674000	7687000	But outside of that, when you start to go to places like, say, South America or Africa, which you know are pretty big places, but it's not as easy to find things necessarily like the Xbox or Nintendo.
7687000	7692000	Now, some of them have a presence. I don't want to say, like, they're just not in those countries because, you know, I do believe in Brazil.
7692000	7698000	I want to say Nintendo has a presence. I might be wrong with that. But I'm going to say you can all find exceptions, I'm sure.
7698000	7703000	But we can all agree there are many places in the world that don't have the most cutting-edge video games.
7703000	7715000	In fact, actually, since I mentioned Brazil, you know, I think we've often kind of had a funny haha about, oh, Brazil, they're still playing the Master System or the Sega Genesis in places like Brazil.
7715000	7727000	But maybe it's not such a haha thing because the reality is they're behind a little bit in consoles because the current stuff is way too damn expensive to import into.
7727000	7731000	Brazil is a fucking large place. There are a lot of people that live there, you know what I mean?
7731000	7735000	So, sorry, I don't mean to take too much of your time selling.
7735000	7739000	There's a lot of people that live there, but there's not a lot of discretionary income there either, my friend.
7739000	7741000	I've been there a lot.
7741000	7742000	Well, but when every-
7742000	7745000	I can tell you this from personal experience, it is not exactly-
7745000	7755000	But when every game is under $10, then that kind of shows that you're aiming towards something a little like, you know, for folks with a lower budget.
7755000	7766000	We played a lot of Super Mario Brothers 3.
7766000	7777000	Because I think you're cutting out for us a little bit, Jim Salley, but I know with a game like Super Mario Brothers 3, a good game like that will last forever.
7777000	7780000	By the way, Loki, what was that? That was a racing game that just went by on that.
7780000	7783000	By the way, Loki, what was that? That was a racing game that just went by on that.
7783000	7786000	I see you analyzing the Intellivision trailer. That was a racing game that just went by, wasn't it?
7786000	7788000	So looking for games that aren't 2.5D.
7788000	7793000	But it looked like a- that looked more like an Iron Man, or no, what was the fucking-
7793000	7794000	Super Sprint.
7794000	7797000	Super Sprint. It looked like a Super Sprint type of game. Yeah, that looks like a Super Sprint game.
7797000	7800000	Ish-esque. Not necessarily an actual Super Sprint game.
7800000	7805000	And that's like an Echo the Dolphin-esque game. Actually, that probably is Echo the Dolphin.
7806000	7814000	Well, Jim Salley, if you're still with us, I don't know, the internet might be acting a little funky, but Jim Salley, if you're still with us, like, is the Intellivision, I mean, you seem to be kind of on board with this.
7814000	7817000	Do you think this is a console you're gonna end up buying?
7817000	7823000	Oh, yeah, I'll definitely get it immediately. Only because, again, we have the various family members.
7823000	7833000	And personally, I'm a very skilled video game player, and I feel, you know, I can never really unleash my fury on people when I try to play with them at all.
7833000	7842000	But if it's something as dumb as, you know, Pong, let's get it on. Let's get it on, man.
7842000	7848000	You know what? But the right twist on Pong can still make a game like Pong fun.
7848000	7855000	You know, some people forget, but, like, they actually made a Pong game on PlayStation. You remember that?
7855000	7862000	And it actually sold pretty well, because they took Pong and they, like, kind of 3D-ified it a little bit, and they made all these...
7862000	7864000	2D-ified it.
7866000	7878000	Speaking of Pong, I remember on the Xbox, man, when they came out, it was Rockstar. I forget what they were testing, but they had that simple little ping pong game that came out, and it was just one stick back and forth, hit the X button, hit the A button.
7878000	7886000	And there wasn't really any... I don't know what the word... I don't want to say there wasn't any skill to it, but there wasn't a lot of mystique to it, like, figure it out pretty quick.
7886000	7888000	Rockstar Table Tennis, I think it was fun.
7888000	7897000	Dude, we played that more than we ever played hockey or football or anything. Like, it was getting intense. It was getting intense, man. Holy shit. Some of the battles.
7897000	7903000	We even tried to play real ping pong at one point in real life. I'm going to tell you right now, real ping pong is not as fun.
7903000	7904000	Real ping pong's hard.
7905000	7912000	Real ping pong's hard, man. You can't get a good rhythm going. But sometimes you got to play those real games, man. Let's talk about the kids and the real games, man.
7912000	7917000	And the real games. You know what's fun to play with your kids? Real games, man. Real fucking games.
7917000	7923000	I saw my kid play Minecraft. Because I was lazy this morning, and my wife wasn't home.
7924000	7933000	I said, here's your waffles. Daddy's going to, you know, read the newspaper, play some Minecraft, and he made a little racetrack. Put a little ball on it and it rolls down.
7933000	7939000	He was proud of his little racetrack. He's four years old. Yeah, he was proud of his little fucking racetrack. That's good, Daniel.
7939000	7944000	That's great for four years old, building that kind of thing. You got a genius kid, Jim Sally.
7944000	7951000	Well, you know, he's got time, man. You Canadian kids, man. It's a little bit easier up here. We got vaccinations and shit. Anyway.
7951000	7955000	Also, I want Jim Sally to make me waffles.
7955000	7959000	Dude, come over any time, Jim.
7959000	7961000	I'm on my way.
7961000	7967000	I wake up all the adults, I say, okay, adults, enough is enough. It's 10 o'clock and I want to smoke weed. Wake the fuck up.
7967000	7976000	Your house is probably, I know you joke before you live like way out in the middle of nowhere, Canada, but your house is probably easier to get to than the Video Game Hall of Fame in Iowa.
7976000	7982000	Dude, for sure, man. If you want to set up the VOG Hall of Fame, I'll gladly have the Canadian affiliate here. I could put up a barn or something.
7982000	7984000	Let me just put up some posters, man.
7984000	7990000	I'm down with that. The VOG Hall of Fame at Jim Sally's house in Canada. I'm down with that.
7990000	7995000	Where the fuck were we? Yeah, we told him about a little boy. So I told him to put his tech away.
7995000	8002000	Okay, daddy. And he went into his toy room and he started grabbing all the different tracks and shit from his fucking various Hot Wheel cars and stuff.
8002000	8008000	None of this shit matches up or nothing. It's all busted. And he sat there and he was trying to put it together.
8008000	8014000	And he just looked at me and he said, I want it to work like Minecraft, daddy.
8014000	8028000	And I understood his frustration, man, that sometimes for kids, there's a lot more fun and reward and they can kind of, they can kind of express it and dig into their creativity a little further if they have these tools in front of them.
8028000	8036000	And for a second, I thought about giving him back his fucking, his iPad. And I said, what would fucking Portuguese mama do in this situation?
8036000	8041000	Portuguese mama used to constantly give me rolls of duct tape and say, figure something out.
8041000	8046000	So I did the same thing, man. I got a roll of duct tape out and we just duct taped the shit out of all those pieces of track.
8046000	8052000	And we made a better track in real life. Put some golf balls in there, started throwing them down the fucking track.
8052000	8059000	And then the cat would come over and bat the fucking track. We'd fucking squirt the cat with a water gun. We would squirt the cat with a water gun.
8059000	8067000	And Danny would look at me and say, what's going on, Danny? He would say, daddy, I'm going to go prone so I can get a better shot.
8067000	8070000	And I say, God damn, did he learn that from a video game?
8070000	8074000	You can get prone and shoot that cat, right? And it's fucking little cat face, man.
8074000	8077000	Hey, hey, hey, be nice to the cats. Be nice to the cats.
8077000	8083000	That fucking cat, dude. My wife made me get a cat and the fucking thing is on the counter all the time eating my fucking leftover spaghetti.
8083000	8089000	He's eating my fucking, I went to go take fucking socks out of the hamper and the fucker chewed a hole in my sock. Fuck that cat, man.
8089000	8094000	Fuck him. Fuck him. I'm getting my boy every super soaker I can fucking find at Walmart this year.
8094000	8097000	That cat's going to fucking get water bored. Anyway.
8097000	8102000	I just, I have to read some of the comments. I have to read some of the comments from chat.
8102000	8106000	Because Bonds006 has taken the lesson from this. Duct tape fixes all. I agree with that.
8106000	8111000	Sg100Matt says, the world would be a better place if everyone had Jim Salley's energy. Cosign.
8116000	8117000	I'd have to agree.
8117000	8120000	Alright. Any last thoughts before I let you go, my friend?
8120000	8128000	Last thoughts, man. I'm going to put out to everybody here with video games and limiting your kids' screen time and shit.
8128000	8136000	You know what? The best way, you know, to involve your kids in screen time is to involve yourself in the screen time with them, man.
8136000	8140000	So sit down beside your kids when they're doing some shit on the fucking iPad, you know?
8140000	8146000	Maybe play a game online with them or something. I can tell you there's only two possibilities, people, okay?
8146000	8149000	Number one, you're going to learn some shit about your kids. Maybe have some fun.
8149000	8156000	Or number two, they're going to think it's, you know, stupid now because mom and dad are doing it and they're going to find something better to do.
8157000	8159000	Win-win. Win-win.
8160000	8171000	Jim Salley, when you first called into this show years and years ago on the All Games Network, I didn't think that one day we'd be getting parenting advice from you.
8171000	8175000	But here we are and it's pretty damn good advice, to be honest.
8176000	8179000	Hey, man. I got this shit all night.
8181000	8184000	Alright. Take care, my friend. It's always a pleasure to hear from you.
8184000	8186000	Yeah, man. I'll talk to you guys soon, man. You take care.
8186000	8188000	Alright. Take care, buddy. Bye-bye.
8188000	8189000	Bye.
8189000	8192000	That was great. That's absolutely right on the money, right?
8192000	8193000	Yep.
8193000	8199000	Sit there and play the games with your kids. Maybe if the parents in the Fortnite situation had done that, maybe it'd be a little different. I love that.
8199000	8203000	Or your kid is just going to think this isn't cool anymore because mom and dad are into it.
8203000	8207000	No, I think my kids would like if I was more into, I don't know.
8207000	8213000	I try to get them into all sorts of things, but then they only want to play Roblox.
8214000	8220000	Although I did, oh, I forgot to mention, I did play a little bit of Roblox this week because, well, because my son was trying, he needed my help.
8220000	8227000	So he was playing this game. It was like some high school game where you do high school things.
8227000	8230000	And so he was driving a car and he wanted to get the car into the school.
8230000	8237000	So like, like inside the school building. And so I was helping him drive it up the stairs and got that fucker up the stairs too.
8237000	8239000	Good job. Congrats.
8239000	8242000	And then I drove it into a pool on accident.
8242000	8249000	All right. I don't see anybody else waiting in the green room. So I think, I think that's going to do it for the live calls tonight.
8249000	8252000	If you do want to think or you think of something after the fact, you want to let us know about it.
8252000	8256000	You can always email us. Again, it's participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
8256000	8260000	Or you can send us a tweet. Twitter dot com slash OLR is a great place for that.
8260000	8267000	Or I don't know. Send us a message one way or another. You could probably write it in crayon and we'll probably see it one way or another.
8267000	8271000	As many ways to get a hold of us. That is that's going to about do it for another episode.
8271000	8276000	A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but we just didn't really have the same amount of news tonight.
8276000	8282000	And Dark Soccer is not here. So she'll be back next week, though, missing her tonight and hope she's doing well.
8282000	8288000	So she'll be back next week. We'll be back next week for another live show and then we'll actually be off for a week.
8288000	8294000	So Bobby will get to do a longer show if he's able to get a certain guest on October 20th.
8294000	8299000	So that'll be in two weeks time. But actually, well, we're going to try to record something in advance.
8299000	8303000	So hopefully our podcast folks will still have something and there'll be something for you guys to actually watch.
8303000	8309000	We just won't actually be here live. So it's important for you guys to know that because, you know, it's cool that you guys like chat along with this.
8309000	8314000	But I it would be really bad if you were expecting us to be reading it in the moment.
8314000	8319000	So I'm going to release games on the Amika, but I'm only going to make it so that the camera is fixed in one spot.
8319000	8324000	And we'll call it two point five D. Although it'll be secretly fully 3D.
8324000	8328000	You got to let it go. All right. We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, though.
8328000	8332000	I want to thank you guys, of course, for listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week.
8332000	8335000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
8335000	8338000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8338000	8343000	But if the voices aren't here to air, then, you know, we can't really talk to them.
8343000	8348000	So help us spread the word. A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show.
8348000	8354000	That goes an awful long way. Also, the auto hosting on Twitch is awesome, awesome, awesome.
8354000	8358000	Even if you don't really do a lot of streaming yourself, the hosting is a great discoverability thing.
8358000	8363000	So we appreciate everybody that goes out of their way to host VOG network on Sunday nights.
8363000	8368000	That is about going to do it. Let's get final thoughts for the night and then we'll wrap up. Loki, your final thought tonight.
8368000	8371000	I plan on working more on my game.
8371000	8378000	I was finally getting some actual progress done, but I've been stuck on one thing for like a long time.
8378000	8384000	I want to get this part done so I can move on to something else. And I'm almost there.
8384000	8391000	And my final thought is I'm looking to play some Mario Maker 2 this week and hopefully some Horizon Zero Dawn.
8391000	8395000	But I am traveling, so I've got to squeeze that in amongst the MMOs that I'm always playing.
8395000	8400000	Oh, and also next Saturday is the big Ingress battle here in Sacramento.
8400000	8405000	So good luck to all my Enlightened around the world if you're participating in Umbra this weekend.
8405000	8408000	So we're going to do our very, very best right here in Sacramento.
8408000	8411000	And either I'll be in a really good mood next week or I'll be in a really bad one.
8411000	8413000	So you can tell how I went.
8413000	8416000	So yeah, I can't wait to see you guys in seven days.
8416000	8419000	So thanks so much for tuning in to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8419000	8422000	Have a great week, everybody. We will see you next time.
