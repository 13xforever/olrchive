69860	74820	over my head it's just really weird but I've had the first good nights of sleep I have in the
74820	79220	longest time well sleep is amazing yes it is it's nice not waking up in the middle of the night
80060	88100	and also say hello to tech master Loki hello how are you Loki I'm fine great have a good week yeah
88100	92780	it's all right all right we'll talk about games that you played and all that good stuff a little
92780	97260	later but for now I want to jump right into our kickoff topic tonight because it's been quite the
97260	103900	week in the gaming news world hasn't it give it a name what the name of the week or the name of
103900	110380	the story or what the name of the whole thing fuckery I'm honestly not a bad word for it
110380	116260	shenanigans I I don't know what to say it's it's been a weird week um okay so here's the deal I
116260	121220	know many of you that subscribe to gaming podcasts and the like and and watch streams on Twitch
121220	128060	probably stay somewhat afloat on gaming news so I don't like to think that I'm reporting the news
128060	132140	here at orange launch radio but we definitely want to discuss it with those of you guys in chat
132140	136660	because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks Network twitch TV
136660	141180	slash vog network that's VOG Network six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern every Sunday night
141180	147020	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show so I'm sure a lot of you have heard about this already you've
147020	152300	heard one thing or another if you didn't hear it in the gaming blogs or social media or what have
152300	156740	you you probably heard about it maybe in some mainstream news because that is how big this
156740	163500	story has gotten this story had senators from the United States commenting on it it's that big a
163500	168700	deal what am I talking about of course I'm talking about this situation with Blizzard and the player
168700	174380	that they banned so Blizzard of course as you probably know suspended one of their competitive
174380	180020	players after a hearthstone competition the name of the player blitz chung is kind of the online
180260	187820	handle of the player and he was in a grandmasters Asia-pacific post-match interview and as he was
187820	191460	kind of wrapping up the interview and said goodnight goodbye that type of thing he said
191460	197580	liberate Hong Kong revolution of our age now if you don't know what's going on in the world at
197580	204860	large there's a lot of protests going on in Hong Kong Hong Kong was under British rule for quite
204860	212420	some time up until you're wrong but it was about 10 15 years ago and I'm sorry I don't know the
212420	217380	year off it was I think more recent than that I think definitely within the last decade well see
217380	222060	here's here's what comes to mind so you guys I'd say you guys here in studio not you guys out there
222060	228140	but you guys remember my ex was from Hong Kong right so he a big reason why I think his family
228140	233820	kind of relocated was because of that handoff that was coming up so it handed off from British rule
233820	241540	to Chinese rule long story short and I am greatly simplifying things 97 so my bad okay so it was
241540	247380	about 20 years and so I'm greatly simplifying things so I apologize but I do you know I do
247380	252780	want to get through the show tonight the people in Hong Kong don't necessarily want to be under
252780	257380	Chinese rule anymore so the people of Hong Kong are kind of speaking up and they would like to
257380	262100	kind of be their own you know country basically I'm really really simplifying a lot of things so
262100	268100	I again please don't feel the need to call me out because I'm openly admitting I'm taking some some
268100	274940	shortcuts here but that has people voicing you know obviously their opposition to wanting to
274940	280340	stay a part of China and wanting to be liberated as you can imagine this is very controversial
280340	286940	within China if you want to go back 20 years now I don't know about you guys or our folks that are
286940	290980	listening but I remember do you guys remember when they were having those free Tibet concerts
291540	296940	to bet and freedom stuff that was kind of an issue where Tibet also under Chinese really it was almost
296940	304500	like kind of a similar ish and again I'm greatly simplifying type of thing there so you know China
304500	311380	has controversy China doesn't have things like the First Amendment for example right we have the
311380	318500	freedom of speech and if I want to sit here and say Donald Trump sucks donkey dick I can say that
318500	323220	because of the First Amendment would protect me because I can openly criticize the president and
323220	328700	I may or may not have done that a few times on this very program right China you don't have such
328700	334680	freedoms right and we kind of know that the internet is locked down a lot in China as well
334680	339780	right there's a lot of websites and a lot of things you can access in China I'd imagine twitch is
339780	344900	probably one of those websites I don't know that for a fact but I can only imagine because twitch
344940	350420	has open speech running rampantly it's likely a website that they probably don't care for in
350420	357420	China so anyway that's a little bit of the oversimplified history lesson as to why why
357420	362540	would somebody want to say this on a live stream why would somebody want to go here and why is this
362540	368100	such a hot-button button political issue because there are many individuals in Hong Kong who don't
368180	376700	want to be under Chinese rule anymore China feels very differently about the issue okay so what
376700	383220	happened after this the stream went to an ad break very quickly and there was some harsh punishments
383220	390140	dealt by Blizzard Blizzard mentioned that Blizz chung violated such section 6.1 of the competition
390140	395580	rules which say that players cannot engage in any act that quote brings you into public disrepute
395580	400500	offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages Blizzard image and so what
400500	407700	was the punishment removal from the grandmasters surrendering of the prize money all of it and the
407700	414220	two presenters even though they quickly kind of did this whole like they want to cover their faces
414220	419300	like they they know what he just said is like oh shit they're like and they cut quickly to a
419420	427060	commercial Blizzard immediately ceased working with both of those casters as well and this left
427060	435540	a lot of people going wow does the punishment fit the crime I don't know about that and a lot of
435540	440580	people were left very confused and very angry because there's a lot of people out there who
440580	446100	also say if the people of Hong Kong want to be free then they ought to have a conversation
446100	452660	about being free that's the way many many many people feel out there now here's the thing from
452660	457580	and now I'm starting to interject some of my personal opinions here I can understand if
457580	464380	Blizzard wants their competitors to not say controversial political statements about anything
464380	472500	because they don't want to drag their game into you know politics it's really hard when you're
472500	478180	competing in a worldwide market because not every country functions the same way I get that as part
478180	483700	of follow-up to this you might have heard Riot Games basically has begged their professional
483700	489980	players please do not bring up politics Riot Games is also owned by Tencent a Chinese company
489980	494420	but I digress okay they they have asked their players please do not bring up these controversial
494420	499620	political issues on stream so I can understand if you sign a contract as a player whether it's
499620	504060	fair or not if you sign a contract as a player that says you will not talk about controversial
504060	509300	political statements and you do then okay I understand why Blizzard felt the need to
509300	514320	retaliate a little bit but I ask again does the punishment fit the crime because I'm not sure it
514320	521180	did and I think that's where a lot of people were left I really don't understand how the casters are
521180	527060	responsible for that when they're just giving the interview and that's a regular thing though in
527060	535060	news old-school communist governments I mean really it is a standard demo yeah so where are
535060	539260	we at now so I mean again I'm sure a lot of you are sitting there going but Blizzard has put out
539260	545620	to say yes so after several days and this is the part a lot of money lost I'm sure yeah oh yeah
545620	551940	this is the part that blew my mind it took them this happened on Monday right it took them five
551940	559740	days Friday 530 Pacific or 830 Eastern like that's the time when the throwaway news comes
559740	567260	out Friday at 530 Blizzard releases a statement and Blizzard says we're listening this this
567260	574460	decision was not influenced by China and our relationships oh shit because many people out
574460	581100	there were accusing Blizzard of you are up China's ass so much and you don't want to lose their
581100	586260	business that you threw the baby out with the bathwater with not only this player but the two
586260	590740	broadcasters and I gotta admit for me the two broadcasters with a part where I was like give
590740	596740	me a fucking break they did not deserve that punishment that's still though mo for countries
596740	603100	like China exactly and I think that's why many of us here in America because we have a different
603100	608980	view on things because of you know we we have the Bill of Rights and our Constitution and so forth
608980	615660	we're kind of seeing they're going this is not indicative of what our country would do and while
615660	621580	you might argue well but it's a worldwide market this is an Asia term Blizzard still an American
621580	626260	company right so I think that's why there's a lot of people that feel very strongly still about this
626260	633660	so after what four or five long days and I couldn't believe it took this long Blizzard puts out the
633660	639780	statement it's not China's thing we're gonna give the prize money back because under as a follow-up
639780	646180	consideration it was determined that he didn't cheat he won the competition fair and square so
646180	653220	why take away the prize money duh this is the thing we should have we asked you to that your
653220	659820	player base kind of expected you to know at the beginning you took away the money why and we're
659820	664860	gonna reduce the suspension to six months but then they they went so far as to still say it
664860	670980	was the broadcasters responsibility to not let this conversation turn into politics and get
670980	677820	political whatever they are says they are still suspended for six months it's still garbage it's
677820	683620	horrible this is still I think a lot of I my theory as to why it took so long is that they
683620	689180	were speaking with whoever their handlers were in in China to make sure that they could do something
689220	694700	in a way that wouldn't damage their business dealings in China um I'm gonna sort of say yes
694700	700220	to that I think it was legal departments that took it this long and all the legal hurdles namely
700220	707100	Activision's legal hurdle this shit wouldn't happen under Mike Morhaime I said it this shit
707100	712900	would not have happened under Mike Morhaime and it wouldn't happened when Activision wasn't in
712900	718540	the picture and it's so frustrating as somebody who's been like such an advocate of Blizzard
718540	723420	games in the past and so forth because it's like the Blizzard I know and love this is the harsh
723420	728380	reality like you've kind of like seen it coming for a long time like the Activision bought Blizzard
728380	733140	and then it's like Call of Duty was in the launcher and all this other stuff and but it's like the
733140	742540	harsh reality is Blizzard is not that like on your side as the player they are not that we are just
742540	748300	like you guys don't want a game and all this stuff if last year's Blizzcon didn't make that
748300	754580	very apparent this whole scenario did because it's Activision's legal department it's Tencent's legal
754580	761340	department that made this thing take so goddamn long so what do I think they should have done well
761340	767420	for one this suspension should not have been as harsh as it was I would have been okay if they
767420	772500	said you know what this blitzchung you signed a contract that said you would not get into
772500	777060	politics because it makes things very complicated we're trying to do things in a world market so
777060	782140	therefore we're gonna suspend you for three games and we're not doing any on-camera interviews with
782140	787260	you for six months I think that would have been more appropriate right I don't know what do you
787260	792940	guys think I mean because I can still understand Blizzard has to navigate tricky waters I get it
792940	801380	but like what they did was like way above and beyond I'd be honest I mean if it were up to me
801380	805980	personally like if I was the one who had to press the button I would have been like do nothing
805980	816180	honestly that's what should have been done in a protected world however you know if anything I
816180	821140	think Chinese politics is the biggest thing to blame that's it well for sure I don't mean to
821140	825700	ignore you guys in chat we just have a lot going on here quest buster and chat says the apologies
825700	830300	made to Western audiences into China were also very different from each other the one for China
830300	835540	promised to uphold national dignity yeah there was an interesting statement on a Chinese is it is
835540	840340	it why bow way bow I'm sorry I don't know the name off top my head but there's a Chinese social
840340	846780	network out there and it's way bow way bow thank you um a account that is supposedly blizzards
846780	853860	Chinese account made a very pro China statement I don't know how else to summarize it was very
853860	857780	like you know we're gonna make these decisions that uphold national dignity and because of course
857780	863500	they did it was it was kind of like it was really a fuck you to everything that was going on over
863500	869260	here with like the protests and people canceling their accounts I know many longtime Blizzard fans
869260	876660	that are like canceling their World of Warcraft accounts I'm including me I uninstalled World
876700	881700	Warcraft today after I unsubbed about two days ago you guys know I've been talking a lot about
881700	886860	World of Warcraft classic and I've been talking about World of Warcraft on this show I unsubbed
886860	897100	and I think a lot of it has to do with kind of that harsh reality that we're in that Blizzard
897100	906460	is now on the same level as EA and I feel sorry I just I'm processing a lot of information as I
906460	911500	think we all are because it's it's so weird like it's just a fucking game but I think for many
911500	916540	people World of Warcraft and in particular and especially you know other other certain things
916540	922300	like overwatch and Blizzcon stuff too Blizzard has historically done a very good job building
922300	930100	communities in these games like people with their World of Warcraft guilds like that is family to
930100	941580	some people right so it's so extraordinarily frustrating to watch that house that your family
941580	950220	is residing in slowly and slowly get turned into a Starbucks I don't know how else to describe even
950220	956780	Starbucks has more user friendly you know what I'm getting at though yeah it's the corporation
956820	964700	coming in and transforming that store being taken over by a Walmart that safe space is suddenly
964700	970420	transforming you know what I mean and I feel really bad for people that have spent a lot of
970420	976060	money to go to Blizzcon this year shit the girls on this network at girls gone wow they're over in
976060	981940	the UK they're going to Blizzcon for the first time this year and this shit has to go down that
981940	985860	is extraordinarily frustrating and I'm not gonna speak for them they have their own show and they
985860	989980	can talk about this or not talk about this whatever they choose to do but I can just look
989980	995260	at people like that and people that are you know out there and you know playing this and they want
995260	999260	to go to Blizzcon this event because it's to see their families and to see the people that they
999260	1005300	play these games online with and to have all this happen is so frustrating and then I think about
1005300	1013140	the various people I've met over the years that work for Blizzard and I know several and I can't
1013180	1019220	speak for them either and I'm not even about to try but I can say y'all seen those pictures online
1019220	1025100	of the statue at Blizzard headquarters where it says every voice matters and it's covered up with
1025100	1030100	paper by the employees who did that and you can see the people standing around the statue the
1030100	1033960	employees because you got to be an employee to get in there with their umbrellas and what's the
1033960	1039540	umbrella a sign of that's a that's a symbol that goes with the yeah the liberate Hong Kong movement
1039540	1046420	so while I can't speak for the people I know I can let those pictures do the talking and so I'm
1046420	1053860	extraordinarily frustrated for them that this shit happens on an executive level it's it's horrible
1053860	1061380	what's happening you're watching this company that you knew and loved so much just fall apart and I
1061380	1066100	know other people out there that are like you know what this doesn't bother me I just want to play
1066100	1072060	the game I respect people's right to protest but I'm not saying people eating a chick-fil-a well
1072060	1077580	here's the thing and you know what you can choose what you do and you don't want to do and that is
1077580	1084140	absolutely fine to be honest but I think even somebody who's somebody in that position could
1084140	1088820	kind of recognize where it's very frustrating for a lot of us you know what I mean I can understand
1088820	1095620	you know if you bought overwatch you want to get your money's worth and keep playing it I get that
1095660	1101540	right I mean that's that seems reasonable to me but I didn't see a need to continue paying a
1101540	1107900	monthly fee for World of Warcraft anymore and if I was gonna get overwatch on the switch I don't
1107900	1114100	think I will now I'll reevaluate my thinking in six months since that's the time frame we've
1114100	1120260	decided to settle on that's where my head's at right now any comments from you guys before I go
1120260	1125740	to chat I'm probably not gonna re-up it all ever I had been considering it now I'm not although
1125740	1130660	right now I'm be honest I'm not really gonna re-up on any MMOs right now just because I don't have
1130660	1137540	the time for it but I had been floating it around in my head whether or not I wanted to and this
1137540	1145460	pretty much cinched it for me I went went in and uninstalled basically all my Blizzard games I
1145460	1149420	didn't install well because I was using the wow model viewer but actually now I'm gonna remove
1149420	1155020	that because I and I have to apologize to psychic for this but I'm not gonna continue with webcomic
1155020	1161900	using the well models again I'm not gonna do it I'm changing switching my directions because I
1161900	1165980	don't want to give them any advertising I don't want to support a company that's gonna behave this
1165980	1169740	way because just because they do it once and then think six months from now people are gonna forget
1169740	1174660	about it or oh we've changed this in six months they're gonna go back and do the same shit you
1174660	1178060	know there's already talks about protests at Blizzcon and all this stuff but I want to be
1178060	1181220	clear on something because this is this is a really weird thing that's happening because
1181220	1186640	there are people it's one of these weird or not when we live in such a divisive world where we
1186640	1192260	have you know folks on the left and folks on the right really going at each other right folks on
1192260	1197500	the left and folks on the right on Twitter kind of all seem to agree what Blizzard did shitty so
1197500	1203380	it's weird that there's this agreement going on there but some of those like shitty extreme
1203380	1210340	Twitter people are now getting involved with this whole thing and I just want to make very clear it
1210340	1220660	is not okay period to harass Blizzard employees to harass Blizzard fans to harass Blizzard content
1220660	1224580	creators who decide that because they need to still make money to pay their rent they're gonna
1224580	1231140	continue to create content it is not okay to harass those people period we've got that same
1231140	1237380	thing going on with the PG&E some some one of the PG&E workers got murdered over something that was
1237380	1242780	a decision over the company oh my god that's disgusting that's disgusting you know and it's
1242780	1250060	like this is it is not their fault so y'all I know our OLR listeners and viewers are good enough to
1250060	1256980	know better but I just need feel the need to say it like it's not okay to harass the employees okay
1257020	1264300	but it is okay to peacefully protest with signs so that you're seen it is okay to peacefully protest
1264300	1269220	with management it is okay to do those types of things and and you know if there's a peaceful
1269220	1275260	protest that's gonna go down at Blizzcon but let the attendees in because some of them came a long
1275260	1280460	way and have paid a lot of money to have this be the year the Blizzard shit on I will tell you one
1280460	1287820	thing that does sort of break the purpose of a protest is that civil disobedience in and of
1287820	1292340	itself is meant to inconvenience the population into paying attention to an adverse situation
1292340	1297900	that's the whole point of it that was why people you know here at pride while why the protesters
1297900	1305580	were making a sort of a stockade around the the event it's because you know why people block you
1305580	1311660	know the bridges in trying to protest for Black Lives Matter and many of the other charities out
1311660	1320860	there is the fact that you don't get the kind of attention and immediate action that happens as
1320860	1326740	you get when you make it a inconvenience for other people especially today we're way too
1326740	1333180	distracted by our modern conveniences how easy is it to say oh well the world is terrible right now
1333180	1339020	I'm gonna go play a game which is fine every so often but when you cut yourself off from
1339020	1344100	participating in things that even they don't affect your life immediately they're still going
1344100	1349460	to affect people that you know it still affects the world that you have to be a part of and just
1349460	1355620	pushing it away I say oh they can do this peacefully where no one can see them versus
1355620	1360220	no they're gonna be in your face they're gonna bring the attention to you the people that need
1360220	1365140	to be inconvenienced are the executives do you want Raven and EJ to not be able to go to bliss
1365140	1370860	con when they have waited years they can't go you know they're gonna the thing is is that to do it
1370860	1375780	legally they're they're not gonna be able to block any entrances and exits so that's not gonna be a
1375780	1380940	problem especially in a big places where this is gonna be I mean not a problem I mean even bringing
1380940	1388420	that up is like that that can't happen but the thing that I'm saying is that if you inconvenience
1388420	1394300	the people attending it directly inconveniences the people making money off of them because
1394300	1399820	there's gonna be complaints there's going to be letters written it's going to spawn more action
1399820	1406660	I kind of think the action is gonna really have to happen way before Blizzcon quite frankly like
1406660	1412860	and I think like if we were to put our finger on why are we upset like let's let's put our finger
1412860	1420180	clearly on that why are we mad at Blizzard what's the why here because for me it was the in bit well
1420180	1424820	obviously the original action was way too extreme that's part of it but for me like what really
1424820	1430660	broke the camel's back for me was how long it took them to respond to that it was straight-up
1430660	1436180	disrespectful in my opinion there are two statements here in chat that I agree with sure
1436180	1440740	I'm for SSJ 100 Matt says Blizzard is going to look at the week one sales of overwatch switch to
1440740	1446020	see if players really do care about the issue and then act-deaf says Blizzard will still exist it
1446020	1451700	won't go under anytime soon but what but what we do to support the free Hong Kong movement will speak
1451700	1456580	louder than any words or statement we make and that's a big thing actually that I'd really like
1456580	1462940	to see happen is that while people are taking their money away from Blizzard and hitting them
1462940	1469060	and in the pocketbook you know the big place that that counts we also need to be putting you know
1469060	1473860	for taking those resources from Blizzard why don't we put those resources into a charity that
1473860	1477540	supports the things that Blizzard seems to be trying to squash even if it's just indirectly
1477540	1484420	you know why don't we put that support in with with free Hong Kong why don't we help them with
1484420	1489100	protesting efforts why don't we help them with the materials that they need to continue to fight for
1489100	1494220	their freedom you know especially coming from people in America where that's pretty much we
1494220	1499700	were raised on being so completely religiously stupid that we have to oppress all other religions
1499700	1505900	and out of saying fuck you to other government powers so why can't we at least help them with
1505900	1512300	the fuck you part just saying I I would super agree that the most effective thing you can do
1512300	1519140	is to stop giving Blizzard money if you disagree you know cancel your wow accounts don't buy
1519140	1524180	overwatch on switch and those are the things that I plan to do for a little while while we wait and
1524180	1530660	see you know what Blizzard is gonna do is remember the physical version of overwatch on the switch
1530660	1537140	is actually just a download code so just you know but you get a box and there was a comment as to
1537140	1542660	the the week one commentary or you know the thing is is that the majority of people who are going
1542660	1547940	to get it will get it week one and that's where the bulk of the sales for any kind of game movie
1547940	1553900	entertainment comes out that's when it happens that and Black Friday or Cyber Monday you know
1553900	1561220	the big that's going to be the benchmark for if people do care about it because if it's something
1561220	1566860	that they care about why not why aren't they gonna get it day one it's digital why why you know why
1566860	1571820	wait if if they want it they're gonna get it and I think that we need to you know make sure that
1571820	1581020	people really do if they hate what Blizzard's doing they need to have some integrity and stick
1581020	1587260	to it you know and I know that we bring that we brought up other boycotts you know and some of
1587260	1591620	them are like oh well this is a minor thing it's not gonna really affect the the whole thing but
1591620	1595700	like in the case of I'm just use this as an example in chick-fil-a it was recently discovered
1595700	1599940	that they were funding missionaries who are going over and working with governments that are setting
1599940	1607580	up executions for gay people on file you know do you want to fund that kind of thing do you want to
1607580	1612940	contribute to this if the answer is no then you don't eat there anymore or you know with Blizzard
1612940	1619700	if you don't want to fund them you know just completely giving in to the dictates of China
1619700	1623620	then you don't support them anymore you don't support this activity you don't support these
1623620	1632260	business practices if you don't like but the joke let me if you don't support like for example what
1632260	1636620	GOP is doing you don't vote for them you don't support businesses that contribute to that you
1636660	1643340	know I'm saying that way you put your money where your integrity is but where do we draw the line
1643340	1647660	because I feel like you can have a reason to boycott everything I mean in this same bucket
1647660	1652980	people are talking about they're mad at Apple because Apple shut down an app where Hong Kong
1652980	1657820	protesters were using it to know where police were Tiffany and company had an advertisement
1657820	1664220	where it looked like a woman was covering her eye and the China folk China government found that
1664220	1668740	offensive so Tiffany and company had to pull that ad and there's more examples of this too
1668740	1673340	specifically with the China and Hong Kong issue so my point is like where do you draw the line
1673340	1679580	because I feel like for me with Blizzard specifically I think it's because you have this
1679580	1686180	very kind of like tangible punishment type of thing that happened and you have this big shift
1686180	1691340	in a company that you've supported for so long that's kind of happened and I think that's why
1691340	1702260	this one I feel like I really want to do something about this particular one I I think in cases like
1702260	1707780	for you know if it's something like an app you do have to do with international legalities there's
1707780	1714220	apps that we can't put out in the US for example for any service because they break federal law
1714220	1722460	you know I think that's a completely different story than going in for an active punishment of
1722460	1728540	a person for for using their voice that's a completely different scenario so you have to
1728540	1734220	kind of pick and choose for you not necessarily for me I have to look at the big picture you know
1734220	1742020	if you were dealing with you know say that you have X bad thing happen in one country but say
1742020	1748300	you have them doing different things in other places to offset it you know oh you know for
1748300	1754860	Blizzard this was a completely punitive action they took against a party that went above and
1754860	1758620	beyond what should have been what should have been done and the fact that they're defending
1758620	1764020	their actions is is also a completely different story too we have something more actively showing
1764020	1771780	the culture of the company in something like the app for example when you were also though
1771780	1779460	dealing with a company that that donates to companies that are not companies but organizations
1779460	1785220	that are going for international you know freedom attempts freedom of speech health care that's a
1785220	1791700	completely different story it doesn't mean that oh all things that China does are great it means
1791700	1797260	yeah our hand is tied on this one but we're doing other things to offset it you know for example if
1797260	1803780	you're dealing with you know a company that's out there actively trying to you know end an
1803780	1809440	entire group of people across the world yeah giving children books is gonna be very small
1809440	1817980	potatoes in regards to what could end up being seen very well as close to I'll put this way just
1817980	1824460	Nazi actions you know killing entire groups of people what we have going on in Syria right now
1824460	1830340	is absolutely horrendous and it's along those same lines it's an active punitive action that
1830340	1836900	is killing other people I'm to try to wrap this all up and move on to other topics from the week
1836900	1840740	because there has been other gaming news this week isn't it interesting how you know I think
1840740	1845940	there's been folks that's been critical of this program in the past you know you and me specifically
1845940	1851900	because gaming and politics should mix type of thing keep the political talk on the gaming
1851900	1858740	podcast but isn't it funny that here we are now where it's like we don't have a choice we have to
1858740	1864460	talk about it because it's impacting the industry like big time so it's kind of like you you you have
1864460	1869540	to be aware of this stuff and you know make your decisions and so forth it's just it's just
1869540	1875660	interesting to me that it's like because Blizzard deals in international markets and so forth I get
1875660	1882740	it they have to walk a fine line I do understand that but isn't it interesting that you know now
1882740	1888540	there's a lot of gamers that are talking about politics essentially in the fact that we sort of
1888540	1893980	feel that this punishment didn't fit the crime for just speaking out on how many people in the
1893980	1901060	country of Hong Kong feel so um anyhow I was looking for some other comments in chat so they're
1901220	1907300	talking let's see see a Tiberian chat is kind of talking about the you know boycotting a lot of
1907300	1911500	different things there's an episode of the show Adam ruins everything it's a show I've never seen
1911500	1916260	to be honest I love that show that talks about that for a little bit called Adam ruins a plate
1916260	1921220	of nachos which I think is the whole like you know every company that contributed to the nachos
1921220	1929340	is trash type of thing so there's there are some things on that show that that are factually
1929380	1934380	incorrect so I'm just gonna leave there you know how you ruin a plate of nachos you put olives in
1934380	1942620	it actually you've been rather quiet this little segment how are you doing well you don't really
1942620	1951940	play Blizzard games exactly I'm not affected by this I don't play any of these games so it's fine
1951940	1961220	no I I've overwatch I haven't played those for a few years so yeah I mean I don't know I I don't
1961220	1966220	have time for an MMO so that it's not like I would quit it for political reasons but I just
1966220	1975020	don't have time so I mean the fact that Activision Blizzard is doing something shitty well hello it's
1975020	1982860	a day of the week so I mean just remember Call of Duty's right around the corner you get your
1982860	1989020	whole whole nother fill of Activision Blizzard doing shitty stuff some other comments from chat
1989020	1994060	captain spike says Rob you're gay everything you do touches the political yeah fair and Bobby
1994060	1999180	Blackwell says surprisingly no talk about the gay guilds name band oh yeah thanks for reminding me
1999180	2003460	because that was the thing too that was honestly it was one of the things where it was like I was
2003460	2007860	already mad at this other thing is like when I heard about this gay guild name getting banned
2007860	2013540	type thing I was just like what else do we want to throw on the fire let's just you know and
2013540	2018740	another one why not let's just let's let's do the airing of the grievances shall we like it's just
2018740	2024780	but if you didn't hear I think it was in Wow classic there was a guild name called gay boys
2024780	2030940	so many people reported it that the name got stripped now in the essence of fairness it was
2030940	2035740	restored but it does go a long way in talking about why are these automated things why is it
2035740	2039780	automated why isn't it looked at by somebody because by doing an action like that it makes
2039780	2045740	it look like you endorse it whether you really do as a company or not etc etc etc quite honestly
2045740	2050940	again you're so mad about the one thing it's like that oh this just add that to the fire
2050940	2059380	unlike any other week I probably would have been like well that was a bad look but at least they
2059380	2065020	made it right and maybe they'll learn something in the future but this week it was like fuck them
2065020	2075100	it's it's hard it's difficult it's it sucks again to use the analogy that I use all of the time on
2075100	2081340	this program when we're talking about how can you love video games and love gaming companies yet be
2081340	2088060	so critical of them it's like Tyra Banks infamously did on that season of America's next pop model
2088100	2094940	where she yells be quiet Tiffany we were rooting for you we were all rooting for you how dare you
2094940	2106020	and that quite essentially sums up how I feel about this whole situation with Blizzard let's
2106020	2111780	see going to some other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network quest buster says
2111780	2117060	Blizzard just keeps throwing logs on that fire slidekick says let's start a guild in another
2117060	2123060	game called gay boys you know it's funny like I've gotten like two people sending me private
2123060	2129700	messages asking me like so how do I sign up for Final Fantasy 14 and I don't know if like Final
2129700	2136780	Fantasy 14 necessarily wants to just I mean it's hard it's hard to say like I I realize I'm saying
2136780	2140340	they don't want to get all this business because of what's happening with Blizzard I I but what
2140340	2143660	I'm trying to say is that I think Square Enix would quite frankly like to stay out of this
2143660	2148340	issue but the reality is Final Fantasy 14 a while have a lot in common so there's a lot of people
2148340	2153540	that are like well now's a good time to go looking for good time to go play port night oh wait well
2153540	2158460	it's funny because actually since you bring up epic epic was one of those companies it felt a
2158460	2163020	little bit opportunistic a little bit especially for a company that also has holdings intense or
2163020	2169140	held of them by Tencent but it was a little weird that they came out said well we wouldn't punish
2169300	2174620	players for what they believe in nobody asked you Tim Sweeney sit the fuck down have a seat
2174620	2180500	I made my own comment back God shut up I was like I was pretty much like let me know when you're
2180500	2185820	actually treating your employees better let me know when you have a shopping cart I think like
2185820	2192940	yeah go seriously go worry about your own shit no one asked you Tim no one asked anyway Bobby
2193020	2198540	Blackwell says Tim Sweeney opportunistic on Twitter say it ain't so yeah pretty much I
2198540	2203700	like st100 Matt says here's the moment Rob is talking about I love that it's bookmarked on
2203700	2209980	YouTube yes it should there there really there is there is definitely like a reality television
2209980	2216700	Bible that you should assemble on YouTube let's see we should definitely have that would be in
2216700	2221540	there there would be a whole book of New York where you would have the good morning good morning
2221540	2227060	good morning good morning not you you can choke let's see what else would be in the way there's
2227060	2232740	there's a lot of things that would be in there there'd be a whole book of Drag Race as well
2232740	2240420	absolutely my wife would like to add I'm not doing this with him today well what you want to
2240420	2246540	do isn't necessarily what you're gonna do oh yeah oh yes thank you there would be a whole
2246540	2252980	chapter 1 verse 1 of the book of Drag Race I never had a sugar daddy if I wanted a sugar daddy
2252980	2256460	yes I could go out and get one because I'm what bitch sickening you could never have a sugar daddy
2256460	2265020	because you are not that kind of girl anyway now I'm getting off topic but the reality is these
2265020	2272860	monologues they shift our thoughts and feelings oh yes thank you so I kick yes the the classic
2272860	2281180	Whitney kiss my ass yes the book of being Bobby Brown yes all right moving on I'm glad we could
2281180	2286860	end it on some laughs let's move on to a less serious topic our gaming weeks the types of video
2286860	2291140	games that we have been playing this week so let's talk about our gaming weeks dark soccer how was
2291140	2295900	your gaming week I'm still waiting for a Detroit to become human to come out on PC of course I'm
2295900	2299940	gonna be replacing my PC at the end of the year so I have to play it quick I thought it was on
2299940	2309780	the epic store no if I'd want the city of Detroit becoming human stop it the game's great I've been
2309780	2315460	playing pinball wizard on Apple arcade and it really annoyed me at first but now I actually
2315460	2322500	super like it I also started sayonara wild hearts which is so great I want the soundtrack for it
2322500	2327740	like so much like I love that rendition of Claire de lune from the first level it's on Spotify and
2327740	2333780	I imagine if it's there it's got to be on Apple music and all the other ones too yeah I was also
2333780	2338900	let me look at it again because I you know of course I was playing my I'm gonna be quitting
2338900	2342860	the Ragnarok game but I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing because I just want Animal
2342860	2351420	Crossing to be out I also started hexaflip which is another interesting little puzzler I still
2351420	2356340	don't like various day life I gave it one more try and I still don't like it so that's pretty
2356340	2363020	much what I've been playing all right we'll move on to Loki how was your gaming week I played
2363020	2371220	Borderlands 3 so I played quite a bit of that and that's pretty much it is really just Borderlands
2371220	2378180	cuz I've been trying to finish it good enjoying it it's more Borderlands you know more more
2378180	2382380	Borderlands over again I have not started over because I haven't actually finished the first
2382420	2390020	time through I don't know where I'm at yeah I think I'm like 60% through the game but that's
2390020	2396140	good I mean it I think that they oversold the diversity of their because one of the things they
2396140	2399700	talked about was like oh yeah there's so many different planets and it's all very diverse and
2399700	2406080	stuff like I kind of remember all this stuff from Borderlands 2 this all looks very similar just now
2406080	2412480	it's on different planets and I don't know it's still good though I mean don't get me wrong I like
2412480	2417960	all the old characters coming back as well that's kind of a thing that they didn't Borderlands 2 as
2417960	2424520	well so yeah I'm digging it I actually sat through and because I haven't played through the pre sequel
2424520	2430040	or tales from Borderlands so I like some of the characters I didn't know who they were so I went
2430040	2433080	through YouTube and watched like kind of like here's all the things you need to know before
2433080	2438480	you play Borderlands 2 or 3 you know so I got caught up on what the pre sequel was and so I
2438480	2442080	didn't need to go back and play the pre sequel because that looks pretty good so there's that
2442080	2448400	and I worked on my game some I'm gonna work on a lot this week so it'll be good awesome my gaming
2448400	2453960	week I had kind of a busy gaming week I actually spent most of my gaming week on the cell phone
2453960	2458600	game I've talked a lot about on this show Ingress so you might see my shirt I'm wearing kind of an
2458600	2463000	interesting shirt today it says Umbra Sacramento epicenter of enlightenment so this was like our
2463000	2470080	team merchandise or swag supporting this weekend's anomaly event so Ingress which is the game of
2470080	2474120	course by the people who did Pokemon go it's where all of the pokey stops and all that come from
2474120	2480160	although not on our show world tonight but they replaced operation portal recon with a site called
2480160	2485160	Niantic Wayfarer which in many ways is great because now you can pick what submissions get
2485160	2490200	prioritized so forth but here's the thing about Wayfarer it's not Ingress art it's mixed art like
2490200	2495160	Pokemon goes in there too which you can infer they're going to open up OPR and that type of
2495160	2499760	stuff or now it's Wayfarer they're gonna open that up for Pokemon go players eventually so it'll be
2499760	2503560	interesting well good I can resubmit the stuff that I've sent because I haven't heard anything
2503560	2508040	since May and you should log in to Wayfarer because if you haven't heard anything it may
2508040	2512360	have actually been rejected or maybe it was even approved and you never got an email because you
2512360	2516520	can go back and look at all your old submissions now finally that's the thing you can do so yeah
2516520	2521880	you should check that out I'll have to do that now yeah I do that so anyway but I digress a
2521880	2526320	little bit the Ingress was the original kind of player versus player resistance versus enlightenment
2526320	2532960	game where a lot of that those landmarks came from so to try to make a long story short there
2532960	2540120	was a kind of a tournament a big event sort of like maybe like go fest in Chicago except to
2540120	2545280	remember that like Ingress probably has like 1% of the player base if that a Pokemon go but they
2545280	2550600	had that in Sacramento was the West Coast so there were three events in the Americas this
2550600	2555400	weekend at least unlike Pokemon go they do multiple cities so this weekend there were
2555400	2562320	events in Sacramento on the West Coast Brooklyn New York on the East Coast had also was yesterday
2562320	2566920	and in the middle was actually Guadalajara in Mexico so those were kind of the three sites
2566920	2571840	that went yesterday so what happened is that members from the resistance and members from
2571840	2577520	the light and all kind of converge and they do a live battle for three hours which consisted of
2577520	2581840	this time it was about who can control portals during certain measurements who can make the
2581840	2586600	longest link pathing between the portals at certain measurement times who could get the
2586600	2589960	most unique portal hacks and then there was a cypher game that's kind of like an escape room
2589960	2595880	type of thing that you like the decoder game that was worth bonus points so my team won yay
2595880	2600600	because I play on the enlightenment the green side and we did a great job and to give you an
2600600	2604720	idea about how many people I don't have any official numbers Niantic doesn't give official
2604720	2607840	numbers I don't know how many people were registered or whatever but people that were
2607840	2612040	watching the map and all the little like peak players that come up said it was about 300 players
2612040	2617880	on the green team 200 players on the blue team we're here so there are about 500 players actively
2617880	2621920	playing in the anomalies because that's a pretty that's a pretty decent turnout for something like
2621920	2627960	that and I know there was there was at least one girl on her team from Taiwan who was here and there
2627960	2632240	was a couple from like I think there's one from Sweden so we had some visitors that came a long
2632240	2637800	way to play so that was that was fun but there was a lot of prep that went into that as you can
2637800	2642360	imagine when it comes to things like strategy and how that's all gonna work work yeah a lot of my
2642360	2647600	week was focused on that so that was all yesterday and then today was kind of the cooldown mission
2647600	2652400	day all factions can do it together it's an individual thing type of thing apparently mine
2652400	2659200	still in queue oh I did withdraw the other one but it's still in queue and they have this upgrade
2659200	2663960	next thing so I went ahead and did that I don't know what that's gonna do yeah so all right um
2663960	2669320	let's see I was looking at some of the comments in chat act F said yeah there's talks about a pogo
2669320	2673880	event next year in Mexico considering they've done some already in ingress yeah so I and
2673880	2677200	Guadalajara is not the only city they've done in Mexico I mean that I think they've done one in
2677200	2681520	they had to have done one in Mexico City I think there was one last year and so on I mean these
2682120	2686840	events are all I missed an OLR last year because I went to one of these in Chicago so I've traveled
2686840	2694720	for these myself and they're fun but I walked 23,000 steps yesterday I was very sore and very
2694720	2701960	tired and I might be coming down with a cold as a result so I mean yeah there's a lot of that it
2701960	2707160	wasn't just Ingers though that I was playing this week I also played so you know the whole I've been
2707200	2711560	playing some how fancy 14 I was playing Wow Wow classic but with everything that happened I've
2711560	2716800	just decided you know what I've been talking about that I kind of need to play less MMOs and catch
2716800	2723120	up on my backlog anyway so I cancelled Wow we're talking about that but it finally made me get to
2723120	2728080	my backlog or actually I should say a new game I added to my backlog because it was on sale for
2728080	2733560	on PlayStation 4 for only $15 so I finally installed and started playing horizon zero
2733560	2738480	dawn the complete edition I have a copy of that that I'm borrowing you should check it out if you
2738480	2743760	haven't yet it's um it's okay the thing is I don't well see I know you are not the big fan of using
2743760	2750280	like controllers because your wrist and so forth and there is like stealthy stuff and so forth but
2750280	2755600	the game also one thing right off the bat you should know is that the game has five difficulty
2755600	2760720	levels or maybe it's six but I think it's five so normal it's kind of like the middle one so
2760760	2765320	I'm playing on easy mode which is one step lower well they have a bobby black wolf mode in the game
2765320	2769240	they have one that's called story where it's like you don't even have to worry about fighting at all
2769240	2773120	and that might be you know if you just want to experience the story and so forth that might be
2773120	2776640	a way to do it without worrying about you know the controllers and all that stuff I'm playing it
2776640	2781760	on easy just because I want to get a feel for the game mechanics but I just I want to get through
2781760	2785720	the story and experience the game and get to my next game in the backlog if I like it a lot then
2785720	2790640	I'll go back and do it on hard or what have you and I gotta say so far I mean I'm not that far in
2790640	2796240	the game I got through the tutorial stages and I'm in the a little bit after that you don't want
2796240	2802200	to say too much but I'm like level five so I'm very early on still but I'm really into it I will
2802200	2807800	say this right off the bat the game is fucking gorgeous it is a gorgeous fucking game like just
2807800	2813800	going through and I don't even have a 4k TV or an HDR capable TV and like if I had that stuff it
2813800	2820000	would probably be even more good-looking but I've just been going through on my cheap old 1080p TV
2820000	2826200	playing on my PlayStation 4 Pro and it looks great I didn't realize there was like an element of like
2826200	2831280	kind of like electronics so it's like you're out in this big beautiful world but you have this
2831280	2835800	little scanner device that makes like purple electronic lines type of stuff show up and you
2835800	2840960	can scan there's a lot of like Metroid prime esque type of scanning that goes on that can give you
2840960	2847240	some insight into story and things like that so and it looks really good like I thought the whole
2847240	2852280	game was like outdoors but no there's some areas where you go indoors it's kind of creepy and some
2852280	2857520	caves or bats fly out yes it's a really really good-looking game and so far this story is like
2857520	2862920	really yeah I'm into it so I may have yet again slept on a game I really should have started
2862920	2870240	playing about a year and a half ago but what else is new that happens sometimes right so excuse me
2870240	2876080	looking at some other comments in her chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network quest buster says
2876080	2883880	love that game alloy is the best yeah the the heroine of the story definitely they are molding
2883880	2889960	her to be a big character that would most assuredly be in the next Sony PlayStation all-stars if they
2889960	2898840	do a game like that that's for sure Captain Spike says OMG same Rob recent play so nice yeah pretty
2898840	2906520	cool Pele Hanumea says I hope horizon zero dawn 2 is a PlayStation 5 launch title I don't know
2906520	2910600	if it would be a launch title but I there's got to be a horizon zero dawn 2 in the making there
2910600	2914080	really has to be it seems like a lot of people who played this game are really into it and I do
2914080	2918000	I want to keep playing it it's um if you don't know like the type of game it is it's really like old
2918000	2922680	world or excuse me it's like exploration a lot of like you do the quest to go from one place to
2922680	2928600	another you may have to hunt monsters and you can do it stealthy and the game rewards you with more
2928600	2933160	XP if you like learn how to hide in the bush and like scan the enemy for the weak point and shoot
2933160	2937920	an arrow at it but there's skills that can help you like there's a skill that I bought that slows
2937920	2943440	down time and zooms in so it's really easy to get a shot on an eye or something like that and honestly
2943440	2946800	I imagine if you're playing in Bobby Black Wolf mode you don't even have to worry about the
2946800	2950960	stealth you just go in there with your spear and chop them up and it's way it'll be fine poke them
2950960	2955880	in the face exactly because that's like if I if I fail and I miss and the thing charges at me I
2955880	2963920	just swing wild with my spear and it usually ends up dead anyway so it works Bobby says you do still
2963920	2970280	have to do stealth yes you do still I mean in the tutorials you have to do stealth I don't know in
2970280	2975800	the game so far I imagine in some story elements there may be some forced stealth but I'm not so
2975800	2980360	sure if you were to play this game in its easiest mode the story mode it probably isn't gonna give
2980360	2983720	a shit you can probably just go in there and hack and slash mobs because they're not really gonna be
2983720	2988000	able to kill you quest buster brought up something I think I would enjoy what's that using trip wire
2988000	2994480	oh yeah I just got that I I went to the guy and got like a true so you set up a trip wire because
2994480	2998720	you scan and you can see the path that they take and you set up a trip wire so that way when it
2998720	3003160	comes and it hits the trip wire goes and it just collapses and you can shoot it in the face it's
3003160	3009680	great I know it's very rewarding it sounds like so fun dark soccer it's not just any trip wire
3009680	3015360	it's a shock trip wire so they trip and they get electrocuted can you also have it to wear like
3015360	3019640	shoots a spike into their face I'm oh there are other types I think there's like a flaming trip
3019640	3025320	wire and there's just you you got me a flaming trip wire robbed there's flaming arrows too you
3025320	3031880	got me at fire literally the first quest in the game is to make fire arrows you might have to
3031880	3037520	check it out yeah I think it's time to hook up ps4 again there you go or at least get the dust
3037640	3042320	off of it yeah quest buster says stealth is really simplistic in this one it's not on splinter cell
3042320	3046840	levels of tough no I I didn't think it was that bad I and I don't like stealth usually although
3046840	3050520	I'll be honest I have been getting my streaming setup together so I can play I love you Colonel
3050520	3056240	Sanders it's just I had to upgrade my operating system first to be able to do that six fucking
3056240	3063280	hours you know how long it took to upgrade my Mac 45 minutes yeah but then when you find out your
3063280	3069080	apps aren't compatible on Mac it takes you a little longer just so you know yes same thing
3069080	3074760	can happen on Windows well I haven't updated my MacBook Pro but my Mac's updated so all right
3074760	3080680	anyway um let's see I want to move on let's that was enough for our gaming week a little bit of
3080680	3088360	housekeeping we will not be here live next week I have a work trip that I need to do and work gets
3088360	3092640	number one preference sorry guys day job is the thing that pays me to be able to do this show
3092640	3099840	so we won't be here live on Sunday night however we're gonna try to record during the week but
3099840	3104160	we're trying our schedules are a little complicated so I can't promise it right now I'm gonna try to
3104160	3109200	record something for you guys I'll have an update on our Twitter over at twitter.com slash olr so
3109200	3114720	just a heads up there but if you're on the podcast but you don't see a new show come in next week we
3114720	3118080	weren't able to get around and record something so sorry about that but you can't always show up for
3118080	3122800	mr. Bobby Blackwell who is here live the voice he's network right before us on Sunday nights
3122800	3128160	all right uh anyhow let's move on let's get into some gaming news we've talked a lot about other
3128160	3132200	stuff let's get into what else has been going on the gaming industry this week so Loki let's talk
3132200	3138720	about this next Sony console that's is gonna be named PlayStation 5 you know what's funny
3138720	3143320	last week on the show remember we did that whole thing about Shawn Layden leaving and like yeah
3143520	3148600	mean and I sat here and I said well maybe they're gonna go in this radical new direction for the
3148600	3153880	Sony place never and they're not gonna call it the five it's gonna be the place to well can't
3153880	3159960	win them all I love that the very next day they gave him out and said no bitch it's PlayStation
3159960	3167120	5 all right so yeah so they basically put out they had an interview with wired and also put
3167120	3175000	out some stuff regarding the next console so it is gonna be the PlayStation 5 it's gonna be out
3175000	3181160	holiday 2020 not a big surprise there they said that the console will have a solid-state drive
3181160	3187760	and they said games released on it would be 100 gigabyte blu-ray discs it will have a 4k blu-ray
3187760	3195680	drive I hope that means 4k video as well because if you remember the current PlayStation 4 pros
3195720	3200680	thinking Sony's gonna get that right I mean I don't know but you know what Sony probably
3200680	3205400	also wants to talk about digital because I would think they want to talk less about the
3205400	3211560	discs and more about the digital but I don't want to I can't mind read Sony anymore I don't want to
3211560	3221000	download a 20 gigabyte video file no no thanks they said that the games will need to be installed
3221160	3226840	from the disc I mean it makes sense because you're talking like huge games they're talking a little
3226840	3231640	bit about how that the new PlayStation 5 controller is gonna be similar to the PlayStation 4 controller
3231640	3237000	but they're gonna be improving things like haptics in there as well and they have this adaptive
3237000	3241520	triggers so what that means is that there'll be variable resistance on the trigger when you're
3241520	3246360	pulling it down so you may have like different things for example it's like kind of like if you
3246360	3251120	remember like the old driving games in arcades and stuff like that where they had some you know
3251120	3256560	resistance on the steering wheel some games have that it's like that but with the triggers so your
3256560	3263200	game can now fight back sort of yeah okay so the controller is not gonna punch you in the face but
3263200	3266920	it can make it a little harder to actually like pull the trigger so when like you're choking a
3266920	3273160	bitch in Grand Theft Auto 5 then you squeeze and eventually you'll feel the neck snap and it'll
3273200	3281240	just give away so just go on and then of course along with that you'll have the additional
3281240	3289000	haptics to feel all the bones breaking and so they said other things it sounds like the HD
3289000	3293640	rumble or whatever that they have I'm not really sure how they're gonna do additional haptics
3293640	3298000	aside from I guess changing the way they do the rumble all together kind of like how they did it
3298000	3307240	with the with the the switch joy cons but they said some things that you'll be able to like for
3307240	3313280	example check out they had a demo I guess of Astrobot rescue mission they said on ice it made
3313280	3320640	the thumbsticks feel like my character was gliding or jumping in a pool and they said there is some
3320640	3328720	resistance on the water on a wooden bridge a bouncy sensation so interesting and they said
3328720	3332360	the thumbsticks I guess there is resistance I wonder if they're talking about resistance on
3332360	3342880	those as well aside from the triggers interesting so then other stuff I don't know they've got some
3342880	3348160	new blue point games is gonna be working on some new games right now they said we're working on
3348160	3355840	a big one right now I'll let you figure out the rest and then they said that their primary
3355840	3364600	primary focus on the new controller is I guess their primary focus is that new controller there
3364600	3370240	was some other stuff that came out I don't know if we're gonna be talking about it necessarily no
3370240	3376320	so there is some other patents we may have talked about this last week of PlayStation VR stuff that
3376320	3380280	there may be a new version of PlayStation VR that's gonna be launching with the PlayStation 5 as
3380280	3385880	well so we'll have to check that out and see that's the thing so I mean what do you think of
3385880	3390960	this news I mean it sounds good I mean I'm interested to see what what what in that how
3390960	3396040	that translates in the gameplay because I mean honestly at this point like you can push graphics
3396040	3400240	you can push graphics you can push to graphics but not every game really needs those graphics
3400240	3404040	push I want to see what you're gonna do they improve the gameplay of these games and I'm
3404080	3410800	curious to see how this haptic stuff feeds into it cuz yeah I'd be pretty cool I mean just don't
3410800	3415960	make the controllers like $80 each but you know I I'm interested to see where they go with that
3415960	3421640	because some things worked some things didn't work like I don't know about the touchpad that's
3421640	3426920	on the PlayStation 4 controller maybe that was kind of a not really working out thing but some
3426920	3433240	other stuff I'm kind of with you it's like it sounds really neat now show me what it can do
3433760	3439280	I realize you know a random day in October 2019 is not really when they are gonna do the big
3439280	3443980	unveiling for the next console this is the type of thing I have to wait for the next c3 or probably
3443980	3448560	Sony's own event but that also gets me excited about like you know with additional haptics in
3448560	3453320	the DualShock controller what about additional haptics in a new VR controller and that might be
3453320	3458400	pretty cool too yeah like that like I like the haptic type of stuff like especially like on my
3458400	3463480	phone in gaming because the phones have the haptic stuff in it like you know the the little like
3463480	3467520	haptic stuff that happens like an ingress for example like when people are attacking near me
3467520	3472080	you actually feel a little like a little haptic like shake in your phone it's really cool like I
3472080	3476240	like it and when you're glipping you you can feel you know and obviously other games have it too like
3476240	3481480	you know the yeah so I'm I like that haptic stuff and I'm curious what it's gonna do more for the
3481480	3486520	console gaming yeah so but now it's just a matter of okay so what are the games that are gonna use
3486520	3492280	these features but you know and then one feature that is see when it's going away I guess that is
3492280	3497800	maybe not a big deal to some people because they may have not used it but the integration with
3497800	3504120	PlayStation 4 and Facebook is gonna be going away as well basically saying that we're working with
3504120	3509680	Facebook of course is working with Sony to finalize an updated contract designed to improve
3509680	3515080	the Facebook integration with PlayStation while these discussions are in progress Facebook
3515080	3522360	features will be not available on PlayStation 4 and it's already gone which is kind of surprising
3522360	3526920	like I don't know like I kind of like the Facebook integration which is weird because there's a lot
3526920	3534000	about Facebook I don't like but it did make it very easy to find my friends who are also on
3534000	3540320	PlayStation and very very easy to just be like oh I don't know this person by their username so we
3540320	3545640	can just exchange the real names and that or my my real name that was probably the only thing I
3545640	3551240	used with that but I know they were talking about other things like you know sharing screenshots
3551240	3557480	videos music trophy details and stuff like that yeah or links to gameplay broadcasts but I really
3557480	3562320	only use it for the friends stuff but yeah no you can do all the sharing just like you can share to
3562320	3567480	Twitter like the video is not stuff or I shared us I shared a screenshot from horizon zero dawn
3567480	3571520	like either earlier today or yesterday to Twitter I could have done that to Facebook yeah but I just
3571520	3575280	figured the people that follow me on Facebook don't really probably care about all my gaming
3575280	3579600	updates most of the people on Twitter probably don't either but too bad I don't know Twitter
3579600	3583880	feels like the easier place for those like shorter updates whereas things on Facebook get kind of
3583880	3589240	lost but I'm I don't know it's it's still a little weird to me that it went away I'd kind of like to
3589240	3594320	know more of the reasons why behind it like was there some type of agreement that fell through
3594320	3598920	does Sony plan to build their own type of social network like what but if that was the case well
3598920	3602640	then they would get rid of the Twitter functionality and that stuff too so I'm kind of not sure like
3602640	3607640	what's all going on my first thought was maybe Facebook made it harder maybe Facebook did
3607640	3615040	something to to this but no you could still have Facebook integration on the switch you can find
3615040	3620080	your hands on the digital switch through Facebook I don't know what's up I'll be honest I never used
3620120	3627840	any features like that so for me it's kind of a no-deal I guess some people like it I'm personally
3627840	3632560	trying to get myself off Facebook as often as as I can which is why there's been an increase in
3632560	3637800	me using Twitter lately so yeah slidekick and chat says did you talk about the biggest news
3637800	3643800	of the recent week which was Galarian Ponyta since I brought up Nintendo says says the one
3643800	3650920	who just changed their Facebook Twitter name yeah so we did not bring it up yet on the show
3650920	3655560	but I will take this opportunity to mention it does look cute as if I wasn't going to buy
3655560	3661560	Pokemon sword and or shield anyway I'm gonna keep thinking of Galarian's I was gonna get Pokemon
3661560	3667320	shield anyway with heads exploding now it's just doubly so that I'm gonna get Pokemon shield so
3667320	3670840	yeah it's like it says someone who had committed to shield months ago I couldn't be happier same
3670840	3677680	that's the same boat I'm in SSG 100 Matt I love this as 200 Matt and chat says tinfoil hat maybe
3677680	3686880	Facebook is going to have a deal with Microsoft but at the same oh no I here's why cuz they're
3686880	3689920	still in with Nintendo switch wouldn't into the switch have to get rid of it too I don't think
3689920	3695200	it's a deal maybe it's just that maybe so much has changed that it just doesn't integrate well
3695200	3700200	anymore with it or something yeah maybe I don't know well we'll probably never know the real reason
3700200	3705640	why as to what's going on but it's fun to speculate see that's why you always do your quote
3705640	3711120	fingers and go reason all right well let's talk a little more about some things going on at
3711120	3717360	Microsoft dark soccer oh yeah I don't know how to feel about this I'm sure people have some feelings
3717360	3725760	but Mikey Barra left Xbox after having been there for about 20 years he's very very high level as in
3725760	3732880	the corporate vice president of Xbox said he's a he's gone bye-bye and this is his direct quote
3732880	3737520	it's been a great ride at Xbox and the future is bright thanks to everyone at Team Xbox I'm
3737520	3742440	incredibly proud of what we've accomplished and I wish you the best more soon on what's next for me
3742440	3750240	super excited sounds like someone was given some opportunity you know an opportunity recently
3750240	3755240	opened up at Sony I'm just saying yeah I'm not saying but I'm saying but I mean we've also lost
3755240	3763280	you know other big figures with with Xbox you know like a Phil Spencer was one of the the big
3763280	3774600	departures you know so he he did we know Spencer still had of Xbox oh no they said they're goodbye
3774600	3778920	to Ibarra sorry I misread something okay I was like wait a minute still there I was like why
3778920	3784040	is that there no he's still there no it said that they they you know the big big goodbyes on
3784040	3792760	Facebook sorry on Twitter but but he did get those some yeah the other high-profile one was
3792760	3800880	Tim Longo who is the creative director for Halo Infinite but no no we'll see what happens I mean
3800880	3807160	I wish him the best but he was also the same person that defended anthem so I'm kinda like
3808000	3814840	later bitch he was doing his job to be fair yeah but I'm still a steaming pile of shit I know but
3814840	3821120	anyway I it's just one of those things was like it's a like all these corporate departures are
3821120	3824880	just kind of like what the fuck's going on what's in the water are they just trying to all get out
3824880	3830600	of politics like what no okay a bad joke but you know it's very what if Shawn Layden and him just
3830600	3838320	switch places okay I doubt it's that I love how everyone though is giving a oh crap I mean his
3838320	3845720	name is spelled differently yeah but I still think it's funny yeah it's funny all right yeah
3845720	3850520	I knew this other Jamie Summers she was a bionic woman apparently and spelled it different
3850520	3857480	differently yes you know as funny as it at work one of the the senior advisors in my team in a
3857480	3864480	completely different location by the way has my maiden name oh and so people get us confused all
3864480	3869280	the time because even though I'm still first level I was a senior advisor before and have
3869280	3874440	like that guess that same tone of voice oh yeah this person talked to you no they didn't they
3874440	3879800	taught to the other Jamie you know what's so funny it took me a minute to remember your maiden name
3879800	3888120	like I had to sit here and go oh yeah and by the way my last name ain't really summers it's just
3888120	3892280	a mind yeah mine's not really Roberts I think everybody knows that at this point and just names
3892280	3897640	not really his birth name isn't Loki I think most people know that and smooshy's stage name is
3897640	3903000	actually this mushy no his name really is mr. smoosh it is mr. smoosh and he's vocalizing actually
3903000	3908160	no because remember mr. smoosh was a rescue cat and when they read the chip it had his original
3908360	3914440	name on it but that's not actually his name he did have a legal name change yeah you do not
3914440	3919040	legally change your name to Rob Roberts no I did not really change my name to Rob Roberts so that's
3919040	3925400	what we have yeah so mr. smooshy's name is mr. smoosh and I call him the smooshy's because he's
3925400	3933840	the smooshiest cat he's so cute all right let's move on and talk a little bit about a game that's
3933840	3940720	causing a little bit of controversy out there or did I I think I skipped a story I'm sorry
3940720	3945400	there's a story missing from our little sidebar oops awkward Loki has something to talk about
3945400	3952640	first yes we're gonna talk about theft and valve and now this isn't anything valve is stealing it
3952640	3960440	is people stealing stuff from valve so apparently there was this 32 year old guy Sean the shop of
3960560	3969280	who burglarized I guess valve and stole a bunch of games and computers and accessories yay so he
3969280	3977680	apparently stole 48 PlayStation 4 and Xbox one games and about yeah they said $40,000 worth of
3977680	3986480	games and equipment from valve um he it's among other things that he stole from other stuff he
3986480	3997440	saw a FedEx truck I guess at one time he also you know stole stuff from public restaurants so yeah
3997440	4004640	so basically he gained access to valve I guess by through a public restaurant and then through
4004640	4012280	a non-functioning stairwell door and then he stole you know all those games from them wait
4012280	4016040	so like valve is a big building that probably has some type of cafe or public restaurant the
4016120	4021120	first floor this guy went into the cafe then like found a stair access in the cafe or yeah
4021120	4026080	they got him into the rest of the building yeah and so then that's your solid along with that
4026080	4032520	he also stole 15 to 20 laptops some Nintendo switch and steam machine consoles see machine
4032520	4037800	consoles aren't worth much and then he well it's it's video games dark soccer he can carry as much
4037800	4044480	as he wants he doesn't exceed the number of he still gave Newell's metal minigun looking thing
4044480	4056080	yes so did they recover it apparently yes he did get that they did recover that stuff so he'd been
4056080	4064080	he says he'd been throwing some random items into a rolling recycling bin which he used to store all
4064080	4071120	the stolen goods but yeah they show like his haul there and there's quite a bit of stuff he
4071120	4079480	sold a signed copy of heavy metal that's random yeah don't steal things folks even though it's
4079480	4084960	kind of like interesting and very video game plot like that he did it you know you probably shouldn't
4084960	4091120	steal it's generally a bad idea he didn't steal Half-Life 3 and that's really what he means yeah
4091120	4095480	that that was what he should have stolen was the source code for Half-Life 3 all right damn it
4095640	4102640	next time all right let's move on let's talk about this Kickstarter for a new game coming
4102640	4108320	out called enchanted portals but the thing is if you actually look at the game enchanted
4108320	4112320	portals I'm sorry I didn't have time to get b-roll tonight because I see bags that have been really
4112320	4116640	awesome I'm sorry but with enchanted portals you'll just have to google it and look it up
4116640	4121800	yourself there was a Kickstarter going on for this and the game really looks a lot like cuphead
4121800	4129040	like a lot like cuphead but it's not a real they're not cups because they're little witches
4129040	4135880	and it's not technically it's just a ripoff of the style and like genre yeah well I mean no one's
4135880	4143440	got a copyright on the 1930s no they don't and technically no my god does look a lot like it
4143440	4149600	though no one has a copyright on shooter like shooters either honestly like cuphead is dr.
4149600	4154640	pepper and this is dr. slice like that or what's the one they sell at Walmart called what's that
4154640	4159800	brand it's you know what I mean though it's it's the it's the lower quality version of the I play
4159800	4170200	a doctor on TV mr. P but a lot of folks went to Twitter to say basically like hey screw you you
4170200	4174280	guys are trying to make money and like totally ripping off cuphead like what's going on well
4174280	4180240	the two-man team behind this game am I saying this right she show xixo she show I guess would
4180240	4186040	be the way to say that she show has been commented has commented on the issue saying yes cuphead was
4186040	4189960	a huge inspiration for enchanted portals we're both avid fans we would make something similar
4189960	4194120	but always from a place of respect and admiration for the original we were prepared for some
4194120	4197760	backlash but the trailer definitely reached way more people than we could ever anticipate
4197760	4202720	and all the hate and negativity coming our way has definitely had a huge impact on us that being
4202720	4206920	said along with all those negative responses a lot of people have also reached out to us to say
4206920	4210840	they adore the game and would love to see it succeed so we're trying to turn our attention
4210840	4216600	more towards all those who are supporting us and sending their love for the game look I can respect
4216600	4222800	the angle of just cut out the haters and embrace the positivity versus the negativity but I also
4222800	4227880	do think it's important like look I get the whole like the art style can be flattering so forth but
4227880	4231880	there were like they were like showing some bosses that were really similar to bosses and cuphead
4231880	4237480	and things like that like do something a little bit different you know I mean like take something
4237480	4241720	you wish was better about cuphead and do that you know like there there is a way where you can kind
4241720	4246360	of take a take cuphead as a template and then like do your own thing on it it's not like there aren't
4246360	4250200	tons of video games out there that are derivative of each other and this goes all the way back to
4250200	4255720	fucking pac-man right like after pac-man came out how many fucking maze games came out what like
4255720	4261080	ladybug mousetrap and even crazy auto which eventually turned into miss pac-man yeah for
4261320	4265720	amadar there was like a million like pac-man clones right or things inspired but they they
4265720	4270440	all kind of did something a little bit different didn't they so you know that that's I think what
4270440	4274600	people would really appreciate about cuphead and I think excuse me about I can't even get the name
4274600	4278680	of the game right enchanted portals and here's the thing that makes it dicey when you go to
4278680	4284520	kickstarter and ask for money when it's one of these things where it's like I would like to make
4284520	4291640	these dolls and I would like to put out my pack a chump dolls here and here's my prototype pack a
4291640	4296360	chump doll that I'm going to be selling and for those team pokemon that for those of you that are
4296360	4301720	watching the podcast feed I'm holding up a certain yellow creature that may look very familiar to one
4301720	4307320	that you know from a go game on your mobile phone or a sword and shield game coming on your switch
4307320	4315320	but my pack a chump uh is uh it's it's just inspired by pokemon I would never just directly
4316280	4323080	steal so what you have to do is you have to put a little mustache on it and glasses
4323080	4325720	and make it your own put a beard on him then he's evil package you
4328200	4334600	uh slidekick in chat says pack a chunk is the obese pikachu oh hey wait a minute just stop
4334680	4340600	pikachu is not a skinny little rat mind you thank you slidekick also doing the real work
4340600	4344760	that we need to know here saying walmart is apparently dr thunder thank you that's what
4344760	4349480	I was trying to think of dr thunder all right anyway that's always still sounds like a porn
4349480	4354840	name uh and then dr thunder in chat this is also very important because I talked about the name
4354840	4363560	of the company shisho act theft was asking is he related to shusha no I don't think so and
4363560	4369800	act after is asking does anyone know who the fuck shusha yes I do and of course I'm going to give
4369800	4377000	you my keys that was how she would end the show and give an extra lipsticky kiss on the cheek
4377000	4384120	to some kid yes now she's wanted for police several years later I want to make a game based
4384120	4388680	on shusha I'm gonna see where she is now yeah where is shusha please don't say dead I feel like
4388760	4389800	the answer is going to be dead
4392360	4399480	in prison no not in prison shusha american tv program okay 1993 my god
4400760	4405400	and it was based on shu de shusha which was the original show it looks like
4405400	4412520	all right her name is shusha mening meningale dijaroma s is saying thank god she's not dead
4412520	4416840	brazilian tv host film actress blah blah blah she's the queen of the short ones
4417640	4423000	but is she is the bitch alive yes okay good uh see a tiberian chat that should be a website is
4423000	4430520	the bitch alive and then you have a drop down and it's just a bunch of different celebrities
4431640	4438520	she is right now among brazil's most prominent celebrities and is worth over 400 million us
4438520	4442760	she's one of the highest net worth of any woman entertainer in brazil
4443080	4447560	metal mayhem in chat says shusha sells seashells by the seashore
4448200	4453560	that's actually pretty funny metal mayhem all right uh see a tiberian chat says someone should
4453560	4458280	make a video game about wing and she was on dancing brazil which is a brazilian version of
4458280	4464920	dancing with stars really and she is a big social uh activist as well working with brazil's poorest
4465000	4474280	communities oh so yeah she turns out shusha is a pretty pretty good and she had an affair with
4474280	4482600	pele oh back in the day when she was 16 scandalous i i just now i now i really want that website is
4482600	4489960	the bitch alive or is the bit excuse me is the bitch dead yes well hey and it's got the number
4489960	4496040	the default search has to be very wide and for people who want to look up shusha it's xu xa
4496040	4500360	and honestly the show is so on drugs that it's worth watching a little bit of it
4501320	4506920	because all the children programming we loved and adore especially in the 80s was probably derived
4506920	4512200	from cocaine oh speaking of things that were probably derived from cocaine pleased because
4512200	4516200	this was linked in the vog network discord and i probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise but
4516200	4520600	we do have our own discord server at vog network.com vognetwork.com slash discord
4520600	4525880	somebody she's on instagram what hold on somebody linked this uh saturday night live sketch that was
4525880	4532600	a parody of the joker movie trailer but it was for oscar the grouch and first off it was starring
4532600	4540040	david harbor yes you know david harbor was in the trailer becoming oscar the grouch but what killed
4540040	4544200	me was that they had all these real life interpretations of all these characters from
4544200	4549720	sesame street and like the count was counting his pills as he was taking them yes fucking like ernie
4549720	4554760	got stabbed by somebody and burt's crying over it it's really funny and i haven't said that about
4554760	4559240	saturday night live in a long time but that was a really funny trailer so thank you for sharing
4559240	4568120	that yeah the grouch trailer so there it is all right moving on let's get to another story uh
4568920	4574600	this is uh edutainment possible edutainment title right yeah um and actually it was the link was
4574600	4581800	provided to me by uh our dear ronma um but it's and now i'm really loath to say anything positive
4581800	4587720	about kickstarter right now but the union organizers and um have been saying please
4587720	4593400	continue to support it because it's how a lot of people get their money so i did actually back this
4593400	4601560	one for the sake of supporting their creators i am still however speaking out against their
4601560	4608680	practices and wanting to hold of course the corporate people responsible so um like i said
4608680	4614920	we gotta pick our battles right um shujinko is a game coming out that's supposed to teach you
4614920	4623960	japanese um it's going to have a release on switch and ps4 and um it's basically set in
4623960	4629320	a world where the japanese language is being erased by demons and you have to save it so it's
4629320	4635160	sort of a roleplay slash metroidvania style game and you have to react to different situations on
4635160	4641400	screen and it familiarizes you with the language as you go um and i'll put it this way it sounded
4641400	4646120	like a really good concept especially for someone like me who's trying to eventually pass the glpt
4646760	4652680	so i backed it it sounds like a neat concept especially you know for somebody that might
4652680	4658520	want to learn a little japanese um lord knows i could use it so well and i said that i was going
4658520	4663080	to teach me how to read like say it pronounce it i had well i hope so but i you know i personally
4663080	4668920	said that i wasn't gonna back anything until i found something worth backing because i do want
4668920	4677480	to support the content creator it's just i am still also you know visibly protesting the actions
4677480	4681240	of the corporation are you able to just reach out to the content creator directly and say hey can i
4681240	4686920	have your paypal you know that i didn't find out i should do that but yeah but you know the amount
4686920	4691480	that i pledged gets me my copy of the game so i should see if they have any other way to do that
4691480	4696280	and then i can withdraw my pledge yeah so i'll do that because i'd feel better about that than doing
4696280	4701880	it any other way um but that's cool i i think that's uh pretty awesome that uh you know it's
4701880	4706440	like an edutainment game but it's something a little more mainstream sounding so best of luck
4706440	4710600	to them on that i think that's uh cool i would love it would be fun yeah hopefully if the game's
4710600	4716040	you know kind of fun i'd love to learn japanese that way anyway let's move on loki all right um
4716040	4722600	so this is pretty exciting so steam is af um adding a new service soon that's called remote
4722600	4728680	play together and what that is is basically allows you to play any couch co-op games
4729400	4737480	online with other players so you'll be able to do uh launch up to four players in a specific game
4737480	4742120	and you'll play with other people that aren't in the room with you so so it's playstation 4 share
4742120	4748840	play sort of yeah exactly um so i'm down with this because if i release a game on steam i don't know
4748840	4754440	how to fucking code your code online gameplay this will make it much easier for me so um
4755720	4759960	i think it's pretty awesome and so they're gonna offer that it's gonna be something that they're
4759960	4765400	implementing very soon and it's just gonna be built into any game that's on steam i think they
4765400	4772120	have a few yeah it's in beta right now so they're launching around october 21st and they said it
4772120	4778680	includes split screen and local co-op play but and apparently it's all done through the steam
4778680	4783720	overlay you can accept invitations from friends to join and block people if you don't want them
4783720	4789240	to come in and there's other limitations you can set like um blocking certain inputs on a shared
4789240	4793800	keyboard and mouse and stuff like that they see can't just hit alt f4 on somebody else's keyboard
4794520	4801160	something like that and draw delete those types of things yeah so um i think this is very exciting
4801160	4809640	it'd be cool to see how you know we can use this but neat i i'm always for more um accessibility
4809640	4813720	for people to play over the internet friends yeah it's kind of neat i mean the playstation
4813720	4818040	4 share play is probably one of those features is like really underutilized and i think people
4818040	4822760	forget it's there so uh yeah it'd be really cool uh bonds 006 says i have some co-workers that
4822760	4826440	would be into couch play on steam yeah i think there'd be especially the the ability to like
4826440	4830440	kind of like try a game because share play is also only limited yeah that was the other thing
4830440	4835160	yeah this one is it's you don't have to own a copy of the game to be able to do that too
4835160	4839320	uh to play with somebody else if they have a copy of the game then you can play it and it'll stream
4839320	4846040	it to you so um pretty cool how about yeah that's kind of neat i like that all right well let's um
4846040	4852760	move on and let's talk about uh some things that are going on with the new atari vcs that is uh
4852760	4858200	maybe coming out i don't know uh because the reason why i say i don't know which is interesting
4858360	4862200	we just last week had that story about how ant stream was going to have like an atari
4862200	4869800	exclusive edition right well the atari vcs the architect of the system quit that's right uh not
4869800	4876120	only did he quit but he quit saying he hasn't been paid in six months oh no yikes uh rob wyatt is the
4876120	4879560	system architect uh he's the architect behind the system he was also one of the founding team
4879560	4884040	members behind the xbox should be pointing out and in an interview he told the register as of
4884040	4889000	friday october 4th i've officially resigned as the architect of atari vcs atari haven't paid
4889000	4895880	invoices going back over six months to the consultant firm that he runs tin giant as a
4895880	4901880	small company we've been lucky to survive this long um all they had so far was a prototype
4901880	4907240	motherboard last month and the team was in the middle of debugging said uh motherboard before
4907240	4912680	he decided to quit uh now it will probably fall to a different organization surface inc
4912680	4917320	uh which atari contracted with to complete the console but who knows how long that is going to
4917320	4927960	take yikes and it sounds this just sounds to me a lot like the whole um calico debacle that was
4927960	4934120	out there except a little a little different story because with the clica one it was i think
4934120	4939480	it was the clica where they had like fake hardware they were trying to like fake that the hardware
4939480	4942840	was actually done whereas this sounds like that he's actually been working on hardware they're
4942840	4950360	just not paying him so but still not a good sign uh dj rama s says what happened to that kickstarter
4950360	4960280	money uh-oh for those backers well to be continued i suppose anyhow now we're going to take a trip
4960280	4965480	down memory lane to better times to better games i'm literally tripping and falling over my feet
4965480	4971560	so we're going to uh get to our classic soundtrack of the month because once a month dark soccer goes
4971560	4975240	in the gaming vault and not only says here's the game you should check out but she's actually says
4975240	4978920	here's a soundtrack that we don't talk about enough although i don't know about this one we
4978920	4982680	talk about this one a lot so it was worth mentioning yeah and remember i'm trying to avoid
4982680	4987480	like the rpg ones and the ones like that but yeah this one just couldn't go without a mention you
4987480	4992360	really can't do this segment especially if you're gonna highlight 8-bit games and not talk about
4992360	4997160	this one uh for those i am putting the 16-bit thing on hiatus uh-huh and i'll go ahead and
4997160	5004680	make the announcement now next year we are doing classic pinball of the month all right
5005800	5011720	which is basically going to be 90 percent you know uh tables you own no because we have some
5011720	5015560	ones i don't like like i hate judge dread and we own that i hate creature from the black lagoon
5015560	5021160	we own that so is there a halo pinball table i'd hate that if it existed but it's not going to be
5021160	5026680	any of the current stern ones it's going to be everything like prior to the whole pinball 2000
5027240	5032520	thing so i'm using that as my marker for what constitutes classic pinball fair enough okay
5032520	5037000	for those watching on twitch because i i had all gonna be john papadook and steve richie games
5037000	5042440	there was a lot of stuff that i did before tonight's show with the system and trying to
5042440	5047000	upgrade some things that didn't work um so it's gonna go blank on twitch for just a minute because
5047000	5052760	i forgot to load the b-roll in advance oopsie daisy um but for the podcast folks you can listen
5052760	5058520	to jamie start to talk about this game so what did you pick for the classic game or excuse me
5058520	5066200	the classic soundtrack of the month ducktales ooh ducktales because of the moon it's all about the
5066200	5073400	moon i mean the whole game has an epic soundtrack um the uh the ducktail soundtrack was composed by
5073560	5080360	tonomura um hiroshige and it was actually one of the first soundtracks he ever worked on can you
5080360	5087000	believe this is early work from this guy actually oh i did fix things where i can turn this up and
5087000	5100440	down on demand here we go so now we all know the beauty that is this particular soundtrack
5101080	5109400	um it was um he also did compose um uh some of the various uh you know background tracks
5109400	5116920	in the game he also rearranged the ducktail scene for this so um and he took moments to get the
5116920	5120920	theme kind of incorporated back into some of the other tracks so at least that same feel of the
5120920	5128120	themes um it also has different uh little fanfares and jingles that were played off of the ducktail
5128280	5134520	like you know when you die or when you finish a stage or something um and all of these songs were
5134520	5143080	completely of course remastered for ducktales remastered um it was coded in uh 6502 assembly
5143080	5151400	and using a sound driver created by um uh sakaguchi uh yoshihiro a yoshihiro sorry so it's
5151400	5157160	really um you know some other things i'd like to highlight what the um composer has done he also
5157240	5165080	did um legendary wings for nes he did um some baseball games destiny of the emperor for nes
5165080	5175640	he did the ninja kids he did uh bust a move for uh in 1994 as nah he didn't do all that
5176360	5183880	and uh he no he was the sound producer for bust a move and he also was uh the sound director for
5183880	5190600	raystorm one of the you know best shooters out there um so he he's really you know i wouldn't
5190600	5197000	say he had like a very long list of things but he's done some very good things um and of course
5197000	5202920	the music is one of the things that people completely know this game for i mean apart
5202920	5209080	from it just being a really solid game um they also did um different versions of the music he
5209080	5214040	there was a transylvania stage that didn't make it into the final one um a slower version of the
5214040	5218680	moon stage and um you know just a bunch of different things that you can find there's a
5218680	5223080	beta version out there that has some of these things in it that you can listen to um and of
5223080	5228760	course uh as the game was uh ported over to game boy the uh the same music went along with it so
5228760	5235400	it was all all his work so we really you know again this is one of those games that the moment
5235480	5240120	you bring up oh yeah i really like playing duck tales people go oh my god but the music
5240120	5248120	right so that's that's our game is duck tales so anyone have some good memories of music
5249400	5254600	i remember i don't think you know i can't remember if i owned duck tales or rented it a lot but i
5254600	5258840	remember playing a lot of duck tales how many games did we have that we just rented it a lot
5258840	5262200	that it felt like we owned them or maybe i borrowed it so that's back when like we had
5262200	5266840	swapped games with friends in the neighborhood and stuff like that and so i just i do remember
5266840	5271560	playing this quite a bit maybe i did own it yeah it's a really good game i mean it's one of the
5271560	5277480	ones that when dan and i were rebuilding our nest collection we we had to have this one and i don't
5277480	5281560	know if it's just because it's like a capcom game or something like that but a lot of this music
5281560	5289080	reminds me of megan well you know who was the um the uh hold on let me pull up the list yeah the
5289080	5298280	one of the main uh artists um of the game was uh you know june so i mean he didn't really do much
5298280	5304040	else in the game but he was uh one of the main artists in this game so there you go that's who
5304040	5309400	we need to get in a marvel versus capcom game scrooge mcduck yeah he'd just poke off of people
5309400	5316040	scrooge for smash and he'd uh he'd smack gems at them hell yes and then but after you smack them
5316040	5319720	then he would run around the screen and go go save it because that's the kind of duck he is
5321080	5326120	i was reading actually a few other things about that beta version of um duck tales like um gizmo
5326120	5332680	ducks uh name from the japanese version uh was in a lot of it is robo duck it's funny i was
5332680	5337720	actually looking at the name um the original name of the game and it's called uh one paku
5337720	5343880	uh one paku daku yume boken which is naughty ducks dream adventures i just like the name
5343880	5352760	naughty ducks it it denotes like some unruly ducks it's the porn parody hockey team either
5352760	5358040	that or they like it's like the precursor to the untitled goose game bobby blackwolf in our chat
5358040	5362680	points out duck tales was the only nes game i could be as a kid without a game genie it's still
5362680	5368040	the only nes game i can be without a game yeah there there's a lot of games that i don't remember
5368040	5373560	really i mean i'm kidding i'm kidding i mean i'm just like i'm thinking back to beating the
5373560	5379240	guardian legend as a kid oh you know something else yes i did beat that you know something else
5379240	5382760	i played this week in a completely random tangent i forgot about it because it was earlier the week
5382760	5388040	it was like monday that you remember that mashup of uh zelda and metroid that they put out the
5388040	5393560	randomizer yeah the one they do for the speedrun z1 m1 or something like that um i i downloaded
5393560	5397960	that and i started playing that that's neat i like that i said the problem with it is then i tried to
5397960	5403560	figure out how do i run that program that automatically plots the map and i couldn't
5403560	5407240	figure that part out and i got frustrated i couldn't figure out the mapping software so i
5407240	5411880	stopped somebody's gotta hold my hand and walk me through it on discord if i can figure it out if
5411880	5416920	people look up the old gdq streams though there's a lot of really good um the other things that i
5416920	5424280	like are like the game bingos i would love for us to put together like um a run what's a game bingo
5424280	5428600	game bingo so you've got your bingo card set with different objectives to do in the game
5428600	5433320	and either you have to do like a particular line of them like you pick which ones you can do
5433320	5438360	different tasks along the way but when you hit your straight line of everything then it's bingo
5438360	5443160	there are some who do blackout bingo okay that's kind of fun yeah um there's there's a few on the
5443160	5449320	gdq twitch channel you can find some really good bingo streams as well um for the last uh
5449320	5456040	gdq thing that they did they did an ocarina of time uh bingo i want to like live stream some of
5456040	5459560	that stuff i think i know when we get into like emulators and stuff things get a little dicey
5459560	5466280	but here's the thing i legally own a copy of zelda i legally own a copy of metroid i don't think i'm
5466280	5470120	in the wrong like several copies of all this shit i think we all do at this point because we've all
5470120	5474120	had to rebuy i have a snest class it gets fine i'm covered for all super nintendo games now well
5474120	5480440	i wouldn't say all super no it's all of them all right anyway uh bobby buckle says yeah they did
5480440	5485160	a super mario sunshine bingo at the last gdq that was the one i was thinking of yeah um but i know
5485160	5489880	that they've done an ocarina one so good times all right well let's move on and talk a little bit
5489880	5497160	about some rapid fire news quickly um some things going on in the uh gaming industry so uh loki uh
5497160	5504280	doom eternal has been delayed to march that's unfortunate the delay the march 20th 2020
5504280	5510840	and it's because they have to add some polish so they can live up to their standards of speed

5518120	5526200	that you know that's fine uh let's see what else and then um they have a new cross sorry i have to
5526200	5533320	say that act deaf to chat says bethesda's delaying a game to fix it why it's id software just because
5533320	5537320	they're owned by bethesda doesn't mean they necessarily operate in the same standards but
5537320	5545000	i see um anyways there is a new crossover coming to rocket league for halloween and it is stranger

5768760	5773400	raisins though yeah the thing is is that you just need to clearly label like i'm fine with oatmeal
5773400	5778120	raisin cookies as long as they are clearly labeled oatmeal raisins raisins are deceptive
5778120	5782360	little assholes i'm fine with oatmeal raisin but like if i eat that thinking oh that's a chocolate
5782360	5787400	chip cookie and then i bite into it and i surprise it's a raisin i'm gonna be dissatisfied but as long
5787400	5792120	as you tell me up front yo it's an oatmeal cookie then we're fine if i be prepared i will not make
5792120	5797080	oatmeal raisin cookies but i will make oatmeal craisin cookies you made those ones they were

5815080	5819880	makers of uh stardew valley and war groove i didn't know that from uh hidden lair games
5819880	5826040	is a very different type of game they're neat uh the publisher was those other games uh shock rods
5826040	5831480	uh is another game that has been added it's kind of like a racing game uh stella is another
5831480	5837640	game that's been released as well as decoherence and mind symphony uh i believe those of you that
5837640	5842360	started your free trial it's going to be running out soon so just a heads up on that if you are
5842360	5846440	on your free month trial and you do or do not whatever wish to keep it but it's five bucks and
5846440	5850760	you can share it with your whole family through family sharing so i mean it's like one of the
5850760	5856200	cheapest subs you'll ever have out there for that much and there's a lot more games coming out i'm
5856200	5861240	really excited i haven't got it yet just because i don't want to add to my gaming backlog but once
5861240	5865160	i make some progress in my gaming backlog i'll probably do it it's a lot of the things on there
5865160	5870360	there were things that you can play in bursts so if you're out and about it's really easy to do
5870360	5878600	it's fair except i'm usually just playing ingress pokemon go harry potter all at once oh you owe me
5878600	5884040	all right uh oh and one other thing to mention here from me uh there is a very scary halloween
5884040	5890600	mask that's been spotted out there it is a is a sonic the hedgehog movie mask that's right even
5890600	5895400	though the sonic the hedgehog movie got delayed until next year you know it didn't get delayed
5895400	5900760	licensing agreements so if you want to be the scariest person on the whole block you can get
5900760	5906200	the sonic the hedgehog mask you gotta buy one and wear it on the show are we gonna have a dress-up
5906200	5914440	night here at olr for halloween now that we're video my co-workers want to do 80s and that's

6328440	6332920	pie ones are really good like the pumpkin ones are good of course but like the flavor is a little
6332920	6336600	more subtle but the apple pie ones look really good all right well let's hear from the dollar
6336600	6343000	store i can't throw it at you okay my stomach's upset all right well let's move on uh to the mail
6343000	6348120	bag question oh there's nothing in the mail bag this week bummer you guys should get on that
6348120	6353720	participate at orange lounge rita.com although i'm understanding we may have somehow lost some
6353720	6358920	emails i don't so it's weird to me that we keep not having emails so i will look into like what
6358920	6364360	the bleep is going on um but this is also part of the reason why i'm kind of like maybe we need
6364360	6368120	to have something besides emails for people to interact with us but i don't know i don't know
6368120	6373480	how to do that yet i i kind of want to have a text message thing or like an app or something
6373480	6376840	i don't know i'm gonna look into that you guys i'm not saying mail is going away so please send your
6376840	6381080	mails participate at orange laundry.com but i'm getting to that point where i'm like maybe we can
6381080	6386600	do this better so anyway for now though doing things better that's what new consoles are
6386600	6391160	supposed to do or or console less consoles right and i'm sure that they're totally not
6391160	6397640	promising things that they can't deliver on but google stadia claims that they're gonna be um
6397640	6405960	it's gonna get faster and uh more responsive than local gaming hardware they say they're going to do
6405960	6413960	this with some sort of um trickery that they're saying is like negative latency so they're
6413960	6420760	basically going to use predictive technology to figure out what you're going to press before you
6420760	6425240	actually press it that doesn't sound like that's going to work but that they say in a year or two
6425240	6432040	that's what's going to happen it's going to make music games super easy exactly they predict i'm
6432040	6437000	going to hit it right every time perfect so people were worried about the latency making music games
6437000	6440600	possible on a game like on a console like google stadia but you're gonna get perfect every time
6440600	6448600	now exactly uh call me skeptical but i don't think that's gonna work out and also a year or two into
6448600	6458040	the console life i don't know i mean well to be fair this just reminds me of the console launches
6458120	6462920	like next month right yeah early adopters with the chrome cast and that whole thing but this like
6462920	6468120	this just totally screams the console we all know like was it the playstation 3 when they were
6468120	6473240	saying oh yeah it's gonna be you know 10 ap on everything or like i think they were even saying
6473240	6478840	like higher than 10 ep like and 120 frames per second on like a lot of the games or whatever
6478840	6487400	i just i'm skeptical that this will be a thing but i guess anything they could do to reduce latency
6487400	6493080	would be nice but i'm just anything negative latency i'm sorry that's just kind of ridiculous
6493640	6500120	ssj100 matt in chat says this story is nonsense bobby blackwolf in chat says believe it or not
6500120	6501880	loki and i agree on this topic
6506840	6510600	i i feel like you're not oh my goding at that revelation even though i was
6510600	6515400	what we did get an email oh we did you just missed it like four minutes ago okay hold on
6515640	6521000	we'll backtrack you can't you can't interrupt now all right uh bobby blackwolf continues on and says
6521000	6527720	negative latent latency equals blast processing it's a buzzword i would i would agree that this
6527720	6531800	is the blast processing of the year 2019 because they could try to predict what you're gonna press
6531800	6537400	but like it's not a guarantee so that's just gonna throw all sorts of problems into the mix
6538040	6542600	so i don't know i just don't see it happening it's it's a weird comment that's really all i have to
6542600	6547640	say all right let's backtrack we can go to the email it's really short okay that's fine all
6547640	6556120	right so this comes from ryan and it's all in caps never do that to me 2020 is quickly approaching
6556120	6560040	there are just over two months left in this decade what are your favorite games of the 2010s
6561240	6566040	oh god this we could do a whole episode on this topic um let's table that one to do a whole
6566040	6573960	episode on that topic do me a favor save that for a taped show next week okay okay if we do that
6573960	6580040	mass effect all the things my list is probably pretty similar but to hold that thought because
6580040	6583640	i want to have a longer discussion on that now i need time to think about it because i need to
6583640	6589800	think like what came out in 2009 and what came out in 2010 okay because i need to kind of plan that
6589800	6594760	out a little bit so all right anyway bobby blackwolf says is this the first time we've
6594760	6601240	used the backward headline button on air uh no you think this is the first time i fucked up that's
6601240	6609320	cute no we never fuck up all the time on purpose fuckery and and backing up doesn't have the smooth
6609320	6614520	animation you've seen it all tonight you got to see the backup you got to see me insert a headline
6614520	6619720	live on air last week i changed a headline live on air because it said classic soundtrack of the
6619720	6624600	month when we had to change that out at the last minute but no it doesn't do an animation when
6624600	6629240	you backtrack but that's okay all right anyway that was fun playing with the sidebar especially
6629240	6632680	for those on the podcast they can't see what we're doing um but you just have to check out the
6632680	6637400	archives over at twitch tv slash vog network but we can move on to our next story which has to do
6637400	6643960	with uh moral combat 11 and you know the way a lot of these uh characters from world combat 11
6643960	6648360	have been leaked is through data mining so people will go in the files and that's how they found
6648360	6655000	that oh things characters like ash and spawn and nightwolf and the terminator are going to be
6655000	6659320	inside mortal combat terminator is fucking hilarious by the way yeah it's it's interesting
6659320	6665240	it's like uh it's looks very arnoldy and all that but anyway um apparently what they've done for
6665240	6671400	data miners is they've trolled a little bit with a combat pack two in one of the outros for the
6671400	6676440	terminator yes you get a first person view where you see kind of the red scan style and then some
6676440	6682120	text comes up on the screen really quickly and one of the things that comes up is data mine in
6682120	6690360	progress and it shows melina rain lee may serena meat and mocap now some of those are actually
6690360	6694920	characters that people would like to see added like melina and rain but other ones like they're
6694920	6700280	not going to do meat give me a break that would be ridiculous mocap i i think would break the game so
6700280	6707800	but it's it's it's a cute little thing that they what's mocap mocap was the character um it was
6707800	6712200	just really overpowered i think what could do everything keep something like that oh of course
6712200	6718360	my hubby that is mortal combat obsessive instantly knows the answer to this who is hi alan how are
6718360	6723480	you okay uh speak into the mic and tell us you can grab loki's mic here yes have a seat with a
6724440	6730360	pack of chonk uh who is mocap i don't know what game he was from but he was a gag
6730360	6736360	character and it's a guy in a morph suit like a green morph suit with the little ping pong balls
6736360	6743640	on him like a mocap like they do the mocap for the character fighting it's just that guy so all
6743640	6750120	right dumb well it's like an easter egg on my head but like as far as like oh iconic punder
6750520	6755160	money is a dlc that's like a deep cut character that's like a fan favorite no he isn't like if
6755160	6758680	mocap comes to the game before melina people are going to be really mad yeah it's like
6758680	6761960	guys come on who do they need to add to mortal kombat 11
6764840	6769400	i they still play mortal kombat 11 no not i haven't in ages no you've been playing doom i've
6769400	6775240	watched because it's halloween it's how spooky season doom is your spooky game yeah okay i can
6775240	6783640	play doom i can't play outlast shut it down i can manage with doom okay yeah all right but you also
6783640	6786840	mod the shit out of doom like i look at your computer it doesn't even look like you're playing
6786840	6791080	doom it looks like oh it's disgusting like there's like killing blows they're like glory kills like
6791080	6795800	a doom 2016 where you're like ripping the sprites in half and there's like intestine sprites you'd
6795800	6804040	love it yeah no i'll stick with my everyone look up project brutality 3.0 and that's my advice to
6804040	6807400	you real quick before i let you go unpack groceries or whatever you were trying to do
6808520	6813480	in one sentence tell me your thoughts on blizzard this week
6819800	6823720	if it stinks real bad and you keep hearing seagulls you're probably standing in garbage
6826840	6829880	and it's been smelling real bad and the seagulls have been chirping for
6829880	6833400	decades now and you look down and it's like oh i'm in garbage
6834360	6838840	thank you alan yes all right enjoy your night all right let's move on
6842440	6849000	and uh we'll get to our next story which has to do with a classic series coming back
6853400	6859880	anyway bubble bubble yay bubble bubble for friends is going to have the 1986 version
6859880	6866440	a bubble bobble like so many classic versions have um but apparently it's going to have some
6866440	6870040	other stuff floating around in it so that seems like it could be pretty good it's going to come
6870040	6876440	out on switch in europe on november 19th and then um we'll be out in north america early
6876440	6885160	um next year so yeah we're getting this one a little bit late um but i mean it it's bubble
6885160	6891720	bobble i like bubble bobble um but it's going to also be out by in games as in the end that you
6891720	6901000	dine at i and then in the games there you go hopefully the boss on level 30 works yeah but
6901000	6906280	this isn't like a completely redone version no i know this this will be fine uh but i yeah i i'm
6906280	6911560	all for revisiting bubble bobble it's a fun series but i liked i i liked parasol stars and all the
6911560	6916360	rainbow or yeah it's parasol rainbow rainbow islands yeah parasol stars was the one where
6916360	6920440	they jump up and down on no that was rainbow islands yeah the one where they jump up and
6920440	6925800	they're human again parasol stars was a weird game uh cuz you know in chat says they need to
6925800	6930840	add blood effects to bubble bobble maybe uh dartitsia says i'm disappointed they haven't
6930840	6934840	done a new title compilation like i know they've done some of the arcade archive ones but i don't
6934840	6939000	think bubble bobble has been done yet uh true i you know it's funny i think i have it sitting
6939000	6942680	right over there on the original xbox there was a title compilation it was pretty good but you're
6942680	6946120	right they haven't really done one in a while which is kind of surprising i think there's a
6946120	6951640	mini cab like if you go to an electronics store and look in that section where the nes classic
6951640	6957000	and the snes classic used to be where everybody's ripping it off now like especially fries oh my
6957000	6960520	god if you have a fries in your town i know they're not everywhere but if you have a fries
6960520	6966120	electronics like look for that part of fries electronics it's gigantic with all these like
6966840	6971400	mini consoles and things like that it's crazy fries though has been looking like an empty ass
6971400	6977480	warehouse lately yes i i really i fear that fries is gonna go under there yeah i went to their game
6977480	6982680	section the other day and i was like there's nothing here yeah it's it's uh you know they're
6982680	6987480	getting killed with online stuff i hope they're able to turn it around because i love fries
6988200	6995480	all right anyway let's move on and uh talk uh to loki about something uh that i think is on
6995720	7001640	they're saying in chat is is going something's going on with this right now yes it's so season
7001640	7009240	10 of fortnight uh just ended which it basically ended in a singularity so there was this event
7009240	7013960	that happens kind of at the end of each season um there's different like kind of almost like a cut
7013960	7020600	scene event that happens so this one they launched the rocket which then ended up um going through
7020600	7026520	one of the rifts and eventually you saw a bunch of rockets come back and then the meteor ended up
7026520	7031320	all kind of just hitting the planet at once everything got sucked into a big black hole
7031320	7038120	including the entire map everything just like got sucked in and that's it the game is over for now
7038840	7044520	but it's funny though is even if you um try to play now you can't play in fact if you go to the
7044520	7050040	lobby screen to go load into it all of the lobby menu and everything gets sucked into this big
7050040	7055720	void and everything is gone all of the social media stuff for fortnight and everything all
7055720	7062040	gone all of the you know their bug fix pages all gone all of the their social media and everything
7062040	7068360	is just now this this black hole basically but there's of course that's a hell of a way to take
7068360	7073800	your game down for maintenance for a day let me just say yes but there is this um there's a lot
7073800	7079320	of stuff going along with it so right now um they've been they have a live stream that's going
7079320	7084440	on with this just little portal thing so if you want something to do in the meantime which is
7084440	7091080	kind of cool they do have a konami code built into um the game if you actually go into the actual
7091080	7095320	launcher and play the game um there's that but there's been these numbers that have been flashing
7095320	7100280	on the screen stuff and people have decoded the message so the message right now is i was not
7100280	7108040	alone others were outside the loop this was not calculated that nothing is now inevitable and so
7108040	7114040	the thought is that they're going to do like a fortnight chapter two by tuesday and it's going
7114040	7118840	to launch with a whole new map and they're going to have like different content in there as well
7118840	7122840	interesting but they people were worried well now am i going to lose all the progress they
7122840	7129000	had everything and uh playstation put out a thing saying don't worry all your v bucks and everything
7129000	7133720	are still fine all your inventory is still fine just it's like an event thing that's going on
7133720	7138360	right now so but right now you cannot play fortnite it's the most clever pull your game
7138360	7142840	down for maintenance thing i've ever seen but think about all that lost money you know they're
7142840	7148360	not making money if they have the they have to shut it down to do this update anyways this is
7148360	7156040	the way to do you know and they've gotten the focus onto fortnite for the time being so yeah
7156040	7160120	all right well we'll see what develops i'm sure we'll know by tuesday if not sooner in fact
7160120	7163800	actually they're seeing right now like this was uh one of the comments you know on the stream 4.5
7163800	7170840	million plus on youtube 1.5 million on twitch 1 million on twitter um just the amount of people
7170840	7176200	watching 50 fucking people on twitch there's 1.5 million watching a black fucking hole yeah
7179240	7184840	anyway all right it's interesting i i watched the video of like what happened and even like
7184840	7189400	i think it was a couple seasons ago with the giant mechs and stuff was pretty awesome
7189400	7197400	um i don't know it's interesting all right let's move on and talk a little bit about uh a new
7197400	7201480	silent hill game that's right we're going to talk about a brand new silent hill that was just
7201480	7209720	announced but it's not really a playstation game or an xbox game or even a freaking cell phone game
7209720	7215720	nope it's a brand new game that was announced at the global gaming expo in las vegas you know what
7215720	7221640	that means it's a slot machine that's right silent hill escape is one of those slot machines that
7221640	7226040	kind of has different sides to it so that three people can play it at the same time and it's a
7226040	7232200	slot experience and it's talking about uh it's one of the first on konami's new video slot cabinet
7232200	7240760	which is a 49 inch j curve 4k uhd display so it looks really pretty basically uh let's see it's
7241160	7245240	a first glimpse of great things to come from konami that according to the executive vice
7245240	7249640	president of konami as we all know and i think we've talked about before on the show konami is
7249640	7254520	no stranger to the gambling industry if you ever go to a casino um in your neck of the woods i mean
7254520	7259400	i don't know what gambling laws are like in your state but we have a lot of um uh native american
7259400	7264680	like land here where they have casinos and uh if you ever look at the machines a lot of them are
7264680	7268840	by konami and have a konami logo on but i'm just surprised like this is doesn't seem like the
7268920	7274600	property that you would want to make out of a slot machine like i just don't like i would think of
7274600	7280360	anything like more of like the music based stuff like is a lot more flashier and stuff i think
7280360	7286760	would draw more attention than silent hill which honestly the demographic i think for a lot of like
7286760	7290600	gamblers is a little bit older like i don't think they're going to know what that is keep in mind
7290600	7295000	there's a certain generation that kind of grew up with those games you know yeah but i don't think
7295000	7300120	these machines are just for they're not just for the u.s obviously there's a lot of gambling in
7300120	7306440	asia in um places like makao and places like that so i don't see like i already yelled over this so
7307080	7312200	you already had your scream and your cry no i i yeah i pretty much did my usual tell off konami
7312200	7321960	on twitter but i mean honestly it's at this point that we we can count konami is no longer a
7321960	7331160	a friend of gamers well i don't know because like i mean obviously they've gone lost a lot
7331160	7335880	either their contour game is really shitty oh i haven't played the country yeah it's really bad
7335880	7339960	oh that's too bad that's too bad to hear because the castlevania those collections turned out
7339960	7345000	pretty good the bomber man games people seem to be really well received and they supported it
7345000	7349400	will really well after the fact so it's a bummer if that contour game didn't turn out that great
7349400	7355720	but i haven't played it myself it's not yeah it's like a game that is not contra that they threw
7355720	7361800	the contra name on uh captain spike in our chat hi captain spike and welcome back to our pals
7361800	7365480	at gameboy.org i noticed they've had two new episodes which means they must be back on a
7365480	7370680	regular schedule uh so it's good to have you guys back captain spike says been to japan parlors are
7370680	7376840	trending younger the ip has value so that's that's what it is you know it's just different stuff
7376840	7381320	whereas like if you go to japan you're probably not going to see dolly parton machines
7381320	7386200	unfortunately because those machines are the ones i play every time i'm going through the vegas
7386200	7393880	airport um but anyway let's open up uh the discord for your calls and then also the chat room if you
7393880	7399240	have anything you want to talk about you can do that now via our discord server and uh our chat

7537720	7543640	how long ago did you play through it i haven't finished but i bought the game like the weekend
7543640	7549160	i got my ps4 um games i've had it for like 10 bucks so i shimmied my way over there so i was
7549160	7556200	like let's see how this is 10 minutes into the game i'm like why didn't i get up here sooner for
7556200	7560680	this game it's it's amazing yeah it's kind of where i'm at where i'm like wow i really should
7560680	7564680	have got on this train sooner even though people were telling me to do that but it's just like no
7564680	7573080	i want to keep playing mmos and you know but sometimes the nice i was just saying the nice
7573080	7577160	thing about getting to the game late is that now all the expansions and everything are already
7577160	7584920	included and the thing is when somebody says something is so good and like your entire squad
7584920	7589960	is all over the game i'm the type of person i'm like nope i don't want it i will wait i will jump
7589960	7600360	onto the game order series in my own time you know so how far did you get oh god it's been a
7600360	7608520	while since i played because i i have gamers add um i think i'm still on the path some path or
7608520	7612440	something like that i just know i'll be able to pick up right where i left them i honestly don't
7612440	7621160	remember god well i'm really gonna try to be in on this game for the long haul i want to try to
7621160	7626040	get really far in it maybe even beat it um i and i guess there's a whole expansion there's this
7626040	7629880	frozen wilds expansion i don't know how that plays into things yet i guess i'll find out when i get
7629880	7635640	far enough in the game uh but yeah i definitely want to play through the game definitely oh and
7635640	7640200	one more thing before i go um did you get the thing that was sent to you
7641560	7643640	oh you mean this thing right here

7664040	7670200	ingress event so i wasn't even home until like 11 o'clock last night okay cool but so tell us
7670200	7677400	about the golden girls puppet parody show okay so it was about an hour hour ten they talked about
7677400	7686920	um dorothy not believing into superstitions uh blanche wanting to get liposuction and sofia dying
7687880	7691960	did they actually take episodes of the show and do it that way or what
7692600	7696840	i don't think they took from the show but they just took like some of the major plot points
7696840	7702120	and rolled it together with the tropes and just and it just played out so well that's fun that
7702120	7705080	would be a thing i want to see if it's still going in new york when i'm there because i'm
7705080	7711480	going to be in new york in like three weeks four weeks i know but they just finished up out of new

7724360	7729240	in new york so i guess not that bad because i'm going to be seeing the um the first few days of

7783160	7790440	what that feels all right take care rama have a good one you too all right we're gonna so yeah
7790440	7796120	i'm apparently making it to derpy con next year after working on the book for six years you should
7796120	7800760	go it'd be fun all right hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is act deaf
7800760	7806600	hey act deaf it's good to hear from you what's up well i kind of wanted to talk about the blizzard
7806600	7812600	thing but it well most of what you said everyone has said already has been said so it's like kind
7812600	7818600	of redundant so fair enough i want to talk about something uh that don't know if you talked about
7818600	7826600	last week but uh pokemon go and the the ticket they're gonna sell for for an event i don't know
7826600	7832520	if you talked about uh that already no not really i may have touched on it but i didn't really super
7832520	7837880	get into it and can i just also say about pokemon go i couldn't do trap inch day because the ingress
7837880	7842520	thing was at the same time now both those games are niantic and a lot of people that play ingress
7842520	7846440	play pokemon go why the hell did they schedule those two things at the same time it's so
7846440	7851720	irritating i tried to do some trap inch catching with my bluetooth but i didn't get any shinies
7853000	7862120	boo hoo um well i know isn't that bad garbage mon anyway so i don't even like the evolutions
7862120	7867400	so whatever all right anyway the shiny does look great but okay uh tell us uh from your perspective
7867400	7872600	so so if i'm not mistaking that nothing official has been announced this is all through data mining
7872600	7876920	which i think is important to note because that means subject to change but apparently they're
7876920	7883160	looking at doing potentially a raid for a generation five legendary pokemon that may be
7883160	7888840	something that you have to pay for a virtual ticket to do so it would be like oh you can do like a go
7888840	7893480	fest wherever you are in the world which we know they have the capability of doing because when
7893480	7898440	they had all those issues at go fest was it last year the year before you had the ability to do a
7898440	7903080	makeup day wherever you were in the world and those those mobs would spawn where you're at
7903080	7907400	so they're talking about you know through the data mining doing something like that where you'd buy a
7907400	7913400	ticket to a virtual festival and you might be able to catch a special gen 5 legendary with this
7913400	7921160	virtual ticket yeah basically the gist of it is there on the 15 at least uh it seems that they're
7921160	7928440	gonna launch this ticket a colossal can i remember the the exact name but it's colossal ticket or
7928440	7935480	something like that and the thing is yeah most people are thinking about this is gonna be a
7935480	7943240	ticket uh uh kind of rate a ticket for uh dredgy gigas which is one of the legendary pokemon from
7943240	7950760	the four generation and probably probably but it's not necessarily confirmed uh there's gonna be
7951400	7959400	tied to a go fest safari zone type event that if you buy the ticket you will get like a special
7960040	7966120	uh research task like with yurashi mu celiby and all that all those more pokemon
7967000	7972760	uh you're gonna get something like that and that like uh when you complete all the tasks you will
7972760	7979240	get uh probably the chance to uh to get ready gigas it's not necessarily confirmed and again
7979240	7986520	like you said it's all that data mining but uh i was gonna ask you because this uh something
7987080	7993160	kind of similar happened with ingress you already talked about this i think but what's your opinion
7993160	7999880	on on something like this like another paid event from niantic this time with pokemon go which is
7999880	8006120	kind of more popular well they have to make money right niantic's got to pay for their employees
8006120	8010600	they got to keep the lights on right so we can't expect that everything is going to be 100 free in
8010600	8016040	these games and i get that but sometimes and where i've taken issue with niantic especially in ingress
8016040	8021160	is the way that they tell people you know people plan for months to do these things like anomalies
8021160	8026520	or you know pokemon go fest or whatever the case is and so uh the thing i got really agitated with
8026520	8031240	niantic about was that they announced a month before the anomaly 30 days before that oh by the
8031240	8035560	way if you want to get a badge that proved you participated in the anomaly you're gonna have to
8035560	8041560	pay for it which they've never done before never ever and there's people that will be here on the
8041560	8047160	ground playing in sacramento or wherever the anomaly is there's also lots of people helping
8047160	8051880	in other places around the world because somebody's got to be like like looking at the
8051880	8055560	bird's eye view telling people where to go and what they see because you can only see so much
8055560	8059320	around you on the ground you can see more stuff from the air and there's other ways people can
8059320	8065480	support remotely as well and niantic wanted to charge those people too and look i understand they
8065480	8071480	got to make money okay fine so they want to charge a fee to you know do these things but give tell
8071480	8075880	people give them better notice give them proper more advanced notice about it and we have this
8075880	8081400	whole issue with the 1.0 scanner was just it's gone the 1.0 scanner or redacted is gone it's
8081400	8087320	only prime now so this anomaly we did yesterday was all in ingress prime i kind of think the
8087320	8092920	people that hate ingress prime aren't giving it enough of a chance or are looking through redacted
8092920	8097640	a little bit too much with rose colored glasses because let me tell you especially on ios redacted
8097640	8102440	had a shit ton of issues too like i have not been able to upload stats to agent stats until they
8102440	8107320	finally got it in prime because redacted you couldn't do it it had so many issues um but
8107320	8113240	anyway i digress um i also understand a lot of people want to use this just as their reason to
8113240	8117240	quit ingress when they need a reason to get off the game and that's fine too you know whatever
8117240	8123960	whatever the case is back to the issue of uh paying for particular raid monsters or whatever
8123960	8129800	in pokemon go i think a lot of it is in the way they announcement announce it if they do this
8129800	8134040	announcement where they go it's coming out tomorrow and you got to pay 10 bucks to do it
8134040	8139880	that's going to be really shitty and i'm going to be kind of upset but if they announce it's going
8139880	8144440	to be happening on november 15th or something like that let's say they announced it this week
8144440	8150040	and they say it's going to happen on november 15th and you can purchase it with in-game currency
8151080	8157800	i think that's all right because that gives you plenty of time to start saving up those gym coins
8157800	8163240	and you can buy a ticket that way if you like um or if you're just lazy or a casual player then
8163240	8166840	fine maybe you'll pony up the 10 bucks and participate that way but at least you'll have
8166840	8171240	a little more choice and you'll have time to decide what you want to do to make that choice
8171800	8178200	um but that would be the way i would prefer to see them do it is via in-game gold which you can
8178200	8182440	technically earn for free it's just that it would be kind of shitty if they don't give you an
8182440	8189240	opportunity to start saving that's all and and yeah that's one of the things that the other thing
8189240	8195480	that kind of bothers me is that we don't know exactly what is going to be the event
8196200	8202760	it may be just a rate pass and if it's a eight dollar eight rate pass for a pokemon that's
8202760	8207800	probably not going to be that great either that's the thing that's worrying a lot because
8208920	8213320	because the ticket is going to be like on sale for like at least two weeks and the event is
8213320	8220040	scheduled to be on the second on november 2nd so that gives people time that that's okay
8220840	8226520	but the thing for me at least the the thing that worries me is how they're gonna do the event what
8226520	8233000	the event is going to be because if it's only like okay you're gonna get a special access for access
8233000	8239880	to to regigigas and again that pokemon isn't that great either it's not something that you're
8239880	8247640	probably gonna use even on raids or other like in even pvp so it's like it's useless but mostly
8247640	8253240	it's useless it's gonna be it's gonna look great but it's gonna be useless yeah so again if it if
8253240	8259960	it's tied to a go fest safari zone type event i think that's gonna be like really really great
8259960	8267080	especially for people like in rural areas that which still with the spawn changes that have
8267080	8272520	happened in the past in the past few weeks they still have problems and they and people like
8273160	8278120	would really actually like i i would actually be glad to pay the the eight dollars or how
8278120	8284280	how much uh it's gonna be in mexico for for this even if i have to pay up money up front or with
8284280	8290920	uh in-game currency it's gonna be okay on my part uh if it's done like that but if it's just like
8291720	8296920	that rate pass like a normal rate pass for this pokemon in particular yeah i'm just gonna skip on
8296920	8302040	it because it's not gonna be that worth it right i kind of think you know again this is kind of the
8302120	8306280	problem with data mining in some ways is that you know you see the beginning point you see the end
8306280	8311880	point and we're left to fill in the gaps with either our fantasies or based on what we think
8311880	8315320	they've done before they're going to do again i mean there's a million different ways you connect
8315320	8320600	point a to point b but we don't really know until niantic says something so i'm going to give them
8320600	8325720	the benefit of the doubt and not make too many decisions about it until we hear the bottom line
8325720	8330600	and niantic says this is what it is this is what we're selling it's a virtual festival
8330600	8335880	that you know climaxes with this pokemon or whatever i i just need to hear the details and
8335880	8340280	then i can really kind of make a fair assessment but um i think it's a fair question to ask you
8340280	8345560	know how does niantic continue to make money especially when ingress is having a lot of
8345560	8349560	issues right now a lot of the player base seems to not be into it and you know they're they're
8349560	8356520	having problems having that game make money harry potter well i think it's doing okay it's not at
8356520	8363720	nearly at the same level pokemon go is not by a mile so who knows maybe there'll be more games
8363720	8367160	in the future i'm sure i'm sure that's inevitable there's gonna be even more niantic games in the
8367160	8373000	future but we'll see and that's the thing pokemon go is already making tons of money so it's like
8373720	8380280	do they really need more but yeah they do well and to be fair technically harry potter is not
8380280	8384840	really niantic's game yes niantic has a stake in it that's really that's really warner brothers
8384840	8388520	game portkey you know that's you know that's why their logos show up in the beginning of the game
8388520	8393240	too niantic's just providing that location database and maybe you know helped him out
8393240	8396520	with some of the map coding and things like that but ultimately that game really kind of
8396520	8400920	wrestled warner brothers so anyway uh i'm gonna let you go my friend so we can wrap up but thanks
8400920	8405160	so much for the call appreciate it hey thanks for having me like always you're welcome take care

8415320	8422120	before we wrap up and uh call it a night do we have any last minute stories um this isn't really
8422120	8428600	much of anything but it's the producer of simpsons hit and run so he's up for a remake of the game so
8430280	8437160	we'll see if they ever get the license to do that um that's about it okay fair enough
