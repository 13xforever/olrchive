7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week, Nintendo sees the return of mainline Final Fantasy games soon to be available on the Switch, starting with a few with X in their name.
20000	27000	There's plenty of news about ports, revivals, and growing pains in this week's news, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 759 for this January the 13th of 2019.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
50000	52000	Hello, I'm here in studio.
52000	56000	You are here in studio. How have things been for you this past week?
56000	59000	I've played a few more games than I've played last week.
59000	62000	Good, good. So we'll get into that in our gaming week in just a little bit.
62000	65000	But we have some other exciting stuff to get to at the top of the show.
65000	69000	Just checking in on the Broccoli Saga. Do the kids know yet where they're going?
69000	70000	No.
70000	71000	Still don't know?
71000	72000	Still don't know.
72000	73000	And when is the big trip?
73000	74000	It's on Friday.
74000	76000	Oh, so it's the reason why you're not here for the next show?
76000	77000	Yes.
77000	79000	Okay, this is going to be interesting.
79000	81000	All right, well I look forward to it.
81000	83000	All right, anyway, let's see.
83000	86000	I guess let's get right into our kickoff topic tonight, right?
86000	88000	Not here tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers?
88000	92000	You guys joining us, of course, at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network
92000	95000	where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
95000	97000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
97000	99000	For more information, you can visit VOGNetwork.com
99000	102000	where there's lots of great indie shows to check out.
102000	104000	And for those that are watching the video live tonight,
104000	106000	you'll notice we started in that tiny little box.
106000	108000	I don't know what the heck happened there.
108000	110000	I think something, when we took the Skype call,
110000	113000	changed the setting back on the camera
113000	115000	because it's not as sharp as it was earlier.
115000	120000	So this is where that whole Skype thing is getting in the way of the show.
120000	123000	So yeah, we're learning a lot of stuff as we're going here.
123000	124000	I don't know.
124000	125000	No, I guess it is set on high.
125000	126000	I don't know.
126000	128000	I can't figure these things out.
128000	130000	Technology is hard, Loki.
130000	132000	It looked really good earlier.
132000	134000	It was nice and sharp, but now that we're broadcasting,
134000	135000	I don't know, it's kind of...
135000	136000	I don't know.
136000	137000	I don't know.
137000	140000	I guess maybe as long as you guys like it, then we're good.
140000	141000	That's all we're good.
141000	143000	Of course, you can join us in our chat room
143000	145000	over at Twitch.tv slash VOGNetwork,
145000	147000	and we do get some comments there.
147000	149000	PixelPaka is commenting on my Golden Girls t-shirt.
149000	153000	Yes, we do own a few to go with the Golden Girls calendar behind Loki
153000	155000	that he picked up for me.
155000	157000	And bonds006 says,
157000	159000	Hello there, got my girlfriend to watch,
159000	161000	so tell a friend to tell a friend.
161000	162000	Well, hello, girlfriend,
162000	165000	and thanks for watching Orange Laundry tonight.
165000	166000	I appreciate that.
166000	169000	So let's get into something I know folks have been waiting for,
169000	170000	the big time capsule.
170000	171000	Yes.
171000	172000	And I know folks are going,
172000	173000	time capsule?
173000	175000	And this time you can see it on Twitch.
175000	176000	Time capsule?
176000	177000	How far back does this go?
177000	179000	Like, is it from the 1970s, the 1980s?
179000	181000	No, it's from one year ago.
181000	183000	It's one year ago that we filled this up
183000	186000	with our gaming predictions and sass and memories from 2018.
186000	188000	Well, technically, some of those are from two years ago
188000	190000	because I just put the old ones back in there.
190000	193000	What? You mixed them up when I wasn't looking?
193000	194000	Yes, I did.
194000	195000	This should be a good time.
195000	196000	Because nothing ever changes.
196000	197000	Yeah, all right.
197000	199000	Well, anyway, this time we'll empty it out
199000	200000	when we're done tonight.
200000	202000	But just on a personal note,
202000	203000	just think about,
203000	204000	and the joke is, too,
204000	206000	is that when we talk about one year back,
206000	210000	how long of a memory span do a lot of gamers have?
210000	211000	Like a week?
211000	212000	In general, yeah, right?
212000	215000	Forgiving game companies for the mistakes they made,
215000	217000	games that get delayed and so forth.
217000	220000	It's sometimes hard to go back and remember
220000	222000	where our heads were at a year ago,
222000	225000	which is part of the reason why I think going back
225000	228000	and listening to really old episodes of OLR is difficult.
228000	229000	Because if you listen to,
229000	231000	and we've been on the air over 15 years,
231000	234000	you go back and listen to stuff from, I don't know, 2006,
234000	235000	when the Wii was first coming out,
235000	237000	and the stuff we were saying about the Wii's successor,
237000	239000	it's just ridiculous stuff.
239000	242000	It's just funny how much things change.
242000	243000	So a lot can change in a year.
243000	245000	And we moved to Twitch in a year.
245000	246000	That was a big change, right?
246000	249000	So now we're doing a video thing as well as an audio thing,
249000	251000	although, of course, the podcast is still the same.
251000	253000	We're coming to you in video form as well.
253000	255000	And big thanks to all you guys out there,
255000	256000	because with your support,
256000	259000	we did hit affiliate status on Twitch.
259000	261000	VOG Network did last week.
261000	265000	And now you can actually subscribe to VOG Network
265000	266000	using your Twitch Prime subs,
266000	269000	or if you're feeling so generous with a regular sub,
269000	272000	tier one, tier two, tier three, tier four,
272000	274000	tier one, or what have you as well,
274000	276000	we can take bitty donations.
276000	278000	So I just want to thank you guys so much in advance.
278000	281000	Since we are taping a podcast, I do just want to address,
281000	284000	I know a lot of your favorite Twitch channels
284000	285000	like to read the bits.
285000	287000	I know I do when I'm broadcasting on a personal channel.
287000	289000	I'll say, thank you so much for the bitties,
289000	290000	VG Realness, I appreciate it.
290000	292000	Or thanks, Act Deaf, for that subscription
292000	294000	three months in a row, you know, like as I'm playing.
294000	297000	But since the goal here is to tape the podcast
297000	298000	and keep our podcast moving,
298000	300000	I'm not going to be interrupting every few minutes
300000	303000	to address the very kind, generous things.
303000	304000	But we will hope you will appreciate
304000	306000	a little scroll along on the bottom
306000	307000	so you'll get a little shout out
307000	309000	at the bottom of the screen live on Twitch.
309000	312000	And then at the very end, when our recording is done,
312000	314000	I'll go back and give y'all special shout outs
314000	315000	and thank yous.
315000	317000	And just in general, like if the chatters can help me
317000	319000	just thank folks as they see them
319000	321000	because I know it pops up in chat as well,
321000	322000	I would like super appreciate that.
322000	323000	So thank you.
323000	325000	So that way we don't have to keep interrupting our podcast
325000	326000	because that'd be really weird
326000	328000	for people listening in the car right now
328000	330000	and like, you know, they can't see the video and all that.
330000	332000	So, all right, enough of that.
333000	334000	Let's get into
336000	337000	the time capsule.
337000	338000	Let's do it.
338000	339000	Let's do it.
339000	340000	Let's see what's in Darth Vader's head.
340000	341000	All right, I'm going to put,
341000	343000	there's a million pieces of paper in here.
343000	346000	Okay, first thing from some year at sea,
346000	347000	this is a monkey.
347000	348000	Oh, that's me.
348000	351000	Nintendo will stop 3DS or 2DS production.
351000	353000	Well, that didn't happen.
353000	356000	In fact, there are new 2DSs doubling down.
356000	359000	You bought your kids 2DSs this year.
359000	361000	Well, that ended up being wrong.
361000	363000	All right, let's see.
363000	364000	Next.
366000	368000	This looks like a Jamie.
368000	371000	Games Jamie is looking forward to in 2018.
371000	372000	Oh, yeah, that's right.
372000	374000	We're looking forward to that.
374000	376000	Dragon Ball FighterZ.
376000	378000	So I know she's been talking about that a lot,
378000	380000	so she did appreciate that.
380000	382000	Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.
382000	383000	Well, that didn't come out.
383000	386000	Well, we got the Nintendo-ish one.
386000	388000	The concept type of thing.
388000	389000	The prequel-y thing.
389000	390000	The 8-bit version.
390000	391000	That was pretty cool.
391000	392000	And this is the funny part.
392000	393000	Final Fantasy, you can't even,
393000	394000	I don't know why I'm flipping it over.
394000	395000	You can't read it.
395000	397000	Final Fantasy VII Remake.
397000	398000	Yeah, that ain't fair enough.
398000	400000	Kingdom Hearts III is coming first.
400000	402000	All right, next up.
405000	406000	I think this is me.
406000	407000	Oh, it's me.
407000	410000	Did I enjoy 2018?
410000	412000	Overall, I think so.
412000	413000	Actually, I will say, okay,
413000	415000	so you guys have to remember personally
415000	417000	my mindset at the end of 2017.
417000	419000	I had a terrible year in 2017, personally.
419000	421000	You guys all that have been listening a while know
421000	424000	it was just a big year of ups and downs, mostly downs,
424000	427000	except marrying my husband was a big up
427000	429000	since he just walked into the room next door.
429000	430000	All right.
430000	432000	But did I enjoy 2018?
432000	433000	Overall, yes, I did.
433000	437000	And then I put Metroid Prime 4,
437000	440000	Mother 3,
440000	442000	Secret of Mana remaster.
442000	444000	That was okay,
444000	446000	but I think because they kind of like
446000	447000	built it from the ground up,
447000	449000	it ended up having some bugs,
449000	452000	and it kind of didn't end up hitting
452000	454000	as well as I think a lot of people were hoping.
454000	457000	So that one ended up being okay, I guess.
457000	460000	So, all right, let's see.
460000	462000	I'm trying to look in chat.
462000	463000	S2 100 mad degrees.
463000	466000	2018 was okay, a lot better than 2017 for sure.
466000	468000	Oh, this one's a big one.
470000	474000	Okay, who wrote on two sides?
474000	475000	Oh, because that one's 2017.
475000	476000	No, because you wrote 2017 here.
476000	478000	This is the 2018 side.
478000	482000	Top games, 2017 Skyrim, South Park,
482000	486000	my game, 2018 Burnout Paradise remake,
486000	489000	Red Dead Redemption 2, Borderlands 3.
489000	491000	Well, they didn't get Borderlands 3.
491000	493000	I would have looked forward to it though.
493000	495000	Okay, and you also wrote on here,
495000	497000	Ready Player One didn't suck.
497000	498000	And it didn't.
498000	499000	That was pretty good.
499000	501000	I watched that in theater to Black Wolf,
501000	503000	and it was a decent movie.
503000	504000	All right, let's see.
504000	507000	We got another big one here.
507000	508000	This is fun.
508000	509000	Time Capsulin.
509000	511000	Okay, oh, this was the chat room.
511000	513000	Oh, we're reading.
513000	514000	You guys, you ready?
514000	515000	I wonder how many of you are here tonight.
515000	517000	Here we go.
517000	518000	Chat predictions.
518000	519000	VidPower in chat says,
519000	521000	U.S. will never get Mother 3.
521000	522000	Hold out hope.
522000	523000	Hold out hope.
523000	524000	Let us have this one thing.
524000	526000	If they can keep putting Lucas in Smash Brothers,
526000	527000	maybe there's a way.
527000	528000	Maybe there's a way.
528000	529000	All right.
529000	530000	Chat predictions.
530000	531000	Dungeon Buster.
531000	536000	EA announces Anthem mix details
536000	539000	and are not as bad as people think.
539000	541000	Well, that one's kind of a mixed bag
541000	543000	because of all the fuckery they did with Mass Effect.
543000	545000	Some of us have a sour taste in our mouth.
545000	547000	Well, they did announce the details.
547000	548000	They did announce details,
548000	549000	and then they delayed it.
549000	550000	So there was that.
550000	553000	JD and ActDeft said,
553000	556000	Pokemon main series game on Switch.
556000	558000	I mean, you got the Let's Go, right?
558000	560000	I mean, we know the real main game
560000	562000	that a lot of people are looking forward to, obviously,
562000	563000	is next year,
563000	567000	but we know the Let's Go didn't turn out so bad, right?
567000	568000	I don't know.
568000	569000	All right.
569000	572000	Anyway, let's see.
572000	573000	TigerCloth.
573000	578000	VR games will be playable by non-VR users.
578000	581000	Well, in some cases that works,
581000	583000	but I would say like the VR game that every...
583000	585000	What would you say would be like the big VR games
585000	586000	that everybody's talking about from this year?
586000	587000	Tetris Effect.
587000	588000	Yeah.
588000	589000	So that's true.
589000	590000	What TigerCloth said would be true
590000	591000	when it comes to Tetris Effect,
591000	592000	but not Beat Saber.
592000	593000	No.
593000	594000	And Beat Saber is kind of a must-have.
594000	596000	So I think there's still a lot of
596000	599000	what does the developer want to do with that going on, right?
599000	601000	Anyway, we're reading your predictions,
601000	602000	ours and yours,
602000	604000	from the time capsule that we did a year ago.
604000	607000	Fifth Dream says PlayStation 5 announced.
607000	608000	Womp womp.
608000	609000	Got that one wrong.
609000	610000	Sorry, buddy.
611000	616000	Rocket League cross-play on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
616000	617000	Ding, ding, ding.
617000	618000	Kaijuto got that one.
618000	621000	And that kind of ended up being a big fucking deal too
621000	623000	when it came to cross-play.
623000	626000	And who could have predicted Sony's kind of stubbornness
626000	628000	in that whole thing going on there?
628000	631000	So score one for Kaijuto.
631000	633000	I don't always agree with what the man says,
633000	637000	but he called that one and called that out specifically
637000	639000	and kind of that ended up being a big headline
639000	641000	earlier in the year with the whole cross-play thing.
641000	642000	Yeah.
642000	643000	All right.
643000	645000	Well, so far, Kaijuto scoring better than any of us.
645000	646000	All right.
646000	647000	Let's see.
647000	649000	Let's look at another one here.
649000	650000	I'm pulling these out.
650000	651000	All right.
652000	653000	Next one.
653000	655000	Jamie's secret wish.
657000	658000	Drumpf impeached.
658000	659000	Well, I didn't.
659000	661000	Sorry, but sorry, lady.
661000	663000	And I get my own YouTube channel.
663000	666000	Well, you could do that.
666000	668000	She streamed on Twitch a few times.
668000	669000	Yeah.
669000	671000	But sadly, I don't think she could have predicted
671000	672000	that her day job, but I mean,
672000	674000	she had a lot of good news at her day job,
674000	676000	which is why she's not able to be here on Sunday nights
676000	677000	with us in studio.
677000	679000	So, I mean, I don't know if anybody
679000	680000	could have predicted that.
680000	681000	All right.
681000	682000	Let's see.
682000	683000	Next one.
683000	686000	We've got a lot of ones that are like tied up in others.
687000	689000	Oh, this is you, Logie.
689000	693000	The AAA gaming industry will continue to fuck up games
693000	697000	using even more predatory loot box tactics.
697000	698000	Ding, ding, ding.
699000	701000	Okay, how would you say that was a win?
702000	703000	I didn't say it was a win.
703000	704000	I just said it was accurate.
704000	706000	Yeah, but like what have they done?
706000	709000	I would say the loot box thing's been scaled back a little bit,
709000	711000	but what have they done?
711000	713000	There's laws against some of the loot boxes
713000	717000	because it's basically gambling and they've decided,
717000	718000	hey, guess what?
718000	719000	Instead of following the laws,
719000	721000	we're just going to not follow the laws
721000	723000	and do it anyways.
723000	726000	Or the whole fact that, you know,
726000	729000	loot boxes ruined a ton of games that came out.
729000	731000	Well, actually not so much in...
731000	732000	I mean, there's still some...
732000	734000	No, actually, no, still quite a bit.
734000	738000	So like, for example, Call of Duty Black Ops 4,
738000	740000	they reintroduced loot box...
740000	741000	They're starting to get smart about it.
741000	746000	So the game got reviewed and then they put in the loot boxes.
746000	749000	Okay, so that's more predatory in a way.
749000	754000	So skirting around reviews by putting in the loot boxes after the fact,
754000	756000	because I don't think that's the only game where that's happened.
756000	758000	No, it's not the only game that's happened.
758000	765000	Well, Modern Warfare Remastered, also Activision, did that.
765000	773000	You have games like Fallout 76 where the game is in a shitty condition
773000	777000	and then they're still trying to throw in the loot boxes on top of that.
777000	779000	So yes, it's still true.
779000	781000	All right, let's go to the next one.
781000	783000	I'm seeing if chat is agreeing with you or not.
783000	787000	Akdeft in chat says, laws against loot boxes because gambling.
787000	790000	Yeah, we haven't seen anything really, really move on the laws front,
790000	794000	but is anyone surprised when it comes to law and how slow all that moves?
794000	795000	I don't know about that.
795000	797000	Another Loki one here.
797000	800000	New second gen VR headsets.
800000	802000	I mean, this is kind of a safe one.
802000	806000	We got the Oculus, like the redone Oculus thing.
806000	810000	They showed some more stuff off it, because this week was also...
810000	811000	Consumer Electronics Show.
811000	815000	Yeah, so they did have some stuff they're showing there,
815000	818000	but it wasn't like, woo, this is amazing, or anything like that.
818000	822000	So this is a really safe pick from Loki, but all right.
822000	824000	Let's see, I'm looking at chat.
824000	827000	Questbuster points out EA moved ahead and disclosed the odds
827000	830000	for their team packs in FIFA, so there was that.
830000	833000	So some companies are coming around on it.
833000	836000	Let's see, and Bobby Blackwell says they removed them from FH4
836000	839000	before it came out and are going to be removing them from FM7.
839000	843000	And Bobby Blackwell also points out the Vive Pro came out in 2018.
843000	847000	But no new PSVR headset, which I would have thought.
847000	850000	Well, they did kind of re...
850000	856000	No, they just have the breakout box now passes through HDR.
856000	860000	No Final Fantasy 7 and no Kingdom Hearts 3 from Loki.
860000	862000	Technically Loki in 2018.
862000	863000	That is accurate.
863000	864000	It is accurate.
864000	868000	So we'll score one for Loki, but he obviously would be a fool
868000	869000	to make that prediction again.
869000	870000	All right.
870000	872000	Well, right, if it's coming out in a couple of weeks, well...
872000	874000	He made the first half, though.
874000	876000	OK, this is me.
878000	881000	Did Rob finally rage quit Ingress?
883000	884000	No, he didn't.
884000	889000	I've scaled back quite a bit, though, and Ingress Prime finally came out,
889000	893000	which obviously, big mobile game from Niantic, the makers of Pokémon Go.
893000	896000	All the Pokéstops and gyms come from a game called Ingress that is still going,
896000	898000	and they relaunched with Ingress Prime.
898000	900000	I think there's actually probably more to talk about in Ingress.
900000	902000	But do I play as much as I used to?
902000	903000	Not really.
903000	904000	No.
904000	905000	No.
905000	908000	In fact, the Blues threw a big field over us this evening,
908000	911000	and if I was playing more often, I probably would have stopped it
911000	914000	because I was even thinking of going to the park today that they threw right through.
914000	916000	Anyway, oh, another one for me.
916000	918000	Did Anthem flop?
918000	920000	Hashtag justice for Mass Effect.
920000	922000	Well, when we did these, we must not have known about the delay.
922000	924000	So, TBD, Rob Roberts.
927000	928000	Next one.
930000	931000	From Loki.
931000	935000	Xbox One X and PS4 Plus didn't sell well.
937000	939000	I don't know if you got this one.
939000	940000	I would say...
940000	941000	I don't know.
941000	944000	We don't really know what the numbers are because they don't really break it down that way.
944000	945000	They don't.
945000	952000	And I think there could be something to say that the classic systems outsold them in some months,
952000	955000	and the Nintendo Switch has continued to overperform,
955000	957000	but does that mean these guys underperformed?
957000	958000	I don't think so.
958000	959000	I think it was more like par.
959000	964000	I don't remember seeing a headline about Sony sales disappoint or anything like that.
964000	965000	I think we're par.
965000	966000	Right.
966000	969000	I think they did a pat on the back job well done,
969000	972000	and that's about where we're at with that, right?
972000	973000	All right.
973000	974000	Let's see.
974000	977000	So, Act F says, I don't think Loki got this one.
977000	980000	Kaijuna says it's not better, but it's not the same.
980000	981000	All right.
981000	982000	Moving on.
984000	987000	Well, they did sell a little bit better because I did buy a PlayStation 4 Pro.
987000	988000	So, you know.
988000	989000	We filled this.
989000	990000	Oh, there's that too.
990000	991000	We filled this thing up last year.
991000	992000	All right.
992000	993000	Predictions from Dark Sakura.
993000	994000	She put all hers on one.
994000	995000	Number one.
995000	997000	More third-party Switch support.
997000	999000	In parentheses, SNK.
999000	1001000	I mean, that kick-ass SNK collection came out.
1001000	1002000	So, ding, ding, ding on that.
1002000	1003000	Konami.
1003000	1007000	Konami ain't doing much of anything right now, but I mean,
1007000	1010000	I think in the general sense of third-party support on Switch,
1010000	1012000	I think it's been very strong, honestly.
1012000	1014000	I think we're starting to see, you know,
1014000	1017000	even companies that weren't supporting the Switch historically
1017000	1018000	are kind of coming around a little bit.
1018000	1020000	So, I'd give her that one.
1020000	1021000	Number two.
1021000	1024000	Konami learns from Capcom and listens to fans.
1024000	1025000	No.
1025000	1030000	Well, I mean, I guess they're listening in the sense that they're still making games,
1031000	1034000	but the games aren't very good that they're making.
1034000	1036000	I mean, Melger Survive.
1036000	1038000	Yeah, that's listening to fans.
1038000	1039000	No.
1039000	1040000	Number three.
1040000	1044000	I will continue to be very disappointed by the gaming industry as a whole.
1044000	1046000	Well, I can't ask her about that because she's not here.
1046000	1049000	She's disappointed by a lot of things.
1049000	1050000	We'll say yes.
1050000	1051000	We'll say yes.
1051000	1052000	I don't know.
1052000	1054000	She really enjoyed Awesome Games Done Quick, though.
1054000	1055000	Her and I were talking about that earlier.
1055000	1056000	Yeah, it's hard to be disappointed.
1056000	1057000	But that's not really the industry.
1057000	1058000	That's the fans.
1058000	1059000	Yeah.
1059000	1061000	This one's for me.
1061000	1070000	Will Microsoft, jealous of Nintendo sales this holiday, jack the Switch concept, but for PC?
1070000	1072000	Nvidia Shield already halfway there.
1072000	1075000	Oh, I know where I was going with this, but I was totally fucking wrong.
1075000	1079000	But, I mean, stay tuned for 2019.
1079000	1081000	Well, that's what the surface is for, I guess.
1081000	1082000	Yeah.
1082000	1083000	Interesting.
1083000	1086000	So, that could still be a thing, but not in 2018.
1086000	1088000	So, this is that.
1088000	1089000	Let's see.
1089000	1090000	Moving on.
1090000	1091000	Let's see.
1091000	1092000	Go ahead and chat.
1092000	1095000	VidPower has an interesting counterpoint to the Konami thing.
1095000	1101000	Does Castlevania characters being in Smash count as Konami stuff in 2018?
1101000	1102000	Sort of.
1102000	1104000	I mean, I'll give you that.
1104000	1107000	I'll give you that.
1107000	1110000	Oh, the best of 2018 from me.
1110000	1112000	Number one, Super Mario Odyssey.
1112000	1114000	Number two, Breath of the Wild.
1114000	1117000	Number three, Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood.
1117000	1119000	Why did we put our 2018 basket?
1119000	1120000	Yes, that's correct.
1120000	1121000	Those were my three favorite games.
1121000	1122000	I think it's just so we can reflect on...
1122000	1124000	Oh, to reflect on these games.
1124000	1127000	Oh, well, Mario is still going.
1127000	1130000	Obviously, they had the Mario Wii U game just came out again.
1130000	1132000	I bought it, but I haven't played it yet this week.
1132000	1135000	I was hoping to do a stream of it, but I'll probably get to that later.
1135000	1137000	I have to admit, I've kind of cooled down on Breath of the Wild.
1137000	1141000	I haven't really played it as much, but I do think Nintendo will kind of take that engine
1141000	1142000	and do another Zelda game.
1142000	1148000	Kind of think akin to Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask
1148000	1151000	were like the same kind of engine on Nintendo 64.
1151000	1154000	I mean, obviously, they were different Zelda games.
1154000	1156000	But that's what I mean.
1156000	1158000	I don't expect a copy of Breath of the Wild.
1158000	1162000	I expect something in that same engine, that same sort of open world design.
1162000	1163000	I think we'll see another one of those next week.
1163000	1168000	Just without the destructible weapons, because their weapon durability.
1168000	1170000	Because that was shit.
1171000	1173000	And then Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood. I'm still playing.
1173000	1175000	I went to Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest.
1175000	1179000	I don't think I could have predicted that I would have been playing a lot of WoW at this time.
1179000	1184000	Final Fantasy XIV is kind of in a lull for me since they're in that pre-expansion kind of blues part.
1184000	1186000	Literally, because there's a blue mage coming next week.
1186000	1190000	But yeah, I've been playing a lot of WoW, which is kind of weird.
1190000	1192000	But fun.
1192000	1195000	This might be the last one. Yep, this is the last one.
1196000	1197000	Another one from Jamie.
1197000	1199000	Top three games last year.
1199000	1201000	Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.
1201000	1203000	Didn't they finally shut that down? Or they're gonna shut that down?
1203000	1205000	I don't know.
1205000	1207000	Was that a thing, chat? Correct me if I'm wrong.
1207000	1209000	No, I don't think they're shutting it down.
1209000	1212000	I think the player base is really tanked on that.
1212000	1214000	And I think even she's cooled on that a lot.
1214000	1218000	I think ever since they announced Animal Crossing 2019, you know, Animal Crossing Switch,
1218000	1220000	that's where her energy is going at this point.
1220000	1224000	Act Def does say Pocket Camp is still going strong, so I stand corrected.
1224000	1227000	But I mean, Nintendo does cancel mobile phone games once in a while, right?
1227000	1229000	Am I right? All right.
1229000	1231000	Miitomo shut down. Yeah, I remember that one.
1231000	1234000	And then number two, she put Danganronpa V3.
1234000	1236000	Because she's a big fan of the Danganronpa series.
1236000	1239000	And I'm sure she would have continued to support that one.
1239000	1243000	I'd be curious to hear her thoughts on what she wrote as number three from last year.
1243000	1245000	Mass Effect Andromeda.
1245000	1249000	After kind of all that, shaped out, and they didn't really continue to expand on that and so forth.
1249000	1252000	So we'll have to ask her at a later time.
1252000	1255000	But there it is. We got everything in the time.
1255000	1257000	How did we do, Loki?
1257000	1259000	I think we did good.
1259000	1262000	I think all the save predictions went really well.
1262000	1265000	Again, Kaijuto kind of probably got the best prediction.
1265000	1267000	I think that ended up coming true in there, I got to say.
1267000	1269000	So props to you guys.
1269000	1271000	So there we go.
1271000	1273000	Wait, since we're on video now.
1273000	1276000	Oh shit, I'm going to have to pick all that up later.
1276000	1278000	All right. Anyhow.
1278000	1280000	All right.
1281000	1284000	No, I didn't do that either. Were we supposed to do that?
1284000	1287000	Should we do Games We're Looking Forward To?
1287000	1290000	Because I think I had one of those in there.
1290000	1292000	I guess I could do that.
1292000	1296000	All right. Well, in the meantime, let's do our predictions for 2019 and fill this up here.
1296000	1300000	I guess Kaijuto just tuned in.
1300000	1302000	Because Kaijuto says, what was it? What did I say?
1302000	1305000	You called the cross-play thing with Rocket League.
1305000	1309000	And the fact that it would be PS4, PC, and Xbox One.
1309000	1315000	And the reason why I kind of give you bonus points for that is because that ended up being like a headline last year.
1315000	1317000	And I don't think we would have known that at the beginning of the year.
1317000	1318000	So kudos.
1318000	1320000	All right.
1320000	1325000	Bobby Blackpool says, don't worry, Loki will pick it all up and put them all back in the capsule.
1326000	1327000	You got it.
1327000	1331000	All right. First prediction I'm going to put in for next year.
1331000	1338000	Did Sony do a PSX event in the fall because of no E3?
1338000	1344000	I find Sony's lack of participation in E3 this year very interesting.
1344000	1346000	I forgot that they're doing that.
1346000	1347000	Yeah.
1347000	1352000	Well, apparently that's going to not happen.
1352000	1355000	You might want, you can quickly change your answer, Loki.
1355000	1358000	So I would say the fact that they didn't do a PSX either.
1358000	1364000	Maybe they're looking at doing some type of like joint thing in the fall that's going to be their big PlayStation 5 announcement.
1364000	1370000	Because I know we've lived in a world historically where consoles come out right before the holidays.
1370000	1374000	But I think Nintendo Switch showed the calendar is flexible.
1374000	1382000	And if Sony wanted to do an event in the fall to hype a March or April PlayStation 5 release, that could be a legit thing.
1382000	1385000	I don't think we'll have a PlayStation 5 for holiday next year.
1385000	1388000	That is not to say we won't have a PlayStation 5 in 2020.
1388000	1389000	So that's my thought.
1389000	1390000	That's where I was going with that.
1390000	1396000	While I tear this up and put it in the capsule, Loki, why don't you do the first of your predictions?
1396000	1398000	You're not going to like this.
1398000	1409000	EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA's shittiness, i.e. loot boxes and other forced changes to the game.
1409000	1411000	Because you know they do that.
1411000	1414000	They fuck everything over and then they blame the developer.
1414000	1418000	And EA has a track record of shutting good companies down.
1418000	1424000	I don't know if that'll happen in the course of a year, but it's possible.
1424000	1427000	I'm not as mad at you about that answer.
1427000	1429000	I'm going to be curious to see what happens.
1429000	1431000	My next one.
1431000	1436000	Next Xbox announced, but no PlayStation 5?
1436000	1439000	Game Pass console to hold us over.
1439000	1442000	Which is funny because I think I kind of conflicted myself with my first prediction.
1442000	1443000	But leave me alone.
1443000	1448000	If I write, yes PS5 on one and no PS5 on the other, I'll get at least half of them right.
1448000	1453000	But where I was really going with this is really more of a Microsoft prediction is the Game Pass console.
1453000	1458000	I think they might tease the next Xbox, but I don't think it's going to be released.
1458000	1461000	I think I was thinking more E3 in my head with this one.
1461000	1469000	And I think there will be a little console that is dedicated to the streaming games and that whole thing to kind of hold us over.
1469000	1470000	That's my thought with that.
1471000	1478000	And then I picked the oh so safe Nintendo 64 classic release holiday 2019.
1478000	1483000	Because, you know, they could pretty much just run it on the same hardware they have now.
1483000	1491000	But do you think, I was at Fry's earlier this week and I saw shelves upon shelves upon shelves of the PlayStation classic.
1491000	1492000	Yeah.
1492000	1493000	Marked down to $60.
1493000	1495000	Do you think that may give Nintendo cold feet?
1495000	1498000	I know it's a weird question because Nintendo's done very well.
1498000	1504000	But do you think Nintendo's going to evaluate is the market done with these retro consoles?
1504000	1506000	No, they're not done with retro consoles.
1506000	1510000	They're done with shit that, you know, they half assed and put out into the marketplace.
1510000	1516000	You know, on emulators that are open source that aren't optimized to run the games that they're running.
1516000	1519000	I mean, and they knew the quality of what it was when they put it out there.
1519000	1521000	They just said, ah, fuck it, who cares?
1521000	1523000	You know, we're just going to make a quick buck.
1523000	1526000	You know, people will buy that because people are buying all these things.
1526000	1529000	Well, people didn't buy it because they won't just buy anything.
1529000	1535000	Let's see, SSJ100Matt wants to know, will Jamie add her predictions next week?
1535000	1538000	Yes, we'll reopen the capsule so she can do that next week.
1538000	1540000	Next one for me.
1540000	1546000	Did they finally get online right with Animal Crossing since they plan to charge for it?
1546000	1549000	So, online in Animal Crossing has always been kind of weird.
1549000	1554000	You have to kind of go, all right, I'm going to go open my gate, trot, trot, trot, open your gate, wait for somebody to show up.
1554000	1558000	And there's a lot of like, kind of like planning that has to go into a visit.
1558000	1563000	Whereas I think there's a lot of us, I don't know, I would like to see it this way, maybe you guys would too.
1563000	1570000	A little more persistent world where I can leave my town open all the time and you can come visit and shake the trees and stuff.
1570000	1578000	So, I would like to know, is online going to be like a more fleshed out full thing since we are paying for Nintendo Online after all?
1578000	1583000	And I think we probably all know how that's going to go, but we'll see. We'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
1585000	1595000	All right. I had that there will be a new AR gaming console by somebody, not necessarily Microsoft or Sony.
1595000	1597000	Tell me a little more about that.
1597000	1603000	So like, you know, let's just take the whole Oculus Go thing and just take it one step further where it's all AR stuff.
1603000	1608000	So you're playing out there in the wild because, hey, Pokemon Go is going to be still popular.
1608000	1614000	And of course, when Harry Potter Go comes out, everyone's going to be back into that shit again.
1614000	1620000	And people are going to jump on that bandwagon and release a dedicated console and stuff like that.
1620000	1623000	All right. I got one more. I put a fourth one. You ready?
1623000	1626000	The Sonic movie was a bad idea, right?
1626000	1628000	Yes.
1629000	1634000	Oh, wait. Well, that'll be the last. No, no, no. Then then then I got one.
1634000	1638000	Then if that's all right. All right. So one more from Loki and then we'll do it.
1638000	1641000	We'll add the game list after the break. So we have a little time to work on that.
1641000	1644000	So I want to move on with the show about 30 minutes in the night.
1644000	1653000	So what's the last one? The last one to go along with that is the Detective Pikachu movie did not suck.
1653000	1655000	OK, fair enough. I'm looking forward to that.
1655000	1659000	I'm I'm hopeful based on the trailer. So we'll see what happens with that.
1659000	1664000	We do need to do some chat predictions. I agree. Let's get some chat predictions, you guys.
1664000	1666000	I'll try to write these down quickly. So let's do some.
1666000	1672000	So if you have predictions, shout them out on our Twitch channel over at VOG Network.
1672000	1674000	Can you read some of those Loki so I can write them down quick?
1674000	1679000	Yes. OK. So chat predictions. Let's see.
1679000	1687000	We have She Hulk 10 say new portable Xbox coming in 2019.
1687000	1691000	Let's see. I thought I saw something from Tiger Claw.
1691000	1695000	I don't know if it was. Let me scroll.
1695000	1699000	Oh, he referenced the movies as well. He said Detective Pikachu and Sonic will be well received and do well.
1699000	1703000	The box office and the studio green light sequels. Well, we already kind of addressed the movies in there,
1704000	1709000	so we'll let that be. Yeah.
1709000	1713000	Oh, act deaf to saying a Pokemon eighth gen delay.
1713000	1718000	I think that's a ballsy prediction because I don't think that'll happen, but I'll write it down.
1718000	1726000	My Bobby's Microsoft never makes another game that supports Dolby Atmos audio.
1727000	1732000	I don't think we'll see anything about the mad box console next year.
1732000	1738000	It's way too early. And sadly, I don't think it's going to go anywhere.
1738000	1741000	I just new console launches are just especially right.
1741000	1748000	Companies that don't have now the one, though, that I am interested in is the whole.
1749000	1753000	And television console, which isn't that 20, 20, 20.
1753000	1759000	They already said the date for that was like something 10, 10, 20, 20 or something like that was the date for that.
1759000	1763000	OK. Yeah. So, yeah, 20, 20 for that. But maybe we'll get some more details on it.
1763000	1768000	But at least I trust that a little bit more than other.
1768000	1774000	You know, the mad box thing is mad. Just coming out of the gate with like no sort of specs or anything saying,
1774000	1778000	oh, our console is going to be the best in the world. Yeah.
1778000	1784000	I just I just have a hard time trusting that.
1784000	1789000	Maybe we'll see we get to get to come out.
1789000	1794000	It's going to be amazing. Sorry for a little quiet here because I'm trying to write some of these things down as you guys are saying them.
1794000	1799000	See it to be reset a new Mario spin off. So that's pretty safe prediction, but I'll go with it.
1799000	1804000	Probably culture saying they want it. He wants a Dreamcast classic.
1804000	1808000	Oh, I like that one. I would like that, too. I just don't think it's going to happen.
1808000	1811000	I mean, I hope it would happen, but I don't think it's going to happen.
1811000	1821000	Can we get like any of some more arcade stuff to like I would take, you know, an autonomous wave classic or CPS to.
1821000	1828000	Well, I guess we have a ton of the CPS to stuff with all the arcade things that they have out there.
1829000	1832000	Oh, oh, I'm going to I want to write that one down from victory.
1832000	1835000	You guys have a lot of great answers here, but I'm running out of space.
1835000	1838000	I'm going to write this last one here from a fifth dream.
1838000	1843000	Final Fantasy seven remake canceled. I think.
1843000	1848000	I think there is a sliver of potentialness in that.
1848000	1857000	Yeah, I know that's a really in a sense that it's canceled because it's going to be Final Fantasy 16 or is it that it's costing him too much money.
1857000	1862000	There's no no amount of money that's too much for Final Fantasy seven remake.
1862000	1867000	I personally don't think it will happen, but I don't think it's completely fucking impossible.
1867000	1870000	I guess.
1872000	1877000	Sorry for the hedgehog. The movie, the game is going to be the best selling game with twenty nineteen.
1877000	1883000	All right. We're adding in the chat predictions. Sorry to those that we did not get an ad in there because you guys had a lot of great predictions.
1883000	1889000	But hey, if you want to be like Dark Sakura and make it your goal to start your own YouTube channel next year.
1889000	1897000	One thing that you could do, make a video, create some content with your own predictions and then go back and laugh at yourself in a year, just like we did tonight.
1897000	1902000	I think that would be a fun thing to do, especially for those you guys that already do like twitch streams and stuff like that.
1902000	1905000	V.G. realness, you hear me? All you out there, code man, you out there.
1905000	1910000	Yeah, you guys, Bobby, you guys can do some some stuff with your prediction.
1910000	1918000	And then when you do it, some random company can come in, you know, copyright claim you because the system is so jacked up that anybody can do that.
1918000	1923000	Apparently, that's the business I need to get into is copyright claiming people for things.
1923000	1927000	We need lots of money that way. We got a story on that a little later, so we'll talk a little more about that.
1927000	1934000	But for now, let's get into, as we like to do towards the top of every show, talk about our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about how is your gaming week.
1934000	1938000	So, Loki, you mentioned you got around to playing some games this week. How did I play?
1938000	1943000	I played more Dance Dance Revolution Extreme because I reloaded that back on there.
1943000	1951000	In fact, funny enough, along with that, even though I am going to be converting the cabinet over the set, meaning at some point I have memory card slots coming.
1951000	1956000	So I may be putting those on the machine. You know what that means? Breaking out the edits again.
1956000	1966000	So I'll be doing that. And then I did play Tetris Effect a little bit this week, unlock some of the stuff in the journey mode there.
1966000	1972000	I always forget that they have the Saturday events. I need to set a reminder on my phone because I haven't participated in one in like a month.
1972000	1975000	Because I just forget that the Saturday, I wonder if they've even been meeting them.
1975000	1982000	I don't know, have any of you guys out there been playing Tetris Effect regularly and seeing if they have been meeting their weekly events? Because I'd be really curious about that.
1982000	1997000	What else? Then I also played Pokemon Go a little bit. And then I did play some other PC games. I'm trying to think, what was it?
1997000	2005000	I don't remember. It was that impactful. I did play Mario Kart 8 and part of our stream here to get affiliate status.
2005000	2019000	I unfortunately found out why I was sucking so bad throughout the race. So because my kids play on our console, my Switch, they had the stupid auto-accelerate and auto-steer on.
2019000	2029000	So what that means is my boosts, I was wondering why it wasn't falling off the track, but at the same time it also is like dragging an anchor behind you when you try to actually race in the game.
2029000	2036000	So I could never catch up because the stupid auto-break and auto-accelerate was on. Because I was trying to take shortcuts in my cards.
2036000	2042000	You have to look for those little icons. Because that happened when I was at a gathering. There was like four of us playing Mario Kart.
2042000	2049000	And the same thing was happening is that our one friend is not controlling it the way they think. And it's because we saw the little icon. Oh, the assists were on.
2049000	2053000	And I think a lot of those turn on by default. So you have to really remember to take those off.
2053000	2060000	So I had to, after I got done, I was like, okay, I took them off and everything was fine. But it was just annoying.
2060000	2066000	Because I was like, why can't I catch up to anybody? I'm like, is it the character? Because I don't really play Mario Kart 8 at all.
2066000	2073000	But I'm like, I know I'm better than this. It's like I can't catch up no matter how many boosts I'm using.
2073000	2081000	And then finally I was like, oh, that's why. Because my kids play it and they don't want to fall off the track.
2082000	2088000	And then I played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 yesterday just to play through some of the DLC.
2088000	2093000	The game's kind of messed up on my Playstation 4 now. All the DLC doesn't appear. Only the latest one.
2093000	2099000	I was trying to like 100% it. And then I just got frustrated because the driving physics in the game are just absolute crap.
2099000	2105000	And yet they force you to do races that involve the driving physics. So I did this race like four or five times.
2105000	2113000	Which is just a really simple drive checkpoint. But the car's handles so terribly. It just was frustrating.
2113000	2121000	I just said, fuck it. I am not playing this anymore. I don't know. But I've had the opportunity to play the Playstation 4 all week.
2121000	2125000	But every time I go to sit down and play it, I'm like, I don't know what I want to play.
2125000	2131000	I just don't want to get into Red Dead Redemption 2. I don't know if I'm just gonna be tired of that game.
2131000	2141000	I think that game is too much sim for me. Like I like Grand Theft Auto 5 where you can do the missions and everything and you can just kind of fuck around and do whatever.
2141000	2147000	But this is more like you have to get food, you have to eat, you have to sleep, you have to groom yourself and groom your horse.
2147000	2151000	That's too much fucking work. I don't want to do that. I just want to be able to like fuck around in the game.
2151000	2157000	So that's kind of what's pulling me away from that. I almost went back to Skyrim again. I was almost gonna do that.
2157000	2160000	And I actually am thinking about streaming Skyrim again.
2160000	2161000	Oh, you should. That would be fun.
2161000	2168000	It would be fun. It's just, it's the talking and like waking everybody up or disturbing everybody. That type of stuff.
2168000	2174000	So like I thought about doing like a series just like totally ordinary version of blah blah blah.
2174000	2178000	And just have it like fucking modded to the point where you can't recognize it anymore.
2178000	2181000	And then it's an ironic name.
2181000	2185000	Exactly. So it would be something like that. And they could do Saints Row or something like that too.
2186000	2188000	Okay. That it for your gaming week?
2188000	2189000	That's it for my gaming week.
2189000	2194000	My gaming week. So I played a little Pokemon Go. I know y'all are sick of hearing me talk about mobile games, right?
2194000	2200000	But the big Pokemon Go community day was this weekend. So I actually went down and I played at the state capital.
2200000	2204000	And now that we have this whole Twitch thing, I can actually show a little bit of what that looks like.
2204000	2210000	Because you know Pokemon Go is a dead game, right? Even though there's like people dressing up and stuff as they're playing Pokemon Go out at the capital.
2210000	2214000	And the feature Pokemon Go was Totodile this time.
2214000	2215000	I got one shiny.
2215000	2222000	I took it really easy. I got six shinies, but I was really kind of like half-assing my adventures out of the capital this time.
2222000	2227000	I actually I used my Bluetooth device to do a lot of the catching down at the capital.
2227000	2232000	And you know that that caught plenty of the Pokemon that way.
2232000	2235000	And I was catching a little bit.
2236000	2244000	What I found is that as I was doing like walking, like lots and lots of walking, is that the various Pokemon were hatching.
2244000	2247000	The eggs were like continuously hatching over and over again.
2247000	2249000	And it kind of like kept interrupting me.
2249000	2256000	So there came a point where I was like, all right, I'm going to just Bluetooth catch things, walk a lap around the park to hatch all of my eggs.
2256000	2258000	Because the hatch time was cut like way down.
2258000	2263000	So I can like reset everything and then load them all up at the same time.
2263000	2264000	So that the hatching doesn't get in the way.
2264000	2266000	But then, of course, you're like right in the midst of things.
2266000	2268000	And it's like I'm trying to roll with a group of people.
2268000	2271000	And then all of a sudden, oh, I got nine eggs hatching all at once with the animation.
2271000	2273000	And so that got to be a little bit annoying.
2273000	2278000	But I was cool with the six shinies because honestly, like there's so many shinies now.
2278000	2281000	And if Shane is still in chat, he's going to totally disagree with me.
2281000	2287000	I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, all right, once I have like the three, the set to have one, I'm kind of over it.
2287000	2288000	Like I'm done. I'm ready to go.
2288000	2290000	But I was happy out of the six.
2290000	2292000	I caught two of them were the highest appraisal.
2292000	2294000	So I actually which is funny.
2294000	2295000	So I got like a feral gator.
2295000	2298000	I evolved it up to get the hierarchy cannon and actually like used it in a raid today.
2298000	2299000	And it was a shiny.
2299000	2301000	So I was it's kind of neat.
2301000	2302000	I'm always neat.
2302000	2306000	But get this. And I'm sure if he is in chat, he's going to say Shane caught.
2306000	2308000	Get this. Twenty five shinies.
2308000	2309000	He got twenty five shiny.
2309000	2310000	You know what his trick is?
2310000	2311000	He does.
2311000	2315000	Well, first off, he doesn't go for the social stuff you saw in the video there on Twitch.
2315000	2316000	You saw it.
2316000	2317000	Let me roll it one more time.
2317000	2318000	I got the same B roll.
2318000	2321000	You see, look, everybody's hanging out with their friends.
2321000	2322000	They're talking.
2322000	2325000	They're casually walking, doing their thing, dressing up, having a good time.
2325000	2326000	Right.
2326000	2327000	That's what they're doing.
2327000	2330000	That's not what Shane does when he's like, man on a mission.
2330000	2331000	Right.
2331000	2334000	He does the fast catching as he's going and checking the shiny.
2334000	2336000	And he's doing the fast catching over and over.
2336000	2339000	And then if he sees a shiny, he might spend a little more time to catch it.
2339000	2340000	But he's walking fast, going everywhere.
2340000	2341000	And he's in the zone.
2341000	2342000	And that's how he did.
2342000	2347000	He got twenty four total dials and one Bulbasaur because the event was that capital.
2347000	2351000	Well, where we went, we went to Capitol Park, which happened to be a Bulbasaur nest during the event.
2351000	2353000	So, yeah, he got twenty five shinies.
2353000	2355000	And I was like, what?
2355000	2357000	What are you going to do with that many shinies?
2357000	2359000	They're shiny.
2359000	2360000	The typical response.
2360000	2361000	Right.
2361000	2363000	All right.
2363000	2368000	Oh, and Shane is in chat under Shad Leland saying, no, I don't do the social stuff.
2368000	2371000	This is a mission every community day.
2371000	2376000	By the way, while he's here and while I know he's in chat, can all you chatters give a big congratulations?
2376000	2380000	Congratulations to Shane in chat because he got married at the beginning of the month.
2380000	2382000	So I think that's worthy of a congratulations.
2382000	2385000	So congratulations to Shane and husband on the marriage.
2385000	2387000	So everybody yay in chat for me, please.
2387000	2390000	And now they're asking about Phoebus Day in chat.
2390000	2392000	So did you know that this is a thing coming up next week?
2392000	2393000	They're going to Phoebus Day.
2393000	2401000	It's not a community day, but it's like a quest period where all the quests will reward Phoebus and some of them will be shiny.
2401000	2402000	It's kind of a new thing.
2402000	2404000	But I don't like Phoebus.
2404000	2406000	It's a stupid fish.
2406000	2408000	Yeah, it's lame.
2408000	2410000	I don't like it either, but the shiny ones are cute.
2410000	2412000	So I don't want it.
2412000	2415000	All right. Other games that I play because I don't just play mobile phone games all the time, believe it or not.
2415000	2419000	Even though I started another mobile one called Turf Wars.
2419000	2420000	It's stupid. It reminds me.
2420000	2423000	Do you remember when we used to play like the sorority or you never play this with the sorority?
2423000	2429000	I think now know the sorority wars on Facebook, which is like you're building your mob of friends and attacking.
2429000	2430000	It's so ridiculous.
2430000	2434000	But it does incorporate real life stuff into it.
2434000	2436000	So I was intrigued.
2436000	2441000	All this makes me think about is the bad lip reading song, Gang Fight.
2441000	2443000	Yes.
2443000	2445000	It's just...
2445000	2447000	All right. Anyway.
2447000	2449000	Let's see. So other stuff I played.
2449000	2451000	I played Soul Calibur 6 finally.
2451000	2452000	So I had bought that on sale.
2452000	2454000	I did a little stream of Soul Calibur 6.
2454000	2459000	I was really pleased with how robust the features are in Soul Calibur 6.
2459000	2463000	Because you have like a story mode that you go through with your own created character.
2463000	2468000	Each individual person has their own story that you can go through and everything's like on a timeline.
2468000	2470000	You can do the arcade mode.
2470000	2471000	You can do online.
2471000	2476000	So I was very pleased with how much there is kind of to do for a fighting game in Soul Calibur 6.
2476000	2479000	I was playing on PC, so it runs pretty well.
2479000	2481000	It's a pretty smooth fighting game.
2481000	2486000	You have these very over the top extra sort of moves that I come to love from Soul Calibur.
2486000	2489000	And the narrations didn't disappoint.
2489000	2492000	Because you know that's my favorite part of a Soul Calibur game.
2492000	2499000	Two souls intertwined enter the battle arena where one will emerge victorious.
2499000	2504000	Who shall be victorious on this day of judgment when the sword comes to life.
2504000	2507000	The narration is so crazy and over the top.
2507000	2508000	That's my favorite part.
2508000	2510000	So the narration in Soul Calibur 6 didn't disappoint.
2510000	2512000	So yeah, I give a thumbs up to Soul Calibur 6.
2512000	2514000	It's still a pricey game.
2514000	2517000	So you gotta really love your fighting games and your Soul Calibur.
2517000	2518000	But I'm into it.
2518000	2520000	So I was liking it.
2520000	2524000	And I played some of the Mario Kart 8 online as well.
2524000	2526000	And continuing to play Switch stuff online.
2526000	2528000	A little Smash Brothers just a little bit.
2528000	2531000	And PC stuff, World of Warcraft still.
2531000	2534000	Final Fantasy XIV did get a big patch this past week.
2534000	2538000	So I played the part one story of 4.5 that they released.
2538000	2540000	Which was really good. I really enjoyed the story.
2540000	2542000	And there's a new dungeon to go with it.
2542000	2544000	And I thought they did a good job with that as well.
2544000	2548000	And I'm interested to see what Bloom Age ends up being next week.
2548000	2551000	Because you know they did some really controversial things with the job, right?
2551000	2556000	Where it's a limited job and you can't really use it in normal end game content.
2556000	2560000	And in fact they capped the level lower than what the level cap really is in the game.
2560000	2564000	So people like can't overpower or whatever end game rates.
2564000	2567000	So I'm curious to see if I like it.
2567000	2570000	Or if it just ends up being a really fleshed out mini game.
2570000	2574000	Which one other thing on Final Fantasy XIV speaking of fleshed out mini games.
2574000	2576000	Something people aren't really talking about.
2576000	2579000	Because it's not really as prevalent in American culture.
2579000	2585000	But Final Fantasy XIV added full on mahjong in the gold saucer.
2585000	2587000	And it's not half assed.
2587000	2592000	It's a full play mahjong with other players or robots.
2592000	2595000	And you get gold saucer point rewards for it.
2595000	2597000	And it's the full rules of the game and everything.
2597000	2599000	And I was like dang this is kind of impressive.
2599000	2602000	So there's some people that happen to know how to play mahjong.
2602000	2605000	That are like this is what they're doing in the patch now.
2605000	2609000	It's like I'm paying $12.95 a month or however much Final Fantasy XIV costs.
2609000	2612000	To play mahjong online all day.
2612000	2613000	No more tetra master?
2613000	2615000	No that was the Final Fantasy XI thing.
2615000	2618000	No that was never in Final Fantasy XI that was like a separate thing.
2619000	2623000	So I guess they figured why have it a separate thing when you just build it into the main game.
2623000	2627000	Get everybody to pay the subscription for the main game to play the feature over here.
2627000	2630000	But I will say Final Fantasy XIV doesn't disappoint.
2630000	2633000	I mean over the years when it comes to like the side stuff.
2633000	2636000	Because they have the chocobo racing is all in there as well.
2636000	2639000	There's the mini games and I'm missing another big one.
2639000	2641000	That there is in the gold saucer.
2641000	2642000	I feel like another big event.
2642000	2644000	Well the costume thing that's a little silly.
2644000	2649000	But I'm pretty impressed with how much side stuff they've done.
2649000	2652000	And I'm sure that will only continue in the next expansion.
2652000	2653000	We'll see.
2654000	2655000	Alright.
2655000	2660000	So SH2100Matt over in our VoG network chat at twitch.tv slash VoG network says,
2660000	2663000	Old ladies are playing mahjong all day.
2663000	2667000	Yeah it's very prevalent especially in Asian countries and culture.
2667000	2672000	I know that's kind of like poker might be a thing in the States.
2672000	2675000	Mahjong is something that people really get into in other places.
2675000	2678000	And considering that Final Fantasy XIV is very big in Japan.
2678000	2680000	They don't have World of Warcraft in Japan remember.
2680000	2689000	So yeah it makes sense that they're doing some things that are culturally appropriate for places that aren't just the US, Canada and so forth.
2689000	2690000	So kind of neat.
2690000	2693000	And it teaches if you don't know how to play.
2693000	2695000	I don't know how to play mahjong but the game has a tutorial in it.
2695000	2697000	Oh I remember the other thing they had in there.
2697000	2699000	The Lords of Verminion.
2699000	2702000	Which was like the Lords of Verminion but they did it with the minions.
2702000	2704000	I forgot that was the other thing.
2704000	2706000	I was like I knew there was something else in Gold Saucer they spent.
2706000	2713000	But like nobody plays it Loki and it's sad because it's like a full fleshed out pet battle thing that's more intricate than what World of Warcraft has.
2713000	2715000	But you know it is what it is.
2715000	2716000	Alright anyway.
2716000	2717000	Let's move on.
2717000	2719000	That's really it for my gaming week.
2719000	2721000	As far as housekeeping goes.
2721000	2724000	Next week Dark Soccer will be here.
2724000	2725000	Although Loki won't.
2725000	2727000	But we hope you'll tune in.
2727000	2728000	Yeah I'll be at the broccoli farm.
2728000	2729000	That's right.
2729000	2730000	Well that's going to be a fun trip though.
2730000	2731000	It will be a fun trip.
2731000	2732000	You know while you're there.
2732000	2735000	Since we have this whole Twitch thing now you should shoot some video at the arcades.
2735000	2737000	If you see some Wreck-It Ralph or something we ought to see.
2737000	2739000	Any Tron references.
2739000	2740000	I want video.
2740000	2741000	Okay.
2741000	2743000	I doubt there will be anything.
2743000	2744000	But just in case. You never know.
2744000	2746000	I will look for Tron stuff.
2746000	2747000	Sounds good.
2747000	2748000	I'm trying to.
2748000	2750000	I don't know if I'm going to get a chance to.
2750000	2753000	But I did scout out before we go.
2753000	2756000	I scouted out where the nearest round one is.
2756000	2757000	So I want to go to round one.
2757000	2758000	It's only like I think like.
2758000	2760000	But Irvine ought to have one right?
2760000	2761000	No Anaheim has one.
2761000	2762000	Oh cool.
2762000	2763000	And so they have one.
2763000	2766000	It looks about like five ten minutes away from where we're staying.
2766000	2771000	So I may go there depending on the time we have.
2771000	2775000	And if I can get away just for like an hour or two.
2775000	2777000	I may try to do that.
2777000	2778000	Alright.
2778000	2779000	Sounds like fun.
2779000	2780000	Alright well let's get into some gaming news.
2780000	2781000	We got a lot of news to cover this week.
2781000	2782000	Things.
2782000	2783000	The holidays are done.
2783000	2786000	And things are ramping up again in the gaming world right?
2786000	2787000	Yes.
2787000	2789000	2019 is starting off pretty interesting.
2789000	2795000	So we have the announcement that Bungie is going to be splitting up with Activision.
2795000	2800000	So basically they're ending their partnership with Activision.
2800000	2807000	And with that they're actually going to be continuing to I guess work on Destiny.
2807000	2811000	Destiny will be retained by Bungie as their property.
2811000	2814000	So it's not going to be something that you know we're going to have to look forward to.
2814000	2818000	Destiny games from Activision without Bungie.
2818000	2822000	So basically you know they said you know we've enjoyed a successful eight year run.
2822000	2825000	And we'd like to thank Activision for their partnership on Destiny.
2825000	2832000	Looking ahead we're excited to announce plans for Activision to transfer publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie.
2832000	2836000	And with our remarkable Destiny community we are ready to publish on our own.
2836000	2841000	While Activision will increase their focus on owned IP projects.
2841000	2843000	So more Call of Duty.
2843000	2848000	And to clear up like the number one like misconception I think that's out there.
2848000	2850000	Activision never owned Bungie.
2850000	2853000	Because there's a lot of people like the gut reaction I'm seeing.
2853000	2858000	Maybe it's just the people I follow on Twitter because of my history with the shows I've co-hosted previously.
2858000	2859000	Horde House being one of them.
2859000	2861000	So obviously I talk to a lot of Blizzard people right?
2861000	2865000	And so like the number one thing I'm seeing is oh Blizzard ought to do the same thing.
2865000	2866000	But it's different.
2866000	2868000	Activision owns Blizzard right?
2868000	2870000	Technically that company is Activision Blizzard right?
2870000	2871000	Yeah.
2871000	2872000	So Activision owns Blizzard.
2872000	2874000	Activision never owned Bungie.
2874000	2875000	They never owned Bungie.
2875000	2877000	This was like a publishing agreement.
2877000	2879000	This was an agreement between the two companies.
2879000	2881000	A very intricate agreement.
2881000	2884000	But there was never really the ownership.
2884000	2886000	And as being pointed out in our chat room.
2886000	2890000	Tigerclaw points out this is the second time Bungie splits from a publisher.
2890000	2892000	They used to be with Microsoft previously.
2892000	2893000	Of course right?
2893000	2895000	Because Bungie made the Halo games.
2895000	2896000	Right.
2896000	2897000	And so they also have.
2897000	2898000	So it was a big deal.
2898000	2900000	When they split and they were owned by Microsoft.
2900000	2901000	If I remember right.
2901000	2903000	It was a studio.
2903000	2904000	So that was.
2904000	2906000	When they first partnered with Activision.
2906000	2907000	That was a big deal.
2907000	2908000	Because it was.
2908000	2909000	Oh shit.
2909000	2912000	Destiny is going to be on PlayStation.
2912000	2915000	As well as you know the Microsoft console.
2915000	2918000	And Sony sure as shit milked that for a while too.
2918000	2920000	Because they had some exclusives.
2920000	2922000	On the original Destiny at least.
2922000	2923000	And I think with the second one too.
2923000	2924000	You know kind of coming out the gate.
2924000	2925000	So.
2925000	2926000	Yeah.
2926000	2927000	Kind of a different you know.
2927000	2929000	But still a very big news.
2929000	2932000	Well plus they also have a new game in development as well.
2932000	2934000	Though they're working on with NetEase.
2934000	2936000	So there's that whenever we see that announcement.
2936000	2937000	Which is ironic.
2937000	2941000	Because NetEase is also the people behind Diablo Immortal.
2941000	2943000	Which if you do want to compare things to Blizzard.
2943000	2946000	That whole controversy and how they announce that.
2946000	2947000	Again.
2947000	2950000	My personal feeling is that Diablo Immortal and going that direction.
2950000	2952000	Was never a bad idea.
2952000	2953000	But this just goes to show.
2954000	2955000	They should teach this.
2955000	2957000	Video game public relations 101.
2957000	2958000	This is a lesson to be learned.
2958000	2961000	College thesis should be written on this.
2961000	2963000	Is all in the messaging.
2963000	2965000	It is all in the messaging for that.
2965000	2968000	2018 will be a good year for that as well.
2968000	2970000	Because if you look at it you've got that.
2970000	2972000	You've got the whole Fallout 76 thing.
2972000	2974000	Which is still ongoing.
2974000	2977000	Just all of the messaging around that.
2977000	2978000	And PR responses.
2978000	2980000	It's just not great.
2980000	2983000	So looking forward to what's going to be coming.
2983000	2984000	I'm curious to see.
2984000	2988000	Because Destiny I feel like a lot of the monetization in that kind of hurt the game.
2988000	2993000	Especially a lot of it where they were focusing on monetization instead of fixing bug problems.
2993000	2998000	And I'm wondering how much of that is Activision and how much of it was Bungie.
2998000	3001000	So now that they're away from Activision.
3001000	3005000	We're going to see how much of that was Activision and how much of it is Bungie.
3005000	3007000	I think there were good things though too.
3007000	3009000	I mean believe it or not I'm going to say some good things.
3009000	3014000	I think the inclusion of Destiny 2 in the Battle.net launcher was huge.
3014000	3016000	Is that still going to be a thing now?
3016000	3017000	They're not saying.
3017000	3018000	I don't know.
3018000	3020000	I don't know how that works and the publishing agreements and all that.
3020000	3025000	I think if it does exit the launcher it will be very quietly done.
3025000	3026000	You can count on that.
3026000	3029000	And I don't think anything will happen in the immediate future.
3029000	3034000	Because doesn't Activision still stand to make money off Destiny 2 if it sells?
3034000	3035000	Probably.
3035000	3038000	So if Activision is still making money off the sales of Destiny 2.
3038000	3040000	Which is funny because they gave it away at one point.
3040000	3043000	But the expansions and all that still coming into play.
3043000	3046000	I don't think Activision is just going to scrape it off the launcher.
3046000	3049000	I think it will still be there for a good long time.
3049000	3053000	Maybe they're talking more like Destiny 3 or a new Destiny game or something.
3053000	3055000	Destiny 2 Switch when?
3055000	3058000	Because you know that's the tweet all over town right?
3058000	3060000	Going to chat.
3060000	3063000	Kaijuto in chat says never like the name Activision.
3063000	3066000	Activision is a really old gaming company.
3066000	3070000	And Tigerclaw kind of shed some light on this.
3070000	3076000	Activision was originally created so that the game developers get credit for the games they created on the Atari 2600.
3076000	3077000	Absolutely.
3077000	3079000	David Crane's Pitfall.
3079000	3080000	Remember?
3080000	3086000	A lot of developers went over to Activision because Activision, believe it or not, at that time was like the good guys.
3086000	3090000	That's where you went to get the full credit for the games.
3091000	3098000	Activision made some very strong titles on the Atari 2600 and other platforms around that time.
3098000	3110000	But some of the biggest Atari 2600 games, things like Kaboom, things like the Dragster, Drag Racing game, Freeway, Pitfall, those were all Activision titles.
3110000	3120000	And that's why those flashback consoles, the newer ones like this, maybe seven, but I know eight and nine for sure, they include Activision titles.
3120000	3123000	And that's what makes those some of the better ones that are available.
3123000	3127000	So Activision wasn't always like the bad kid in the neighborhood.
3127000	3137000	And it's really interesting how this crown of shame, or the shame bell if you will, kind of floats around to different developers year after year.
3137000	3142000	One year, EA's the bad guy. Worst company in America, right? Then Activision's the bad guy.
3142000	3147000	They're all bad for different reasons. They have their own flavors of bad.
3147000	3156000	Microsoft probably wore that crown at one point, but I would say at this point, I don't think, I mean, there's always going to be some Microsoft haters when it comes to like the operating system wars and all that.
3156000	3160000	But I would say in the gaming sense, I don't think people are ganging up on Microsoft right now.
3160000	3161000	No.
3161000	3165000	There's a lot of people that are actually kind of like, oh, we hope you catch up, you know, oh, crackdown three.
3165000	3177000	You know, I think there's a lot of, you know, but it just goes to show, taking it all the way back to something I mentioned almost an hour ago at the top of the show, kind of that gaming attention span where one year it was one way.
3177000	3181000	We should have wrote down on the paper, who do we hate now?
3181000	3189000	Here's the companies we hate the most going into 2019. What does it look like at the end of, you know, 2019 going into 2020?
3189000	3191000	I think that would be an interesting thing to look at.
3191000	3192000	I don't know.
3192000	3193000	So let's see.
3193000	3198000	Bobby Black Wolf shouting out Oink, which is also a great Atari 2600 game.
3198000	3200000	One of my favorites is a multiplayer.
3200000	3202000	One person could be the wolf and the other could be the pigs.
3202000	3204000	Anyway, let's see.
3204000	3213000	Tiger Claw says the reality is they split from Activision because they've been breathing down their necks and wanting such and such in their games.
3213000	3215000	And Tiger Claw says now Activision doing it.
3215000	3217000	So Bungie being better on their own.
3217000	3224000	So, you know, a lot of people were calling out the changes in stock and what's happened with the stock prices since this happened.
3224000	3226000	And the stock has kind of come down a little bit.
3226000	3229000	I would say certainly this is probably a part of it.
3229000	3232000	But I feel like Activision has been in the news for a lot of weird things lately.
3232000	3236000	Right. Like they just had what was it their CFO or somebody went over to Netflix.
3236000	3240000	That was a headline I don't think we got to last week because of the power outage.
3240000	3245000	Then we had the mobile game. The Diablo disaster was a blizzard.
3245000	3249000	That is still something Blizzard's kind of taken licks on.
3249000	3259000	And then a little more recently after that, everything Heroes of the Storm is going through with that league kind of getting, you know, basically pushed away into a deep, dark closet somewhere.
3259000	3263000	And then basically saying we're not going to do major updates on the game anymore.
3263000	3267000	I mean, there's been a lot of kind of not so great news coming out of Activision Blizzard.
3267000	3270000	This is just kind of the what next?
3270000	3280000	I'm not sure how the Black Ops 4 sales were either because I don't think a lot of these games that have been putting out each year are doing better than last year.
3280000	3283000	I don't know where things are as far as sales go with those.
3283000	3289000	I know they always really have a high expectation for the fourth quarter sales on those Call of Duty games.
3289000	3293000	But I don't think anything's matched up to like, I don't even know what the last big one have been.
3293000	3300000	Black Ops 3 maybe? I mean, I haven't been interested in them in a long time, which is unfortunate, especially this one.
3300000	3303000	This one actually looked interesting, but then they didn't put a single player campaign.
3303000	3306000	So I have no interest in it now.
3306000	3309000	Great chat comment from vidpower573.
3309000	3318000	Can you think of a time, and I'm sure you can think of a time, but think of the general population, not just you, that Nintendo was the bad guys.
3318000	3320000	Nintendo was absolutely the bad guys.
3320000	3324000	Because usually Nintendo, we like Nintendo, we stick up for Nintendo, right?
3324000	3327000	We get mad at Nintendo because we want them to do better, right?
3327000	3329000	But do you remember a time when Nintendo was the bad guys?
3329000	3332000	Um...
3332000	3335000	Alright, let me get to vidpower's comment.
3335000	3341000	Back in the NES day, Nintendo's iron grip on NES publishing made them the bad guys.
3342000	3349000	The Nintendo's seal of quality and all that, and their fights with Tengen and what happened with Tetris and, you know, that whole thing.
3349000	3351000	That, in some ways, made them the bad guys.
3351000	3360000	Why you have Ultra games that put out the Ninja Turtles game and the original Metal Gear and all this was because Konami hit their three game a year limit or whatever.
3360000	3366000	I don't remember if it was three games a season or three games a year, but they wanted to do more, so they created a secondary company to be able to do that.
3367000	3372000	And then, of course, I thought of another one. Nintendo was kind of the bad guys when it came to the YouTube and all that stuff.
3372000	3375000	But you could also kind of blame YouTube for a lot of that.
3375000	3379000	I'm not out here to make a We Hate Nintendo show because we don't.
3379000	3386000	But it just goes to show everybody at some point makes the mistake that makes them the ire of the gaming industry for a little bit, right?
3386000	3388000	So, there is that.
3388000	3390000	Anyway, I guess we'll move on, right?
3390000	3392000	So let's continue with Nintendo.
3392000	3394000	I think this is a pretty neat move from Nintendo.
3394000	3397000	It's interesting and I'm curious to see how it goes.
3397000	3400000	That is a new partnership with The Humble Store.
3400000	3402000	That's right, the home of The Humble Bundle.
3402000	3408000	They also have a store, you may or may not have known, and when you buy games on there, you can donate a portion of it to charity.
3408000	3411000	Not all of it, obviously, because there are a lot of new games on there.
3411000	3417000	But The Humble Store announced this week on their website that they are now selling Nintendo games.
3417000	3419000	I did a little bit of browsing on there and you can buy.
3419000	3425000	It doesn't seem like the whole catalog of indie titles is mostly first-party Nintendo stuff.
3425000	3430000	You can buy Smash, you can buy the new Mario game, you can buy Splatoon, you can buy Zelda.
3430000	3434000	You can buy pretty much the big Nintendo first-party titles on The Humble Store.
3434000	3443000	But that's kind of neat because, you know, I don't know about you, but I've always kind of thought of Nintendo as the company that they don't want to partner up with other stores.
3443000	3445000	Well, that's not necessarily true.
3445000	3451000	They do that with GameStop. They sell their digital codes through there. They also sell digital codes through Amazon.
3451000	3452000	Fair enough.
3452000	3454000	I think a lot of other store friends do it.
3454000	3462000	What I like about The Humble Store, though, I think with Humble Monthly you get some cashback or credit or something like that that you can use with things.
3462000	3467000	So, it's neat that they have that. It's just another option to be able to purchase things.
3467000	3472000	I hope that means that we're going to see another Nintendo bundle because, you know, now that my kids have 2DSs and stuff,
3472000	3478000	I still have some 3DS keys sitting in my library that I was like, hey, you know, I could give you some more games if you guys want, you know?
3478000	3484000	Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah, so I would love to see, you know, Humble Bumble, I don't think we're going to get first-party Nintendo titles.
3484000	3491000	Well, never say never. I mean, something, is there any title that kind of disappeared on the ARMS?
3491000	3495000	I'm sorry, no. All the ARMS fans are going to come at me now.
3495000	3496000	All one of them.
3497000	3505000	With their two arms. No, I don't know. Is there any, like, completely underperforming Nintendo title that they're just not going to probably focus on anymore on the Switch?
3505000	3509000	I don't know. So, maybe something like that might show up in a bundle, but I kind of doubt it.
3509000	3520000	Nintendo really, Nintendo doesn't even tend to put their shit on sale, but I think, Loki, you're a little more on it where it's like, well, they partner up with these other stores and do digital codes, especially in a storefront on the receipt, so why not team up with Humble?
3520000	3525000	I wouldn't necessarily think we're going to see a deep discount on digital codes. There usually isn't.
3525000	3532000	In unison, Act F, DSG, 100, Matt, 1, 2, Switch. Brilliant. Brilliant idea, right? The hell with that game, man.
3532000	3537000	It wasn't. He's trying to capture that Wii Sports magic. Never going to fucking happen again.
3538000	3540000	God, 1, 2, Switch is fucking terrible.
3541000	3553000	Anyway, so I kind of think this is interesting, especially, you know, 2019 in some ways is going to be the real year of the store evolution, I think, in some ways, right?
3553000	3572000	We already know GameStop, they know their time is limited, and you walk into a GameStop this day and age, you see, sure, of course you still see physical games, they still buy the games, but you notice less of the store is focusing on that than it was a few years ago, and now it's more like what BoxLunch and the other, like the nerd stuff. Nerd store.
3572000	3594000	Oh, right, because they own the thing geeked, so they have all that stuff in there, and also you have to figure, and this was kind of the situation that, you know, our company was going through when we were kind of at the tail end before they closed everything, is because game margins aren't very big, and you can't really run your company on selling just new games. You're not going to be able to make a profit enough to...
3594000	3599000	But those little shitty Funko Pop dolls, no, I shouldn't say that, they are fun, but you know...
3599000	3600000	They're just not shitty.
3600000	3607000	No, and the only reason I hate on those things, just to be clear, the only reason I hate on those things, they're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're like...
3607000	3608000	Yeah.
3608000	3610000	But, including in this house, yes, I see you looking over there...
3610000	3614000	Well, and like arcade games, and like, you know, and amiibo, I mean...
3614000	3616000	I'm shooting myself in the foot, clearly.
3616000	3624000	So like, yeah, they make a lot of money, because the collectible stuff makes a lot of money, and I honestly like, I enjoy looking at, you know, especially like...
3624000	3631000	Nowadays, I know what's coming out, like, I don't need to like, go and browse the shelves, and every time I browse the shelves, it's like...
3631000	3638000	What do I want in here? Like, what's on the discount that I would pick out? I'm like, none of this, because I'm not going to play any of this.
3639000	3643000	But I do look at all of like, the toys and stuff, and board games, and I'm like, oh hey!
3643000	3649000	And then our store nearby has like, Gundam models. I was like, oh...
3649000	3656000	Oh, you've come calling to me again! I literally, I had a huge collection of Gundam models, and I threw them all away.
3656000	3663000	But, and honestly, the GameStop thing is not the only thing I'm talking about when I talk about the year of the store changing, but of course, obviously we have this...
3663000	3673000	Steam versus Epic Store versus Humble Store versus GOG, you know, versus Discord, all of this kind of starting to really get interesting with what, you know...
3673000	3680000	And this has been an ongoing conversation with the price slashing for what, you know, the cut that the publishers get and all that.
3680000	3683000	This is really heating up, and I think it's going to be a big year for that.
3683000	3692000	So isn't this interesting, where Humble's approach now for how can we get head, how can we, is why are we limiting ourselves to selling PC games?
3692000	3704000	Why not have a storefront to go buy Nintendo PC, and I bet before too long if they can get agreements on the dotted line, Microsoft seems like an obvious, you know, next branch for that.
3704000	3712000	Maybe even Sony at some point, although Sony, you know, probably wants to sell movies too, as they kind of like their place, but nothing's impossible, right?
3712000	3713000	So we'll see.
3713000	3725000	Yeah, so, I mean, if anything, you know, at the very least, it makes browsing those titles easier on the Humble Store because it sure as hell aren't easy to browse on the eShop, so...
3725000	3738000	I mean, really, I don't understand with the eShop too, that really doesn't make any sense why it couldn't be better, because I mean, look at like what the eShop was or the Wii Store, whatever the hell it was called on the Wii, I mean, it was better on the Wii.
3738000	3747000	And we're now on like several generations of systems later, and you can't do at least as good as you did before, I don't understand why that can't be possible.
3747000	3759000	Alright, well, let's move on to our next story, because actually, looking at Twitch and the headlines, I can actually see that we're gonna address this store war issue again coming up real soon, so maybe I should just bite my tongue until then and move on to the next story.
3760000	3781000	So yeah, so I'll try to like figure out what's going on here. So we've got basically some back and forth lawsuits with Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, and I guess a former Gearbox attorney Wade Callender.
3781000	3784000	Looks like Callender. I'm gonna say Callender.
3784000	3788000	We have the signature of one of those guys right here, that a listener got us, did you know that?
3788000	3794000	Yeah, you probably didn't come through on Twitch, it may be if I'd gotten that sharpness on the camera to stick tonight, but interesting.
3794000	3808000	Yeah, Randy Pitchford, not the most, yeah, I don't know. Anyways, so let's try to follow some of this, because it's just kind of scandalous stuff that probably not necessarily refer, you know, it's just drama.
3808000	3810000	It's just drama, so basically.
3810000	3812000	It's ugly. It's ugly.
3812000	3834000	Yeah, it's ugly. So first there's, let's see, there's like a case that was against Callender, which I guess, then there was a complaint filed also, they were saying that Callender then sued Randy Pitchford and Gearbox in December of last year, basically in retaliation.
3834000	3852000	And said that that lawsuit was in regards to Randy Pitchford allegedly taking a $12 million bonus from Take Two Interactive in 2016 that he funneled into Pitchford Entertainment Media Magic LLC.
3852000	3873000	And then of course, there's another part of this which has to do with alleging that Randy Pitchford accidentally forgot a USB drive at a Dallas area Medieval Times restaurant in 2014, and the USB drive contained both highly sensitive business documents and underage pornography.
3874000	3879000	Okay. Gross. Yes.
3879000	3890000	And then of course the whole original, I guess, lawsuit. So apparently the lawsuit against Callender from November was for misusing company funds.
3890000	3896000	It said that he borrowed money from the company for a home loan and tuition that wasn't fully paid back.
3897000	3908000	And then also, I guess, as using credit cards for personal expenses, such as family vacations, gun club memberships, firearm accessories, and trying to get six pack.
3908000	3919000	So this is, this is, it's, it's beyond ugly. I mean, when we talk about very, very, very serious things like pornography of underage folks, which is horrific, monstrous.
3919000	3930000	I mean, you know, every, every negative word I can think of just inserted here, it's disgusting. Right. And it's unforgivable and heaven forbid, but at the same time, you know, it's, it's not been proven in a court of law yet.
3930000	3939000	So, you know, despite the way social media works, sometimes we want to, you know, innocent until proven guilty, but that's a fucking monster of a claim to me.
3939000	3942000	Well, I hope to, I hope to hell it's not true.
3943000	3957000	From what I, because I kind of like heard a few people tell the story. So from what I heard, it was, I think Randy Pitchford had gone on some podcasts and talked about like his, like, I don't know, his like taste in like pornography or something like that.
3957000	3968000	And like talked about like cam girls and things. I don't remember exactly how that came up, but it's something along the lines of that. And so it was apparently related to that in some way. I don't know.
3968000	3978000	Just, just for the record, game developers out there interested in coming on Orange Lawns Radio, I, we ask a lot of crazy questions. I'll never ask about your porno habits. That's your business. Okay. What the hell?
3978000	3997000	I don't even know where it came up from, but like, but of course, Gearbox also, they put out a statement basically saying Gearbox will be filing a grievance with the State Bar of Texas against our former general counsel, Wade, for disciplinary proceedings for filing a lawsuit that includes accusations that he knows to be untrue.
3997000	4001000	Lawyers, legal clap back basically. Yeah.
4001000	4015000	Look, here's the thing. I, I really hope and pray it's not true because the, the problem, obviously the problem besides the crime, which is a big fucking problem, but it's going to taint everything this guy's touched. You know what I mean?
4015000	4032000	And all these other, you know, and I pointed at this, this poster that one of our listeners kindly got us a lot of the signatures. The problem is if this guy made a monster fuck up of that kind of proportion and he's the CEO of that company, then this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, and this guy, they all pay for it.
4032000	4040000	And that's, that's just the ugly side of this and the true, what was the big O that you just let out over there? I'm a little worried now.
4040000	4055000	So apparently, so the Ars Technica, I guess, had found, um, they said Gearbox CEO says he left USB stick of porn at medieval times. So I guess he was on this podcast that, and he stated that he did that.
4055000	4065000	Okay, but porn, porn is one thing, you know, porn is underage porn is a whole other thing. You know what I mean?
4065000	4082000	Yeah. Yeah. So Loki, I don't think we know. I don't think the game blogs know. I think this is some of those things is that one of those things is going to have to be settled in a court of law. And it just sucks that this is as ugly as it is.
4082000	4097000	Because like I said, you know, him being the CEO of the company and with as much anticipation as there is about like a Borderlands three, a story of that magnitude in this type of trouble, if, if proven to be true, uh, is going to affect everyone.
4097000	4106000	So I don't know if it's necessarily underage porn, but basically, so it says, um, he was on the December 22nd episode of the piff pod and he says a pitch.
4106000	4116000	He talked at length about porn that he enjoys, including cam girl pornography in which the host exposes themselves to a live feed and takes requests and financial tips for consumers or whatever.
4116000	4130000	Says he explains that he was a consumer of this content. He then confirmed that he copied a specific video to this memory stick as he describes it to work out a method of how the cam girl hosts fake the act of female ejaculation.
4130000	4141000	Uh, he says, I realized this is not a sex worker. This is a fucking magician for those under and he says, uh, he had a vested interest in the field of magicians and owns a magic focus.
4141000	4151000	Janai magazine. So he says that he claims, he says, this was before I learned I should have password protected memory sticks. And before a meeting, they left the USB flash drive at the medieval times.
4151000	4164000	I just don't want to hear it. I don't, I don't want to hear the story. Okay. Just, just enough. Okay. As Bobby, Bobby puts in our chat room, Bobby says, uh, he said she was barely 18.
4164000	4178000	He was on a magic podcast, uh, like, uh, pen and teller style magic. And it came up because what the cam girl did was magical, but he lost the USB stick immediately. Okay. Look, this has nothing to do with games at this point, honestly.
4178000	4202000	Um, just work it out in court. And I hope to God, you know, it's, it's people like what they like, but it needs to be legal done. Don't ruin the legacy of your game that so many people enjoy and love by doing something so fucking ridiculous and trying to be a bad ass on a podcast, which I realized is really ironic coming from us.
4202000	4216000	But, um, I, we, we've said a lot of weird shit on the, that, that, that's even out somewhere. I host the rock, your picture show. And that's weird. All I gotta say, man, is those special attacks in Borderlands three are going to be some serious magical shit.
4216000	4229000	Right. Bobby and chat says, this is why I didn't cover it. Wait a minute though. Cause you spent that time enhancing a story that you'd done last week. Right. It was, it was on your short list. All right. Anyway, let's move on.
4229000	4243000	I, we just, for the love of God, let's move on to a different story. All right. Uh, let's talk about what's going on with the division two, because this was a bombshell announcement this week. The division two, not going to be on steam initially is the word being used, which is an interesting word.
4243000	4257000	Uh, and we'll actually launch on the Epic game store on March 15th. This, according to a report from gamesindustry.biz, uh, as we know, the Epic game store has the 12% share whereas steam takes a 30% share.
4257000	4269000	So is that coming into this? Probably. Could there be a little bit of extra payment or extra incentive that's not documented that Epic's making to score this kind of land? Probably. Uh, but that's not out there.
4269000	4285000	So anyway, um, game industry also elaborated on their report that Ubisoft will be working with Epic on additional select titles throughout 2019. So come on, just dance 2019 exclusive to Epic store. Okay. But all that stuff aside, obviously they have a PC version of that.
4285000	4295000	That would surprise me considering they support literally every other platform that they wouldn't have a PC version of just dance that has to chatter. Is there, is just a stance exist on PC? I don't know.
4295000	4307000	Anyway, uh, something that a lot of people pointed out right off the bat is that you're still going to have that you play thing no matter what. And a lot of people don't really care. I don't care anymore. Honestly, it feels a little bloaty to me.
4307000	4321000	That's what I don't like about it. It just feels like it's collecting, but I do like the fact that you can earn a chance in one game and like buy things in another game. Like I'll give you play that, but that little shell is still going to exist. Either way you slice it. Yeah. Yeah.
4321000	4333000	So, uh, what do you think though about this announcement? I mean, this is good. It's good for competition. I'm glad to see that there's competition for steam because steam needs kind of a kick in the pants just to fix it. Shit.
4334000	4351000	So more power to competition. Yeah. Uh, Tiger call on chat says you play, used to give you free games back in the day. Um, and maybe, maybe they will on PC. Who knows? But it's just, it kind of just also, it's like another thing I've got to put on my PC, but you play was always kind of like embedded in the game.
4351000	4361000	Yeah. Like this extra thing. I mean, maybe the extra thing does exist, but I just don't notice it maybe because I play more on console, the Ubisoft stuff. I don't know, but I do know the division to a lot of people looking forward to that. Right.
4361000	4377000	Because it's kind of like, it's like the division, obviously the sequel of the division, but the division is like kind of like an MMO type of gun game. Yeah. Right. That has a lot of like, it's kind of like their version of destiny sorta, but like with the Tom Clancy spin, I guess sorta is one way to put it.
4378000	4391000	I know it's very multiplayer heavy and you know, very much co-op squad type of thing. It looks interesting. I kind of wish I was more into those type of games. I'd probably give it a go, but not at $60, but maybe when the sequel comes out, they'll kind of like give the first one away.
4391000	4402000	And I'd be interested in like checking that out. Maybe talking about you playing free games and all that. Any of you guys in chat, really looking forward to the division too. I'm curious about you guys since Loki and I are kind of sitting here admitting.
4403000	4414000	I mean, we know it's a big game. We know a lot of people are looking forward to it. It's not exactly the type of thing that Loki and I are going to jump out and get day one. So I'm curious about you guys. Is there anybody that's going to be getting the division right off the bat?
4414000	4422000	What do you think of this news? Uh, the fact that it's going to the Epic store, do you think it's a big deal or what? So yeah, it's a big deal. Just not my game.
4422000	4435000	While I wait for the delay and the answers to come in, I will say as far as the Epic store goes, you know, they're still giving away those free games every two weeks. So I just picked up and I really, if you guys do have the Epic store on your computer, which if you have Fortnite on your PC, then you probably do.
4435000	4449000	What Remains of Edith Finch is the game they're giving away right now. And I, that was one of my favorite games when it came out on the PlayStation four. It's a, you know, one of those more exploration based narratives, not a lot of skill needed.
4449000	4465000	Um, but, um, I, I really enjoyed that game and I highly recommend it. And the fact that they're giving it away for free, uh, you don't have an excuse unless you don't have a PC that'll run it. You really don't want another store on your PC. I'm sure you can think of excuses, but there, there's very few of them.
4466000	4481000	Exploration games. So I finally got my son to play, um, the Stanley parable. Oh yeah. So he's been playing through that. Um, but he's like, I finished it. I'm like, no, you haven't. You haven't finished it yet. You had to play through it multiple times.
4481000	4509000	Um, some comments on, uh, the division at deaf says, I remember the demonstration they gave at E3 with the gamer talk. Yeah, the relief. Oh God, can we stop with the gamer talk? But that isn't, that shouldn't be a reflection on the actual game. Uh, questmaster says, uh, the division is the third person shooter in post apocalyptic, uh, plague, uh, NYC. I love it. They really turned it around. Can't wait for the division to, although, uh, SG 100 map points out division two takes place in DC, not NYC.
4509000	4523000	So, um, and the SG 100 mass suggests in game DC looks like if this shutdown drags on much longer, little government shutdown joke there in the chat room over it, Twitch TV slash vog network. We're making history. Yeah, we sure.
4524000	4549000	The wrong kind of history, but we're making it anyway. Why don't we move on to, uh, another company making history that isn't the greatest kind, right? Yes. So formula one, um, apparently is cracking down on people playing sim racing games. So, uh, there's been, I don't know if anybody's paid any attention to YouTube drama and I won't even say necessarily drama.
4549000	4565000	It's just like YouTube bullshit, uh, where people get copyright claims for dumb shit. Like for example, there was one I saw this week that a guy was testing his microphone and was going like test one, two test one, two, like just checking levels and stuff.
4566000	4583000	Why would you do a YouTube video of that? Well, he was just checking to see how it came through or whatever. It was a live stream and it, Oh, okay. It was like a live stream. So he was testing Bs Twitch and it went and it went, it was a private video and then it got copyright claimed by a music company saying that this was a song that he saw.
4584000	4609000	He's like, what the fuck? You know, like this, none of this made sense, but like it's this type of stuff that happens and people will blame the algorithm and stuff. So for example, in this case, uh, they're playing sim racing games and it's, some of them happen to be like Gran Turismo sport for example, and it's not necessarily they're playing with formula one cars, but they're on some tracks that, you know, formula formula one racing races on.
4609000	4627000	And so they said that some of the videos, I guess resemble formula and footage, and they're being removed, um, by YouTube or, you know, being copyright claimed by formula one management for a clip, you know, of someone live streaming sim gameplay, which is stupid because.
4627000	4641000	It's not, it's not, it's not their footage has no right to that footage, but it's a, if I'm not mistaken from what I'm reading about this, it sounds like it's like one of those bots, right? The bots that scan things out of control.
4641000	4654000	And here's the, here's the mess up part about YouTube to kind of remind people. So the way the copyright claim system works is so like, say, um, someone claims one of my videos and I say, well, no, I, you, your claim is wrong.
4654000	4664000	You know, this is actually fair use, whatever. It's up to them. The people that claimed your video to decide, I think I'm right. And then they'll say, no, no, you're wrong.
4664000	4678000	And you get copyright strike. And then your only chance to fight the copyright strike is to take them to court. And so it's basically, you know, anybody can, you know, go on to someone's video and say, oh yeah, I'm going to claim this.
4678000	4690000	And then they say no. And then, um, you know, they counter claim or whatever, and then they can wait the 30 days and just like release it at that point. But they've already taken the revenue from you for those 30 days.
4690000	4702000	And it's basically like free money because there's enough YouTube isn't stopping them. So I was like, I would delete my YouTube channel and go somewhere else. But I realized that's easier said than done. Some of these people have been making a little money off of YouTube.
4702000	4719000	I think the art of being a professional YouTuber, much like a professional Twitch streamer, mind you, it's a volatile ground and not that. And this is my personal opinion. Okay. This is why I always stick with it as a hobbyist, because it could be gone one day here, one day gone tomorrow. You know what I mean? And it's shit like this that kind of proves that.
4719000	4730000	Or there's another YouTuber James Key, who I watch, and he does a lot of game streams and stuff. He does like weird like TikTok videos and stuff. And he was making fun of a video he saw on TikTok.
4730000	4745000	And apparently, the girl on there, or well, it was her management company saw this video. And so what did they do? They did a copyright claims on like a ton of copyright claims all at one time.
4746000	4758000	And it's not necessarily that they're trying to say that this content, like the whole video is theirs. They're just doing it to get back at this person. And because they know that four or five copyright claims are at three, and you're out.
4758000	4774000	So three in your channel is deleted from YouTube. And so they just do that all at once. They'll say, Oh, yeah. And there was actually a game company. Several developers have tried this too, where someone will say something bad about their game, and they'll go and copyright claim all of their videos.
4774000	4787000	The robot shit should not be legal. I don't know. I don't know another way to put it. Like, you might think I'm just being like, well, it's not a robot. So it's manual claims to the people go and do that. But another thing, but it's manual claims.
4787000	4796000	Where's the three strikes against the people? There is nothing. And they can't. That's a fucking YouTube problem. Why are people not going to these YouTube conventions and screaming the door?
4796000	4813000	They can't because it's DMCA because YouTube has to be separate from this issue in order for them to be kind of like a safe harbor type thing. They can't put their, you know, horse in the race because if they put any sort of like, no, this is not legit.
4813000	4825000	You know, the person looks at, then they're like starting to evaluate. Well, this country needs to re-examine copyright, trademark, IP reform, but we can't even run a fucking government right now. So I'm not going to hold my fucking breath. Yeah.
4825000	4840000	This is just ridiculous and sad. This all kind of goes with the Tumblr bots too, right? That's been a big controversial thing, right? The bots on Tumblr that scan for pornography and like it gets some of it, but I don't get all of it. And it gets a lot of false stuff too.
4841000	4859000	We still have algorithms, right? The algorithms aren't good enough to do their job correctly and that, and to bring it all back to the algorithm. So in a Formula One F1 spokesperson, they said that there was a temporary issue with some settings with inadvertently served claims against some user's content.
4860000	4867000	Well, all righty then, huh? And it was immediately noticed and quickly rectified. I don't think so, but sure, whatever.
4867000	4882000	All right. Well, I need to de-stress after all this news. So maybe one game I could play to de-stress would be a brand new title that's coming out to the Switch in spring of 2019. It's called Panty Party.
4883000	4902000	All right. Are you ready? Are y'all ready for a Panty Party? And you know, of course I have B-roll of this. So check this out. Panty Party coming out for the Switch. You literally play as a pair of panties and the developers go out of their way. This is not a hentai game. This is not a sexy girls wearing panties game.
4902000	4914000	This is, this is, you are panties with your frilly flowery panties, striped panties going around, waving swords, firing, but why? I don't know.
4914000	4915000	Cause that's awesome.
4915000	4931000	It's a Panty Fighter basically. So Panty Party coming out for the Nintendo Switch in spring of 2019. And yeah, that's really all I can say about that. Yeah. Are you going to play Panty Party?
4931000	4932000	Oh yeah. Day one.
4936000	4953000	I love this. From the, from the press release or what have you. Feel emotions of foolishness and excitement with Panty Party. Energetic dancing music. It is the melody of panties. Every color imaginable. It is the color of panties.
4954000	4965000	This is a product that people will probably buy and yet they won't make president cat. They won't bring mother three to America.
4965000	4978000	Japan is getting an extra game on the Switch online service this week that we're not getting, but yet Panty Party. No hentai. Just, just the panties.
4978000	4989000	You know, we could just make the US equivalent of it and just have like, you know, tighty whitey party or something like that. Boxers versus briefs.
4989000	5001000	Finally, we're going to put an end to this once and for all. Boxers versus briefs. That'll be the, the sequel. I don't know. Anyway, uh, let's see. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says stream that on your personal channel, not the vog channel.
5002000	5016000	What's the problem? It's just cotton. It's just, it's nothing. There's no panties. There's no nudity. There's sentient underwear. Wait, wait, wait. Did Bobby say I'm not allowed to play something on the vlog channel? Is that something I heard?
5019000	5030000	All right. I better, I better stop before he pulls the plug on it. It's new. Hey, it's news. We have to report it. It's a, it's happening in the industry. Gotta talk about it. I'm sorry to say.
5031000	5053000	Uh, Metal Mayhem suggests more like Call of Panty, modern panties. Uh, sure. Pod Culture suggests the spinoff Panty Racers. All right, enough. Done. Cancel this segment. Move on. Let's move on to the, uh, ooh, I didn't even advance it. I got so excited about the Panty party. I forgot to advance the thing, but let's move on to the classic game of the week.
5053000	5061000	It's funny that somebody brought up racing games because I think we need to get to the classic game of the week and maybe hear about another one.
5063000	5078000	And so we took a step into the gaming vault and we dig up our old photo and put it next to our new photo while we visit the classic game of the week. And joining us here in studio, not on Skype tonight, say hello to Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.
5078000	5079000	Why hello there.
5079000	5081000	Hello. We've missed you.
5081000	5082000	What'd you throw?
5082000	5086000	Uh, well, my aim's improving. I'm throwing classic NES carts, actually.
5086000	5087000	Oh, ow.
5087000	5090000	But don't worry. They're just copies of Clu Clu Land. Nobody will miss them.
5090000	5092000	Freaking Clu Clu Land.
5092000	5094000	Anyway, you actually haven't done that as a classic game of the week, huh?
5094000	5095000	Um, I have.
5095000	5103000	Maybe. I don't know. I, there, there's a large, you know, you've done over 500 classic games. Well, maybe not you yourself because you have a lot of help sometimes, but, uh.
5103000	5104000	I've done most of them.
5104000	5106000	You've done most of them. You really have. So, uh.
5106000	5108000	Hold on. I'm actually seeing if I've done Clu Clu Land.
5108000	5110000	All right. Well, uh, in order.
5110000	5111000	I have not.
5111000	5112000	Okay. Well, maybe.
5112000	5113000	The fuck?
5113000	5122000	Maybe a future, uh, game in the making. But anyway, uh, I know it's not what you picked tonight, but you went into the gaming vault and found a game that was at least 10 years old.
5122000	5124000	I think tonight's a little bit older. More like 20.
5124000	5125000	More like 20.
5125000	5129000	And, uh, you found a game for people to check out. What is the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?
5129000	5131000	Crash Team Racing.
5131000	5135000	Everybody's Crash Team Racing. I don't know. I got nothing.
5135000	5138000	By the way, of course, we all know that Awesome Games Done Quick is going on.
5138000	5141000	Well, not by the time this airs. They're wrapping up, uh.
5141000	5143000	Super Metroid is the finale.
5143000	5145000	Of course. Good. I'm glad to see it back.
5145000	5149000	Um, but, um, I had to watch, uh, Sanic Ball.
5149000	5151000	Oh, yeah. Bobby was telling me about that.
5151000	5152000	That was pretty funny.
5152000	5153000	Good times.
5153000	5159000	Okay. Anyway, um, Crash Team Racing, also shown as CTR colon Crash Team Racing.
5159000	5164000	Because acronyms are cool. You're listening to OLR talking about CTR.
5164000	5166000	We need CPR when this is done.
5166000	5169000	With a CG OTW.
5169000	5172000	It's a kart racing game. It was produced by Naughty Dog.
5172000	5176000	And it was published, uh, by Sony for the Playstation.
5176000	5181000	It is actually considered the fourth of the Crash Bandicoot games.
5181000	5190000	And it focuses on a team of racing characters who have to race against Nitrous Oxide to save their planet.
5191000	5195000	So you can be one of fifteen different Crash Bandicoot characters.
5195000	5199000	Though only eight are available at first. So you do have to do some unlocking.
5199000	5205000	Um, you also have different offensive and speed boosts that will give you an advantage.
5205000	5212000	And, uh, the game was pretty much, you know, looked at with approval for its gameplay and graphics.
5212000	5215000	Although it had some kind of questionable audio.
5215000	5219000	Um, and then there was an indirect sequel called Crash Nitro Kart in 2003.
5219000	5223000	The Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Playstation 2, Xbox, and N-Gage.
5223000	5225000	Thinking here about the taco on this one.
5225000	5226000	Wow.
5226000	5232000	And then there was a remaster titled, uh, Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled.
5232000	5234000	Which was announced at the Game Awards 2018.
5234000	5240000	And will be released on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on June 1st, 2019.
5240000	5242000	So a lot of people have been thinking about this lately.
5242000	5245000	That trailer for the new one did look really sweet.
5245000	5250000	So at any rate, um, you can, you know, you're driving along.
5250000	5252000	You use the analog stick and buttons to go.
5252000	5255000	And you also have different crates that are through the whole area.
5255000	5257000	With the question mark they have power-ups and weapons.
5257000	5262000	Um, if you have a weapon or power-up it will show in a box on the top of the screen.
5262000	5264000	And then you can activate them.
5264000	5268000	Then you get fruit crates with Wumpa Fruit that gives you more speed.
5268000	5270000	And strengthen your weapons and power-ups.
5270000	5273000	So not to say it's a copy of Mario Kart, but.
5273000	5274000	It's a copy of Mario Kart.
5274000	5278000	Imagine Mario Kart with Crash and friends.
5278000	5280000	You also have the power slide.
5280000	5281000	Ooh.
5281000	5283000	Ooh, is that like the cha-cha slide?
5283000	5285000	I don't know.
5285000	5289000	So when you slide you also have a turbo boost meter that will let you fill it up.
5289000	5292000	And then you also will burn up your gas.
5292000	5293000	So it's different stuff.
5293000	5296000	I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the Kart Racer series.
5296000	5298000	But I did want to bring this up.
5298000	5301000	Because what do we have coming out?
5301000	5302000	Like I just said.
5302000	5303000	The remaster.
5303000	5304000	Sure.
5304000	5305000	So you have different modes in the game.
5305000	5306000	There's five different modes.
5306000	5307000	You get adventure.
5307000	5308000	Time trial.
5308000	5310000	Can I say too, before you detail all the modes.
5310000	5314000	I think this one too, like even if you're not super into the Kart Racers.
5314000	5317000	I think, and you know we joke, it's a Mario Kart clone.
5317000	5320000	There's been a lot of Mario Kart clones over the years, right?
5320000	5321000	We had a pretty good Final Fantasy one.
5321000	5323000	That really was my favorite of the clones.
5323000	5325000	The Final Fantasy Chocobo racing.
5325000	5327000	But there's been like Hello Kitty clones.
5327000	5328000	There's been Sonic.
5328000	5333000	There's been, you know, like everybody has kind of tried their own.
5333000	5335000	Everybody's Super Sonic racing.
5335000	5337000	Well, I mean the Mario Kart series is huge, right?
5337000	5339000	And you know, some of them have brought some new things.
5339000	5341000	But anyway, Crash is really one of the better ones.
5341000	5346000	Especially, you know, in an area where you didn't really have a lot of crossover, right?
5346000	5349000	PlayStation games were PlayStation.
5349000	5351000	Nintendo games were Nintendo.
5351000	5353000	Super Nintendo were Nintendo 64 around this era.
5353000	5355000	You know, Dreamcast games were Dreamcast.
5355000	5358000	You maybe had the rare third-party game that kind of crossed over.
5358000	5361000	But for the most part, things really kind of stayed on this as they were on.
5361000	5367000	So like if your house didn't have Nintendo 64, like my college dorm room,
5367000	5369000	but you had a PlayStation and a Super Nintendo,
5369000	5375000	you kind of got Crash Team Racing because you didn't have something to play Mario Kart 64 on.
5375000	5376000	You know what I mean?
5376000	5378000	There's another power-up I forgot.
5378000	5382000	But when you get air time, you actually build up a speed boost until you land.
5382000	5385000	And then the longer you're in the air, the bigger the speed boost you get.
5385000	5386000	Nice.
5386000	5391000	So anyway, your modes, you have Adventure, Time Trial, Arcade, Versus, and Battle.
5391000	5393000	So you pick any of the characters.
5393000	5399000	And sorry, I just got texted telling me that the Mario Odyssey run was wild.
5399000	5400000	Oh, fun.
5400000	5402000	Thanks, Dan.
5402000	5403000	That means they're almost done.
5403000	5404000	I think Super Metroid is all that's left.
5404000	5405000	Super Metroid, yeah.
5405000	5409000	Well, that and the blood-stained incentive.
5409000	5410000	Oh, right. Okay.
5410000	5411000	Yeah.
5411000	5416000	So anyway, you can use the multi-tap for PlayStation to do a three- or four-player game.
5416000	5421000	So Adventure mode is one player where you have to race through all the tracks for trophies and stuff
5421000	5423000	and get all the things.
5423000	5426000	And that's, you know, your story mode.
5426000	5433000	So you also, of course, the other levels, you know, Time Trial, Arcade, Versus, and Battle,
5433000	5438000	they sound, you know, they basically explain themselves.
5438000	5441000	As far as, let's see.
5441000	5454000	So with the characters in this, you get Crash, you have Dr. Neo Cortex, you get Coco Bandicoot,
5454000	5464000	you get Dr. N. Gin, you get Pura and Polar, you get Tiny Tiger, and Dingodile.
5464000	5467000	So you get Crash, the main villain, and B-Listers.
5467000	5470000	Yeah, and his stupid friends.
5470000	5471000	Yes.
5471000	5474000	And then you also get some other boss characters.
5474000	5477000	You get Ripper Roo, which is a street jack wearing kangaroo.
5477000	5479000	Didn't they steal that from Tank Girl?
5479000	5480000	Maybe.
5480000	5488000	Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, and Pinstripe Potoroo.
5488000	5491000	I have no idea what a potoroo is, now I have to look at this.
5491000	5495000	It's a kangaroo-like marsupial, because of course, if it's anything from Australia,
5495000	5498000	it's either a marsupial or deadly.
5498000	5505000	You also get the witch doctors Aku Aku and Uka Uka as your tutorial.
5505000	5512000	But you do not get the Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Appu Waha, the official state fish of Hawaii.
5512000	5513000	Right.
5513000	5515000	Yes.
5515000	5519000	Anyway, the game started development as a bunch of just block-headed characters,
5519000	5521000	no Crash, nothing else with it.
5521000	5527000	Naughty Dog was showing it to Sony, and they had interest in the game to make it Crash-themed,
5527000	5529000	and Sony's like, okay, cool.
5529000	5537000	So they made a deal with Universal, and they already had a plan for original characters in case it can go through.
5537000	5541000	But production began after Crash Bandicoot 2,
5541000	5548000	and it was made actually right about the same time that Crash Bandicoot Warped was being produced,
5548000	5550000	so it was finished by then.
5550000	5560000	And so it basically, like, now this was funny because I actually watched a beta build of this.
5560000	5566000	They used a replica of Crescent Island from Diddy Kong Racing to test the tracks.
5566000	5571000	And some of its data is still in the game.
5571000	5579000	So they wanted to basically just use that to see how it would render and see how much better it would go.
5579000	5583000	So they actually were able to get a lot of the game to run.
5583000	5587000	And it's really, believe it or not, fairly low-res.
5587000	5591000	Just they did some kind of marvel to make it work right.
5591000	5596000	So it did get some pretty good reviews, generally favorable.
5596000	5600000	Famitsu gave it a 33 out of 40.
5600000	5603000	EGM gave it a 9.3 out of 10.
5603000	5606000	GameSpot gave it an 8.4 out of 10.
5606000	5608000	Quite respectable showing.
5608000	5611000	The controls were really what was most praised about it.
5611000	5616000	And the graphics, they really thought that the graphics were great, that they weren't too complex.
5616000	5626000	But with the cartoony style and the use of how they used the textures and colors to keep the polys down,
5626000	5629000	then they thought it was a really good use of it.
5629000	5635000	And some people really liked the background music, and some people said it was annoying as shit.
5635000	5640000	Or actually really boring in some cases. Nothing cute, clever, or memorable.
5640000	5645000	So yeah, we have the remaster coming out, which is Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled.
5645000	5648000	So it's going to be out on June 21st, 2019.
5648000	5651000	And we'll see what it looks like.
5651000	5655000	But the thing about the new one is it's being recreated from the ground up.
5655000	5663000	Completely new assets, online play, cart customization, including all the carts from Crash Nitro Cart.
5664000	5671000	And they are actually adding in yet another boss as an unlockable character.
5671000	5672000	Fun.
5672000	5673000	So there you go.
5673000	5676000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Crash Team Racing.
5676000	5677000	Woo hoo.
5677000	5680000	CTR on OLR.
5680000	5683000	On the CG OTW.
5683000	5688000	Anyway, we gotta get back to the main show, but one thing we're going to be talking about tonight, Dark Sakura, I know,
5688000	5691000	because I can see the future, is the predictions.
5691000	5693000	Remember we did the time capsule last year?
5693000	5694000	So we're going to go through that tonight.
5694000	5697000	And I'm curious, you know, I don't want to put you too much on the spot.
5697000	5703000	Maybe we'll get some more official predictions for you next week when I know you're here live during the show on January 20th.
5703000	5709000	But do you have any maybe like early predictions for maybe things you want to see in game?
5709000	5713000	Maybe not so much an actual prediction, but just something you want to happen in 2019.
5713000	5715000	So much Animal Crossing.
5715000	5717000	You're eagerly awaiting the Animal Crossing, huh?
5717000	5720000	Yes. I actually have preordered.
5720000	5721000	Already?
5721000	5725000	Yeah, I preordered when I bought.
5725000	5730000	But Jamie, was it really a preorder or was it an order?
5730000	5732000	It was an order.
5732000	5734000	You knew I had to.
5734000	5737000	I know it's colloquialism, but it's a stupid one.
5737000	5738000	Yes. All right.
5738000	5740000	Dan's like, are you preheating the oven?
5740000	5743000	No, I'm heating it.
5743000	5745000	For all the delicious cookies.
5745000	5749000	I'm heating it now in preparation. I'm prep-heating the oven.
5749000	5750000	Anyway.
5750000	5751000	Yeah.
5751000	5753000	All right. That's it. Let's get back to the live show.
5753000	5756000	Because you can't. It's like, how do you heat something before you heat it?
5756000	5760000	I don't know. Anyway.
5760000	5762000	Any last words for us, Dark Sakura?
5762000	5765000	Bronchitis sucks. Don't get it.
5765000	5774000	All right. And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 759 for this January the 13th of 2019.
5774000	5778000	With our show already in progress. Thank you guys so much for being here.
5778000	5783000	I noticed looking at the number of people watching on Twitch right now, we have over 50 people watching so much for checking out the show.
5783000	5787000	I really appreciate it. I see we've had some subscribers and stuff so far.
5787000	5789000	Thank you guys so much. Really appreciate it.
5789000	5797000	For those who don't know, we've been doing our podcast on shoutcast for over 15 years in various forms, like through five and so forth.
5797000	5801000	Our first show you might have seen on the bottom bar go by was in June 2002.
5801000	5806000	So we've been doing this for a while and we just did the Twitch move in mid-December and it's been great.
5806000	5808000	It's been 16 and a half years now.
5808000	5816000	Yeah, I know. It's been a long time. So the video thing is still a little weird and I've got a lot to learn and still managing more things than I was doing with audio.
5816000	5821000	But having a lot of fun and getting to expose the show to new people on Twitch is always great.
5821000	5826000	And we really enjoy having you guys here to be able to participate with the show, getting to read what you guys have to say live in chat.
5826000	5828000	Hopefully getting some of your calls later on in the show as well.
5829000	5836000	And yeah, it's been a real feel-good time, except for last week when the power went out. That was a feel-bad time.
5836000	5841000	But crap happens. We managed about an hour show out of that anyway.
5841000	5847000	Yeah, and it was a nightmare coming home from that because people don't know how to drive when there's a power outage.
5847000	5854000	And you're supposed to stop at intersections, treat it like a four-way stop. People treat it like there's no stop, just keep on going.
5854000	5857000	And yeah, it was a nightmare.
5857000	5864000	Alright, so I totally forgot to do this during the break, but I think you did it. So you're going to have to start us off while I try to hastily write here.
5864000	5867000	But we're talking about now for the time capsule that we did earlier in the show.
5867000	5873000	We wanted to put in there the things, the most anticipated games for 2019, right?
5873000	5877000	So we can open it up in a year and be all, how did these games turn out?
5877000	5880000	Kind of like we had the Secret of Mana remaster in there from last year.
5880000	5883000	And it was kind of like, oh yeah, that kind of came and went, didn't it?
5883000	5889000	So let's take a look at the big stuff for next year. So, Loki, what are you going to put in there to reflect on in a year's time?
5889000	5896000	I'd be curious for you guys in chat as well, what are the things you're massively hyped about in 2019 over at twitch.tv slash vog network?
5896000	5902000	So I put down Crackdown 3 because I am somewhat hyped about that. I love me some Crackdown games.
5902000	5910000	I put Animal Crossing Switch because, I mean, I'll like that. My wife will probably be more hyped about that than I will, I guess.
5910000	5917000	I'm holding out for Borderlands 3, but in the case that that doesn't come out, well actually I don't know when this is coming out either,
5917000	5925000	but The Outer Worlds, because that looks awesome, that would be a good Borderlands type game and it's kind of Fallout-ish and I would be down.
5925000	5932000	I don't know if that's coming out in 2019, that might be a 2020 game, but it looked fucking awesome when we saw it, so I'm hoping to check that out.
5932000	5936000	I may actually check out Rage 2 a little bit. It looked okay.
5936000	5946000	And then also the new Fallout game, or not Fallout, Far Cry game that's coming out in February, the kind of post-apocalyptic thing,
5946000	5952000	which reminds me, I think go back and play Fallout, or it keeps saying Fallout, Far Cry 5.
5952000	5959000	I was actually going to start Fallout 4 again because that was one of the games I was looking at last night to play.
5960000	5965000	It's been a while. I don't remember what happened when I last played it.
5965000	5970000	All I know is they patched out all my fun exploits and so that, you know, I gotta have mods now.
5970000	5977000	There wasn't mods when I, they tell you how long ago it was that I played Fallout 4.
5977000	5982000	It was before they had mod support in Fallout 4. It's been that long.
5983000	5988000	W04 in our chat says, broccoli farmer simulator. Those jokes are good.
5988000	5991000	I wanna, we should write down, is the broccoli thing still a joke?
5992000	5994000	Can you put that on a visa? Is the broccoli thing still a joke?
5994000	5997000	I threw in a haberist, so I guess we can't.
5997000	6002000	Alright, okay, so I notice I agree with the wandering apparatus on one of these, so my anticipated games,
6002000	6008000	I hadn't even put Kingdom Hearts 3. I told, I feel like, I'm still convinced somehow that game's not coming out, ever.
6008000	6011000	Yes, I know it's only two weeks away, but like, I'm-
6011000	6013000	I don't even know what happens in the Kingdom Hearts games, I'm so lost.
6013000	6014000	It just doesn't matter.
6014000	6016000	It does matter, it's a story.
6016000	6022000	It's Disney and Donald Won't Heal You. Alright, anticipated games, number one, Animal Crossing, of course, come on.
6022000	6027000	Number two, Metroid Prime 4, so I'm with a lot of you guys on that one, I'm really excited about that.
6027000	6033000	Number three, Harry Potter Wizards Unite, because you know I'm a sucker for the location-based games,
6033000	6040000	so I am really curious to see how the Harry Potter game goes over and I really hope it's not garbage.
6040000	6045000	I'd be so sad. And then I added a fourth game deal with it, because I had to put Pokemon Gen 8 on it,
6045000	6049000	because somebody else said Pokemon Gen 8 in chat, and I was like, oh, fuck yeah, I have to put that on there.
6049000	6053000	So there you go. Those are my anticipated games for 20 months.
6053000	6056000	Honestly, my most anticipated games are gonna be the ones we don't even know about yet,
6056000	6062000	because that's kind of what it ends up being, is that there's like, there's so many games that are coming out,
6062000	6067000	like, I don't even know, like, think about this year, aside from, like, Animal Crossing, which will be fun for a while,
6067000	6071000	but it's fucking Animal Crossing, it's gonna be the same goddamn game again,
6071000	6074000	and you're gonna play it for a while and you're gonna get bored with it. Whatever.
6074000	6079000	Um, great comments in chat, Miltonious Games, uh, Miltonous Games, sorry if I said your name wrong,
6079000	6084000	Dragon Quest XI for Switch, because that's gonna be a thing in Japan, I don't know if we'll get it here, but hopefully.
6084000	6090000	Um, let's see, uh, Act Def says Goose Game, that's right, wasn't that called, like, Asshole Duck or something?
6090000	6092000	No, it was Untitled Goose Game.
6092000	6095000	Okay, but it's awesome, everybody was calling it, like, Asshole Goose or something like that,
6095000	6096000	which obviously they're not gonna call it.
6096000	6101000	No, that one looks awesome, there was, um, there's a Raccoon Game, too, that's like that, that looks awesome,
6101000	6106000	I wanted to check that out, um, all these devs I follow on Twitter, um,
6106000	6110000	there's some skateboarding game that they have coming out that looks pretty awesome, too,
6110000	6113000	that looks like Skate, but it's not Skate, I don't remember what it's called now.
6113000	6118000	So, anyway, you guys in chat have some great answers, and I really encourage you, like, you have to have some little thing like this,
6118000	6122000	I don't even know where the hell, this is like a bank or something, it's, I don't think it comes through on the camera very well,
6122000	6127000	this little picture of Darth Vader, appropriate, I suppose, uh, and, uh, find something in your house like that,
6127000	6132000	and fill it up with your own predictions, and so when we come back and do this again in a year's time,
6132000	6136000	you can see how your predictions went, I think it's, I think it's fun, I think it's fun.
6136000	6142000	Uh, Wandering Apparatus in chat says, uh, I'm gonna Hufflepuff the Muggle out of that AR game when it comes out, who's with me?
6142000	6147000	I'm there, except I'll be, uh, Snake Emoji Slytherin, so, assuming we get to pick a house, we'll see.
6147000	6154000	My kids are totally into Harry Potter right now, I mean, uh, I bought my youngest son a Harry Potter t-shirt,
6154000	6160000	and they both got Harry Potter wands for Christmas, and so they're just like, they're digging Harry Potter,
6160000	6165000	they're gonna be disappointed we're not going to Harry Potterland this year, but, maybe next year, they'll deal.
6165000	6170000	Maybe next year you can go to, uh, you know, where they make, uh, I don't know, the Frozen Peas Factory.
6170000	6172000	Frozen Peas Factory.
6172000	6173000	Alright.
6173000	6176000	You can't do that twice, they're gonna, they know better.
6176000	6184000	They already suspect that they're not going to a broccoli farm, because they're like, well, what are we gonna do, you know, at a broccoli farm and stuff.
6184000	6195000	So, like, they're like, that's, they're all, we know, they're all, we're not going to a broccoli farm, like, Mike, well, you don't know where you're going, so, just wait and see.
6195000	6200000	Alright, alright, let's move on, we gotta, uh, check out some rapid fire news, so we got some quick stories to cover, right, Logie?
6200000	6209000	Yep. Final Fantasy X and X-2 will be coming to the Switch and Xbox One on April 16th.
6209000	6218000	And then, of course, they're gonna be doing the Final Fantasy XII remaster will be coming out on both of those platforms on April 30th, so it's gonna be Final Fantasy April.
6218000	6222000	Yeah, it's kind of interesting, there's not a lot of breathing room between those two titles.
6222000	6226000	I would have thought they'd try to spread it out a little bit, but, eh, whatever, alright.
6226000	6235000	And then, um, you may remember those arcade one-up cabinets that you can go buy at your local Walmart or wherever.
6235000	6245000	Well, there's gonna be more cabinets coming out soon, so they've got Final Fight, which is gonna have Final Fight, 1944, Ghosts and Goblins, and Strider, that's coming out in February.
6245000	6246000	That's a good, that's a good pack.
6246000	6254000	Uh, the Space Invaders cabinet, which is gonna be Space Invaders in both color and black and white, that's in February as well.
6254000	6261000	If you're, you know, I remember this game in arcades, but, Golden Tea, that's gonna be coming out as well.
6261000	6265000	Golden Tea Classic, Golden Tea 2K, and Golden Tea 99 and 98.
6265000	6271000	It might seem like a weird pick, but that's that game that's like that random game they have in a bar.
6271000	6276000	Or at the Walmart arcade, you remember how like Walmart's got Deer Hunter and Golden Tea.
6276000	6277000	So, like, it's, it's...
6277000	6279000	Where's Big Buck Hunter?
6280000	6285000	Wait for 2020. It's an interesting choice, but it's not like completely out of random.
6285000	6286000	Oh my god.
6286000	6294000	In fact, I could see where maybe they're trying to sell these to go in, well, legally, I wonder if they could, but maybe something to go in bars and places like, I don't know.
6294000	6295000	You know what I want?
6295000	6297000	Well, I'm gonna get to what I want after we're done here, but.
6297000	6298000	Okay.
6298000	6305000	So they have the Mortal Kombat cabinet, which is coming out on, in September, that's Mortal Kombat 2, or 1, 2, and 3.
6305000	6311000	And then the karate champ cabinet, that's Karate Champ, Bad Dudes, Burger Time, and Caveman Ninja.
6311000	6314000	And that's in September, as well.
6314000	6316000	Those are each at $300.
6316000	6322000	Bobby kind of echoes in chat that, remember the Golden Tea was, for many years, the highest grossing arcade game in America, for years.
6322000	6326000	Yeah, because it's the one game that would show up the places that arcade games don't show up.
6326000	6337000	So I know that right now, the reason that they don't have these light gun games and stuff, because they don't really have a way to do light gun stuff on LCD or LED screens and stuff like that.
6337000	6342000	Well, until now, I mean, they're gonna be working on something, but.
6342000	6344000	Oh yeah, I thought we had a story on that.
6345000	6348000	Up until now, it's been not possible.
6348000	6355000	But, I would totally love for a Namco gun collection.
6355000	6356000	Point blank.
6356000	6357000	Yes.
6357000	6358000	Point blank and time crisis?
6358000	6359000	Yes.
6359000	6360000	Yes, please.
6360000	6361000	Oh my god.
6361000	6367000	Point blank is like one of those series, like, it's up there with the guardian legend for series I most want to make a big return.
6367000	6374000	I would even be fine with, you know, they did it before, like with the move controller, or even like the switch controller or something like that.
6374000	6381000	I would be fine with just another point blank remaster collection or something like that. Bring it back. Point blank was awesome.
6381000	6389000	Let's see, in chat, Tiger Claw suggests that arcade 1UP will need to lower the price on the cabinets, because I still see a bunch of them at Walmart.
6389000	6402000	You know what's interesting? This whole retro thing, like, you know, I mentioned I was at Fry's over the weekend, and I saw, you know, the stacks of PlayStation classics, but I didn't realize how much of those, because they have like, like an entire aisle.
6402000	6407000	Like you got one aisle for like PlayStation games, one aisle for Xbox games, they have like an entire aisle for like retro consoles.
6407000	6415000	Because everybody's trying to get in on this now, for like, you know, the entire flashbacks and like, just random like the, there's like a Pac-Man, Namco thing, a Mega Man 2.
6415000	6429000	They also do these like, loot box things. It's kind of like, you know how you have, you know, the, well, the actual loot box service, where you get like a box full of like, tchotchkes and t-shirts and stuff like that for certain things.
6429000	6445000	They sell those in these retail stores for like different things, like the PlayStation or the Nintendo or Zelda loot box things, where it has like a bunch of, you know, socks or pins, who knows what.
6445000	6451000	But I'm sure as the technology, you know, to like build those machines comes down and down, they figure out how to build them cheaper.
6451000	6460000	I bet the price will start to come down as well. And mentioning in chat, already starting to see them for like $249, which you know, I think it depends, you know, it's all about supply and demand.
6460000	6466000	And I think people are really seeing like, oh, these people are willing to pay for these emulators, they've been playing for free for years.
6466000	6482000	If I had the space, I mean, those, I'm wondering what kind of mods you can do on those things, because it would be cool just to hook up like, because I, I can't see buying, you know, granted, yeah, you're supporting somebody that maybe, maybe somehow the money's trickling down to my data.
6482000	6497000	But like, it'd be interesting to see like, being able to add more games to an existing cabinet, like I wish they would do just like a service like that where you buy the shell cabinet, and then you pay for the licensing for the different games and just download them virtual console style.
6497000	6499000	I mean, that would be amazing.
6499000	6511000	Yeah. Anyway, I'm moving on to some other rapid fire news. This is sad news has to do with civilization five game still there. But unfortunately, the narrator of the game and the voice you hear in the game did pass away.
6511000	6525000	Over the weekend, William Morgan Shepard was the actor's name passed away. You might know him from civilization five. That's his tie to gaming. But he's had a lot of appearances, a lot of sci fi stuff. He was in Doctor Who episodes.
6525000	6544000	Star Trek was also in the Medal of Honor games. I know William Morgan Shepard from the Elvira movie. He was the antagonist in the Elvira movie. He was like the uncle that was trying to Yeah, anyway, that's what I remember William Morgan Shepard from so and I had no idea that he was the voice in civilization five so rest in peace.
6544000	6550000	And thank you for those contributions to pop culture, gaming culture and all those awesome things.
6550000	6560000	Moving on, we got to say something about awesome games done quick. I guess we already we talked about a little bit, I think, on our call with much of that this week. Yeah, I talked about this on the Bobby call.
6560000	6566000	I won't repeat myself too much. But Shane brought to my attention that Mega Man DOS was going on. I had to watch that because I actually remember that game.
6566000	6575000	And yeah, I watched some of the other stuff. I saw a little bit of the whole the guy that said he was going to do the flossing during the cutscene in Splatoon two and all that stuff.
6575000	6583000	So yeah, I kind of watched it here and there. So it's always a good time. They do. They do a good really, really good charity event there. You get to see a lot of different games.
6583000	6594000	It's a good like informational game period because what I like about it. Here's what I like about the thing is that I don't necessarily like the speed run is kind of like, all right, cool.
6594000	6608000	And it is a great way to feature a lot of games in a very short amount of time. But what I like hearing is the speed runner telling stories about the game and why they enjoy the game and how they got turned on to the game and about the game like history.
6608000	6617000	The lady that was streaming the Mega Man DOS thing. She was bringing up like points about like it was developed by one person and like things I was not aware of.
6617000	6626000	So I thought that was really cool. That's what I love most about that event is like hearing from kids. You all know, I love passion about games and stuff and that kind of positivity.
6626000	6635000	That's that's what I love most about the speed runs is just hearing people be fucking enthusiastic about video games as opposed to like a lot of the doom and gloom we see sometimes in gaming culture. Exactly.
6635000	6646000	So, yeah. Anyway, but they did raise over two million. I don't do like two point three, two point four million. This article, I don't think has a final number there. I think it's just two point four million, I think.
6646000	6655000	OK, just so and probably still going as because they keep it open for a little bit after. Right. So the Prevent Cancer Foundation is what they're raising money for.
6655000	6666000	Great cause. Great, great charity event. So congratulations to everybody involved with that. Next event is Summer Games. Is that the one that's in Orlando or is it next year's games done quick?
6666000	6676000	I know Bobby was talking a little bit about that on his show tonight there. So, yeah, very cool. Bobby is actually trying to audition for a host announcer position. I hope he gets it. That'd be great.
6676000	6688000	So Summer Games is in Minnesota. Next Awesome Games is in Orlando. And that makes sense because Awesome Games is the winner one. So you want to choose a place that's going to be a little calmer in the winter.
6688000	6695000	And then Minnesota. Summer is a good time to go to Minnesota. So it makes a lot of sense. Well, congrats to the folks at Awesome Games done quick.
6695000	6702000	All right. Now we're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases in our release date segment. Loki.
6702000	6711000	Yes. So we do have a couple of things coming out this week, starting off with Yakuza 4. That's coming out on PlayStation 4. And we have a game.
6711000	6727000	I don't know if this is a YEEC. Postmodern RPG. It's Y-I-I-K. I don't know if that's supposed to be some acronym or something, but yeah, a postmodern RPG. And that's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6727000	6735000	We've got Ace Combat 7, Skies Unknown. That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. I know it supports the PlayStation VR, so you may have to check that out. Hopefully they have a demo.
6735000	6743000	And last but not least, we have Travis Strikes Again, No More Heroes on Nintendo Switch. That's it.
6743000	6746000	I'm surprised you're not all about that game, maybe.
6747000	6756000	I'm a big fan of No More Heroes, but I'm not sure if this is going to be a traditional No More Heroes game. It's a little bit different, so I may check it out.
6756000	6771000	Okay. That's fair. All right. Let's travel over and check out some Japanese release dates. Believe it or not, Player Unknown Battlegrounds on the PlayStation 4 in Japan is a game to look forward to this week, as well as Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet, the complete edition.
6771000	6787000	Ace Combat 7, Skies Unknown also gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 4. And a remaster of Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu wo Sugomono is a remastered game that's coming out from Sega this week in Japan.
6787000	6795000	Checking out the Nintendo Switch real quick to see if they get anything this week. Actually, it doesn't look like it. It looks like it's a quiet week in Japan this week, at least as far as retail releases go.
6795000	6800000	I'm sure they still have some digital stuff going on this week, so that is what you have in Japan this week.
6800000	6804000	Loki, can you cover Europe for us while we're still missing a Dark Soccer here?
6804000	6811000	Oh yes, I can do that. So we've got Ace Combat 7 coming out there as well on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6811000	6821000	And then also Senran Kugura Burst Renewal, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 as well.
6821000	6835000	And then Raven Remastered on the Switch. And I think that's it. It's hard to tell because game.co.uk has all their release dates out of order, even though you tell it to sort by date.
6835000	6838000	So thank you for being stupid.
6839000	6850000	Alright, let's see, moving on. Quest Buster talks about that Yik game saying, I tried out the Yik demo, it's like a weird mix between Shadow Hearts and Earthbound set in the 90s.
6850000	6859000	So that's what Yik is. Act Def says Ace Combat 7 is going to be awesome. And Frodo Swagons wants to know if that's a Pikachu creeping behind Loki. Yes it is.
6859000	6868000	Well, you've got your bag in front of it too. So Pikachu's holding the bag for you. But on the cam there is a Pikachu. And actually this is a brand new addition to the studio this week.
6868000	6874000	On said Fry's Trip, check that out. That's a little pillow, which I know doesn't do you guys on the podcast good.
6874000	6880000	But imagine a little tiny body pillow, but like a small one, not like a big one. But it's like a Famicom controller.
6880000	6885000	And that's what I kind of like about it is that instead of being a Nintendo controller, it's a Famicom controller. And I think that's kind of cool.
6885000	6892000	So that's up there as well in our set, which you can check out over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
6892000	6897000	Since we are an affiliate now, unfortunately if you do want to watch the video, you have to be here live on Sunday night or be a subscriber.
6897000	6904000	But you can use your Twitch Prime subscription if you have that to subscribe to VOG Network and be able to see the videos as well.
6904000	6910000	But folks do make clips of Orange Launch Radio. You get those little short 30 second clips. Those are free.
6910000	6915000	So if you want to check out what the studio looks like, hopefully somebody made a clip of a little piece of this week's show at some point.
6915000	6919000	So you can always check that out over on VOG Network.
6919000	6926000	And Bobby kind of also dropping a hint that we might start looking at doing reruns now that we can do a little more video on demand.
6926000	6931000	Because we're talking about expanding stuff here at VOG Network, not just the Chusos on Sunday night.
6931000	6935000	But of course Anime Jam Session is going to be starting in hopefully later this month.
6935000	6939000	I hope because I think the radio feeds going away this month. So hopefully they're starting this month.
6939000	6943000	And some other stuff as well we're talking about that I'm not ready to disclose yet.
6943000	6949000	Oh that makes sense. So Black Mamba 1977 says Yik stands for Y2K.
6949000	6950000	Oh that makes sense.
6950000	6951000	That makes more sense.
6951000	6953000	Why do they get Y? Alright.
6953000	6955000	Y Roman numeral K.
6955000	6957000	Yeah. Alright that's dumb.
6957000	6962000	Oh Bobby Blackwell says Anime Jam Session is starting this Tuesday. So they're coming back from their hiatus onto Twitch. That's great.
6962000	6966000	I hope we'll all be here to support them. So that'll be Tuesday night. So check that out.
6966000	6973000	Alright. Let's move on. We've got some more gaming news to cover. Starting off. Oh no we're going to go to the mailbag next.
6973000	6975000	Yes. Starting off with the mailbag.
6975000	6980000	I can't even read my own damn schedule. Alright let's go to the mailbag next. I'm used to Dark Soccer doing this segment.
6980000	6986000	Alright we have a few emails to get to tonight because we kind of had a cut short show last week.
6986000	6990000	So let's get to our first email tonight from Hydro Thunder.
6990000	6991000	I love that game.
6991000	6992000	I know. Good name.
6992000	6995000	That's another cabinet that I wish they'd bring a home version to. But you know.
6995000	6996000	Might be a little bit.
6996000	6999000	That's a little bit. Oh my God. San Francisco Rush even.
6999000	7001000	There you go. There you go. Alright anyway.
7001000	7004000	Hydro Thunder says Hey Loki, Sky, and Dark Soccer.
7004000	7010000	I've been thinking about purchasing a Switch and I'm trying to decide whether I should go all in on digital downloads or physical games.
7010000	7015000	Here's what I'm thinking. For a digital, most cartridges require a download and some games could have large patches.
7015000	7020000	So I think it makes sense not to have to deal with cartridges if you need to use SD cards anyway.
7020000	7030000	Also, digital downloads open the door to backwards compatibility on future consoles like 360 games on Xbox One if Nintendo decides to do that someday.
7030000	7037000	However, having cartridges would allow me to share games with friends where digital would not and it allows for second hand sales.
7037000	7044000	I believe you touched on this in the past, but I'm curious to see if your thoughts have changed after almost two years since the Switch release.
7044000	7050000	I've been a long time podcast listener ever since I found the To Go edition on my PSP when they added podcasting way back when.
7050000	7058000	Thanks Hydro Thunder. Well thank you for being a fan of the show for so long all the way back to To Go on OLRPSP.com which no longer works.
7058000	7060000	But yeah, that's awesome.
7060000	7062000	Sold the files for it. That was something I dug up too.
7062000	7067000	I never realized how many folks that PSP thing brought to OLR.
7067000	7071000	I think I really under, because I think a lot of you weren't talking to us then.
7071000	7075000	You were just kind of listening on the PSP. But yeah, I feel like we get emails every other week.
7075000	7078000	Oh yeah, I found you guys through PSP. That's pretty cool. Good job Loki on that.
7078000	7079000	Hooray!
7079000	7084000	Well anyway, Hydro Thunder did a great job making the case for and against all by themselves.
7084000	7089000	So I don't know what to add to that. You really have to just kind of make the decision on what works best for you.
7089000	7094000	For me, like it depends on like stuff that I, am I going to resell it or not?
7094000	7101000	I tend to buy stuff digitally, but I have a 128 gig card that goes with my Switch.
7101000	7108000	And I do purchase a lot of games physically because I end up getting them for my kids as gifts.
7108000	7111000	And so you can't open up a digital thing.
7111000	7115000	But I also purchase things off the eShop if it's on sale.
7115000	7117000	Like some of the older LEGO games.
7117000	7122000	Like we had, what did I buy for them that was off, that's digital?
7122000	7127000	I know I, oh, LEGO Worlds for example, which is kind of like the Minecraft type game.
7127000	7129000	I purchased that when it was like 10 bucks.
7129000	7134000	There's been other digital games that I've purchased as well from there.
7134000	7140000	Like, I don't know. So a lot of those, I'll pick it up wherever it's convenient.
7140000	7143000	If it's like a digital only game, then obviously it's going to be digital.
7143000	7149000	If it's an older game, I may end up picking that up used if I can find it cheap enough.
7149000	7157000	But a lot of the times, especially if you're looking for games retail, they don't drop in price very much because of Nintendo.
7157000	7161000	But, and same with, I mean, I guess the same could be said for digital.
7161000	7163000	So it's wherever I can find it cheapest.
7163000	7167000	Yeah, for me, I still have to kind of weigh the pros and cons versus, you know, if there's a sale,
7167000	7171000	if I can get it pretty cheap for digital, then I'll opt for digital.
7171000	7174000	Or if it's like a game where it's like, I know I'm never going to take this game out of my console.
7174000	7178000	I want it everywhere. And I started doing this with 3DS games like Animal Crossing, for example.
7178000	7181000	Yeah, Pokemon Let's Go. Like I knew I was going to get that day one.
7181000	7185000	So I was like, I'm just going to download it. And I bought it that way.
7185000	7194000	Here's the one big drawback I think Hydro Thunder left out of the email that I think is important to consider is that digital stores and that stuff, they're not always there forever.
7194000	7199000	Case in point, the Wii, right? The Wii eShop, you can't buy stuff on that anymore.
7199000	7206000	And I believe if they haven't already, they're going to pull the plug where like, if you don't download it, you're never going to be able to.
7206000	7210000	That store is going to be poof, gone. So that's the problem.
7210000	7218000	The one problem with digital stuff is that there may come a point where if you didn't download it digitally, you will never be able to download it digitally again.
7218000	7222000	P.T. would be another great example, right? That one got ripped from the store completely.
7222000	7229000	That's obviously, there's a lot of different stuff going in there. I don't want to necessarily equate it completely, but I do think it is something to consider.
7229000	7241000	So, you know, if you buy a game for 60 bucks and it's retail and it's in a cartridge, you know that if you want to sell that back or loan it out or whatever, it does have value that you can sell back.
7241000	7255000	But if you buy a game on sale where it's a $60 game getting for 20 bucks, but it's going to be digital, then I think you start to kind of weigh this, well, I'm getting it really cheap, I can't sell it back, but I got it cheap, so the money I lost, I'm getting, you know what I mean?
7255000	7264000	And the other thing too, I think it's the same for physical, is the Nintendo points that you earn as well.
7264000	7274000	So, when you purchase a game, you can redeem the points on the store, and I know digitally you get almost 10% back in points, which turns in the money.
7274000	7283000	So, for example, if I buy a $60 game, I get $6 back that I can then use it for another digital game later on, and that ends up paying for things as well.
7283000	7285000	And that drops the price for certain games.
7285000	7290000	Metal Mayhem in our chat says, physical games, especially collector's editions, often have physical extras.
7290000	7294000	Yeah, some digital games do have extras, but some people prefer the physical stuff. Oh, absolutely.
7294000	7302000	Sometimes the physical stuff is out of control, right? But even now, even the physical stuff is getting controversial, right?
7302000	7308000	Fallout 76, the bag, right? There's some interesting stuff going on, but that's an exception.
7308000	7318000	Anyway, the Wandering Apparatus in chat says, I was impressed with the Pokeball. Way more functionality than I had previously thought, speaking of physical things.
7318000	7323000	And the Pokeball, and that whole functionality, that's not something necessarily you get digitally.
7323000	7328000	My favorite function of the Pokeball Plus is how fast it can collect dirt on it.
7328000	7330000	Is that so? I didn't know that.
7330000	7336000	It is dirty as fuck, and I can't clean that shit for it all. And it's not my kids' fault at all, it's in my pocket.
7336000	7344000	So it just rubs up against my black wallet that I have, and so it just scuffs the crap out of it. I don't know why.
7344000	7351000	Alright, well let's get to another email tonight from, this next one is from Robert M.
7352000	7361000	I do see that currently, alongside the $13 Smash Brothers Amiibos, I'm seeing Mabel from Animal Crossing for $5, due to the glut of these figures.
7361000	7367000	I don't know what that figure did in New Leaf Welcome Amiibo, so what do you expect Mabel to do in the upcoming Switch games?
7367000	7376000	Store and transport designs, perhaps? Also, with the 20th anniversary of the Japanese release of N64 Smash Brothers coming up, will there be special events?
7376000	7382000	Total guess fanfic speculation. I think the Amiibo thing in the new Animal Crossing game will be a hotel.
7382000	7392000	And if you use the Amiibo, then certain people will show up and stay at the hotel, and possibly give you things, items, each one may have a random item that comes with it.
7392000	7399000	I think that's what they'll do. Because I don't think they'll maybe have the character on the Amiibo move to your town permanently.
7399000	7405000	But I think you could force them to visit by using the Amiibo in a hotel-type feature. That's my guess. My wild guess.
7405000	7413000	Yeah, I actually bought this week the Amiibos, because my kids have 2DSs, and so they don't have the Amiibo functionality built in.
7413000	7419000	So I bought the Amiibo scanner thing for the 2DS or the older 3DS systems.
7419000	7428000	And so, so far we haven't figured out what will work with it. I have a Villager, but apparently that's too epic to scan with the ghost thing.
7428000	7433000	I know you can use it, it is compatible with the game, but you have to use it for something else, I think, to get furniture.
7433000	7440000	I don't know, I haven't played that game. I'll let my son and my wife figure that shit out.
7440000	7448000	I was gonna get one of those spoofers. I'm gonna spoof that shit, because they're fucking expensive.
7448000	7455000	Akdeft in chat points out, Animal Crossing Amiibo are dirt cheap right now. So dirt cheap. For New Leaf, you can score some of the Amiibo and have special residents.
7455000	7459000	Where are those then? Where are they selling them at that they're so cheap?
7459000	7469000	There's probably the dollar store, honestly. A lot of overstock, I bet. I think with the Amiibo, they kind of put out a bunch of series that the masses didn't really want.
7469000	7474000	Animal Crossing didn't really work out so well because there wasn't really a console game.
7474000	7476000	Yeah, I beat down them for the Animal Crossing ones.
7476000	7486000	They put out too many of those Kirby. Sorry, Akdeft, you're gonna hate me for that. But I think most people weren't looking for getting Waddle Dee and some of the real deep cut Kirby characters.
7486000	7493000	I think they put out too many of those. Like Kirby, Dedede, Meta Knight, some of the big ones, especially the ones in Smash, that makes sense.
7493000	7499000	But I think there's too many of them they really started putting out. I think Nintendo kind of broke the formula there.
7499000	7505000	But they're still putting out what? They're putting out Ice Climbers, King K. Rool, like the other Smash characters and so forth.
7505000	7508000	So it's not like Amiibo are going away anytime soon.
7509000	7517000	Anyway. Alright, one more email tonight. And if you want to email us at some point, participate at orangelandraday.com. It's the place to do it.
7517000	7520000	You can see that written over there in the text for those of you watching on Twitch.
7520000	7525000	For those of you listening on the podcast, write it down real fast. Participate at orangelandraday.com.
7525000	7527000	This email from Frodo Swaggins.
7527000	7536000	Thought somebody may hate or get a kick out of this. I was at my friend Randy's house and he randomly shows me this and I instantly thought of Rob.
7536000	7539000	Apparently it's a custom made Bowsette Amiibo.
7539000	7544000	I was pretty surprised by the quality. LOL. Feel free to show it on stream if you want.
7544000	7549000	Well unfortunately I can't show it on stream because I have to load that stuff in advance and I forgot to do that tonight.
7549000	7552000	But I did look at the pictures earlier and it is a well done.
7552000	7560000	You know it's like they took the original backing and made a custom one and they took like a peach figure and just basically made it Bowsette.
7560000	7565000	It was well done even though we didn't get to cover it last week and I was really excited to talk about it.
7565000	7568000	But Nintendo has confirmed Bowsette is not canon.
7568000	7573000	Nintendo even tried to say Luigi was the one that tried to wear the hat. I don't know. Anyway.
7573000	7579000	And this is how you make Luigi. This is how you make Luigi Nintendo.
7579000	7586000	People hate me because I'm so anti Bowsette. I'm not really. I just think like y'all went crazy with the Bowsette thing.
7586000	7591000	I'm just slow down internet. Slow down with that stuff. That's my only thing.
7591000	7597000	But I do think the custom amiibo for what it's worth is really well done. So props to your friend Frodo Swagons.
7597000	7603000	I'm sorry I can't show that on stream right now. But for those listening on the podcast that need a little bit of a visual as well.
7603000	7610000	Just imagine a peach doll but it's been done up like Bowsette and actually put back in the plastic with the custom backing and everything else.
7610000	7616000	It was well done. I've seen things like that. I'm pretty sure I saw like a Waluigi one that was done in a similar way at some point.
7616000	7622000	So anyway let's move on. We do have some more stories for you guys. We're going to try to get to the Skype line.
7622000	7629000	We are going to be working on a move to Discord very soon for our calls. Not tonight. We have no time to switch that over that fast tonight.
7629000	7635000	But I would say sooner rather than later like next week if I'm able to get all the testing done before then.
7635000	7642000	We will be moving to start taking calls on Discord. And so you'll want to be on our VOG Network Discord in order to do that.
7642000	7646000	And to join our VOG Network Discord you just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7646000	7650000	And that will generate the invite for you and everything you need to get into Discord.
7650000	7654000	Because later we will be taking calls on Discord in later weeks.
7654000	7659000	Tonight we'll still try Skype but with the new setup over here and everything it's going to be so much easier when we go to Discord.
7659000	7665000	So I'm looking forward to that part. But for now we do have some more news stories for you guys before we get to one of the last Skype segments.
7665000	7668000	A story on Fortnite right Loki? Sort of?
7668000	7675000	Yeah so this is in regards to Epic Games not receiving a very good score through the Better Business Bureau.
7675000	7682000	And this is in regards to unanswered. They have 247 unanswered customer complaints.
7682000	7692000	I know one problem with Epic Games especially the Epic Games Store is they don't really have a centralized forum or community pages for any of their games.
7692000	7699000	And I know we had a story a few weeks ago when they were talking about the whole Epic Games Store that people were having issues with games.
7699000	7706000	They were going to the Steam forums to talk about stuff because there wasn't anything kind of built into.
7706000	7711000	It's almost as if this game this company made got bigger than any of them could have ever anticipated.
7711000	7717000	Well I don't think it's necessarily. I mean yeah there's that too but I think it's just they don't really have a way to take complaints.
7717000	7719000	Or to take.
7719000	7721000	They need a complaint department.
7722000	7729000	So yeah so apparently it says many of the complaints center around unauthorized credit card charges or account hacking.
7729000	7732000	Yeah unauthorized charges my child.
7735000	7746000	So you know apparently Epic said that they're aware of instances where users accounts have been compromised and they're working using well known hacking techniques.
7746000	7748000	It says they're working resolve these issues directly.
7749000	7754000	I don't know but then again you get to the whole Better Business Bureau part of that. It's a scam anyway so you know.
7756000	7757000	It is what it is.
7757000	7758000	So why.
7758000	7759000	They will try to do better.
7759000	7762000	Do you think Epic's actually going to take this seriously and try to fix this.
7762000	7765000	I think they'll try to do better but it's a better.
7765000	7769000	You know the Better Business Bureau isn't like an actual like government thing anyway.
7769000	7771000	For one it's still like Yelp.
7771000	7772000	For one it's still open.
7772000	7775000	You're right it's that's actually exactly what it's old school Yelp.
7775000	7788000	Because that's the thing too is I think they have like I've heard stories where people will they'll say you know contact the businesses say hey you want to get a better rating you know pay us some money and we'll make sure they get a D instead of an F.
7790000	7792000	They're going to try to raise that grade to a D plus.
7792000	7793000	Yep.
7793000	7794000	All right.
7794000	7798000	Moving on let's talk about Final Fantasy and a new digital card trading game.
7798000	7809000	This was first kind of suspect speculated suspected when some Japanese trademarks went in because Square Enix earlier in the week trademarked a Final Fantasy digital card game in Japan.
7809000	7813000	And you know Final Fantasy actually does have a trading card game on if you've ever seen it.
7813000	7816000	I've always been very curious if this is any good to any of our listeners play it.
7816000	7821000	I'd be so curious if the Final Fantasy trading card game is worth my time because it looks interesting.
7821000	7827000	I know they sell like booster decks with different different like a Final Fantasy 13 deck a seven deck you know and all that type of stuff.
7827000	7828000	So I'm super curious about it.
7828000	7833000	So anyway Bandai Namco actually filed a series of trademarks for Japan.
7833000	7835000	They do a lot of stuff Square Enix in Japan.
7835000	7840000	Anyway long story short then they announced the actual game for PC and smartphones.
7840000	7850000	So Square Enix did announce this but get this it's going to be on the Yahoo Japan because Yahoo is still a big thing in Japan whereas here it's kind of I don't think as many people use it as in the early days the Internet.
7850000	7857000	But Yahoo Japan game plus platform in 2019 is when this will be coming out but it's on Yahoo Japan.
7857000	7862000	So that means as far as like an America version coming out I don't I wouldn't hold my breath.
7862000	7863000	I don't know. We'll see. You never know.
7863000	7866000	Could be the smartphone versions I guess could make their way over here.
7866000	7871000	There will be a beta test that I think starts next week January 18th through the 25th.
7871000	7872000	But this is in Japan.
7872000	7878000	Only 10,000 users will be accepted and it is going to be a card based turn battle game.
7878000	7885000	But it doesn't necessarily look like it is the same game that is like the table top trading card game looking at the pictures.
7885000	7887000	This looks very different to me.
7887000	7889000	It doesn't look like the same game.
7889000	7894000	But anyway you will be able to develop characters and beat your rivals and make an original deck.
7894000	7896000	There's a Web site you can read all about it.
7896000	7904000	JP dot Square Enix dot com slash FFDCG for Final Fantasy digital card game.
7904000	7905000	So cool.
7905000	7910000	Anyway looking at chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
7910000	7913000	Bonds 006 says I use Yahoo every day and AOL and Outlook.
7913000	7915000	Hey some habits are hard to break.
7915000	7922000	I just don't like I just don't know if Yahoo is like the forefront of people's Internet surfing like it used to be back in the day.
7922000	7928000	Wandering Apparatus apparently has played it saying it's a pretty fun game not as complicated as Magic the Gathering.
7928000	7931000	So no killing your friends and looking up rulings every game.
7931000	7932000	There you go.
7932000	7939000	SSJ 100 Matt throwing it back to the worst people right in the comments section on Yahoo News articles.
7939000	7942000	Rule is never read the comments.
7942000	7945000	Do you remember when O.L.R. was a network on life 365.
7945000	7947000	This would be before VOG.
7947000	7948000	Yes.
7948000	7949000	Before all games.
7949000	7951000	This is when Orange Orange Radio was a network on life 365.
7951000	7952000	OK.
7952000	7953000	I had a show like I did it.
7953000	7954000	I don't.
7954000	7955000	Was it Vanilla Sky.
7955000	7956000	Was that what I called it at the time.
7956000	7957000	Yeah.
7957000	7958000	There was one of those.
7958000	7964000	But then there was the outside the box some other I just like little pet project shows right because I've done spin off shows once in a while.
7964000	7972000	Anyway there was a segment we did on one of those shows that was always guess the lie when it comes to Yahoo comments.
7972000	7973000	I remember what we called it.
7973000	7984000	But it was basically like we would read three legitimate Yahoo comments and then one that we made up and it was hard to tell which one was fake because there's so much crazy shit on Yahoo comment news articles.
7984000	7989000	So anyway hopefully in Japan they treat each other a little more with respect.
7989000	7992000	And that'll be true with the trading card game as well.
7992000	7994000	So anyway.
7994000	7995000	All right.
7995000	7996000	Let's see.
7996000	7999000	Bobby Blackwell says Rob doing other projects.
7999000	8000000	This is completely unexpected news.
8000000	8001000	I know.
8001000	8002000	I know.
8002000	8012000	Black Mamba says wife says no DT you have too many cards in regards to dark Tetsuya saying I wanted to get into the trading card games there.
8012000	8014000	Milton is games.
8014000	8017000	I'm so sorry if I'm butchering your name says I miss Hoard House.
8017000	8019000	I miss it too especially now that I play Wow again.
8019000	8021000	But you will be.
8021000	8024000	I still talk to everybody from the Hoard House days.
8024000	8026000	A really quick where are they now.
8026000	8028000	Grandpa still does starboard power coupling.
8028000	8030000	So if you're not listening to that podcast you should.
8030000	8034000	He just got back from the Star Trek cruise and convinced me to go next year.
8034000	8038000	So I'm going on a Star Trek cruise next year thanks to Grandpa from the Hoard House days.
8038000	8040000	Extefer ended up moving.
8040000	8042000	He lives in North Carolina now.
8042000	8044000	So he lives on the East Coast.
8044000	8047000	But he is going to Dragon Con with me this year.
8047000	8051000	So not only am I going to Dragon Con and Bobby Blackwell and who knows us.
8051000	8053000	Extefer is making his Dragon Con debut this year.
8053000	8055000	So look forward to that in 2019.
8055000	8056000	And then Shane.
8056000	8057000	Well we mentioned that earlier in the show.
8057000	8058000	He just got married.
8058000	8063000	Which is a pretty big life development there and is playing some Wow with me these days.
8063000	8065000	So that's a little where are they now for Hoard House.
8065000	8066000	So there you go.
8066000	8068000	They still do their side projects as well.
8068000	8070000	Extefer does streaming.
8070000	8074000	Shane isn't really podcasting right now because he's had a lot of transition stuff going on.
8074000	8075000	But maybe he'll get back into it.
8075000	8076000	I don't know.
8076000	8077000	But they're all on Twitter.
8077000	8078000	Go follow them.
8078000	8079000	Alright.
8079000	8083000	That's enough about old podcasts that folded a while ago.
8083000	8084000	Let's move on to other stories.
8084000	8085000	Loki.
8085000	8086000	Yes.
8086000	8090000	Let's talk about the Xbox Game Pass Quest.
8090000	8094000	And so this is a new thing that they're going to be adding.
8094000	8098000	That basically it's different things you can do.
8098000	8101000	Earning achievements earns you different points.
8101000	8106000	And these reward points can be used to trade in for different things like money.
8106000	8112000	So for example in the month of January they've got several different things you can do.
8112000	8115000	So for example they have one that's called Extraction Expert.
8115000	8119000	You complete two specific extraction achievements in Tom Clancy's The Division.
8119000	8121000	And you get 200 points.
8121000	8123000	So you get to finish it by the end of January.
8123000	8124000	So these are different from Gamerscore.
8124000	8125000	Yeah.
8125000	8126000	They're different from Gamerscore.
8126000	8130000	It's kind of like if you've used some of the Microsoft services they have different Microsoft
8130000	8137000	points you can get for using Bing or for like answering surveys and bullshit like that.
8137000	8144000	And you can trade them in for like Microsoft points or Microsoft Game Store money and stuff like that.
8144000	8149000	So it's similar to that but it's basically just playing different games and getting achievements.
8149000	8152000	And then you earn up credit to get different things.
8152000	8157000	So one of the things that you can get of course is like money.
8157000	8161000	So they have a $1.25 Xbox gift card which is $1.25.
8161000	8165000	It's a 2100 points or 1700 points.
8165000	8174000	Yeah so you can earn 2100 points in January and 1700 points gets you a $1.25 Xbox gift card.
8174000	8177000	Or if you want a free month of Xbox Game Pass it'll cost you 7000 points.
8177000	8180000	This is like what the hell is that website.
8180000	8182000	And I'm not this is not a paid advertisement.
8182000	8185000	I'm not endorsing this site because I don't even know if it's still around.
8185000	8188000	What is that site that Amazon runs.
8188000	8191000	And you do these dumb little tasks like fill out surveys.
8191000	8195000	Oh and you get like five cents like Amazon Turing project.
8195000	8198000	It was somebody in chattel know what I'm talking about.
8198000	8200000	But it's a website.
8200000	8206000	And like if you were to do that website full time you would be making less than minimum wage basically.
8206000	8209000	And you get little Amazon gift cards for like 10 cents.
8209000	8210000	It's like that.
8210000	8211000	Thank you.
8211000	8212000	Mechanical Turk.
8212000	8213000	M. Turkey.
8213000	8214000	Yeah.
8214000	8215000	Thank you.
8215000	8216000	Thanks Chad.
8216000	8217000	Chad to the rescue.
8217000	8218000	So there you go.
8218000	8220000	I don't know why but I'm reminded of that.
8220000	8221000	But with like video games.
8221000	8225000	But it's it's neat though it's just like maybe and it's all stuff that's on Game Pass.
8225000	8227000	So all these are Game Pass titles.
8227000	8229000	I think it's fine because you know what.
8229000	8233000	It's not like it's costing you any additional money if you already have Game Pass.
8233000	8236000	And all it is is encouraging you to play different games.
8236000	8238000	And I think that's fine.
8238000	8242000	And you can do it and you get free money.
8242000	8246000	Rama says what I said about the minimum wage is not true.
8246000	8252000	Granted it was from something I read a couple years ago when I think I made my first dollar on that website.
8252000	8255000	And probably my only dollar I made on that website.
8255000	8259000	So things may have changed to be fair.
8259000	8261000	So sorry if I misspoke.
8261000	8264000	So but yeah I you know.
8264000	8269000	I guess if you're bored and you're just sitting there with you know you're watching television.
8269000	8274000	Like why not do a little task and make some money while you watch Bird Box or whatever on Netflix right now.
8274000	8275000	So yeah.
8275000	8277000	So yeah.
8277000	8281000	So this is something that they're going to be switching out these different quests every month.
8281000	8283000	So hey that's cool.
8283000	8289000	I mean it's something to I don't know if I'd necessarily like try to get all of these.
8289000	8292000	But you know it's it's neat that they have it available.
8292000	8293000	Yeah.
8293000	8295000	It doesn't cost you anything more than Game Pass.
8295000	8298000	So I'll tell you what it's better than doing nothing.
8298000	8300000	At least it's an attempt to do something kind of cool.
8300000	8301000	Better than nothing.
8301000	8302000	Yeah.
8302000	8303000	All right.
8303000	8308000	Well speaking of nothing that's how many Super Nintendo games we currently have playable on the Nintendo Switch.
8308000	8309000	But who knows.
8309000	8314000	There are some indications that things may be changing because good old data mining.
8314000	8321000	So the latest version of the Switch Online NES app was data mined and apparently 22 different Super Nintendo games are mentioned.
8321000	8324000	Now not that this should mean anything.
8324000	8329000	After all the PlayStation Classic was data mined and they found all these games that didn't really end up on the PlayStation Classic.
8329000	8331000	So this could be testing.
8331000	8334000	This could be just a load of crap.
8334000	8335000	It could be anything.
8335000	8340000	But anyway I'll read this list real quick because if nothing else it's a great trip down memory lane of Super Nintendo stuff.
8341000	8342000	Super Mario Kart.
8342000	8343000	Super Soccer.
8343000	8344000	Zelda Link to the Past.
8344000	8345000	Demon's Crest.
8345000	8346000	Yoshi's Island.
8346000	8347000	Stunt Race FX.
8347000	8349000	Kirby's Dream Course.
8349000	8350000	Pop and Twinbee.
8350000	8351000	Star Fox.
8351000	8352000	Contra 3.
8352000	8353000	Kirby Super Star.
8353000	8354000	Super Ghouls and Ghosts.
8354000	8355000	Kirby Dream Land 3.
8355000	8356000	Super Metroid.
8356000	8357000	Super Mario World.
8357000	8358000	Pilot Wings.
8358000	8359000	F-Zero.
8359000	8360000	Star Fox 2.
8360000	8361000	Super Punch Out.
8361000	8362000	Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
8362000	8364000	Super Mario All Stars.
8364000	8365000	And Breath of Fire 2.
8365000	8373000	If nothing else that's a really solid like good mix of like mainstream games we all think of when it comes to Super Nintendo.
8373000	8377000	And some somewhat deep cuts like the Stunt Race.
8377000	8378000	Stunt Race FX.
8378000	8380000	I don't remember that game playing very well.
8380000	8388000	And it sounds to me though with the whole Star Fox 2 and stuff it sounds like these are just the same titles that were in the SNES Classic.
8388000	8390000	They're not though.
8391000	8395000	Because the SNES Classic had 24 games in it.
8395000	8397000	But there's different regions.
8397000	8401000	And I don't believe it had Stunt Race and it didn't have Breath of Fire 2 I'm pretty sure.
8401000	8403000	It didn't have a Stunt Race but.
8403000	8406000	So there's a, but you're right there is a lot of crossover for sure.
8406000	8411000	But with the Classic NES and the Switch Online NES library there's a lot of overlap as well but not 100%.
8411000	8414000	I'm surprised they're putting Star Fox 2 in there.
8414000	8415000	Yeah.
8415000	8416000	So be interesting.
8416000	8417000	Be very interesting.
8417000	8424000	It would definitely would be nice to get some additional games on top of just the two a month.
8424000	8428000	I honestly I don't play really anything in that collection.
8428000	8432000	I know Blaster Master just got added this month and I was like.
8432000	8434000	Not yet. It's next week actually.
8434000	8435000	They just announced it for this month.
8435000	8438000	I'm just like eh. I don't know.
8438000	8444000	Bobby Blackwell says they are discontinuing the SNES Classic so maybe this is why Star Fox 2 will live on.
8444000	8445000	That is true.
8445000	8446000	That would make sense.
8446000	8452000	Jeff says is this rumored edition really worth paying for the service considering the Switch Online service still has a lot to be done.
8452000	8457000	I will remember Switch Online is online play.
8457000	8460000	If you want to play Splatoon, Smash.
8460000	8461000	Mario Kart.
8461000	8463000	Mario Kart. You gotta pay for the service anyway.
8463000	8465000	So you're already paying for it.
8465000	8470000	If you're playing these games online you're paying for it anyway so you might as well get these free NES games.
8470000	8472000	NESflix as we call it.
8472000	8477000	So if they do SNESflix then cool. I just hope they don't try to charge much more money for it.
8477000	8482000	I really wish though they would have just did this with the SNES Classic.
8482000	8486000	Just have a virtual console system that you can download that stuff to.
8486000	8489000	Or just enhance it yourself.
8489000	8491000	Sure you can just do it for free.
8491000	8492000	Come on Loki.
8492000	8493000	I've already done it.
8493000	8498000	Not that that should be endorsed but the reality is that's what a lot of people are going to do.
8498000	8510000	The general populace doesn't care if you can't get the Guardian Legend for the NES Classic because of licensing issues or licensing problems.
8510000	8513000	Here's a better example.
8513000	8515000	Super Star Wars on the SNES.
8515000	8517000	A lot of people love and remember that game.
8517000	8523000	If they want to play that game they're just going to hack their thing and put it on there.
8523000	8535000	But you know what? They would probably take the much easier step of pressing a button and paying 500 WooHoo Nintendo bucks to get that on their console for free.
8535000	8543000	And to be fair Super Star Wars I do believe they sold this like a separate thing on PlayStation as part of like a collection there anyway.
8543000	8550000	But you know my point is still is that when it's easy to press a button and pay money for it people will usually do that as opposed to piracy.
8550000	8556000	Look at iTunes and Spotify and the impact that it had on the underground Napster, LimeWire, and all this.
8556000	8559000	Not to say it got rid of piracy. I'm not saying that.
8559000	8564000	But it sure put a lot of legitimate stuff out there too.
8564000	8579000	Because a lot of people like me for example will pick up stuff on a deal like as an impulse buy and then you end up with a library of like 400 games in your PlayStation account and 700 on your Steam account that you don't end up playing but you paid money for and that person got paid.
8579000	8585000	So it's just I don't understand why they don't do that. I mean it's...
8585000	8590000	So Bobby's bringing up the counterpoint. We hated the Virtual Console when it came out because they made us pay $5 per ROM.
8590000	8595000	We all wanted a Netflix. Now we have a Netflix and we want to go back to paying $5 per ROM.
8595000	8600000	Here's the thing though. Netflix is putting out new shit every week.
8600000	8609000	And look I understand because of rights issues and everything there's only so many ROMs that Nintendo can put out and all that but it's moving too fucking slow.
8609000	8615000	That's a big part of the problem I think for me is that 30 games is not that impressive of a library.
8615000	8618000	100 games? That's an impressive library.
8618000	8622000	And there's thousands of people. You can't tell me Nintendo can't get the licenses for 100 games.
8622000	8629000	And it's a lot of their first party titles. I don't see how you can't put your own titles onto the console.
8629000	8637000	I also don't hate the Netflix thing like other people do. I'm happy it's there. I'm glad they're doing something.
8637000	8644000	I do wish there was more to it but we'll see where it's at in another year or so. I'm just glad it exists.
8644000	8647000	And if they're going to do these Super Nintendo games that's even better.
8647000	8654000	That's going to practically double the size, not really, but double the size almost of the library.
8654000	8662000	And that's a huge step forward and really starts to make it feel more like a Netflix type of thing as opposed to a very limited type of box.
8662000	8669000	Right, because there's more I think Super Nintendo games that I'd play versus Nintendo games. I don't know.
8669000	8674000	And some folks in chat are saying, I like it. Sj100Matt, The Wandering Apparatus, I like it. I like it.
8674000	8677000	Or Nintendo 64. Let's put Nintendo 64 games on there too.
8677000	8685000	I also kind of like, it's just a very little thing, but I think it's kind of neat that they do these random official save states that they put out.
8685000	8690000	Where it's like, explore the last Gradius level. Or here's Zelda with all the rubies already.
8690000	8693000	I just wish there was Game Genie supporting all these games.
8693000	8698000	Well, that's kind of what they're doing. It's interesting, especially from a setting up a speed run of a game type of perspective.
8698000	8702000	It's interesting how these little save states kind of change things a little bit.
8702000	8706000	They should do that, like have speed running games.
8706000	8710000	I'm sure, if you can imagine it, it's being done somewhere on the internet.
8710000	8713000	Anyway, a few more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line.
8713000	8717000	So, at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. At least we're going to try.
8717000	8719000	I hope it's going to work tonight. We'll do our best.
8719000	8722000	In the meantime though, Loki has another story for us.
8722000	8731000	In this episode of Battle Royale All The Things, Battle Royale-y is a new mod that's come to Stardew Valley.
8731000	8738000	And it allows 100 players to duke it out in Stardew Valley.
8738000	8741000	So you can do all sorts of fun stuff in there.
8741000	8746000	I think it even has, yeah, up to 100 farmers will battle it out.
8746000	8755000	And apparently you have to have, of course, the mod running along with Smappy, which is the API that they have for Stardew Valley.
8756000	8763000	And also there's, I guess, an online server browser that you can find different servers to play against.
8763000	8766000	But that's pretty funny that you can play the game.
8766000	8772000	I don't know if they have guns or stuff, but I see there's horses and buildings.
8772000	8778000	So it's got all the things. But neat. I would definitely check this out.
8778000	8781000	Are you a fan of Battle Royale coming to everything, Loki?
8781000	8790000	I think it's funny sometimes, yes. Especially things that don't really need it to come to it. But it's funny.
8790000	8794000	The Wandering Apparatus suggests Broccoli Royale mode.
8794000	8801000	Miltonius Games says, but does it have romance? The people need to know. Can you romance all those 99 people?
8801000	8803000	That would be a lot of work.
8803000	8808000	That would be a lot of work. But, you know, some people might be into that. I don't know.
8809000	8815000	All right. Let's get to one more story for you guys, and it has to do with a pretty cool little tribute coming to World of Warcraft.
8815000	8821000	It's a Stan Lee tribute, because of course we all know Stan Lee of Marvel Comics passed away in November.
8821000	8824000	And World of Warcraft does these pretty cool little tributes sometimes.
8824000	8827000	They've done it for some of their fans and long-time players.
8827000	8833000	I know they've done it for, you know, people like big celebrities and stuff too, like Stan Lee.
8833000	8840000	A recent public test server patch went live, 8.1.5. So it's not in the live game yet, but it's on the public test realm.
8840000	8845000	And apparently there is a new character around Stormwind Keep whose name is Stan Lee.
8845000	8850000	And if you actually look at him, he's not Stan Lee, but Stan Lee.
8850000	8857000	But if you actually look at him, it's very much like you look at, he's got a very unique model with the glasses and the stash.
8857000	8858000	We all know damn well what he is.
8858000	8863000	Of course, he also will greet you by shouting Excelsior, as if the rest of that wasn't a giveaway.
8863000	8867000	But I love that. I love those like tributes and MMOs and things like that.
8867000	8873000	You know, heaven forbid, if anything ever were to happen to me, I would be tickled pink if I was remembered with an MMO type of tribute.
8873000	8878000	I would want to be a slutty lala in Final Fantasy XIV named Robbing Roberts.
8878000	8881000	And I would steal a gill every time you walked by. No, I don't know.
8881000	8886000	But you know, it would be, or I'd never shut up. I just keep talking. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
8886000	8889000	That would be fun. How would you be immortalized in an MMO, Loki?
8889000	8891000	This is dark, but you know.
8891000	8893000	How would I be immortalized?
8893000	8895000	How would you be immortalized in an MMO?
8895000	8897000	Oh, they just wouldn't release the MMO like my game.
8901000	8905000	It'd just be a piece of missing texture. Coming soon, Loki.
8905000	8906000	All right.
8906000	8913000	Coming up right now, we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8913000	8916000	And we're getting ready to take your calls here.
8916000	8919000	Bobby Blackwell says he'd rant about everything.
8919000	8921000	That might be the thing you would do. I don't know.
8921000	8924000	Anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype.
8924000	8926000	We are eagerly awaiting your calls.
8926000	8931000	Meanwhile, while we wait to see if anything comes in, do we have any last minute stories we want to cover, Loki?
8931000	8933000	I know we had to cut a few things from the show world tonight.
8933000	8939000	Uh, yeah. There was, I was going to say we didn't talk about the light gun thing that they have.
8939000	8948000	So there's a new technology now, apparently, to be able to do light gun games on, like, LCD-type panels and stuff.
8948000	8957000	And so it's a new thing that they're going to be releasing to support, I want to say, I think it was NES games, maybe?
8957000	8958000	Yeah.
8958000	8967000	So that's pretty cool. I'm kind of curious to see how that works, but I'm down for more light games.
8967000	8970000	All right, I think we have a call on the line, so hopefully you're there.
8970000	8975000	Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8975000	8979000	Okay, we don't hear you, and I think that's a fault on my end. Sorry about that.
8979000	8986000	So let me just play with the controls over here, and give me a moment, caller, and we'll try to get you on the line here.
8986000	8992000	ASAP, which is probably the fault of this thing, one way or another.
8992000	8994000	Try again. Caller, are you there?
8994000	8999000	Hey, this is Metal Mayhem. I used to go by regionator.
8999000	9004000	Well, welcome to your final form, Metal Mayhem.
9004000	9021000	Anyway, you were talking about arcade cabinets sold by various stores during your rapid-fire segment.
9021000	9023000	Sure, like the Golden Tee and that stuff.
9024000	9035000	Yeah, well, I would imagine they're not exactly like the machines that you can see in arcades.
9035000	9048000	But with that being said, assuming that you had the budget for it, and you can find ones that are worth...
9048000	9050000	Uh-oh, he froze up.
9050000	9055000	Uh, regionator, if you can still hear me, go ahead and finish your question. His video froze, too.
9055000	9059000	Uh, do we have you back, regionator? Can you finish that question again?
9061000	9070000	Shit, did we lose him? Oh, I like to hear little bits and pieces coming through, and it's not on our end because we're still broadcasting. See how he's frozen?
9070000	9071000	Poor network connection.
9071000	9073000	Poor network connection! Oh, wait, he's moving again.
9073000	9074000	Regionator!
9074000	9077000	That was weird. Alright, I think we're back now.
9078000	9090000	Okay, I don't know what the fuck happened there, but somehow that locking up on the phone sent, like, something to the mixing board that, like, completely knocked it out.
9090000	9092000	Skype is trying to attack our mixing board.
9092000	9099000	That was crazy. Anyway, I'm sorry, Metal Mayhem, I don't know what the heck that was about. That was crazy.
9099000	9102000	That's something I'll have to fix in post. Sorry about that.
9103000	9108000	Did you see that? Like, the light, the only way I knew was because the light on the mixing board, like, suddenly went out.
9108000	9109000	Huh.
9109000	9113000	How does that even work? And so I just unplugged it and plugged it back in. Isn't that weird?
9113000	9114000	Weird.
9114000	9117000	Anyway, whew! Yeah, we'll be moving to Discord real soon.
9117000	9134000	Um, and yeah, Damon's, um, I think the question he was trying to ask was, if we were to switch, or if we were to build one of these arcade machines, budget's not an issue and so forth, what would the arcade machine that you would sell look like?
9135000	9156000	Uh, the one I would sell, I would do, um, I would do, like, some of the, I don't know if it's all Midway stuff, but, like, let's do, uh, Gauntlet Legends, and, uh, we'll do some of the Ninja Turtle arcade games, and, what is this, all Konami, the Simpsons arcade game.
9157000	9170000	That's a really good one. I, I, I love that idea. I would go, like, Ninja Turtles and Simpsons arcade game, like, the old, like, Konami hardware from there. I would definitely go with that, but, um, you know, I'm a big fan of BurgerTime as well. I think that might actually be a thing that's out there as well, though.
9170000	9171000	That's one of the ones that's coming out.
9171000	9172000	Is it really? I want that one.
9172000	9174000	That's, uh, the karate champ one.
9174000	9177000	I might have to get that one, for sure. So.
9177000	9189000	Demons. Gremlins and demons. Don't know what's going on. Shorts.
9189000	9199000	I seriously think something might have shorted in that mixing board, and that's leading to the buzz that we have now. This is crazy.
9200000	9218000	I don't know what the heck is going on. That's crazy. Anyway. Um. Wow. I'm, I'm at a loss for words for the first time in forever. So. Crazy, crazy. Alright. Is the buzz still there?
9221000	9226000	I unplugged the phone. I completely unplugged that connection. Completely.
9227000	9237000	Wow. If it's not one thing, this is the brand new mixing board, you guys. It's the brand new one. So, yeah, and they still hear the buzzing in the background.
9237000	9245000	And I'm really worried. I can see a little bit. Yeah, you can see it is slowly getting louder and louder. Oh, my God. This is awful.
9246000	9253000	How did a short kill the soundboard that fast? I don't think a short did kill the soundboard. What do you think's wrong, Logie? I don't know.
9253000	9266000	Yeah, is it? It's not a is it a grounded? Um, it's not grounded. Is it like they don't have a grounded like I used to get like can see it flicker. Wait, let me try. I'm gonna try a different plug. Hold on, guys. Okay.
9267000	9279000	Because you can. I used to have a problem on my old USB stuff. Yeah, I still hear it very faintly. I think I don't know how the hell this thing shorted when we've only been like four episodes in.
9279000	9290000	It's probably under warranty. So frustrating. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. All right. Yeah. And I I plugged it into another thing.
9291000	9300000	Some folks thinking the power outage could have shorted it. I don't know. But that is crazy. We have to wrap up before the bus comes back.
9301000	9313000	God, if it's not one thing, it's another. At least we got a full two plus hours in tonight. Yeah. That is ridiculous. All right. Because you see you see it start to flicker over there and then it goes out. But why? Why now?
9314000	9328000	Why did we go like two and a half hours of show and then all of a sudden that comes in? It didn't like Skype. I don't get it. All right. Real quick, let's wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts. Logie, your final thoughts tonight?
9328000	9338000	My final thought is vacation. My final thought is thanks for being here and putting up with all this weird stuff going on. I don't even know what to think. Have a good night, everybody.
9339000	9346000	Thank you so much for listening to the show and downloading. Tell a friend or two. We'll work on the soundboard for next week. It's all we can do. Good night, everybody. Thanks.
