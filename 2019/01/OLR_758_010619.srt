1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey everybody, it's Rob Roberts. I know this is a really weird way to kick off the podcast, but this is a really weird episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So here's what happened. It's going to be a little bit of a shorter show than usual this week because we actually recorded this while there was a big storm going on in our hometown of Sacramento, California.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And it actually ended up that there was a storm so big that it kind of presented hurricane-style winds, which is really unheard of in California.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And it knocked out power for 100,000 people in the area, which unfortunately included us at Orange Lounge Radio Studios.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But unlike the one or two times in our 15-year history where this has happened to us before, this time we were broadcasting on Twitch.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So all of our audio was actually saved thanks to the fact that we were broadcasting on Twitch.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So I was able to stitch together a little piece of the podcast here, thanks to Bobby Blackwell for his help by the way in saving some of this audio.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So we can at least present the parts of the show that we were able to do on Twitch.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But for that reason, the audio is going to sound a little weird. It does some weird cuts and things that you might not be used to hearing on the podcast.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Some audio is going to be really out of whack when we're running some video at the same time, so I apologize for all that.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But it's better than nothing, which is what Mother Nature wanted us to do.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So here you go. Here's the first part of the lost episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this past week, episode number 758.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Expected excitement and plenty of other happenings are already in progress and there's plenty of news to cover.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So let's jump right in and start the show where every gamer has a voice.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 758 of our show for this January the 6th of 2019.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Back for the first show of the new year after a little holiday break.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I am Rob Roberts and joining me as always here in studio is Techmaster Loki. How are you doing?

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's me. I'm here.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're here. You're back. How you doing?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm good.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah? Did you have a good holiday break?

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was alright. I had a lot of opportunity to play games that I didn't take.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay. Okay.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So instead I worked on stuff, I guess.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So you worked on stuff or you worked on gaming projects? Your own game?

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I worked on step mania stuff and I think I may have played, maybe I played a few games, but it was mostly step mania stuff.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Alright well we'll get into that during our gaming weeks in a little bit.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now the resolution that people want to know from about three episodes ago, that in-joke that had everybody dying,

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
about you guys telling the kids you were going to take them to the broccoli farm when in reality that was the trip to Disneyland, right?

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay so you were going to unveil that whole thing on Christmas, right?

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I wanted to, but we have not done that.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So they still think they're going to the broccoli farm?

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They're still convinced that there's a broccoli farm out there that they're going to.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do they know that the broccoli farm is in Southern California?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, they know that they're going to-

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You didn't tell your kids on Christmas?

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, we didn't. So we're going, yeah, they know that they're going to Los Angeles.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, okay.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Some relatives of ours though are like, they're all, yeah, we're going on vacation to Southern California.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, wait, you guys going to Disneyland?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm like, no, we're not going to Disneyland. We're going to Los Angeles. Shut the fuck up.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I love it. I love it. As Akh Def says in our Twitch chat, the broccoli farm of the stars.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes, who knew all that on Broccoli Way?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Not here tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. She is still on a work break.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She will be joining us here in studio January 20th.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So we're going to have to rearrange the look of everything to fit one more in here.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, we're not. She's just going to sit on the other side of the camera.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think she wants to show off the wigs.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, she's going to show off wigs?

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My favorite idea for getting Jamie was the Dr. Claw, where you'd be able to see her arm and maybe we'd have like a robot arm or something.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know. I like that idea, but we'll see.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And then maybe a little wig. But we'll see how we work that out with her later.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I haven't messed with OBS enough to know, like, can we do like Instagram filters on there and shit, you know?

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think, yeah, because you can kind of do like the chroma key. Like, I use some other plugins.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do like some motion tracking for like an animated thing that's over her so you don't see her.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't want to do all that garbage. I just know.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So we'll see. I'm going to work out whatever she's comfortable with so you guys can check that out.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're part of the voice geeks network live with the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday night.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So we are right after him. He's on at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And we are right after it about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern and other great podcasts on the voice voice geeks network that you can check out.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Not all of them live on Twitch yet. Some of them don't want to be.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I know anime jam session going to be making the move over to Twitch later this month.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I think I think that whole filter thing you're talking about, I think they are doing something.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't want to give too much of their stuff away, but I've heard they may do something like that.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So that's all I'm going to say. So stay tuned for that with it.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And again, session comes to Twitch. So we are going to get into some news.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I know we have some big stuff that's going on with Japan and these laws.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But first, I want to wish a happy mag fest to those that actually went out to mag fest.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It looks fun. It does. It does look fun.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Actually, what's pretty cool is that we actually sent some B roll of like, this is what mag fest actually looks like.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So our pal Ramo was actually at mag fest. So we don't know what mag fest is.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's like this big festival that goes on using games fest that actually goes on out in the DC area.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And they have other satellite ones. They do smaller shows. They do a mag west.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So, I mean, mag is kind of this thing that they're putting all over the place.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And this is, I think what they're calling super mag fest right now.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So they're actually doing this back.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And so, sadly, you guys can't see this in the podcast, but for those watching on Twitch,

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
we're actually looking at footage that DJ Rama has shot of the game room from this year,

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
where you saw some people playing karate games.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They have a very impressive collection of pinball tables as well.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And the whole, the whole like, catch to this whole thing or whatever is that these are open.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
These rooms are open like 24-7, basically, for people to play in, participate in.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So people can go to play in these rooms and play games the whole time.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ramo wants to clarify, it wasn't from his cell phone. It was actually his DSLR camera.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, my bad. I thought it was his cell phone. Oh, my bad. My bad.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I guess I confused uploading from cell phone. So sorry that time was bad, Rama, but there you go.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Anyway, so, yeah.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But you can see there's several people playing U-beats.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There's lots and lots of music and representation that happens there,

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
which is interesting because I know they were having some problems in like Tokyo Attack and their agreement,

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but I think they were able to find somebody else to kind of take over and provide lots of music-based games,

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
as well as some of the other, like, classic arcade games.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think at one point in here, they'll get to where people are playing rock bands,

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
like projected up on a wall, which is something that you can actually see as well.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I guess the chat is telling me that the video is really, really loud.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I thought I turned it down, but I'll turn it down even further.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So hopefully you guys can hear me a little better.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can see they actually have, like, little pods that they bring in for MAGFest and so forth.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So it's a lot of fun, and what's not in this video, unfortunately, but, you know, there's only so much we can fit in.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Are those, like, the virtual pods?

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, I think there's something, like, a little bit different, actually.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But, yeah.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, there it is. Yeah.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, there's the rock band that's playing on the wall.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But anyway, they have lots of stuff that's going on at MAGFest, including concerts that go on the entire time.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They actually have bands that are playing Chiptune music and doing, like, other awesome things all that time,

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
while everybody's gaming in these rooms.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Console rooms, and I'm sure there's places where you can do RPGs.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The typical panels that you would expect.

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I mean, it's a really fun convention. I'm really sad I missed it.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But the reality is, you know, OLR is not my job that pays the bills.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I have a day job just like he has a day job, and Dark Sakura obviously has a day job, which is why she's not here for a little bit.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And so the day job, you know, I only get so much time off.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And so Dragon Con, and then, you know, Alan and I got to take a trip here and there.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So, you know, I don't have quite the time to be able to do MAGFest.

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Maybe next year.

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But I wonder if I should be saying this this early, but what the heck? Why not?

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Just for you guys. A little secret between us.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So next year, I already have a trip planned for March.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So guess who talked me into something pretty big?

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It was Grandpa from the Starboard Power Coupling, right?

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So Grandpa actually talked me into going on the Star Trek Cruise.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Star Trek Cruise?

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, there's a Star Trek Cruise.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So they're actually going to have, like, some of the celebrities from Star Trek that actually, like, get on the cruise, get on the boat, and it travels all around like the Miami, the Bahamas, and all this stuff.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Grandpa is actually there right now. He's actually there.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So they're booking for next year already. So he talked us into it.

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So that's going to be a fun trip for next year.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But sadly might be the reason I can't do MAG next year, but we'll see.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Because the cruise is in March next time, so we'll see.

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, that's different.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I would, if it were me, you know, if I was one of those Star Trek actors, I'd be like, I'm going to get on a boat with these people.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They make money. They get their money from autographs and pictures. It's like a floating convention. It'll be a lot of fun.

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I know Bobby's a big cruise person. I don't remember if I told him this yet, so I'm sure he'll be excited for me, too, and that whole thing. So, yeah.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, it'll be fun.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All right. Anyway, enough talk about fun and conventions. Let's talk about more serious things, like the law.

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's talk about what's happening in Japan, because there's a big new modding law that went into effect over in Japan.

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Right, Logie?

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes. So, it's illegal. Don't be doing it.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, you know, a lot of the Japanese companies are pretty strict when it comes to modding and different piracy devices or whatever.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But you may remember very recently last year that Nintendo cracked down against some ROM sites.

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You know, in the past, they've come after, of course, modding devices like the R4.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But now, they basically are part of Japan's Association of Copyright for Computer Software.

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Modding game save data and consoles violates the country's unfair competitive prevention law.

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And basically, it sounds like the DMCA here, but more strict.

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The problem, though, with it, I think, is that a lot of the stuff that you're going to get in trouble for is if you're selling tools.

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like, for example, there's this company, Cyber Gadget, that has a save editor tool that allows users to put in cheat codes and stuff like that.

152
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, they have to stop selling the save editor on their Japanese site.

153
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But I think a lot of this, if you do it in home, they're not really going to catch you and, like, put you in jail or something like that.

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's if you just try to make money off of it, it's more like it.

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So that's, well, I mean, to be fair, some of that is a questionable reality in the U.S. as well.

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Like, in extreme circumstances.

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Like, I seem to remember we've had stories on the show about people that run bots in, like, World of Warcraft or even, I think, like, League of Legends.

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
People that run bots and cheats for these games, they usually get taken to court in a civil sense.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't think anyone's been, like, dragged off to prison over this.

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah.

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But you know how we're all so happy here in America.

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, it's, yeah, it's not illegal to do that. It's illegal.

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think in those cases, it's just maybe they're saying that they're in violation of the end user license agreement or something.

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And so they're taking, it's a civil case.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But it's not like it's against a lot of the, in fact, actually, I think quite the contrary in North America.

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They have the, I want to say that you have the right to be able to root your own console.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think you can mod your consoles and, you know, fix them and stuff like that.

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But they, you know, of course, the company doesn't have to let you onto their services if you do that.

169
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But it's not illegal for you to modify your consoles.

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's just that you may lose some functionality from that.

171
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Now, the other thing I kind of think about is something that's been very popular lately, especially with the PlayStation Classic.

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We were out for a week because of the holidays. So we haven't been live in two weeks.

173
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So we missed kind of the week. I mean, not a lot, a lot happens between Christmas and New Year anyway,

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
because most of the game industry is also taking a vacation as well. Right.

175
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But I know that one of the big things that happened in that break that we were out is that the PlayStation Classic all of a sudden dropped in price.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Right. Like a lot of people, it's only 60 bucks now.

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So we were kind of like doing like super couponing at Target to like get it down even further.

178
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was seeing on Twitter, people were getting it like 30, 40 bucks. And it was like through it was through a Target hack.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You know, couponing with their I think you use like a normal coupon, but you could also use the cartwheel.

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You know, that app, the cartwheel. And I'm sure the red card is.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So anyway, you ended up with like a double coupon. So people are getting that thing even cheaper.

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But my point is, people are starting to now, I think, take interest in that PlayStation Classic because they want to mod the hell out of it.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But technically in Japan, you're like breaking the law doing that.

184
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But we're kind of interpreting this to be the problem would be if you then turn around and flip those consoles on eBay or the Japanese equivalent, which I think Yahoo auctions is still a thing over in Japan.

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So. Right. You know, but but whatever, regardless, like modding those consoles, then turn around and flip it around. That's illegal.

186
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But what you do in your own home, the government is going to have a hard time tracking that down. Right.

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't think that if you're modding your console, like, say, if I modded a switch or something like that and I'm in Japan, I don't think Nintendo is going to turn you over to the authorities for that.

188
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But if you're trying to, you know, say you create a mod chip to put into the switch and that makes it really easy and try to sell that, then you might be in trouble.

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But it seems it does seem very short sighted about the global situation.

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I mean, many times a lot of these chips and things are coming from other countries. Right.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Like even all the way back to when we would plug in something in the back of our PlayStation ones so we could play burn discs.

192
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A lot of those were coming in from, ironically, Japan, but also places like Hong Kong. Yeah. You know, other countries, basically.

193
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So, I mean, Japan, I guess, could say in this law that you can't really import them or sell them.

194
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I mean, this is such a hard thing to enforce. It is. And but now if you do get you do get in trouble with this, you can face up to five years in prison and up to a five million yen fine, which is about forty six thousand dollars.

195
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Truthfully, that doesn't seem that bad unless it's like per offense and it stacks up quickly, kind of like what happened with the ROMs on those ROM sites.

196
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I wouldn't want to go prison for anything. I mean, that's stupid.

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, is it both? I thought it was prison or the fine. I missed that. Yeah, it's it's both. Yeah.

198
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yikes. Go into our chat at Twitch TV slash Vogue Network. Code Man says, just just got a call from Nintendo, Rob.

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They are suing you for wearing that shirt. This shirt is actually I've seen a ton of other people wearing this shirt, too.

200
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's on. I guess I can give him a shout out. It's from Threadless. And for those on the podcast, it's got like little eight bit representations of pretty much like every Nintendo thing they've ever made.

201
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And I know I've seen other people wearing this shirt on like YouTube and other things. So it's a pretty popular shirt.

202
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So but they wouldn't. Why would you sue me, the consumer? This actually as much as a tongue in cheek comment as that is, I think it does relate to what's going on with this story, because Japan, you know, with this, I'm sure it's got a lot of sensationalist headlines about,

203
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:36,000
oh, you mod something in Japan, you're going to go to prison. But it seems like it's much less the moderate, the individuals themselves with the people who are taking that and turning around and putting it out there for other people to consume.

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I would bet these three D.S. cards that allow you to, you know, Nintendo hates those things. Oh, yeah. They like dump the like the flash carts and stuff. That's what they want to stop.

205
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah. And this is probably to prevent that. You know, it's just, I guess, more ammo for them to be able to come after them.

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But do you think they're going to take the time to shut down nude Skyrim mods? Because that's what I don't know about Loki.

207
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Now, that's that's different. See that. And this is more of like it says modifying game save data. That's a little weird, though.

208
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think they're talking about devices to do that, maybe patches and stuff, but like I wouldn't think that just because of this, like it would be illegal for you to use mods and like, you know, like you mentioned Skyrim because of this.

209
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't think it has anything to do that, because that's basically you're, you know, allowed to create content for.

210
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I think it's more of like I just hack and cheat devices, basically. If it's morally wrong, although new mods might be morally wrong to some people.

211
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But if it's like breaking the game in a way that, you know, is unfair, then, yeah, it's probably that. Like, you know, if you're selling aimbots or something like that.

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Profiting off of someone else's game, essentially, which is interesting because then how does streaming fit in all that?

213
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Like, I don't think it's I'm not I have no idea like where streaming culture in Japan is that like I'm obviously completely ignorant to that.

214
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I would love to hear from listeners that might know that.

215
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But like, I don't know if it's even on the same level as it is here.

216
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't know. Like, it would be interesting to see now this laws in place, what you know, what actually is going to be was going to be used for.

217
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Because, yeah, I don't think they're going to go after everybody. I think they're just going to use this to go after people that, you know, do different things.

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's just like, you know, it's the whole DMCA stuff. Yeah, those laws are on the books. Yeah, it's illegal to do certain things.

219
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But do people still do those things? Yeah, because I mean, it's not going to stop the individual person from modding or doing whatever.

220
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It just might make it a little harder to get the tools to do that. Or, you know, if you're looking to profit off of that, maybe you might think about not doing that.

221
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Bobby's kind of pointing out that modders do get hired sometimes, though, like especially you think about like Valve and a lot of their teams and things like Team Fortress 2.

222
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like Team Fortress was a Quake mod, right? Dota, the original Dota was a Warcraft 3 mod, right? So Valve loves modders.

223
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So, you know, mods, it is an interesting kind of counterpoint, though, is that modders are not always like a bad thing.

224
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But I believe ID always loved the Quake modding thing. I know Warcraft embraced the modding thing.

225
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like sometimes the original games kind of embrace the modding scene and really encourage you to do that stuff. Hell, with Blizzard Starcraft 2, like that whole arcade thing is mods, mods, mods, right?

226
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm just surprised, though, that they just even bring up modding save game data. I would think that it's modifying consoles would be something.

227
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But I don't know unless that they're talking about save game data as in, you know, patching a new ROM onto your system.

228
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So they're basically saying soft mods and hard mods is what I'm thinking.

229
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There's a couple of other great comments in chat. I want to get out here before we move on to the next story.

230
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Questbuster says, Japan has also cracked down on gaming bars for playing games without consent from the publishers.

231
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's so fascinating to me. I mean, and you think like, God, there's bars here that do game night all the time that I'm sure are not paying any royalties.

232
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
In fact, I know at least some of the local bars. I went to a gamer night that was like Smash Brothers or something.

233
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And like, they're not they're not paying Nintendo money for that. But I also kind of look at it as it's kind of like free advertising for Nintendo.

234
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But bars have jukebox, jukebox laws technically when you play music like at a bar.

235
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah. You're supposed to pay the music industry for that. But like, I don't get like.

236
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't know. I just think the whole even that I think is kind of ridiculous sometimes.

237
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I mean, I understand that licensing and everything, and it's just what we let these industries get away with.

238
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
As far as like being able to play a game in like a location or something and having to pay rights to that, I think that's dumb.

239
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I understand like movies, because that's basically, you know, watching a movie or listening to a song is basically the same as if you went to see it in a theater or you're listening to it on the radio or whatever the case.

240
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So that I can understand, you know, paying licensing rights for playing a game at a tournament or something doesn't seem that that's the same thing.

241
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Because a lot of times, you know, you you interact with the game actually makes the experience watching somebody do that.

242
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That doesn't I don't know. I think it's just a weird grab for cash at that point.

243
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's like you purchase the game.

244
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It all sorry, but it all comes back to this thing that like copyright, IP, trademark and just like knowledge protection.

245
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know what else to call it, but those types of laws in the U.S. were written way before all this technology has stepped in.

246
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And every year we're moving more and more into uncharted territory.

247
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And because this country, you know, not to get on a political soapbox, I try my best.

248
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But I mean, the reality is, clearly, if you look at what's going on in politics right now, they're focused on all this other stuff.

249
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Right. Nobody's nobody cares about trying to reform trademark or IP or trying to bring that into.

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Well, not right now. Yeah. Well, certainly not at this moment.

251
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But do we feel do we feel like anybody's going to run on that platform in 2020?

252
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Because I really doubt it, considering everything else is going on in the world politically.

253
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You know what I mean? Like, I feel like it does need a major overhaul.

254
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It does. Like somebody we just need to come to the table and evaluate it in this technological age.

255
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Because, you know, not only do we have a global market where, you know, even like game releases,

256
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,000
they don't come out a year earlier in Japan anymore because people know if they're if the gap is too big.

257
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Sorry, I look shocked because was that thunder that just shook the I don't know.

258
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Holy crap. We have storms going on here in SACRA. Our show is based right now.

259
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And we don't get thunder like that here. I think it's just wind.

260
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's really windy out there. Wow. That just that shook the whole door over there.

261
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Sorry, I got derailed. Well, the wind is coming from that direction.

262
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So that's scary. That's scary because I had to drive in it just a second ago.

263
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And then that wasn't that wasn't much fun with stupid people.

264
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
They don't know how to drive in the show. Just suddenly disappears tonight.

265
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Y'all know what it's because Thanos snapped his fingers and we all vaporized.

266
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, the rapture is happening in Sacramento right now, actually.

267
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No, I'd get on my phone and I'd hop in the chat and say what's going on real fast.

268
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Speaking of saying to folks in chat now, I did notice that we have cheesy tots.

269
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Ninety six and chat says first time listening live. Well, welcome.

270
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm glad this twitch thing and cheesy tots are delicious.

271
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But I'm glad this whole move to Twitch is kind of exposing to new people.

272
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's what we were. That that was the plan, Loki. That was the whole idea.

273
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We had a plan. We just like the Cylons. There was a plan somewhere in there.

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They have a plan. Let's see. Also in chat, Code Man says, can we get a modder to mod the new Sonic movie poster?

275
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Perhaps. I don't know. Let's see. Photoshop is going to fix that movie poster.

276
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Act Deft in chat says, Rob, what about that UPS?

277
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
OK, so the chat's been raising razzing me. I saw one the other day.

278
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I seriously I was, you know, because I should have asked when I took my kids to their gymnastics class.

279
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We always make a trip over to the goodwill is next door. And I saw UPS sitting there for like five bucks.

280
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But I should pick it up because I don't that is I don't know if it's any good because it's that, you know, it's a goodwill.

281
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So who knows? It can't be any worse than what we have now.

282
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I should have picked it up because I was like, oh, you know, we don't have one of those.

283
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll check next week. All right. Sounds good. But no, no, you because I've spent money on getting the video going and all that stuff.

284
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Come on, guys. Priorities. Sorry. It's just it's one of those things you don't think about until you need it on a day like today.

285
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We're like, I wonder if the show is going to shut off. But the nice thing is now, because we're streaming to Twitch,

286
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
there is going to be a backup of any audio that's done. There's going to be a backup on Twitch.

287
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You know what I mean? Yeah. So worse comes to worse. I go back and record that.

288
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And so we can have a podcast of what went out. But yeah, the lightning strike in the house and all that is definitely no fun.

289
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I know that. I understand. Anyway. All right. Anyway, anything else you want to say about the Japanese copyright law before we get into our gaming weeks?

290
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Or modding law. Sorry, I shouldn't say copyright law, but I feel like it all ties in.

291
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I think it's that the wording seemed to be kind of a reach as far as like modding save game data.

292
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But I don't know the actual details. This is like, you know, distribution of game save data, editors and programs distribution, selling auctioning,

293
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
serial codes and product keys without the software maker's permission.

294
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh, that's to get at those companies like G2A, whatever. That's probably not the right name, but it doesn't matter anyway, because they're kind of they're kind of sketchy as we got into on the last show.

295
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Services that offer editing hacking of save data and modifying hacking of game consoles. So it sounds like it's more of like the programs and stuff.

296
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It is interesting how these laws are very like corporation friendly, isn't it?

297
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Well, I notice it's distribution of a game save data and not using it necessarily a distribution of those serial codes.

298
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I mean, just don't use G2A and services. And so it's offering services and tools, not necessarily the actual process of doing it yourself.

299
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So I think it's, you know, if you're going to use ROMs on your device, that's fine.

300
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Just, you know, don't tell anybody or don't tell Nintendo that you're doing it or whatever.

301
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But don't put up a goddamn website offering ROMs for anybody to download, because then that's going to get you in trouble.

302
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah. Go on to torrents like everyone else did. I mean, I wouldn't know anything about that. What are you talking about anyway?

303
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
All right, let's move on. Let's get into our gaming weeks. Let's talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

304
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Loki, you mentioned you haven't really been able to play a lot, but I'm sure you're still playing your DDR machine here and there.

305
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Right. I haven't played my DDR machine too much. I'll tell you why.

306
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So like what happened was, is I was trying to put a new mix onto the machine.

307
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And so apparently I think it's the disk I burned was not great because I burned it really quick.

308
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And I was like, eh, it'll work fine. So I've been like, it took me a while to find a mix that worked on the machine again.

309
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I ended up going back to extreme because it's like, I'm just not fucking with this anymore because I, every time I swap a mix out, that's 15 minutes.

310
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So like the other day I was going to stream, but it took me, I tried to go to fifth. I tried to go to max.

311
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I tried to go to a Disney rave again. And then I was like, fuck it. I'm just going back to extreme.

312
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And that's like 15 minutes between each swap. And then on top of that, I thought the drive might've been bad because I swapped it to the, the second or third drive that I bought.

313
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That was the one I was supposed to have. And it works. It's just, I think the disc is bad.

314
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I think the disc is just not burnt. Right. Um, so I just went back. Isn't there a thing with like really old lasers?

315
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like if you burn a disc at like 48 speed or something way too fast, like burn it that fast. I burned it maybe four speed or one.

316
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It was four speed. I think I dialed it way down because I know that if you burn too fast and yeah.

317
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And it's just the machines, um, are very picky on the analog mixes and stuff in which, you know, technically the newer mixes aren't,

318
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
analog mixes, they're the, you know, digital stuff, but it's the older mixes are just really picky on reading.

319
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Um, so I would get it installed just fine. But then when it goes to read the actual data off of the disc to load everything, it just wouldn't do it.

320
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It'd give me a CD ROM error. So, um, I just went back to extreme because I'm like, ah, fuck it.

321
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm not going to worry about this because next thing that's going on there is going to be the, um, set meeting machine anyways.

322
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I already have the PC built. Um, I've got everything loaded on there. I'm just building the theme right now.

323
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So that's what I've been doing is, um, well I had a, I had a design and then I just didn't like the way it looked.

324
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And so I'm doing something different. And then my stupid dumb ass got this like really elaborate idea because nothing I do can be simple.

325
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So, so now we're going, we're going to do something that involved me downloading hundreds of freestyle videos from the DDR scene.

326
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yes, because my theme is based around DDR freestyle. Um, and it's pretty bad ass. Like I, I'm not going to show this on camera, but I'll show it.

327
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm going to show Rob on camera blindsiding me. I'm going to show you what my logo looks like, but it's going to actually have more.

328
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
This is the type of thing Mel B would give you a big hug for. This looks awesome.

329
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes. And it's exactly the type of thing that, yes, they're going to be.

330
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So are you saying you're going to put like freestyle videos in the background of like DDR songs?

331
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Um, it's going to be in the intro of the whole thing. So it's like, so here's what you have to do.

332
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You, you made these projects so huge so that you'll never finish them.

333
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
No, no, no. I have like I have the template or the theme I'm building off of.

334
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I just wanted the intro part to look nice because I originally I had like my idea was going to have like a video looping in the background.

335
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But for some reason and I, I don't know if it's the video I'm choosing or something.

336
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I can't get like a DDR ace. They have a cloud video that keeps looping, but I can't get any other video.

337
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I try to swap that with or like put something that loops like that to loop perfectly.

338
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It like stutters and it doesn't seem to loop like continuously. I don't know.

339
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So I was going to change up how I'm doing the theme and everything with that video, but all the songs in the background.

340
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So we're going to have like video backgrounds and it's going to it's going to be awesome.

341
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But I don't know why I'm even bothering to discuss this is just shit.

342
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm going to be streaming on on camera and you're not even necessarily going to even see the intro.

343
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But here's why, though, because eventually I do want to like distribute the theme.

344
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But in Japan, of course, because I want to get arrested in Japan, it's it's not modifying it.

345
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I mean, it's modifying a program, an application.

346
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So. Yeah, I spent a lot of time just researching like how to do different things.

347
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And so I'm in Blender now actually doing a 3D mockup of it so I can do like a pan around of a 3D logo and everything to project.

348
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Basically, here's the give you an idea. So. I was looking for.

349
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Like the the how you would call like, you know, projecting like an image, because I thought it was like 3D projection or was was called,

350
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
but that's actually something different where you actually project 3D project like a computer image up to three objects and do fun stuff like that.

351
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But so I was looking for the terminology for that.

352
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And I came across, of course, the Marvel, you know, the Marvel Cinematic logo theme that they do with all the video stuff.

353
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm like, I want to do something like that. So I may end up doing something like that, but we'll see.

354
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Anyways, so enough. So I yeah, I did. My cabinet is ready to play on again.

355
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So I am going to start streaming again this week. I meant to do it last week, but I wanted to do a different mix and I just couldn't get it to work.

356
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So I'm like, fuck it. Go back to Extreme again. And so it's all ready to go. I just have to go play now.

357
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But ironically, I've had the TV available to me most of this week.

358
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Why have I had the TV available to me this week? Because I or Santa Claus got the kids 2DS's for Christmas.

359
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And so with that, they got it came with a new Super Mario Bros 2. I bought them both 3D or Mario Maker and Animal Crossing.

360
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And you had to buy them both the game. Yes. Because they don't know how to share. No, they don't know how to share.

361
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So here's why, though. It's important, though. It's so they can play together and they don't have to take turns because the whole point is they fight over the console.

362
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Okay. Okay. But there's an ironic twist to this. So Animal Crossing. So my my son, Josh, loves Animal Crossing.

363
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
My son, Danny, doesn't give a shit about it. But guess who does give a shit about Animal Crossing wife, my wife.

364
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And she's been playing Animal Crossing this entire week.

365
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So so you finally figured out how to get your wife off the TV was to get her a DS and Animal Crossing.

366
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And now Isabel and her are off being BFF. So they're talking about playing Animal Crossing.

367
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And I've had the opportunity to play games on the TV. I've just I've sat down and going, I don't even know what I want to play.

368
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's like I was like, well, I could play Red Dead Redemption, too. I'm like, I don't really want to.

369
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And then I was like, I should buy just cause for something like that.

370
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But I I didn't want to buy another game with all these games in my I should start a complicated media project that nobody's going to see.

371
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But myself and learn how to use Blender to create this elaborate introduction is going to do me literally no good now that I have access to the TV.

372
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes, that's exactly what I decided to do instead.

373
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You're such a man. You're such a man with man problems, but actual games.

374
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So the actual games they did play. So I did play a game. I bought one on on steam recently.

375
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And I can't remember the name of it now. It was it was called.

376
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Well, it must have left an impression. No, no, I just.

377
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And that's the part where the power went out for the first time. So it was a really quick hiccup.

378
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It only went out for probably about 30 seconds, but it was enough to shut down all the computers and make us have to come back up on Twitch.

379
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So we did give it another go and spare me the UPS jokes, guys.

380
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It does come up on the stream a little bit, but just with all the investment that's been going on and some of the new hardware and stuff to do the conversion of the Twitch video.

381
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Buying a UPS to prevent a freak storm was not exactly the first thing on the list.

382
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Whoops. Could he use that tonight? Anyway, here's the smaller, unfortunately, because it happened again.

383
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Spoiler alert. But here's the smaller second part of the show that was broadcast live.

384
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
All right. Welcome back to Orange launch radio. So what happened there in the little gap you're going to hear the podcast recording is that we actually did have a power failure.

385
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So all that talking about I'm afraid this is going to happen. Sure enough, came to light.

386
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We did have a power failure, so we lost Twitch and everything. We lost everything, obviously, for a couple minutes.

387
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And everything's still flickering.

388
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Everything's still flickering, so we may be hosed.

389
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So if it does happen again, sadly, at that point, I'm going to call the show. At that point, it's just not safe to keep doing the show.

390
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But yeah, all I can say is that these storms are crazy. Like for California, they're crazy.

391
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
For the rest of the world, they're probably not so bad. But for California, they're pretty crazy.

392
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And yeah, so the wind is blowing like mad and I'm sure this will shut down the power.

393
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So anyway, thankfully, because we do broadcast on Twitch, we are getting the audio pulled so we will have that for the podcast.

394
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We won't like lose the episode completely, but it's just what a pain. Yeah, an absolute pain.

395
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Anyway, when we left off, we were talking about your gaming gaming.

396
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
We were talking about some of the things you're going through with your DDR machine.

397
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You talked about your wife and the DS's and that Animal Crossing addiction, all that.

398
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah, so they like their DS's and everything. So they've been playing that.

399
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So she's been doing that. I haven't decided what to play on console yet.

400
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Metronomicon was the game I played and it's a rhythm like RPG game.

401
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I know Bobby's played it, but that's the game I purchased on Steam.

402
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So it's kind of like DDR, but it's an RPG. So it's kind of neat.

403
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So I played that a little bit and then Katamari reroll.

404
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Finally got around to playing that, which is Katamari.

405
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And then Pokemon Go, still been playing that.

406
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I think that's pretty much it, unfortunately. It's been pretty minimal.

407
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So for my gaming week, the week we were off, since I knew you were doing family stuff that Sunday,

408
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and Dark Sakura still had her work thing, so there just wasn't enough of us to do a show that week.

409
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But I ended up doing a stream of Katamari Damacy reroll.

410
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So yeah, that went really well, actually, since a lot of the people that would usually show up for OLR

411
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
are watching that stream. So that was a really great thing to do.

412
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And the game's fun. Once I got past that introduction, I was able to get the video configuration.

413
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's just dumb. I don't know why they do that.

414
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's so weird, because I think it's a lazy dump from the Switch version. But whatever, whatever.

415
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That was a lot of fun to play.

416
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I also took advantage of the Steam sale and I bought another game.

417
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I bought Soulcalibur VI, but I actually haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

418
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm hoping to do that in the next week. But another game I bought, part of the reason I haven't gotten around to Soulcalibur VI yet,

419
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I bought Groove Coaster. So you know, Groove Coaster, right?

420
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah, I remember that.

421
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's a music game, and it originally came out on the iPhone in 2011, 2012.

422
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's been out on iPhone for years, but I think more people know it now because of its Japanese arcade machine release.

423
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And if you go to round one, or I even saw it in the MAGFest footage we were looking at earlier,

424
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
they have these big Groove Coaster machines. So this game is really popular in the arcade.

425
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So they actually have a version of it available on Steam.

426
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So I picked that up on the Steam sale, because that's only, I think it's only been out for about six months.

427
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And I had no idea, I somehow missed. We probably had talked about it on the show.

428
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Talking about it on the show does not always translate to me going over to my computer and pressing the purchase button on Steam,

429
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
because I remembered to do it. So I finally did get it during the sale, and that's been fun to play.

430
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It doesn't recognize my Xbox 360 controller for some reason, which is weird, because it has controller information in there.

431
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So I actually play with the WASD and the IJKL, and that whole thing.

432
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So I actually play with those two thumb sticks.

433
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But it works like I'm actually able to play it.

434
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So if you don't know what Groove Coaster is, it's a music game.

435
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's very bright, very colorful, very ravy, and you're going down this track.

436
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
They call it Coaster because it's like your little sprite, which a lot of times is the Space Invader, because it's, you know, the same company.

437
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It goes down this track, and as you go through the track and hit notes, like notes will come onto the track, and you hit buttons in time with it.

438
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But sometimes it's not just tap, sometimes it's tap both, sometimes it's slide, sometimes it's wiggle.

439
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You know, it has you do these different things with the controllers.

440
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And it's fun. So it's just a fun little tap-along music game, so people that are into music games I think will get a kick out of it.

441
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And it's presented pretty well for Steam. I like the fact that it will recommend songs for you to play based on the difficulty of other songs that you've been playing.

442
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So that's kind of neat. Obviously there's a ton of DLC. I haven't really explored a lot of the DLC. I know Undertale stuff is available.

443
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That's kind of how I heard about this actually, because a friend of mine was getting the Undertale DLC.

444
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So they have some interesting stuff on there. So yeah, I've been playing a little bit of Groove Coaster on PC, so that's been fun.

445
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And continuing my adventures in World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy, and Final Fantasy gets a big patch next week.

446
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Final Fantasy XIV, that is, gets a big patch next week. So I'm really excited about that.

447
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And yeah, I think that's the bulk of the big stuff I've been playing.

448
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I still need to pick up Beat Saber, because I actually charged all my move controllers and all that with the intention of getting it.

449
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But then I just, I didn't get around to it that night.

450
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You just played Rez instead.

451
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I have played Rez, but just not, yeah, not recently.

452
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But I talked about Rez VR a couple weeks ago, right? Yeah.

453
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So I did finally get around to playing that. It was great. I really liked it.

454
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But, like, Beat Saber's probably the next thing I want to pick up on PlayStation, so.

455
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I guess one other, I should mention this game too, and it's my buddy Delvin's fault from VG Realness here on Twitch.

456
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
He started playing Grim Dawn, which is like a Diablo-esque type of game that came out probably about a year or two ago.

457
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I think they're on their expansion now.

458
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And so he was playing it so much, I was like, well, shoot, I want to play.

459
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So I started playing, I got a character up to like level 15, like further than I'd played it before.

460
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So I was having fun with that.

461
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Game Grim Dawn?

462
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Grim Dawn, yeah. It's Diablo-esque.

463
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So it's that same like RPG, but in the action sense.

464
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And, you know, you build your character's classes, but it's a lot more complicated than Diablo, in my opinion.

465
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's a little more, I think it's built more for fans of that genre.

466
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But it's a fun game.

467
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I just, I wish my inventory was bigger because I feel like I'm always like having to go back to do inventory management.

468
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And that's the part of those games that gets a little bit dry.

469
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But I know pros of the genre would tell me, well, you have to pick what to take with you.

470
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I'm just kind of like, yeah, but that's not, you know, other games like Diablo have spoiled me.

471
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And all that stuff, you know what I mean? So, exactly.

472
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So, good guy Bobby Black Wolf already has Dropboxed the first part of the show to me.

473
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So I can do post-production really easy tonight.

474
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yay!

475
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Thank you, Bobby. Appreciate that.

476
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And thank you everybody for your support continuing on in our chat room there.

477
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I really appreciate it.

478
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
ActDeft, speaking of chat, says, I'd kill for a Theatrhythm on Switch.

479
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I would love Theatrhythm to come back.

480
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Like, I love the arcade version of Theatrhythm.

481
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I've been able to play that at round one.

482
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And so I think it's a lot of fun.

483
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And yeah, I would love to play that again, especially like on the Switch.

484
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Or even if Nintendo's going to insist on keeping the DS being a thing,

485
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I would love another version of that on DS, to be frank.

486
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
KArts1 in our Twitch chat says,

487
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
What's the name of that one free Diablo like on PC with the insanely big skill tree?

488
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
You're thinking of Path of Exile, I think, is the one.

489
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Path of Exile is also available on consoles.

490
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
They have that on Xbox One, and I believe it was recently put out on PlayStation 4.

491
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And it plays pretty well on consoles, all things considered.

492
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Just like Diablo kind of does.

493
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So yeah, Path of Exile, I like the soundtrack in that game, too.

494
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's got a really sweet soundtrack.

495
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I know it's a weird thing to compliment, but like, you know,

496
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
when a game soundtrack is really good, like, you notice, you know.

497
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So I noticed that Path of Exile had a pretty sweet soundtrack to it, too.

498
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So and it's free, which is what people really like.

499
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But because it's free, like, respecing is going to cost you money.

500
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
If that's what, you know, they find ways to kind of nickel and dime you.

501
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Lots of cosmetics, of course.

502
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But I don't think, like, they don't do it in an intrusive way.

503
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You know, the way they do it, they're doing pretty good for themselves,

504
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and they have a pretty successful franchise.

505
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So there is that.

506
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So all right.

507
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Well, we're going to try to get on into some news here on this storm.

508
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I think the wind finally calmed down, so hopefully the worst of it has passed.

509
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I don't know. We'll see.

510
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Good thing I shut off my computer in the other room and all that other stuff before tonight's show.

511
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's just a bummer we were trying to do live internet radio tonight.

512
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
What can you do?

513
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
All right, let's move on. I guess we're going to get into some news, right?

514
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Let's do it.

515
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So, you know, brand new console being announced by Slightly Mad Studios.

516
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
They are the developers of Need for Speed Shift and Project Cars.

517
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And they basically made the CEO, Ian Bell, put out on Twitter,

518
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
or he created a Twitter account and put out some tweets regarding this console

519
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that they're claiming is going to be the most powerful console ever built.

520
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Eye roll there.

521
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And it's projected specifications, according to him.

522
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's going to be capable of 4K output and VR gaming at 120 frames per second.

523
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And that it'll be including a full engine for free game development.

524
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And they said that, you know, apparently that it's going to be price competitive with upcoming console prices.

525
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Okay, why are you sighing, though?

526
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm just sighing because I've heard this before.

527
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
To be fair, our chat is lighting up to the Phantom 2, says Pod Culture.

528
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Even more powerful than the Soulja Boy consoles, says K Arts.

529
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So there's a lot of skepticism going on here.

530
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm so skeptical because you don't have any fucking experience in developing a console.

531
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
One, two, we've seen this shit before.

532
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Like with fucking Ouya, fucking Oton console, if anyone remembers what the fuck that is.

533
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I mean, there's lots of promises.

534
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
You can fucking throw out numbers all fucking day long.

535
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But until that fucking console comes out, I'm not believing one iota of this shit.

536
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's a tweet.

537
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's a fucking tweet.

538
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's a tweet that game journalists and blogs and all that are running with

539
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
because OMG new console announcement in a weird way.

540
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So you're just like, I'm skeptical until the proof is out there.

541
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But if you come to an E3 stage and you show this or whatever you want to use in this day and age

542
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and you show one of these things in public and people play it and it's badass, then the hype turns against you.

543
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The only thing that's missing from this right now is a crowdfunding campaign for this shit.

544
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Really, that's it.

545
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I mean, at least they're not doing that yet.

546
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Or I don't know if they're planning on doing that.

547
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,000
But like, you know, even other tweets like, yeah, we're going 90 per eye, 180 FPS internally.

548
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
My CTO has just called me and confirmed that's what we'll be able to deliver.

549
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You don't know what the fuck you're going to be able to deliver

550
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
because you haven't even figured out what the internals of this thing are going to be yet.

551
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm highly skeptical of this.

553
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And then they put out like a 3D render of like the console.

554
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But hey, we blurred the inside because we don't know what the fuck's going inside of it yet.

555
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But here's what we've designed on the outside.

556
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And by the way, it's fucking large.

557
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It looks like a PC case.

558
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm just, I don't care.

559
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Do we really need another console?

560
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Is this, we don't even know what the next gen of consoles are going to be yet.

561
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Like, and you can't say that, oh, this is going to be the most advancing.

562
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Fuck you.

563
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I mean, seriously, just saying, Loki, go off, drag her.

564
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's dumb.

565
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I just don't like, what is the purpose of this?

566
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Let me, let me get to some less skeptical comments from our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network.

567
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Kaijuto says it sounds good, but it's going to take a while for them to get any playable games on there.

568
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I believe them.

569
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Bobby says, I roll my eyes at this, but I'm also excited to have positive things to think about the new Intellivision.

570
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So I'm a hypocrite.

571
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But I mean, but Intellivision, you know, there's a lot of names going into that.

572
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
There is console experience.

573
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And Intellivision's not trying to like, oh yeah, 4K, 180 FPS.

574
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
True, Intellivision actually kind of trying to lower your expectations in a way, right?

575
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah, and I'm fine with that.

576
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
They're trying to say like, we're not going to be PS4.

577
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
This is exactly, like, they're clear with where their target is.

578
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I have huge skepticism for anybody out there that comes out with, oh, we've got the most powerful console coming out.

579
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We're designing it.

580
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We don't know what the fuck we're doing, but we're designing the most, it'll be the most powerful thing.

581
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And it'll be competitive because, like, it always seems with this type of stuff, the closer we get to it, the more vaporware this becomes and the more they start scaling back their expectation.

582
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And just, I don't know, I've never seen a new console just launch like this and actually be successful.

583
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
To be fair, to be fair, it's a tweet.

584
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The gaming people that have nothing better to talk about because the holidays have been going on and this is a very slow time of year.

585
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And that, unfortunately, is where it cut out for good.

586
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,000
At that point, our power went out and it stayed out past the point where Loki ended up going home to make sure his family was okay.

587
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And we weren't even getting data on our cell phones.

588
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It was, the power was out.

589
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So that was it.

590
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
We couldn't really do any more Orange Launch Radio for this week.

591
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So that kind of stinks, but Mother Nature, what can you do?

592
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Freak storm.

593
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Climate change isn't real.

594
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Anyway, what we can do, though, is that even though we didn't get to that part in our show role, which is like our list of everything we're going to talk about for the week,

595
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
you guys probably figured out by now that when we're talking about Radio Magic, we mean, yeah, we taped this segment a little earlier in the week.

596
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So we actually do have the Classic Game of the Week segment already done.

597
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So we'd like to present to you for this episode the Classic Game of the Week.

598
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So that music must mean it's time to take a trip back in space and time and visit the Classic Game of the Week,

599
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:28,000
where every week we are joined by, well, hopefully we're usually joined by the one and only Dark Sakura to pick a classic game for the gaming vault for us to celebrate every week.

600
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And we have via the Skypline tonight, Jamie is here.

601
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Hello.

602
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Hi.

603
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Hi, welcome back.

604
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah.

605
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
We missed you.

606
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
New year, new me.

607
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah, new year, new you.

608
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Have you really changed that much in 2019?

609
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I got some wigs.

610
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Oh, well, I can't wait for you to be back to the show and show off some of those wigs on our new Twitch stream, which has been going very well, but we missed you.

611
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I've been, yeah, I've been playing, my current game is new wig, who dis?

612
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
New wig, who dis?

613
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
All right, well, let's get to it.

614
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
New week, which game?

615
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Let's talk about the Classic Game of the Week.

616
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
What'd you pick for us?

617
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I pick a really, really old one, Rob.

618
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It's like super old.

619
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, I'm so, yeah, obviously I'm a little clued in on what it is.

620
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And this is one of those games where like, I'm mad that this is 10 years old.

621
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I am mad that this game is 10 years old, because that means it's been 10 years since I remember this game coming out.

622
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah, it's the City of Final Fantasy.

623
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And while it came out in North America in August of 2009, it actually came out in Japan December 18th, 2008, so it counts.

624
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So, there was also an international version that came out in Japan based on the North American version called City of Final Fantasy Universal Tuning that came out November 1st, 2009.

625
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
What's up with that? Square Enix always does that international version stuff. Always, always.

626
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's as reliable as, you know, bears shitting in the woods.

627
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Square Enix is always going to do international versions.

628
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well, you know that they make our version better, because our version comes out afterwards.

629
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
True.

630
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah.

631
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So, at any rate, the game basically takes characters from different Final Fantasy games and puts them on this big conflict between Cosmos, who's the goddess of harmony, and Chaos, the god of discord.

632
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And so the two gods will summon different warriors to fight for their sides in their, quote, 13th war.

633
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So, in the story, you know, you play 10 characters, chosen by Cosmos, who are the protagonists from the first 10 Final Fantasy games.

634
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And you also have other features that are in the international version, such as an arcade mode.

635
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So it was actually created because Nomura Tetsuya, who is the director for Kingdom Hearts, wanted to do a Kingdom Hearts spinoff, but they changed to Final Fantasy.

636
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And so he designed all the characters in it and, you know, tried to make it appealing to Western players for some reason.

637
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But it got really good reviews and generally considered a fun, pretty game.

638
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I did not know it was originally a Kingdom Hearts thing. I wonder if that means we would have had, like, Disney characters and stuff.

639
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And maybe I could have finally kicked Donald's-

640
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
That's probably why it wasn't.

641
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I could have finally kicked Donald's ass for not healing me.

642
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Right? Or, goofy for taking all the potions.

643
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
True.

644
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Well, at any rate, the game was described as what's called Dramatic Progressive Action.

645
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And so it is a full 3D game. It has- you can do wireless one-on-one multiplayer, and you can use the different skills of the different characters.

646
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You can also customize your characters by adding equipment to them.

647
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You know, it's fully 3D field map, you can do special maneuvers in the environment, you've got traps you can set off, all kinds of fun stuff like that.

648
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And you then get experience and go from the battles, you can add, you know, more equipment and further customize your characters.

649
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So basically, you know, you're supposed to reduce your enemy's HP to 0.

650
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Your defensive and offensive power is shown in what's called BRV, or Bravery Points.

651
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You start off with a certain amount, and you basically just have to use different HP attacks.

652
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You can steal BRV from your opponents with different types of BRV attacks, and there's all kinds of weird shenanigans that go on in the game.

653
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:43,000
But basically, if you have depleted your BRV, basically if it's past 0 and into the negatives, you go into Break Mode,

654
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:51,000
which you can't cause any more HP or BRV damage, but every attack against you is critical.

655
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You know, kind of like when your meter goes, like, max in Smash Brothers.

656
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You also have an EX gauge that you can fill in different ways, like doing damage or taking damage or, you know, stealing or taking EX cores from the field.

657
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But once it's filled, you go into EX mode where it increases your power and gets new attacks.

658
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You get EX bursts, so you have some very damaging special attacks, kind of like the Limit Break.

659
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And then in another mode that's more exclusive to the Western versions, you have Arcade Mode,

660
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:36,000
which makes it into a traditional fighting game with all of the RPG elements removed and the characters' abilities just down to the basics.

661
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So you've got three tiers in that Normal, Hard, and Time attack, and beating any tier of Arcade Mode will give you player points that you can use for stuff in Story Mode.

662
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And all the characters, including the villains, are available in Arcade Mode except for Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht.

663
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
They need to be bought with the PP catalog from other modes.

664
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And so that really is just the big thing about the game.

665
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You've got your, you know, your ten characters, which starts off with the Warrior of Light in the first game,

666
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Furion, the Onion Knight, Cecil, Butts, it says Bart, but I call him Butts because that's how I first started playing Final Fantasy V.

667
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Because you're a mature adult.

668
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
He needs Butts. You know what? Whatever.

669
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It was Batsu.

670
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It was Chara, or Tina as she was in Japan,

671
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Cloud, Squall, Zidane, and Tidus.

672
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Or Tidus in the Japanese one.

673
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And so they have to retrieve the ten crystals, which will help them defeat Chaos.

674
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And so, you know, you basically have this whole big, overwhelming story.

675
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And you've also got two other storylines, one called Distant Glory,

676
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
where Shanto, I'm going to mispronounce it, Shantoto, sorry,

677
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and Gabranth are introduced with two different areas that they are trapped in and have to find a way out.

678
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And then you have Inward Chaos, which is an alternate scenario in which Chaos has never been defeated.

679
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And you're guided by something called Shimoyu to defeat Chaos.

680
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So yeah, basically it was meant to be a spinoff from Kingdom Hearts when they were developing Kingdom Hearts II.

681
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
But Nomura was like, he didn't want the Disney characters to fight each other,

682
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and so he opted to use the Final Fantasy characters instead.

683
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Although the idea did lead up to the development of Kingdom Hearts 3.58 by two days.

684
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And then it also led up to other new developments, too.

685
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Like, some of the other games that had influence on this were also A Little Bit of the World Ends with You.

686
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So they really tried to involve different things.

687
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So they were able to just throw in all kinds of other things.

688
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And of course, as the game progressed, they were able to do sequels for this,

689
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
because people wanted other characters, too.

690
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So they were also trying to include other characters that had tie-ins to the main characters.

691
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So it's just really, overall, a very dynamic game.

692
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And then the game was originally licensed in the US as just Dissidia.

693
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
But then they connected it with Final Fantasy, of course, later on through the Japanese website.

694
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,000
The soundtrack was done by Ishimoto Takeharu, and the soundtrack by itself was released in December 2008.

695
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It had a regular and special edition, and just really, really good music for it, too.

696
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Lots of merchandise that came out for it, the international version, like I said.

697
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,000
There was also a Mystic Silver PSP that came out with a copy of Dissidia Final Fantasy 2GB Memory Stick,

698
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
and a copy of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children that came out in August of 2009.

699
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And then there was Dissidia Final Fantasy Ultimania Alpha, which was a reference guide for the game.

700
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And it was part of the Ultimania series for what they did.

701
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Suntory, which is like a whiskey and brewing company, also collaborated with Squenix to do the Dissidia Final Fantasy potion drinks that came out in Japan.

702
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And then there were trading arts figures for the game that had Cloud, Squall, Zidane, Tidus, and the Warrior of Light.

703
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And then there was a second one that had Sephiroth, Terra, Butch, Fearion, and Cecil.

704
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So it sold pretty well.

705
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah, it was the 12th best selling game in Japan in 2008.

706
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,000
The United States debuted in 7th place in 2009 in August, despite only having been out for four days.

707
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Wow. Well, the Final Fantasy name is a strong thing.

708
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Yeah, so there we go. The game is Dissidia Final Fantasy.

709
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Awesome. I have to admit, I tried to, I didn't really play it on the PSP.

710
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I tried to get into it with that recent PlayStation 4 release.

711
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I wasn't really feeling it, but maybe I need to go back and experience the original.

712
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I don't know. Maybe I was doing it all wrong.

713
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Possibly.

714
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It was just, it was really hard to understand, but I've had that happen with video games.

715
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Is that like, it goes really over my head and then I'll go back and like play it again.

716
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And then I'm like, okay, this isn't as bad as I thought it was.

717
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So sometimes the problem isn't the game, Jamie, it's me.

718
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Well, sometimes it is the game though.

719
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It sometimes is the game, but I don't think in this case. So anyway.

720
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
All right. Well, there it is. Classic of the week.

721
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
We do have to get back to the live show, but quickly, Jamie, since it's been a little bit since the listeners heard from you,

722
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:52,000
do you have any like gaming resolutions for 2019? Anything you're looking forward to playing or destined to catch up on?

723
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm going to stream some shit.

724
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So think of, think of, I would like the listeners to think of a SNES game that they would like to see me play through.

725
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And maybe I'll do it if I have it, which I, chances are I do.

726
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
If it's in the vault somewhere.

727
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It's somewhere in there.

728
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
It's true. You're not going to be restricted.

729
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I still want to copy.

730
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I was just saying, you're not going to be restricted to just the classic consoles or I'm sorry.

731
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I mean the classic, like the SNES classic and those things.

732
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You're not just restricted to those because chances are you probably have the original hardware.

733
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I mean, I mean, you certainly have the original console, but you probably have the original cart somewhere too.

734
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Well, yeah, I've got the original console that has a lot of original carts.

735
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And if I need to, because I was actually thinking I've got this big Sony Vega in here that would be perfect for not having to deal with the input lag from the component cable.

736
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So we'll see.

737
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
All right.

738
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Well, best of luck to you in that endeavor.

739
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I know a lot of people are trying to focus on streaming this year.

740
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I guess us at OLR included with this whole Twitch move we just started a couple of weeks ago.

741
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So, yeah, it's going to be a big year for streaming.

742
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Absolutely.

743
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,000
All right. Before we let you go, any final words for the listeners before we let you go?

744
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I wish I could eat ice cream.

745
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And with that, that's everything we had for Orange Launch Radio this week.

746
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So I know it's a really weird episode, but what can you do?

747
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Anyway, let's all cross our fingers and our toes that we're not going to get hurricane style storms next week.

748
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And we will be back live on Twitch next week, God willing, literally on January 13th.

749
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
So you can check that out Sunday, January 13th at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

750
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Thanks, you guys, as always, for subscribing to our show.

751
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
We really appreciate it.

752
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Thanks for listening this whole way through, even though it was a really weird episode.

753
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Really appreciate you guys.

754
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And we'll see you next time, okay?

755
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Send us emails for the next show.

01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

757
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Tweets would be great, too, at OLR.

758
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And that's it.

759
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Awkward ending, but what can you do?

760
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That's it.

761
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Fade to black.

762
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Bye.
