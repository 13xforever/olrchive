7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week I felt a great disturbance in the internet as if thousands of videos suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly unavailable. I fear something terrible has happened. We'll explain this as well as plenty more from the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 760 for this January the 20th of 2019.
46000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts and not joining me tonight, Techmaster Loki, but in studio with us, back tonight, happy to have her back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
56000	57000	Hi.
57000	58000	Hi, how are you?
58000	61000	I'm doing okay. I forgot I left this Ragnarok thing open on my phone.
61000	65000	Yeah, are you are you farming for Ragnarok, Zeni or whatever it's called?
65000	68000	No, I'm just farming for gems.
68000	69000	Okay, I see.
69000	72000	I want to kill Baphomet and it won't let me kill it yet.
72000	74000	Is that, that's a thing that you find in the game, Baphomet?
74000	75000	Yeah.
75000	76000	Alright, well anyway.
76000	79000	It's also funny because I'm also leveling a Baphomet too.
79000	83000	Let me come back to you in a minute, Jamie, because I know we have a lot to catch up on because you've been out for a little bit.
83000	84000	Yeah.
84000	89000	Well, you've been here through the Classic Game of the Week, but those that are watching on Twitch are probably wondering, who's this guy that's sitting next to me?
89000	91000	Well, Techmaster Loki is out this week.
91000	94000	This was the weekend of the broccoli farm trip, so I'll come back to that in a minute.
94000	96000	But this is Alan, Alan Alchemy.
96000	97000	Hello.
97000	98000	Hi, how are you?
98000	99000	I'm good.
99000	100000	Good.
100000	101000	So, Alan's going to fill in for the show tonight since Loki.
101000	103000	I haven't been on this show in a long time.
103000	107000	You have, well, I feel like you've like come on like it's, oh, you did the classic game a few weeks ago.
107000	108000	Yeah.
108000	109000	She, she like wasn't even able to do the Skype thing.
109000	110000	Yeah, I did freelancer.
110000	111000	Yeah, okay.
111000	112000	But just in general.
112000	113000	Just in general.
113000	116000	You haven't, you haven't been on the show in a little bit, but we're happy to have you here tonight.
116000	117000	Yes.
117000	118000	This is great.
118000	123000	So, um, for those that are listening on the podcast feed, I'm trying to change some things around on Twitch a little bit.
123000	127000	You're probably actually wondering on Twitch, why can't you see Dark Sakura?
127000	128000	Reasons?
128000	137000	She's staying hidden tonight just because she wants to for one, but the other is actually also because we haven't been able to correctly configure our studio to get the shot that we want.
137000	142000	We do know the shot we're going to get that has Dark Sakura's kind of like Dr. Claw element in there.
142000	144000	And I think on Twitch, she's going to show you her hand.
144000	147000	She's got, she can, she can do a little bit of that.
147000	153000	Uh, but anyway, so just due to like the configuration, I wasn't able to get it work for Dark Sakura to be on camera tonight.
153000	155000	And this part kind of affects the podcast as well.
155000	165000	If you notice that the sound sounds a little different tonight, that's because the podcast audio is now going to match directly the Twitch audio.
165000	169000	It actually wasn't before there was stuff I was having to go back and splice in and some of that stuff.
169000	171000	But now it's actually going to line up a hundred percent.
171000	177000	That's going to allow us to do our calls tonight on Discord because we're actually getting rid of Skype, which is another big change.
177000	180000	There's a lot of crazy stuff going on on OLR tonight.
180000	182000	No Loki, Alan's here instead.
182000	184000	Jamie's actually in the studio.
184000	185000	We're switching to Discord.
185000	188000	Cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria.
188000	193000	And if I get the schedule I want at work, I will be back permanently in March.
193000	194000	Yeah, good.
194000	195000	I'm so happy to hear that.
195000	196000	So happy to hear that.
196000	205000	And in chat over our Twitch TV, because we do tape live at Twitch TV every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
205000	210000	And of course our Twitch channel is VOG Network and you can watch us for free on Sunday nights.
210000	214000	You can watch us on demand with a subscription to our channel at Twitch TV.
214000	220000	And you can always listen for free on our podcast feed available in most any podcatcher like iTunes or Google Play.
221000	226000	Nifty805 in our Twitch chat room says, God is a woman, voiced by DarkSakura.
226000	227000	There you go.
227000	228000	No shit.
228000	231000	She is the VOG tonight, the voice of Goddess.
231000	232000	Yes.
232000	233000	There it is. Awesome.
233000	237000	And yeah, Spyro says the audio sounds better quality tonight too.
237000	239000	I think not having the split is helping with that.
239000	242000	And I did some rebalancing of things, so hopefully that's all good.
242000	247000	And I don't know if it's coming through, but the video on my side now looks the way I've wanted it to.
247000	250000	It's been a little bit blurry ever since we made the move to Twitch.
250000	253000	And I think tonight is the first time it's like nice and sharp.
253000	257000	So Alan's sharp, I'm sharp, and it's not quite as washed.
257000	259000	It kind of had like a washed out look to it.
259000	261000	So it's very exciting.
261000	262000	Yeah.
262000	264000	And SG100Matt confirming in our chat that everything does look good.
264000	265000	Great.
265000	266000	I'm very happy to hear.
266000	267000	I look especially good.
267000	268000	Yes, DarkSakura looks especially good.
268000	271000	Maybe at the end of the show, she'll let us turn the camera around, but no promises.
272000	283000	There might be a surprise extra guest host in that because I'm here, Mr. Smush, who is always attached to me like glue, may, oh, he just, he heard his name.
283000	284000	He heard his name.
284000	285000	He heard his name and he meowed.
285000	288000	He may decide that he wants to be with me and be in my lap.
288000	289000	So that will be a treat.
289000	290000	Yes.
290000	291000	But we cannot.
291000	293000	He's a cat, so we make no guarantees.
293000	297000	We have to ignore him and he will insert himself into the situation.
297000	300000	If we try to make him come here, it will never happen.
300000	301000	All right.
301000	302000	So anyway.
302000	303000	He's already making his presence known.
303000	304000	He is.
304000	305000	He's starting to meow.
305000	306000	He probably wants food or something.
306000	308000	So anyway, thanks again, you guys, for being here live tonight.
308000	310000	And it's great.
310000	312000	We're going to jump right into our kickoff topic tonight.
312000	316000	So our kickoff topic tonight is to kind of pick up where we left off last week.
316000	321000	So last week we talked about some 2019 gaming predictions.
321000	322000	So we filled up our time capsule.
322000	326000	We actually took out 2018 and we read through them and had a good laugh.
326000	329000	And now we're getting into our 2019 gaming predictions.
329000	334000	But since Dark Sakura wasn't here last week, I mean, she joined us through Radio Magic and that whole thing.
334000	339000	But since she wasn't here last week, she was unable to contribute to the time capsule.
339000	345000	So I wanted to ask Dark Sakura tonight about some of her gaming predictions for 2019.
345000	349000	So Dark Sakura, please, I know you've written some things out before the show.
349000	351000	Will you tell us, did you end up with three or four?
351000	352000	Four.
352000	353000	Four.
353000	354000	Okay.
354000	356000	Would you give us one of your 2019 predictions, please?
356000	357000	I'll read all of them.
357000	359000	Well, just give us one to start because we have to.
359000	360000	We have to.
360000	361000	Yeah.
361000	363000	Still no Half-Life 3?
363000	366000	Talk about a safe prediction.
366000	367000	Well, OK.
367000	370000	Alan, you're a big Half-Life fan, right?
370000	373000	I guess you used to be.
373000	374000	Yeah.
374000	380000	OK, so tell us tell us about this like Half-Life saga going on, because I understand like they hired one of the old writers and Mark.
380000	381000	Is it is it going to happen or not?
381000	382000	Oh, no.
382000	384000	We're never getting Half-Life 3 ever.
384000	392000	Mark Laidlaw, I think, was his contract ended with Valve because it's a new year.
392000	393000	I have no concept of time.
393000	395000	2016, 2017.
395000	398000	So he's no longer employed with Valve.
398000	410000	And then last year or the year before, the nondisclosure agreement for the script that he wrote for Half-Life 2 Episode 3 expired because that's how long it's been.
410000	411000	So he just leaked the script.
411000	417000	He just did like a fine replace on Gordon Freeman and Alex Vance to like some other generic names and said, hey, I'm going to put this on my blog.
417000	427000	And people realized, oh, this is this is Episode 3 that he legally can share now because that's how invested in the franchise Gabe Newell is.
427000	432000	So one of the co-writers from Half-Life 2 was brought back on to Valve.
432000	438000	And my prediction is that there were news stories about that writer.
438000	439000	It doesn't mean anything.
439000	441000	We won't hear about him ever again.
441000	442000	He gets a paycheck from Valve.
442000	443000	Doing what?
443000	444000	We won't know.
444000	445000	It'll never happen.
445000	448000	Well, now Tiger Claw in chat over at Twitch TV says maybe no Half-Life 3.
448000	450000	But what if we got Portal 3?
450000	453000	I mean, is Valve ever going to put out a game with a 3 in it?
453000	454000	No.
454000	455000	No, they're done.
455000	456000	They're off to VR.
456000	457000	Dota.
457000	458000	Dota is the new.
458000	460000	There might be a Dota 3.
460000	461000	OK. All right.
461000	462000	Interesting.
462000	463000	OK. All right.
463000	464000	Well, thank you, Dark Sakura.
464000	466000	Let us have a little sidebar on Half-Life.
466000	469000	So what is your next prediction?
469000	474000	Nintendo freaks out and goes back to friend codes for all the things.
474000	478000	Nintendo has another freak out and goes back to friend codes for all the things.
478000	480000	It's not completely unreasonable.
480000	482000	Like, you might think she's being very tongue in cheek, and I think she is.
482000	483000	No.
483000	486000	But we've seen Nintendo freak out before, right?
486000	489000	Nintendo did a freak out with the chat app on 3.
489000	490000	I can't even remember the name.
490000	491000	PictoChat.
491000	492000	PictoChat.
492000	493000	They've erased it from my memory.
493000	494000	No, PictoChat was the live chat.
494000	496000	What was the one where you email each other?
496000	497000	Oh, well, no.
497000	500000	Because PictoChat was the live chat room, and then there was the one where you sent each other little...
500000	501000	It was PinoChat.
501000	502000	SwapNote.
502000	503000	SwapNote.
503000	504000	Thank you, Bobby.
504000	505000	They were all PinoChat.
505000	506000	SwapNote.
506000	511000	And remember, like, because somebody sent a picture of a penis, the whole thing was done for.
511000	513000	So that's it.
513000	514000	All right.
514000	516000	So that's Dark Sakura's number two prediction.
516000	517000	How about your number three prediction?
517000	521000	Amazon's new streaming game service will not overcome Steam or the console market.
521000	525000	Okay, so Amazon's going to do the new stream gaming, but it's not going to be enough.
525000	526000	I don't think it's going to be enough.
526000	527000	Okay.
527000	532000	Do you think maybe Amazon might launch their streaming thing into, like, build it into the PlayStation 4,
532000	533000	build it into what's existing?
533000	534000	No.
534000	535000	Not too stubborn.
535000	536000	No, it's going to be all the Prime stuff.
536000	539000	And because they own Twitch as well, they're going to try to push it through Twitch.
539000	540000	Mm-hmm.
540000	541000	Makes sense.
541000	545000	But no, it's going to be Prime poop.
545000	546000	I don't know.
546000	547000	All right.
547000	550000	And lastly, but not leastly, your number four prediction, Dark Sakura.
550000	556000	OLR may earn enough money for bus tickets to Penny Arcade Expo.
556000	559000	Finally, after 15, 16 years.
559000	561000	Oh, God, no, this is year 17, actually.
561000	562000	We started in 2002.
562000	563000	This is year 17.
563000	566000	I'm at that point where I'm low balling our age.
566000	572000	Here in the 17th year of OLR, we may earn enough money to get a bus ticket to go to PAX.
572000	574000	Why would we want to go to PAX?
574000	575000	We went once.
575000	576000	It was pretty fun.
576000	577000	We had a good time.
577000	578000	You know what, Dark Sakura?
578000	580000	Will Wheaton signed my first model iPhone.
580000	583000	Anything is more fun when we're there.
583000	586000	Well, when I'm there.
586000	588000	So what happened to the other predictions?
588000	590000	Because I never got to look at what was in the old can.
590000	593000	Sadly, we tossed them last week.
593000	594000	I'm sorry.
594000	595000	Really?
595000	596000	After I wanted to see it?
596000	598000	I guess you have to listen to the show.
598000	599000	Put this shit in the can.
599000	601000	You have to actually listen to the show, Dark Sakura.
601000	602000	Here you go.
602000	604000	I don't listen to the show.
604000	605000	This is a dumb show.
605000	607000	Who would listen to this shit?
607000	609000	Anyway, I don't know.
609000	611000	Alan, do you have any predictions?
611000	614000	I know I didn't have you write them down, but if you do make an official prediction,
614000	616000	please make sure you note it and put it in the thing.
616000	619000	That writer that was talked about for Valve, it doesn't mean anything.
619000	621000	Nothing will ever happen with it.
621000	628000	Anthem is going to flop so bad, it may bring into question whether or not Dragon Age 4 gets made.
630000	632000	That's severe.
632000	635000	Because they know Dragon Age is the cash cow.
635000	636000	Yeah.
636000	640000	I do think Dragon Age 4 will still happen, but it might be like,
640000	642000	is there going to be a Bioware after Dragon Age 4?
642000	649000	I will cackle loud squawking laughs when Anthem flops.
649000	651000	I will be like a witch.
651000	652000	I will be there with you.
652000	653000	Here's the thing, guys.
653000	658000	I'm torn, though, because there are many people who have nothing to do with why we're pissed at EA
658000	661000	and why we're pissed at Bioware that work on this game, and so for them, I feel bad.
662000	664000	But at least my hope is what tends to...
664000	671000	I mean, a lot of what we're seeing come out of these big developers oftentimes is more like smaller indie studios.
671000	673000	Like, for example, we had the...
673000	676000	I think it was on the show that got cut off because of the power outage and the storm,
676000	681000	but we were going to talk about the guys that worked on Hearthstone were about to make their own game with their own studio,
681000	684000	and they just got the Marvel license, and that was a pretty big deal.
684000	692000	So I will go along with your cackling, but only for the management and for the other employees.
692000	696000	I hope they are able to bond together, unionize, and make the game that they want to make.
696000	701000	So I will wish for the negativity, but with a positive shell to that.
702000	705000	Frodo Swagons has a question.
705000	707000	Is there a way I can just get the audio?
707000	709000	Yes. In Twitch, click the little gear.
709000	712000	Touch the little gear, and you can find the options there.
713000	716000	Makes it great if you're trying to listen in the car. Please don't watch in the car.
716000	720000	SSJ100Matt anthem is enemy number one in the eyes of Mass Effect fans.
720000	722000	That is largely true.
722000	730000	However, it is such a departure of why Bioware fans of yesteryear played any Bioware game,
730000	735000	in that you are a solo protagonist, you don't have a party, so there's no banter amongst the party members.
737000	740000	I believe that's true, and there's no romances of any type.
740000	747000	So even if it was like, we're going to throw Mass Effect under the bus to bring you this new cast of ragtag misfits,
747000	753000	I would still be into that if for the romance options, for the interpersonal relationships, for all of the recorded dialogue,
753000	755000	and Anthem isn't offering any of that.
755000	757000	Anthem's just trying to be a Destiny knockoff.
757000	764000	Yeah, so that's why I'm kind of like, it's such a departure of the Bioware formula, which we all fell in love with.
764000	769000	It's less bitterness over we didn't get our Andromeda DLC, because Andromeda wasn't really very good.
770000	772000	I'm still bitter about the DLC.
772000	773000	DLC or not.
773000	775000	I wanted all the Quarian stuff.
775000	782000	Well yeah, I did too, but it's such a departure of what Bioware used to be that I want to see it fail for that reason,
782000	785000	more than a personal affront to my Mass Effect fandom.
785000	787000	Anthem is New Coke.
787000	789000	Anthem is New Coke.
789000	791000	Or Crystal Pepsi.
791000	793000	Okay, but I liked Crystal Pepsi.
793000	795000	That's true. Okay, they're New Coke.
795000	798000	Although when I went back and drank, I liked Crystal Pepsi when I was a kid.
798000	802000	And they did that redo, or the whole like, everything 90s is cool again.
802000	807000	Like two years ago, whenever they brought back Crystal Pepsi, I had it, and I was like, this is like liquid sugar.
807000	811000	They should have brought back Josta. Pepsi should have brought back Josta.
811000	813000	And Surge.
813000	815000	Surge is back on, you can buy Surge on Amazon.
815000	818000	And Coke needs to put out Beverly in the US.
818000	820000	Anyway.
820000	821000	They need to bring back Coke Black for me.
821000	823000	Alright, moving on, moving on.
823000	826000	My last prediction.
826000	830000	After, I'm going to mispronounce the name just because I don't have it in front of me.
830000	834000	Sekiro, the new From Software Dark Souls-esque feudal Japan game.
834000	835000	Oh, right, yeah.
835000	842000	Once that is out, they are going to announce Bloodborne 2, because Sony is writing that check for that exclusive game.
842000	848000	Whether From Software wants to make it or not, they're like, oh, just like Bayonetta 3, well the check came in, so we're making it.
849000	853000	It's going to be announced, it's not going to be out, but I think that is a safe bet.
853000	857000	I think that's a very safe prediction, but it's still a good one.
857000	864000	They need to put out the current blue chip title, which is Sekiro, before they announce it.
864000	866000	But yeah.
866000	870000	Alright, good predictions. Be sure to write them down and put them in there so we actually get to look at them in 2019, okay?
870000	872000	Okay. 2020.
872000	879000	Or, yeah. Well, I would say I'm still writing 2018 on all my checks, but who writes checks anymore?
879000	883000	Oh, we do for the rent. That's like the one thing. We've still got a landlord who lives in the 80s.
883000	885000	We pay our gardener.
885000	886000	Oh, there you go.
886000	887000	With a check.
887000	889000	I think like one other bill.
889000	900000	It's so, I don't know if you've started doing this, but like now it's all about things like, you know, I don't want to endorse one or the other, but it's things like Apple Pay, Venmo.
900000	903000	I think there's a cash, just one called cash.
903000	904000	Cash app.
904000	915000	The largest amount I've ever Apple paid somebody was like $460 to get extra ramps and two of the chests.
915000	918000	I actually have three chests for my theater magic.
918000	928000	I did, okay, so when I was at Final Fantasy Fan Fest, I sent $100 to one of my friends because he had a ton of money and cash on him because he knew he was going on the trip.
928000	931000	And I didn't want to go to an ATM, but I wanted to play the slot machines.
931000	934000	So I did, I sent my friend $100. He was like, here you go.
934000	937000	And I was like, yay, no ATM fees.
937000	938000	So that worked out.
938000	941000	But it's, I mean, that stuff is really big now.
941000	946000	Like, I don't know about you guys, but like when I go out to eat and I swear this is not a commercial.
946000	949000	I know there's so many podcasts that endorse one of these particular apps.
949000	950000	That's why I'm being very vague.
950000	951000	There's a bunch out there.
951000	958000	But like now, like when you go out to eat and dinner and stuff, like it's, it's one of those apps all the time to like split the check or it's just, okay, I'll put it on my card.
958000	962000	Everybody send me on, you know, Venmo or Apple pay or whatever you guys are using.
962000	963000	So kind of interesting.
963000	964000	Anyway.
965000	966000	Also, if I may make a quick shout out.
966000	967000	Yeah.
967000	972000	I'm sorry, I forgot your name, but to the dude who is at Cliffs Variety that we started talking about, Pinball.
972000	973000	Hi.
974000	976000	If that person is even watching.
976000	988000	No, I, if he's, if he's listening or watching, but, um, it's nice finding more and more pinball fans out there to the point that maybe we should have ourselves a pinball segment.
988000	989000	Wink, wink.
989000	990000	Or a pinball show.
990000	991000	Take that on.
992000	993000	Okay.
993000	997000	Who wants to be my cohost on, uh, on pinball hour?
997000	998000	Pinball hour.
998000	1000000	We're looking, we're looking for more video content.
1000000	1001000	We'll just call it the pincade.
1001000	1003000	We're looking, you should recruit your hubby.
1003000	1004000	I think would be a good one for that.
1004000	1007000	He's been on, actually, he's been on some pinball podcasts.
1007000	1008000	There you go.
1008000	1013000	And there's actually, I don't know if you watch Twitch, but there's Twitch pinball stuff and it's kind of funny because.
1013000	1015000	He watches the Bro Do You Even pinball?
1015000	1018000	Most things are widescreen on Twitch, right?
1018000	1021000	So like, you know, you see interesting things with the layout.
1021000	1024000	Like for us, you have like the stories coming up on the side and the bar at the bottom and all that stuff.
1024000	1029000	But like with pinball, since pinball is very narrow, it's like one small part of the screen and then you, you see the person playing it.
1029000	1030000	You see the board.
1030000	1031000	I watch many of them.
1031000	1033000	But it's, yeah, it looks, it looks neat.
1033000	1036000	But the big one he watches is the Bro Do You Even pinball?
1036000	1038000	And then he watches some of the tourneys.
1038000	1039000	OK.
1039000	1040000	So.
1040000	1041000	Shout out.
1041000	1042000	All right.
1042000	1045000	And lots of lots of positive buzz for the pinball hour in our chat room.
1045000	1049000	KArts1 says it's been far too long since the Dan OLR appearance.
1049000	1050000	So there you go.
1050000	1055000	I asked Mr. Husband tonight, you want to come be on the show?
1055000	1056000	Will's coming over.
1056000	1058000	We're going to play demolition man.
1058000	1059000	We just got a demolition man.
1059000	1060000	OK.
1060000	1061000	So, so this show got bounced.
1061000	1064000	This show got declined in favor of demolition man.
1064000	1070000	However, I did get to hug one, too, who is the cutest people ever.
1070000	1071000	Let's see.
1071000	1075000	Also at the San Francisco March yesterday, because I was marching at the Women's March.
1075000	1078000	I will endorse that one because they are very nice to Jewish people.
1078000	1082000	And like the DC one where the woman is anti-Semitic as fuck.
1082000	1090000	But I got to pet an iguana and a it's like in the parrot family.
1090000	1093000	But I got to hold a bird and feed it an almond.
1093000	1101000	And you randomly saw a gamer Jamie Lee Curtis there, which I thought I saw Jamie Lee Curtis outside the Castro theater while I was still in full face.
1101000	1102000	Awesome.
1102000	1103000	Yeah.
1103000	1105000	I love Jamie.
1105000	1106000	The reason why so pretty.
1106000	1109000	Jamie Lee Curtis is relevant to OLR because she's like a gamer.
1109000	1110000	She goes to Evo.
1110000	1111000	I want to grow up to be her.
1111000	1114000	She goes in cosplay, head to toe cosplay.
1114000	1115000	So she's unrecognizable.
1115000	1119000	And I think it's a really cute story because I think correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was her son that got her into it.
1119000	1123000	And she kind of became a gamer because she wanted like that with her son, which I think is awesome.
1123000	1127000	And she's like one of the only people in Hollywood that's like still married to the same Christopher guest.
1127000	1128000	Yeah.
1128000	1129000	Which is, you know, great.
1129000	1132000	So like my point is Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect.
1132000	1135000	I want to grow up and be her because I already have her name.
1135000	1136000	Right.
1136000	1137000	That should have been your stage name.
1137000	1138000	Jamie Curtis Lee.
1138000	1140000	No, because I would.
1140000	1142000	You know why I picked Jamie Summers.
1142000	1143000	Right.
1143000	1144000	I do.
1144000	1145000	If the listeners don't know.
1145000	1146000	OK.
1146000	1147000	So the bionic woman.
1147000	1148000	I was named after the bionic woman.
1148000	1151000	Yes, I am that old.
1151000	1155000	The character is spelled J.A.I.M.E.S.O.M.M.
1155000	1156000	Wait.
1156000	1159000	J.A.I.M.E.S.O.M.M.E.R.S.
1159000	1161000	So I picked Jamie J.A.M.I.U., which is how I spell my name.
1161000	1163000	S.U.M.M.E.R.S.
1163000	1165000	Not realizing that was already porn stars name, of course.
1165000	1166000	Whoops.
1166000	1167000	And apparently.
1167000	1168000	That's all right.
1168000	1171000	There's a Rob Roberts that like makes guns.
1171000	1177000	If you if you search on YouTube, not that I'm endorsing this guy's channel, but there's like a gunsmith or something.
1177000	1178000	That goes by Rob Roberts.
1178000	1180000	And his parents really did name him that.
1180000	1183000	And that's why he's angry and he sells guns.
1183000	1184000	And that's yours is chosen.
1184000	1190000	There's there's a rugby guy because there's if you go to Wikipedia for Rob Roberts, I'm not notable enough to be on Wikipedia,
1190000	1193000	despite that I'm the co-producer and co-host of the longest running podcast.
1193000	1195000	But we won't go there.
1195000	1198000	There's a rugby guy that's named Rob Roberts.
1198000	1199000	Rugby's cool.
1199000	1200000	I'm all right with that.
1200000	1201000	Oh, well, she's 50.
1201000	1206000	And she really is like one of those classic bombshell type of porn star looking ones.
1206000	1207000	Good for her.
1207000	1210000	And she also is in a video with Jeff Stryker.
1210000	1211000	All right.
1211000	1213000	This has gone way past gaming predictions.
1213000	1219000	So I think it's time to advance to the next segment, which is a little more appropriate for these conversations we're having, which is how is your gaming week?
1219000	1222000	So Dark Sakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?
1222000	1224000	Well, this week was actually a super busy week.
1224000	1226000	I had bronchitis last week.
1226000	1228000	Well, the past week before.
1228000	1232000	And so if you hear me hacking, I have the leftovers.
1232000	1239000	So really, it was just all watching awesome games done quick and then me and Dan rewatching the streams.
1239000	1241000	But I've mostly played pinball.
1241000	1247000	I've been playing theater magic because I freaking love that game and ours is pristine.
1247000	1250000	Dan should be supposed to be working in my World Cup soccer.
1250000	1257000	But I found the reason I like theater magic so much and World Cup soccer is apparently I just like games designed by John Poppadook.
1257000	1261000	So go fig.
1261000	1264000	There's also and I've been trying I didn't put it up in the show,
1264000	1271000	but something interesting is that Steve Ritchie may be getting to work on his dream game, which might be Black Knight 3000.
1271000	1273000	Oh, cool. Give me your money.
1273000	1286000	Yeah. But, you know, it's just been, you know, mostly even playing Pokemon Go and playing, you know, idol pouring and this would block puzzle game because, you know, I like spatial puzzles.
1286000	1287000	Sure.
1287000	1292000	I've just been trying to keep my mind going because I'm losing it so much.
1292000	1295000	You should look at the game that Bobby had on his show tonight.
1295000	1297000	That looked pretty cool. And that was like a spatial puzzle kind of game.
1297000	1301000	So, yeah. Cool.
1301000	1310000	Oh, and I'm actually going to be I want to play it on the old SNES because I want to do a Jamie Cheats at games.
1310000	1315000	Just like put in the game genie and like do Final Fantasy six with the speed shoes on all the time.
1315000	1322000	You know, just just because I love, you know, after I've beaten games 57 million times, sometimes I just want to play through for the story.
1322000	1327000	So I was thinking about doing like a Jamie Cheats and just do me cheating at games.
1327000	1334000	Well, you know, have you I don't know if you've looked a lot at the Switch online library of NES classics on if you played around with that.
1334000	1342000	Something they've been doing is that every month they've been adding, you know, two or three new games, but they also have been adding one or two SP games.
1342000	1345000	And what's really interesting about the SP games is they're based on all they are. They're just save states.
1345000	1349000	They're like official Nintendo sanctioned save states. But in the beginning, they were really cool.
1349000	1357000	Like there was a Zelda one where you start Zelda, but you have two hundred and fifty rupees and you have every item that you can buy from a merchant.
1357000	1365000	Like somebody ran around the game. So like if you just want to power through Zelda without worrying about a bunch of that bull, you just you can use that Zelda SP.
1365000	1368000	And then they did like a Gradius that's starting on the last level.
1368000	1375000	Well, they just put out this last month that they put out a I think it was Ninja Gaiden starting at the very last boss fight.
1375000	1381000	So you can see that but with full life that what nobody probably ever saw the actual endings.
1381000	1389000	Yeah. And then what was the other one? A ghouls and ghosts or ghosts and goblins on the second play through or on the last boss with the with the key.
1389000	1397000	They started on level six with key. I don't remember because remember you have to get the item and carry it through the last level to the game officially.
1397000	1406000	I'm a girl. I can barely beat level one. Barely. So and I think I did it on a Commodore 64 when I was seven and not in my 30s or 40s.
1406000	1413000	So it's not. But anyway, my point is those SP titles are kind of a way to like, oh, get that little oomph.
1413000	1419000	It's almost like fingers crossed that they do end up supporting Super Nintendo games someday.
1419000	1425000	Maybe we would see something like that, like a Final Fantasy with certain things already on your account.
1425000	1430000	I want to know who would be interested to see me cheat. No. Just tell me if you want me to cheat.
1430000	1436000	Cheat through life. All right. Hey, what was it?
1436000	1441000	And I'm thinking of Eddie Guerrero in wrestling because he used to always cheat to win.
1441000	1445000	But I don't know. I think it's the only one I ever hear about is Sami Zayn.
1445000	1450000	I don't know why, but that's the only thing I ever hear about. It's fun to just, you know, just play for fun.
1450000	1455000	You know, the challenge is great, but I've already done it 50 million times. I have nothing to prove.
1455000	1460000	Whatever. Fair enough. I get good when you can cheat.
1460000	1464000	Let's go over to Alan. Alan, how was your gaming week? What kind of games you've been up to lately?
1464000	1471000	I haven't been playing a lot of games because the cat will not let me.
1471000	1478000	This is so true. So he used to just be fine in my lap when I played.
1478000	1482000	But now, not only does he want to be on my desk, because I have a big enough desk for two monitors.
1482000	1487000	If he plops himself down to the right of my keyboard, I can reach over and pet him. Everything is fine.
1487000	1496000	But he specifically likes to be across the keyboard, literally, like, on top of.
1496000	1500000	And you can't really play, or he'll attack my hand as I move the mouse.
1500000	1507000	So there's a point where I'm just like, I'm not playing Overwatch right now. I'm just going to get up or do whatever.
1507000	1511000	So yeah, it's endearing, but also annoying.
1511000	1515000	ActDeftInChat says, and that's a problem how? Mr. Smoosh deserves all the attention.
1515000	1520000	When I'm in the middle of a ranked match in Overwatch and he decides to do it,
1520000	1526000	it is unfortunate for the people I'm playing with because I'm not entirely focused on the game.
1526000	1536000	But he's also saving me from Overwatch because this particular season of ranked mode Overwatch has been terrible.
1536000	1542000	And I should be playing it because every time I play it I get upset because the rounds and matches go really poorly.
1542000	1545000	So I think he's just looking out for my emotional well-being.
1545000	1551000	He's like, it's time to log off, honey. Put Overwatch down.
1551000	1555000	It's like the meme where it's time to stop posting with the cat paw on the mouse.
1555000	1563000	He's like, you can play healer all you want. Your team's not going to win because you're in the doldrums of the toilet of ranked mode.
1563000	1569000	Give it up. Give it up, sister. I was on a huge Dark Souls kick for a while.
1569000	1576000	I played Dark Souls 2 to death. I think the last time I was on OLR I was playing Dark Souls 2.
1576000	1585000	Pokemon Go, we do raids. We were driving by on our way to do something completely unrelated.
1585000	1590000	We noticed a bunch of cars parked at the end of our street where a Pokemon raid is and we pulled over and we're like,
1590000	1593000	are you guys doing a Pokemon raid? So yeah, that was fun.
1593000	1597000	And they're like, yeah, there's two of you, right? Because they needed two more people to have a full group.
1597000	1604000	Yes. So without giving away where we live, we've told the local people in our part of Sacramento,
1604000	1611000	if there's a Pokemon raid at this park, we just have to put on our shoes. We can walk there.
1611000	1619000	So yeah, Pokemon Go, Dark Souls and Overwatch when the cat will allow me to play, that's really it.
1619000	1621000	All right. Not a whole lot.
1621000	1627000	Going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, VG Realness agreeing with you on Overwatch saying,
1627000	1632000	OMG, tell me about it. It is so bad this season. I know VG Realness has been doing some streaming
1632000	1637000	and go check out the clips at VG Realness' channel because he's got some real interesting people over there.
1637000	1644000	Once you dip below, like bronze is fine, but once you dip below 1300, 1200, there's no coming back.
1644000	1653000	Come back the next season, do your new 10 placement matches. Once you get into the 1100s, you're just hurting yourself.
1653000	1655000	You need to love yourself.
1655000	1660000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says you should also put on pants, not just shoes. That is a good idea.
1660000	1661000	Yeah.
1661000	1663000	Let's see, S2100 Matt says...
1663000	1665000	The jury is still out on that one.
1665000	1669000	Some of the people on ranked Overwatch are a little too intense when I played.
1669000	1672000	I know Allen and the others here are not, but the intense randos are off putting.
1672000	1677000	I don't know. I mean, then again, I don't really play ranked at all, but even in things like World of Warcraft,
1677000	1683000	where I'm running dungeons and people are being shitlords, like I just go K or cool.
1683000	1688000	Like I don't even like I maybe engage them with like one word or even one letter responses and then I just ignore them.
1688000	1694000	Like I know that's a hard thing to do. Sometimes it's easier probably in text, but like I just fuck them.
1694000	1697000	Like I don't have to acknowledge them or anything.
1697000	1704000	In ranked mode, you should, I feel, have a headset, even if you don't want to say anything.
1704000	1709000	Like if you don't want to talk to these people, if they say, hey, do you know how to play this healer?
1709000	1712000	You should be able to grunt like yes or no.
1712000	1715000	I think that's a reasonable expectation to play ranked.
1715000	1722000	But yeah, there are people because I will be like, I'll be the one that says, hey, let's switch it up because we only got a minute left.
1722000	1727000	And this isn't working. It hasn't been working for the past four minutes and no one's really saying anything.
1727000	1733000	So let's switch it up. But yeah, there are people that are like, God, you guys are all terrible.
1733000	1740000	And it's like, we are in bronze. We're all bad. You're bad. We are all in the sewer together.
1740000	1747000	So I mean, just call you the Ninja Turtles and you ain't Master Splinter.
1747000	1751000	When you point a finger at us, there are three fingers pointing at yourself.
1751000	1756000	This is bronze. We have no aspirations of grandeur here.
1756000	1762000	So before you say, God, you're all fucking terrible. You two.
1762000	1767000	We're all in hell. We're all going to die here.
1767000	1772000	So knock off the attitude.
1772000	1774000	You're just getting cheered on in chat.
1774000	1776000	Delvin is like having church right now.
1777000	1781000	Tell them Alan, K Arts 1, drag them.
1781000	1787000	I love it. So, yeah, we're all going to we're all going to die down here in bronze.
1787000	1791000	So, yeah, for ranked mode.
1791000	1796000	Some people are terrified of of like they don't want to interact with the players.
1796000	1801000	I don't think that's good for ranked because the whole point of it is that you're taking the match seriously.
1801000	1808000	But once you're in that low of a level, it's just do what you can with what you got.
1808000	1811000	And that's my gaming week. Go with what you know.
1811000	1814000	All right. My gaming week.
1814000	1819000	I've been playing some Final Fantasy 14 because they unleashed the blue mage in Final Fantasy 14 this week,
1819000	1823000	which was fun for a minute. But then you kind of realize, like, I'm leveling this blue mage.
1823000	1825000	I'm going around and getting all these spells and stuff.
1825000	1830000	And why? Because you can't take it into current content or do anything really like cutting edge with it.
1830000	1835000	So it's kind of it's like this entire little sideshow they built into the game, which was fun for a little bit.
1835000	1839000	But like everybody figured out how to cheese it. Like you could kill.
1839000	1845000	And I maybe was guilty of participating, but basically you can switch to your level 70 character.
1845000	1849000	Go find a level forty nine mob. You can't you can't do it with level fifty.
1849000	1851000	You go find a level forty nine mob, kill it.
1851000	1855000	And right before the XP is rewarded, use your macro to switch to blue mage.
1855000	1858000	And you get all that experience on your blue mage and you level up like fast.
1858000	1863000	So all you really have to do is go hunting for the spells, which is a little bit tedious, but I don't know.
1863000	1866000	I might go back and keep trying it because I hear the Master Carnival is kind of fun,
1866000	1869000	which is like the end game thing for blue mage only.
1869000	1875000	But I just I don't really totally understand Square Enix's and the development teams like stubbornness.
1875000	1880000	And we don't want this to be a full job because it will be too overpowered.
1880000	1883000	You could cast level five death on things.
1883000	1887000	So it's like, OK, then just don't let people use that spell.
1887000	1891000	Like limit the spells they can take with them into raids and things like that. It would not be crazy.
1891000	1896000	Just say there's a magical field that prevents certain spells like it's fucking Final Fantasy.
1896000	1899000	Make it up like a wizard did it. Yeah, a wizard.
1899000	1906000	It's it's a wizard, Harry. Like just it's not hard to just come up with something as why you're doing it a little differently.
1906000	1911000	Like I feel like they're like, we have to implement blue mage just like it was in Final Fantasy five.
1911000	1916000	Never mind that blue mage was a class in Final Fantasy 11 that worked out very well.
1916000	1923000	Actually, there are a ton of jobs in Final Fantasy 11 that 14 is never going to get.
1923000	1928000	And blue mage could have just as easily been one of those like I'm not going back to that game.
1928000	1933000	So I just you know, I I don't hate it as much as some people we know.
1933000	1937000	And I'll give you give you that. But I it's just kind of one of those.
1937000	1943000	It feels like I don't like that. It's like a sideshow. I just wish I mean, it's it's an OK sideshow.
1943000	1947000	It's about as exciting as things like PvP.
1947000	1951000	But you know, I just wish there was a way they could kind of realize it into the full game.
1951000	1957000	And I think it might mix up the meta a little bit. Did Stormblood introduce any new PvP maps like like the big group ones?
1957000	1963000	I think so. I haven't played it a lot, but I think they have their their trying on bless bless their hearts.
1963000	1968000	Bless their heart. I mean, actually, I got to say, I've played some PvP in Final Fantasy 14. It is kind of fun.
1968000	1972000	It is. Well, that is a shame. It isn't as well known as something like World of Warcraft.
1972000	1979000	But it's just it's it's a tough cookie to break into because so many people are playing World of Warcraft and some of those other PvP games.
1979000	1982000	It's hard to just put out a new game and expect it to take fire.
1982000	1985000	But I'm not knocking the PvP scene of Final Fantasy 14.
1985000	1989000	It actually they're they're the players that do it do a good job. And it is it is.
1989000	1993000	I like that they it's a very different type of game than the rest of the base game.
1993000	1996000	But anyway, that's enough about Final Fantasy 14.
1996000	1999000	Other games I've been playing this week include World of Warcraft.
1999000	2003000	Ironically, still working on leveling my shaman in that game.
2003000	2006000	I'm going to start playing it again. Yeah. I'm waiting for Delvin to come back.
2006000	2010000	I think they're opening the next raid next week, so I think he'll finally be back.
2010000	2015000	I'm starting to wonder if I have out geared Delvin who's been raiding because ever since the last patch,
2015000	2019000	they're handing out like I level 370 and 375 gear like cookies.
2019000	2022000	So I wonder if maybe I pass Delvin. He just doesn't know it yet.
2022000	2027000	So I'd be really funny because he was helping me try to level and then kind of took a break to go play Overwatch and all that stuff.
2027000	2032000	So that'd be fun. And then let's see what else Pokemon go as well.
2032000	2038000	Something you didn't bring up that I want to is that event that they had over the weekend for the Phoebus.
2038000	2041000	That was so bad. Like the event wasn't a normal community day.
2041000	2043000	It was just for three hours.
2043000	2047000	All Pokestop quest rewards are going to let you catch Phoebus and you might be able to get a shiny.
2047000	2051000	And it's like the quests were ridiculous. Like it should have been.
2051000	2056000	If they made it if they made it a week long, I would feel a lot differently about it.
2056000	2058000	Yeah. It needs or at least even just a full day.
2058000	2061000	A full day would have been a lot easier to stomach than just three hours.
2061000	2067000	Like they tried to make a second community day and I don't want to community days and Pokemon go a month.
2067000	2069000	Like just have one.
2069000	2073000	And if you want to do the Phoebus thing is like a special event that goes for a day or two.
2073000	2075000	Because they've done like two day events before.
2075000	2079000	They did the Farfetch'd was out here in the US for a couple of days.
2079000	2083000	The love disc being shiny or whatever like that big. It was only a couple of days.
2083000	2087000	So anyway, I just that was a trash event.
2087000	2090000	It flopped and I hope they don't try something like that again.
2090000	2092000	I mean, I was OK with the event itself.
2092000	2097000	And if they want to make the quest like catch 15 Pokemon to finish the quest, then just give more time.
2097000	2100000	You know, I mean, like, yeah, people do it for longer. That's all.
2100000	2106000	So and some folks in chat act deaf saying, yeah, a weekend would have worked perfectly.
2106000	2108000	It was frustrating to say the least.
2108000	2113000	As you and Matt says, I mean, the Pokemon requires you to walk 20 K in order to evolve.
2113000	2115000	It just wasn't worth it. Yeah.
2115000	2118000	I mean, technically, you would want after this.
2118000	2121000	You would want two shinies because you want to keep the baby and then you want to evolve one.
2121000	2125000	And I actually already have 100 percent Phoebus, which is now a melodic.
2125000	2129000	Yeah, I got that in an egg some time ago. So it's like a year ago.
2129000	2134000	I'm not as big on the shinies. I mean, they're cool, but like I'm not Shane about it.
2134000	2136000	They're cool. I like the few shinies I have.
2136000	2142000	But I like the 100 percent stuff more than I get really excited when I get a 95 percent of the shinies I have are.
2142000	2144000	I have because of community days.
2144000	2147000	I do not have the luck of catching.
2147000	2154000	I remember once we were in Safeway and you got a shiny yellow Geodude and you like gay gasp.
2154000	2156000	Well, because Geodudes do look cool.
2156000	2159000	You know, they do. But I just finding a random one in the wild. Yeah.
2159000	2161000	I have the worst luck. Yeah.
2161000	2164000	So anyway. Yeah, I like finding them in the wild there.
2164000	2167000	They're pleasant little gifts. Like, I'm not going to be like, I don't care about shinies.
2167000	2171000	Like, they're cool. But at the same time, like, oh, darn, I missed the Phoebus shiny.
2171000	2172000	I'm not going to lose sleep.
2172000	2176000	I caught like 20 Wilmer's today. Not a single one was purple. I want a purple Wilmer.
2176000	2180000	I think I hatched a purple one. Aren't they pink? I thought they were pink.
2180000	2182000	They're purple. They're purple. All right. Whatever.
2182000	2184000	I believe you guys. Geez, Rob. Sorry.
2184000	2187000	Anyway, that was it really for my gaming week.
2187000	2190000	Next week, I still need to play New Super Mario Brothers U.
2190000	2193000	I keep me needing to do a stream and I've just been preoccupied with other things.
2193000	2201000	But also, if I'm not crazy, isn't this the week where like Kingdom Hearts 3 is like actually happening, right?
2202000	2204000	Is that this week or is that next week?
2204000	2210000	It's the 20th Tuesday of not this upcoming week, but the next week.
2210000	2211000	Oh, OK. So it is next week.
2211000	2212000	29th. 29th.
2212000	2217000	But I'm still like, well, I mean, the Utada Hikaru song is out with Skiller X.
2217000	2218000	Yeah.
2218000	2220000	That hit Spotify and Apple Music and all that stuff this week.
2220000	2222000	And like, I need to listen to the Japanese one first.
2222000	2228000	It's weird to think. I like the song, but I don't like the part where the Skrillex stuff is turned up to 11.
2228000	2233000	Because like, you know, the part where she's singing like, let me face, let me face, I don't want to get muted.
2233000	2234000	So I guess the whole thing.
2234000	2237000	But like, you know, the little song and then like even with the drum and bass, I'm fine.
2237000	2243000	But then when it goes like it's just like slow down, like stop.
2243000	2246000	That's just too, too much.
2246000	2251000	Which is funny because there actually is a Skrillex song that I like all because of Deadpool.
2251000	2254000	I have discovered that actually like Bangarang.
2254000	2256000	That's the whole scene was hilarious.
2256000	2261000	And it was in Cactus Canyon Continued where they did the Cowboys versus Aliens thing.
2261000	2265000	I really like the Celine Dion song that was in Deadpool.
2265000	2269000	So I just think it's great that he got Celine Dion to.
2269000	2271000	She plays that in her Vegas show.
2271000	2272000	Oh, really?
2272000	2277000	Yeah, it's actually as far as like Celine Dion power ballads go, like it's a really good power ballad, honestly.
2277000	2279000	So, hey, it is what it is. All right.
2279000	2282000	I was listening to a podcast where someone was like,
2282000	2289000	there's not going to be an episode of this show when Kingdom Hearts three comes out because fuck y'all.
2289000	2295000	And then they were like, Kingdom Hearts two came out when I was still in high school, like 15.
2295000	2298000	And now this person is almost 30. And I was like, oh, my God.
2298000	2302000	Yeah, I was like, didn't Kingdom Hearts two come out like right before we started?
2302000	2304000	Oh, children.
2304000	2307000	Because Kingdom Hearts 2001 and Kingdom Hearts two is 2005.
2307000	2310000	I don't know. No one look it up. Who cares?
2310000	2313000	But yeah, it's been it's been a while. It's been a minute.
2313000	2315000	Anyway, someone in chat, I'm sorry, I missed the name. It scrolled off.
2315000	2318000	Someone in chat asked if I was actually wearing a corgi shirt.
2318000	2320000	And I am. But it's actually like kind of like the memes.
2320000	2322000	I'm trying to show it off on Twitch.
2322000	2325000	We can actually see how the corgi is saying, bork, bork, bork.
2325000	2327000	And I love this shirt.
2327000	2331000	Like, I don't happen to own any dogs. We're more of a cat household.
2331000	2333000	But if we did get a dog, I do want corgis.
2333000	2336000	And I want eight of them on a lease, just like the Queen of England.
2336000	2338000	All of her corgis are dead.
2338000	2340000	What? Why would you say that?
2340000	2343000	No, it's true. She actually stopped breeding her corgis
2343000	2347000	because she doesn't want anyone to raise her dog's puppies.
2347000	2350000	The line of what was her first dog's name?
2350000	2353000	But she didn't want anyone else to raise the puppies from that line.
2353000	2356000	I'm depressed. We're changing the topics.
2356000	2358000	All right.
2358000	2361000	Great. Why don't we talk about depressing, violent things
2361000	2363000	to start off the show tonight?
2363000	2365000	Girl, I'm just all about the facts. You know me.
2365000	2367000	I know. I know. All right.
2367000	2369000	Let's move on. Let's get into some gamey news.
2369000	2373000	All right. Loki. Loki is not here tonight.
2373000	2375000	Alan.
2375000	2377000	Really?
2377000	2379000	Look. Look.
2379000	2381000	Do something.
2381000	2383000	You're our current chaos bringer.
2383000	2386000	Do you see any round table or like five guys in front of me?
2386000	2390000	Do something one way for 17 years and then suddenly try to change it.
2390000	2392000	Yes.
2392000	2395000	All right. Alan, why don't you start us off with some news today?
2395000	2400000	So, the irony is that right before it's my turn to talk about a news story,
2400000	2402000	my tablet apparently has crashed.
2402000	2405000	But luckily, I know this off the top of my head.
2405000	2411000	NetherRealm Studios, who put out in 2017 Injustice 2,
2412000	2418000	they announced what pretty much everyone knew was in the pipeline.
2418000	2420000	Mortal Kombat 11 was announced.
2420000	2425000	They had a big event where they invited a lot of YouTubers and Twitch streamers.
2425000	2428000	Also, SonicFox was there.
2428000	2433000	Our favorite blue furry fighting game champion.
2433000	2435000	Oh, yeah. I love that guy. Yeah.
2435000	2438000	Yeah. So, a lot of the big names from EVO were there.
2438000	2442000	And they announced 11 and they showed,
2442000	2446000	there's I think eight or nine characters official.
2446000	2451000	But if you keep on top of stuff like this on YouTube or on Twitter,
2451000	2453000	you'll see that in the playable demo.
2453000	2457000	Because the people that got invites to actually play the game,
2457000	2462000	they got a copy of the video to put on their channels.
2462000	2464000	I didn't know that you could do that.
2464000	2467000	I thought if you went to a special event where you could play the game,
2467000	2469000	that footage belonged to the company.
2469000	2474000	But a lot of the people that I follow have been putting their time playing 11
2474000	2477000	on their own channels with them playing.
2477000	2482000	The release date is April 23rd.
2482000	2487000	It looks like it still has the...
2487000	2490000	Each character has three different fighting styles.
2490000	2497000	Cassie Cage in Mortal Kombat 10 had Hollywood, Ballistics,
2497000	2498000	or something else.
2498000	2505000	Or Jax's daughter, Jackie, had full auto, shotgun, and tech or something.
2505000	2510000	And that means that she has three special moves that are the same across all three.
2510000	2513000	But then there are three more special moves that you only get
2513000	2517000	depending on which fighting thing that you're in.
2517000	2521000	X-ray attacks have been replaced with things called fatal blows.
2521000	2526000	You can only use one fatal blow per match.
2526000	2530000	So if you use your fatal blow in round one and it's a three-round match,
2530000	2534000	you don't get to use it the other two times.
2534000	2542000	The antagonist is named Kronika, and it's the first new character.
2542000	2548000	It's the first main antagonist that's a woman in all of the Mortal Kombat games.
2548000	2551000	Something to do with time travel, of course.
2551000	2553000	I guess you've had bad girls before.
2553000	2555000	Melina was kind of an antagonist.
2555000	2558000	They've always been a tertiary or the henchman.
2558000	2562000	I didn't even really realize that until it was pointed out.
2562000	2565000	She's the first main end villain. That's cool.
2565000	2568000	Mortal Kombat 9 was really incredible.
2568000	2573000	I remember when the Sony network was down for two or three months,
2573000	2578000	two games came out that you couldn't enjoy them online
2578000	2581000	because of that Sony thing. It was 2007.
2581000	2585000	It was Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat 9, the reboot.
2585000	2589000	Mortal Kombat 9's really awesome thing was the story mode
2589000	2592000	where you get to play the game, but then in between each round
2592000	2596000	you got cut scenes and they sort of dictated which character you played
2596000	2600000	based on the perspective of who was witnessing the story.
2600000	2603000	So they're keeping that in 11.
2605000	2608000	It looks like the story...
2608000	2611000	Because Mortal Kombat 9, sorry I'm jumping all over the place,
2611000	2616000	took the stories of the original Mortal Kombats 1, 2, and 3,
2616000	2620000	cleaned it up and unified it into one big storyline,
2620000	2624000	and also parts of MK4 with Shinnok and did that.
2624000	2630000	MK10 was the storyline from Mortal Kombat 4 and then a new continuity,
2630000	2634000	and I was hoping that Mortal Kombat 11 would have
2634000	2636000	Deadly Alliance or Shaolin Monks,
2636000	2640000	because a lot of the Mortal Kombat sequels for PS2 and 3 were kind of garbage
2640000	2643000	and they had a lot of throwaway characters that weren't memorable at all.
2643000	2648000	I was hoping that they would take the existing canon, as ridiculous as it was,
2648000	2653000	throw out the trash and retell that story,
2653000	2656000	but with better writing for this new game.
2656000	2659000	We hardly know anything about the game,
2659000	2662000	but with this new antagonist, Kronika, and the time travel,
2662000	2666000	it looks like they are doing more of a departure as far as the story.
2666000	2670000	The time travel element, I imagine, lets them bring back a lot of characters
2670000	2673000	that weren't in Mortal Kombat X.
2673000	2676000	We already know that Baraka is back.
2676000	2682000	Scarlet, she's like a blood mage, or like a blood ninja.
2682000	2685000	And you thought she was kind of a throwaway character.
2685000	2689000	She was a really badass, awesome character in Mortal Kombat 9,
2689000	2693000	but she only existed as a DLC character in 9.
2693000	2700000	And to see her back is really great.
2700000	2705000	I think the big three that they need to announce to make all the fanboys happy
2705000	2708000	is Cabal, because Cabal is awesome,
2708000	2711000	Noob Sabat, they've already done Baraka,
2711000	2716000	and Shang Tsung, really, those are the fan favorites that weren't in X
2716000	2718000	that people want to see in XI.
2718000	2720000	So there are eight or nine...
2720000	2723000	When I played Mortal Kombat, I liked Cabal.
2723000	2729000	So for those that don't know, I have historically really loved the Mortal Kombat franchise.
2729000	2735000	I love the old games, they're fun, they're cartoony and gross and funny.
2735000	2740000	But I enjoyed Mortal Kombat 9, kind of, and then Mortal Kombat X,
2740000	2742000	I'm like, this is too much.
2742000	2745000	Some of these fatalities are fucking gross.
2745000	2748000	I just hit the point where I'm like, this is nasty.
2748000	2752000	It was that one you showed me, and you called it when I finally broke,
2752000	2756000	was that Jax fatality where he puts out the cigar in the person's head.
2756000	2761000	He takes the top of their head and basically snaps their jaw back
2761000	2764000	so that their head hinges open like a trash can,
2764000	2768000	and he puts the cigar out on their tongue, and you can see down the esophagus.
2768000	2772000	The problem is, when it was the graphics level of Mortal Kombat 2 and 3,
2772000	2776000	it was a cartoon and it was funny, but it's too real now.
2776000	2780000	So I tuned in to that Mortal Kombat 11 thing.
2780000	2781000	Why wasn't he that real?
2781000	2785000	Because I felt some sense of, oh, I'm a gamer, commentator guy,
2785000	2788000	I should know what's going on, and I do like Mortal Kombat.
2788000	2794000	So I tuned in just in time to see Baraka doing a fatality on Scorpion,
2794000	2796000	where I don't even remember what happened.
2796000	2798000	He stabs him four times, and each time is gross,
2798000	2802000	and then he stabs him, pulls out his brain, and starts eating it,
2802000	2805000	and I was like, done.
2805000	2806000	This is ridiculous.
2806000	2807000	Yeah, the end.
2807000	2809000	Look, I get that it's over the top.
2809000	2812000	I get that some of you are into stupid horror like that,
2812000	2815000	meaning over the top, not like I have friends.
2815000	2817000	I work with the horror film festival here in SAC.
2817000	2819000	I respect your guys' fandom.
2819000	2824000	It is just, for me, I'm just like, I don't, just enough, enough.
2824000	2826000	So that's it.
2826000	2831000	I would like to just play Mortal Kombat without that level of craziness.
2831000	2833000	So I like Injustice.
2833000	2835000	Yeah, I don't mind.
2835000	2836000	Injustice is for me.
2836000	2838000	I don't mind, because when I was a teenager,
2838000	2840000	I would buy Fangoria magazine, and I really like horror,
2840000	2842000	which you wouldn't really know, because I don't,
2842000	2844000	it's not like we go see horror together.
2844000	2848000	My friend made me watch faces of death, and I cried.
2848000	2852000	So I don't mind the detail of the graphics.
2852000	2856000	I just want the deaths to be funny slash creative,
2856000	2860000	and a lot of the really gruesome fatalities in Mortal Kombat 10,
2860000	2862000	they were graphic, but they were also boring.
2862000	2864000	Like, wouldn't it be awesome if we just made someone blow up
2864000	2866000	in their guts hanging from the ceiling?
2866000	2868000	Not really, because that's not interesting.
2868000	2870000	The one that you really liked, that was gross,
2870000	2872000	that you thought was funny, was the Cassie Cage one
2872000	2874000	where she takes a selfie.
2874000	2876000	You liked that one, that was gross.
2876000	2878000	That one was pretty funny.
2878000	2880000	It was funny. It was gross.
2880000	2886000	Yeah, so a lot of people on YouTube have analyzed the footage
2886000	2889000	of what they showed at the special event,
2889000	2892000	and you can see Kano in the background of a stage,
2892000	2894000	so people are like, okay, Kano's not confirmed,
2894000	2896000	but he's probably there.
2896000	2898000	Same thing with Johnny Cage.
2898000	2900000	In some of the menus of the advanced modes,
2900000	2903000	like the time towers or whatever,
2903000	2906000	you can see Rain because it's tilted.
2906000	2910000	It's tinted purple, and the silhouette is what Rain looks like.
2910000	2913000	So even though they've only officially confirmed,
2913000	2915000	I think, eight or nine out of the 25,
2915000	2917000	I think there's going to be 25 core characters,
2917000	2922000	then 60 LC, they said, for a total of 31 or maybe 32.
2922000	2925000	If you're really into the putting on the little eyepiece
2925000	2929000	and analyzing the meta of what footage,
2929000	2932000	you know that there's going to be more characters in there
2932000	2934000	than what they've announced.
2934000	2936000	So I'm looking forward to it.
2936000	2938000	I guess I'll pre-order it to get Shao Kahn,
2938000	2945000	even though he's one of the cheesiest fighting game bosses of all time.
2945000	2947000	Yeah, so that's the thing that happened.
2947000	2949000	Netherrealm Studios, Mortal Kombat 11.
2949000	2951000	But I do think it's funny that, obviously, if you guys didn't already know,
2951000	2953000	Alan and I just celebrated two years of marriage.
2953000	2954000	We've been together for nine,
2954000	2957000	and that I feel this way about Mortal Kombat,
2957000	2960000	but Alan loves it, and I'm like, all right, have fun.
2960000	2962000	Go play it over there where I don't have to watch it.
2962000	2964000	I've literally turned into my mom.
2964000	2968000	Some long-time OLR listeners may remember that clip.
2968000	2972000	Oh, I wish I had it, because I even took video of it, funny enough.
2972000	2973000	It was with Molina.
2973000	2977000	Yeah, and I showed my mom some of the fatalities in Mortal Kombat 9,
2977000	2979000	and I remember her sitting back there going,
2979000	2982000	This is so rad. This is gross.
2982000	2984000	Who does this?
2984000	2987000	And I've turned into that.
2987000	2991000	Through the course of one game, when it came to Mortal Kombat 10,
2991000	2993000	I turned into that.
2993000	2995000	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
2995000	2998000	I'm glad that Mortal Kombat 7 Elis exists.
2998000	3002000	I will not be buying it, but I hope you guys do and enjoy it.
3002000	3003000	Perfectly said. Well said.
3003000	3005000	I hope you have fun, honey.
3005000	3007000	I'll be over here playing Hello Kitty Adventure.
3007000	3010000	Ronda Rousey is the voice actress for Sonya.
3010000	3012000	Why, though?
3012000	3018000	If this had happened for Mortal Kombat 10 when she was an up-and-comer,
3018000	3020000	and sort of like...
3020000	3028000	Before she became people's problematic fave or was canceled, whatever.
3028000	3032000	So, eh, I'm indifferent.
3032000	3034000	She's a UFC fighter.
3034000	3038000	I think her last big match is she kind of got her ass beat more than she won,
3038000	3039000	which is neither here nor there.
3039000	3042000	That's what's happened to athletes in that very dangerous sport.
3042000	3044000	I guess she needs to get a paycheck from somewhere.
3044000	3047000	Yeah, so...
3047000	3048000	Yeah.
3048000	3049000	All right.
3049000	3050000	Next story.
3050000	3051000	All right, we will talk about the next story.
3051000	3054000	Well, if you want to watch people playing Mortal Kombat videos online,
3054000	3056000	you might be doing that on YouTube.
3056000	3059000	And unfortunately, a lot of gaming-related YouTube videos
3059000	3060000	have recently come down.
3060000	3065000	That's because Machinima pulled all their videos this week,
3065000	3066000	like, just overnight.
3066000	3068000	Gone.
3068000	3071000	Apparently, this is because they're going to be merging with Alation,
3071000	3074000	part of OtterMedia, part of AT&T Warner.
3074000	3079000	So you got to go down, like, four parent relationships there of companies,
3079000	3081000	and that's where this is going.
3081000	3085000	Apparently, some folks were not told that this was going to happen.
3085000	3087000	Like, video producers had no idea this was going to happen.
3087000	3090000	But there was a Twitch clip going around where Lawrence Santang
3090000	3093000	from Rooster Teeth tried to get some insight on what was going on.
3093000	3098000	Warner, at this point, cannot verify the copyrights to all videos
3098000	3101000	in Machinima's network, and there are a ton of videos.
3101000	3103000	It costs a lot of money to do it,
3103000	3105000	and this is on videos that aren't getting any views.
3105000	3106000	So they cut it loose.
3106000	3107000	That's that.
3107000	3108000	That's a business.
3108000	3109000	That's how it goes.
3109000	3112000	But, you know, there were a lot of people that partnered up with,
3112000	3114000	worked with Machinima, that just suddenly...
3114000	3117000	Or made content for that channel.
3117000	3120000	Because people were still making content,
3120000	3123000	and some folks were being told they were being dropped from the network,
3123000	3125000	but who knows what's going to happen with Machinima now.
3125000	3129000	But it's one of those big wake-up calls about this day and age that we live in,
3129000	3135000	is that someday the place where all the content is being made may go under
3135000	3137000	or choose to pull all the videos.
3137000	3141000	I mean, I hate to say it, but Twitch would not even be immune to this.
3141000	3143000	This is a great home right now.
3143000	3146000	I'm loving that we've been exposed to new folks.
3146000	3149000	Shout out to any new people that have just discovered OLR
3149000	3151000	because of our move to Twitch recently.
3151000	3152000	Say hi if you're out there.
3152000	3153000	I'd love to hear from you.
3153000	3155000	But if you want to lurk, that's cool too,
3155000	3157000	because I like to lurk on Twitch feeds a lot too.
3157000	3160000	But, you know, Twitch may be gone someday.
3160000	3161000	Who knows?
3161000	3162000	Amazon might sell it.
3162000	3163000	Twitch might, you know...
3163000	3164000	Who knows?
3164000	3165000	It might be gone today.
3165000	3166000	I'm not saying negative.
3166000	3167000	That's just the reality.
3167000	3169000	Things come, and things go.
3169000	3170000	Just like people.
3170000	3171000	People come, people go.
3171000	3172000	Right?
3172000	3173000	And that may happen to Twitch.
3173000	3176000	But the good news is, at least this is still a podcast,
3176000	3181000	so I feel like the content we're making couldn't disappear completely.
3181000	3185000	At least the audio is still going to be there somewhere in space.
3185000	3187000	I know there's that OLR archive and stuff.
3187000	3188000	Even if you can't download them,
3188000	3191000	you can download a lot of back episodes right now still.
3191000	3194000	But, you know, there's unofficial archives and people have MP3s.
3194000	3197000	This still ultimately was the decision of an individual business
3197000	3200000	rather than YouTube coming down with their scythe
3200000	3202000	and cutting a ton of content.
3202000	3203000	It was...
3203000	3207000	Well, but if you think about YouTube's hair-trigger copyright content thing,
3207000	3210000	that could have weighed in the decision.
3210000	3212000	I mean, we can't say for sure.
3212000	3213000	But that could have weighed in the decision.
3213000	3216000	But I think ultimately it was kind of the copyright issue
3216000	3218000	and the fact that, you know, there's still a lot of blurred lines.
3218000	3220000	I mean, even when it comes to video games.
3220000	3222000	Maybe Warner didn't want to get put in a situation
3222000	3225000	where somebody's doing a video about a Nintendo game
3225000	3227000	and now Nintendo wants to sue Warner
3227000	3229000	because, hey, that's my game in your clip
3229000	3233000	because, let's face it, a lot of these Let's Plays and things like that,
3233000	3235000	as far as, like, copyright stuff goes,
3235000	3238000	they still exist in this very kind of nebulous space
3238000	3241000	where a lot of creators don't care.
3241000	3242000	They turn a blind eye to it.
3242000	3246000	But then you have companies like Nintendo who, up until recently,
3246000	3248000	I know they changed their thing recently,
3248000	3252000	but up until recently was very actively trying to get a piece of the pie for themselves.
3252000	3255000	You know, it's a little bit of a blur out there.
3256000	3259000	Anyway, going to chat for some other comments here.
3259000	3262000	Questbuster says Maximilian Dood's videos were hit like this,
3262000	3265000	but he was able to put them back up as a YouTube partner
3265000	3267000	after talking with them and working it out.
3268000	3270000	One more and then I'll get your comment.
3270000	3274000	KArts1 says, Glad to see YouTube MCNs gradually fading away
3274000	3278000	as content creators are wising up to their predatory practices
3278000	3282000	and going independent with fan funding platforms like Patreon.
3282000	3285000	I never really considered Patreon as a YouTube competitor,
3285000	3287000	but I suppose there is something to be said for that.
3288000	3292000	Yeah, a lot of people that have had to censor their content on YouTube
3292000	3294000	in order to keep it monetized,
3294000	3296000	like World of Wonder who does RuPaul's Drag Race,
3296000	3298000	they have to bleep out swear words.
3298000	3302000	If you're a member of the Patreon or however that works,
3302000	3304000	you can see the unedited videos.
3304000	3306000	That's another one with Vet Ranch,
3306000	3308000	is they have to put up two copies of their videos
3308000	3311000	because they do animal surgeries on there.
3312000	3314000	I like watching the surgeries.
3315000	3318000	One of the horror YouTube channels I subscribe to is called Dead Meat.
3318000	3321000	They do videos called Kill Counts.
3321000	3323000	It's great if you're into horror.
3323000	3326000	If the movie is really nasty, he has to put it on his Patreon.
3329000	3331000	What I was going to say, MaxMillionDude,
3331000	3333000	when I was saying if you know who to follow on YouTube,
3333000	3338000	you can see all of the speculation of the little meta investigations
3338000	3340000	as to who else is in Mortal Kombat 11.
3340000	3342000	MaxMillionDude is one of the guys that I watch,
3342000	3345000	and also Super, simply just the word Super,
3345000	3348000	watch his gameplay videos of Mortal Kombat 10,
3348000	3350000	and the combos he does, they're incredible.
3350000	3352000	He's my favorite YouTube fighting guy.
3352000	3354000	Okay, quite the endorsement.
3354000	3357000	All right, well, let's move on from those vanishing YouTube videos
3357000	3360000	and talk about something else that's vanishing, right, DarkSakura?
3360000	3363000	Yes, yes, yes, with a warning.
3363000	3367000	The Wii Shop is going away on January 31st.
3368000	3370000	Bye! Bye, bitch.
3372000	3374000	But all of the functions, of course, associated with it
3374000	3377000	are going along with it.
3379000	3382000	So, meaning, like, if I wanted to redownload Final Fantasy IV,
3382000	3385000	The After Years, which was a great WiiWare title.
3385000	3386000	Wii Shop closes.
3386000	3388000	You can't do it. The Wii Shop's gone.
3388000	3394000	So, what you will need to do to get your shit is that...
3394000	3395000	Pirate them.
3395000	3396000	Girl.
3396000	3397000	Don't do that.
3397000	3399000	You can redownload all your games.
3399000	3401000	You can download them.
3401000	3403000	Basically, if you go to the Wii Shop channel
3403000	3405000	and go to titles you've downloaded,
3405000	3409000	after the 31st, you won't be able to redownload
3409000	3411000	the ones that you've deleted.
3413000	3416000	And also, I mean, the video streaming apps
3416000	3418000	are going to be useless after a while,
3418000	3420000	so you can basically make yourself tons of room to save all those games.
3420000	3422000	I think a lot of them already are useless.
3422000	3423000	I think a lot of them are already closed.
3423000	3425000	The other thing, too, is that if you've got Wii points,
3425000	3427000	spend them up.
3427000	3428000	You can't buy more.
3428000	3430000	They turned that off a while ago.
3430000	3432000	To be fair, they warned us about this.
3432000	3433000	You were warned.
3433000	3435000	But the limit is disappearing in two weeks, too.
3435000	3436000	Yeah.
3436000	3438000	But the day is coming up.
3438000	3441000	And the very last thing is if you've got a Wii U,
3441000	3444000	transfer your shit to your Wii U.
3444000	3446000	Do all of it.
3446000	3449000	We did a transfer, like, a long ass time ago,
3449000	3451000	so we're pretty okay with it.
3451000	3456000	But, I mean, I'd hate for people to spend all this money if they have
3456000	3458000	and then lose their stuff.
3458000	3459000	Yeah.
3459000	3460000	It's frustrating.
3460000	3463000	One big thing I've been trying to do is that, you know,
3463000	3465000	a lot of people bought the Wii, right?
3465000	3467000	It was one of the top selling consoles ever, right?
3467000	3468000	I was in line.
3468000	3470000	Yeah, that was something we did.
3470000	3472000	But here's the thing to keep in mind with that.
3472000	3474000	You probably know more casual gamers,
3474000	3476000	like families that have a Wii in their house,
3476000	3478000	that have no idea this is coming.
3478000	3480000	Now, they may not use that Wii that much anymore,
3480000	3483000	but I made a Facebook post and I just said,
3483000	3487000	hey, I know I have some casual gamers that don't follow a bunch of gaming news,
3487000	3490000	but if you own a Wii, you probably want to know about this.
3490000	3493000	Because I would bet I know people, like families,
3493000	3496000	that just bought a 2,000 Wii Points card,
3496000	3498000	put it in there and never spent the balance.
3498000	3501000	So get in there, spend it, download it.
3501000	3504000	Let your friends know that are more casual gamers that happen to know a Wii
3504000	3507000	because they'll be pissed if it goes away and they didn't know.
3507000	3509000	Like, that one time, they want to go fire it up again
3509000	3512000	I mean, chances are if they haven't booted up their Wii in a year,
3512000	3514000	they're probably never going to.
3514000	3516000	But I still think it's nice to give the heads up.
3516000	3517000	And, you know, why not?
3517000	3520000	It's a chance to go back and maybe rediscover some stuff on Wii
3520000	3522000	because as older as that console is,
3522000	3525000	there was some great stuff on the Wii shop.
3525000	3528000	Like, Konami did those remakes of the Castlevania adventures
3528000	3529000	and the Game Boys.
3529000	3531000	Like, that has not come out anywhere else,
3531000	3533000	which is really unfortunate.
3533000	3536000	The Final Fantasy IV After Years, they did do that,
3536000	3538000	but they remade it.
3538000	3543000	So if you want the version that looks like Final Fantasy II or IV Super Nintendo,
3543000	3546000	you got to get the one that's on the Wii.
3546000	3549000	So, you know, just things to think about.
3549000	3551000	But unfortunately, if you never bought the points,
3551000	3553000	you're already cut off on that.
3553000	3556000	So you may have to turn to piracy for that,
3556000	3558000	and I don't usually endorse piracy,
3558000	3563000	but if we're at the point where that is the only way to experience some of that stuff,
3563000	3565000	then what can we do?
3566000	3570000	It also has a lot of people thinking right now about,
3570000	3572000	and it was funny, we got an email about this last week,
3572000	3574000	so it almost kind of piggybacks on that about
3574000	3578000	why to buy games digital versus why to buy them physical.
3578000	3583000	And this is something I think that really puts itself firmly in the go physical column
3583000	3587000	is that if you had bought stuff, you know, anything you bought on the Wii digitally,
3587000	3589000	you can't redownload it.
3589000	3593000	If your Wii gets fried in a power failure or electrical storm,
3593000	3596000	which I think happened to Bobby, that's it, sayonara.
3596000	3599000	So, something to think about, you know,
3599000	3601000	and I think I have a lot of people thinking about,
3601000	3602000	oh, maybe with the Switch.
3602000	3604000	Now, the Switch has been very widely successful,
3604000	3606000	but so was the Wii.
3606000	3610000	So as long as you are okay with the Switch getting shut off in 10 years,
3610000	3612000	I don't know.
3612000	3613000	All right.
3613000	3616000	Going to chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network,
3616000	3620000	Bobby Blackwell says, yep, lost all my Wii digital purchases.
3620000	3622000	Granted, I maybe spent $30 total,
3622000	3624000	but that's still 30 bucks, right?
3624000	3625000	Let's see.
3625000	3630000	Metal Mayhem points out the thing is, Rob, PC games are rarely physical nowadays.
3630000	3632000	Very true points.
3632000	3634000	I'm not sure how to respond to that.
3634000	3640000	I mean, shops like Steam have it written into their rules
3640000	3642000	that like if Steam ever gets pulled down,
3642000	3646000	they have a button that they can press that kills all the DMCA.
3646000	3648000	So you'll at least be able to play your purchases.
3648000	3649000	And let's be real.
3649000	3651000	There's a lot of abandonware.
3651000	3652000	Yeah.
3652000	3653000	Right.
3653000	3656000	Where people are like, well, technically copyright law only applies so law.
3656000	3658000	I think Nintendo would feel very differently about this
3658000	3659000	in the ROM sites they took down.
3659000	3660000	Yeah.
3660000	3661000	But whatever.
3661000	3663000	I think a lot of companies turn a blind eye to it.
3663000	3666000	But there's a abandonware thing where old games you can usually download.
3666000	3670000	GOG tried to market this stuff, but GOG couldn't survive on it.
3670000	3671000	They're trying to, you know.
3671000	3672000	Yeah.
3672000	3675000	It's kind of the sideshow of their service now.
3675000	3677000	And now they showed their true colors too,
3677000	3678000	what jerks they are.
3678000	3682000	Well, that's a whole other Oprah.
3682000	3686000	If there's a special edition of like From Software announced
3686000	3691000	Dark Souls trilogy and you can buy a super mega edition
3691000	3695000	or like Mortal Kombat 11 with like a bust of Scorpion
3695000	3699000	and like, you know, I don't know, a cloth tapestry to put on your wall.
3699000	3701000	Like fan stuff.
3701000	3703000	A plate and spoon and fork and a cloth.
3703000	3707000	If you're willing to pay $150 for this special edition
3707000	3712000	that comes in like a big box, you can get the game plus all this fandom crap.
3712000	3714000	Those are only for the console version of games now.
3714000	3716000	You can't get those.
3716000	3719000	I think Skyrim was the last PC.
3719000	3723000	I mean, I'm sure Skyrim was like seven years ago.
3723000	3727000	So obviously I'm sure there have been some since.
3727000	3729000	But by and large for the last two or three years,
3729000	3734000	if you want the special fan stuff, you have to get it on console
3734000	3736000	because they don't make those for PC.
3736000	3738000	You can just download the game is my point.
3738000	3740000	Let me read a couple other comments from chat here.
3740000	3745000	Nifty 805 says, someone somewhere is still buying Just Dance for Wii.
3745000	3746000	True.
3746000	3750000	I mean, remember, sometimes in other countries,
3750000	3754000	places that aren't the US or one of the main European territories
3754000	3756000	where games are launched first or Japan,
3756000	3760000	if you're in a different country, sometimes you do get stuff later.
3760000	3764000	And you know, like we've had on the show before in Brazil,
3764000	3767000	the Sega Genesis is still kind of having its heyday.
3767000	3768000	You know what I mean?
3768000	3771000	The Master System was the big one.
3771000	3775000	For a long time because, you know, after it kind of died here,
3775000	3777000	they got a lot of the second run.
3777000	3780000	A lot of Genesis conversions were made specifically for the Brazilian market.
3780000	3781000	Yeah.
3781000	3783000	For Master System.
3783000	3785000	And it's not like Brazil is some small country.
3785000	3787000	You know, these places are huge.
3787000	3788000	There's a lot of people there.
3788000	3790000	Brazil is kind of fucked up right now.
3790000	3791000	Yeah.
3791000	3793000	Again, a whole nother robot.
3793000	3794000	Let's see.
3794000	3797000	Tiger Claw in chat says, in fact, I bet you can still find Wii games
3797000	3799000	or so at a thrift store or flea market.
3799000	3800000	Oh, absolutely.
3800000	3801000	Absolutely.
3801000	3803000	There's still tons of Wii games.
3803000	3804000	Oh, yeah.
3804000	3806000	If we went to a random store.
3806000	3807000	The flea market.
3807000	3808000	Yeah.
3808000	3809000	You'd find tons.
3809000	3810000	Of course.
3810000	3811000	All right.
3811000	3812000	Well, let's move on.
3812000	3814000	Let's talk about our next story, which Alan,
3814000	3819000	I think you're going to talk about, which kind of on your LOL anthem
3819000	3821000	bandwidth a little bit.
3821000	3823000	Yeah.
3823000	3831000	So Visceral Games, who I believe also made Dead Space, I think,
3831000	3835000	which EA ruined and drove under the ground.
3835000	3837000	EA shut down Visceral Games in 2017.
3837000	3842000	Visceral Games at the time was working on a Star Wars game
3842000	3846000	that was code named, Star Wars game code named Ragtag.
3846000	3850000	When Visceral was shut down by EA, they gave those assets,
3850000	3854000	the Visceral had, and spun it off to EA Vancouver.
3854000	3859000	And it was supposed, the Visceral's vision of the game was supposed to be,
3859000	3863000	I think, single player campaign, just like a narrative Star Wars game.
3863000	3867000	But EA Vancouver was supposed to make it into an open world.
3867000	3872000	And open world is, I don't know, like, I mean,
3872000	3875000	open world is like your Breath of the Wild, your Skyrim,
3875000	3879000	your Elder Scrolls, your, just take that thought already.
3879000	3882000	Sure. But like, you know, that would have been cool. I would have played that.
3882000	3885000	Yeah. Well, it's been cancelled.
3885000	3889000	So when it was still a Visceral Games property,
3889000	3892000	they did have a few screenshots or a few concept art things.
3892000	3895000	So Visceral did have something to show.
3895000	3899000	Nothing, since this game was handed to EA Vancouver,
3899000	3904000	they have not themselves put out little snippets of their own work.
3904000	3911000	So it's kind of just been vaporware since it was handed to them.
3911000	3914000	And now EA has confirmed that it's been cancelled.
3914000	3921000	However, Star Wars Battlefront II is still being updated.
3921000	3928000	And also Respawn, which I think is something under the giant EA umbrella,
3928000	3931000	because really who can keep track of how fucking big they are now,
3932000	3935000	are working on a game called Jedi Fallen Order,
3935000	3939000	and those are still things that are happening or will happen.
3939000	3942000	So EA is like, we're not just sitting on the Star Wars license,
3942000	3946000	even though when LucasArts had it, they made 5,000 games, you know,
3946000	3948000	but now that we have it, but whatever.
3948000	3950000	So it was one of the last few...
3950000	3952000	Granted, it was LucasArts, but...
3952000	3955000	It was one of the last gasps of Visceral Games.
3955000	3960000	It was given to EA Vancouver, and EA, I guess, didn't like where it was going
3960000	3962000	or how it was turning out, so it's gone.
3962000	3963000	That's too bad.
3963000	3964000	Short and sweet.
3964000	3965000	That's too bad.
3965000	3968000	All right, well, bummer for those folks that were working on it.
3968000	3969000	It sounds like a cool concept.
3969000	3971000	I wonder where it went wrong.
3971000	3973000	Maybe it just was something that didn't work or didn't play well
3973000	3974000	or didn't feel right.
3974000	3975000	I don't know.
3975000	3977000	Well, another game that is disappearing,
3977000	3980000	but this one's already been out there, and it's a very different reason.
3980000	3981000	Westward Mobile.
3981000	3982000	That's right.
3982000	3984000	I don't know how many of you guys are watching that show.
3984000	3986000	I'm sorry, not Westward, Westworld, excuse me,
3986000	3989000	because it's based off that TV show, which I admittedly have never seen
3989000	3991000	because I'm usually doing podcasts on Sunday night,
3991000	3994000	and, you know, very few shows I ever watch anymore.
3994000	3997000	It's like androids in the Wild West with titties.
3997000	4001000	Okay, I've only seen the Drag Race parody
4001000	4003000	when they did West Girl or whatever they called it.
4003000	4004000	They did Breastworld.
4004000	4005000	Breastworld.
4005000	4008000	I saw that, and that episode was so bad
4008000	4010000	because I didn't understand any of it
4010000	4012000	because I guess it was a parody of the show.
4012000	4015000	But anyway, and I don't know why Eureka never got sent home.
4015000	4017000	But anyway, we won't talk about that.
4017000	4019000	That's a different podcast that you do.
4019000	4020000	Sorry, all right.
4020000	4021000	Different show.
4021000	4025000	Anyway, Westworld Mobile was a little too similar to Fallout Shelter
4025000	4027000	because Bethesda took them to court.
4027000	4030000	Bethesda took Behavior Interactive and Warner Brothers to court over it,
4030000	4032000	and you know what's happened?
4032000	4036000	And nobody knows if this is directly a result or what's going on,
4036000	4040000	but Warner Brothers has pulled Westworld Mobile from the app stores.
4040000	4042000	In-app purchases have been disabled in the game,
4042000	4046000	and you can still play the game through April 16th.
4046000	4049000	That is the day when it's going to be shut down for good.
4049000	4054000	Previously, after suing the pants off of Behavior Interactive,
4054000	4058000	Bethesda and they both said the two sides claimed
4058000	4060000	there was an amicable end to the lawsuit,
4060000	4064000	but apparently that meant you got to shut the game down.
4064000	4065000	And so they put out a little statement.
4065000	4067000	We hope you've enjoyed playing it.
4067000	4069000	We're sorry to tell you the park is entering a new phase
4069000	4071000	and will no longer be taking applications for new employees.
4071000	4073000	It's going away.
4073000	4076000	Bummer to those folks that spent money on the game,
4076000	4080000	but again, this is something I have to remember
4080000	4082000	when I play Pokemon Go.
4082000	4086000	When I spend money on coins and incubators and bag upgrades,
4086000	4089000	which yes, I may have done a time or two,
4089000	4091000	that is going to go away someday.
4091000	4094000	Pokemon Go will not exist forever.
4094000	4097000	In ten years, the technology will be so good,
4097000	4100000	there's probably a different type of game that supersedes Pokemon Go,
4100000	4102000	and that's the game that we're playing.
4102000	4105000	It starts to look like the Detective Pikachu movie,
4105000	4108000	but in real life through our AR glasses,
4108000	4110000	our hololenses, and all that stuff.
4110000	4113000	But all that joking aside, we have to remember
4113000	4117000	this money we spend on things is not going to be around forever,
4117000	4120000	and it's a hard lesson learned as well for this Westworld game,
4120000	4122000	because I don't think they're doing refunds.
4122000	4124000	I don't see refunds anywhere here.
4124000	4128000	So when you buy things, it's for the moment, and that's that.
4128000	4130000	So there it is.
4130000	4132000	Going to our chat room.
4132000	4134000	Let's see.
4134000	4136000	Some folks in chat are talking about, oh,
4136000	4138000	SG100Matt saying, I saw the original movie.
4138000	4140000	That's it.
4140000	4143000	Bonz006 says, I don't know if he meant to say HoloLens,
4143000	4147000	but it says I want HaloLens in my actual glasses.
4147000	4150000	I don't know, that whole Google Glass thing kind of went away.
4150000	4155000	But I mean, I know Microsoft still has HoloLens back there somewhere,
4155000	4157000	as something they're going to do someday
4157000	4160000	on a more commercial front.
4160000	4162000	Who knows?
4162000	4165000	I would still think there's going to be that in the future.
4165000	4169000	We're all going to have little things like Geordie LaForge on Star Trek,
4169000	4172000	but for him, it was to help him with his blindness, if I remember right.
4172000	4175000	For us, it'll be how we see AR, like a gaming device.
4175000	4177000	I don't know. I don't know. We'll see.
4177000	4180000	Bobby Blackwolf says, they're doing a lot with HoloLens.
4180000	4182000	You just don't see it because it's not in your purview.
4182000	4186000	It's a lot of not gaming stuff, which to be fair, sure, that's fine.
4186000	4189000	And that's where Kinect kind of ended up being strongest, right?
4189000	4194000	Like, Kinect, as much as Microsoft has pretty much killed that off for gaming, effectively,
4194000	4198000	Kinect, as far as I know, is still going, especially in hospitals
4198000	4201000	and places where you need the very sterile types of environments
4201000	4205000	where the gesturing and all that is actually really good to be able to navigate.
4205000	4209000	So, I would imagine HoloLens could have a similar market in,
4209000	4211000	you know, this show focuses on gaming,
4211000	4216000	but what could HoloLens and that AR technology do for other industries,
4216000	4219000	medicine, science, you know, exploration?
4219000	4223000	You know, imagine being able to put on the HoloLens
4223000	4227000	and explore Mars from a rover that's sending you images back.
4227000	4229000	Who knows? Who knows?
4229000	4232000	I don't want to get too sci-fi, but that is, it is what it is.
4232000	4234000	All right, let's move on.
4234000	4238000	Dark Sakura, take us to something maybe a little more traditional, I don't know.
4238000	4239000	Traditional?
4239000	4240000	Ish.
4240000	4243000	It's not very traditional, but it's really nice.
4243000	4246000	So, Fortnite.
4246000	4249000	What do we hear about Fortnite all the time?
4249000	4253000	Angry seven-year-olds calling each other horrible names.
4253000	4258000	Well, Tim Sweeney, who is the game's creator, is doing other stuff,
4258000	4261000	but it's not really much to do with the game itself.
4261000	4266000	He, now that he has Uber money from the Fortnite,
4266000	4270000	he is actually doing some more philanthropy.
4270000	4275000	He is using his money to buy parts of the Carolina mountains
4275000	4278000	so that they are not deforested.
4278000	4281000	He's purchased nearly 40,000 acres of land,
4281000	4286000	which makes him one of the largest private landowners in North Carolina.
4286000	4292000	He's also used his money to participate in conservation parcel projects,
4292000	4297000	like expanding 1,500 acres to Mount Mitchell State Park.
4297000	4302000	And so he donated also $15 million for a conservation project
4302000	4304000	for Box Creek Wilderness.
4304000	4307000	And the other thing about the area that he bought
4307000	4310000	is that it's part of the Blue Ridge Mountains,
4310000	4314000	some rather untouched, pristine land.
4314000	4316000	Corporations have had their eyes on it for a while.
4316000	4319000	He outbid them and took the land to keep it from being ruined.
4319000	4321000	Wow, that's a pretty big move.
4321000	4324000	That's why I always say forests are the more traditional thing.
4324000	4327000	It's so that he can do a battle royale for real.
4327000	4330000	Your ass is going to get dropped into that forest.
4330000	4332000	Or is he setting up a preserve?
4332000	4335000	Wasn't this the twist in the village?
4335000	4336000	Possibly.
4336000	4339000	Sorry if I ruined that movie for you, but I actually saved you in a way.
4339000	4342000	I liked that movie, but it's only worth seeing once.
4342000	4343000	And it's like 20 years old.
4343000	4345000	If you haven't seen it at this point, you're not going to.
4345000	4348000	Anyway, but I'd like to read his quote about it, if that's fine.
4348000	4349000	Sure.
4349000	4352000	It's one of the most diverse areas in North Carolina.
4352000	4355000	It has such rare plant and wildlife species.
4355000	4358000	It seems a perfect fit with the Fish and Wildlife Service.
4358000	4359000	This is a first step.
4359000	4361000	There will be other places protected.
4361000	4364000	The goal is to connect South Mountain State Park to Chimney Rock.
4364000	4366000	This is one piece of the puzzle.
4369000	4371000	I just have to read this comment from chat.
4371000	4372000	I'm sorry because I'm cracking up.
4372000	4374000	I'm sorry if I pronounced your name wrong.
4374000	4375000	Jay's Unown.
4375000	4377000	I'm sorry, Jay's You None.
4377000	4378000	I'm sorry, I don't know which way it's pronounced.
4378000	4382000	But says in the chat, 100 content creators get dropped into a forest.
4382000	4387000	Yes, maybe this is his elaborate setup for, you know,
4387000	4389000	all these people that play Fortnite.
4389000	4391000	It's like, now show us what you've learned.
4391000	4392000	Drop Ninja.
4392000	4394000	Drop Jake and Logan Paul in there.
4397000	4399000	They get the frying pan to protect themselves.
4399000	4400000	Sorry, Jamie.
4400000	4405000	Well, at any rate, the other thing is that he's actually been keeping full transparency on this.
4405000	4410000	So that instead of just, you know, being all fake and quiet about it,
4410000	4414000	he's being very public with it and saying, no, this is it.
4414000	4417000	In writing, this land will not be developed.
4418000	4424000	And just looking at the pictures of the scenery, it is super, super gorgeous.
4424000	4427000	Now, he also did outbid for another piece of land.
4427000	4430000	A 1500 acre place that was called Stone Hill.
4430000	4436000	Stone Hill that he actually outbid people that wanted to turn it into a fucking golf resort.
4436000	4441000	Can Tim Sweeney please buy all of the land around Dollywood and the Smoky Mountains
4441000	4446000	and just to make sure Dollywood is always preserved and will be a monument to humanity?
4446000	4448000	Actually, I think that Dolly owns the land around it.
4448000	4450000	Oh, good. Oh, good.
4450000	4451000	Well, don't take it from Dolly.
4451000	4452000	If Dolly owns it, Dolly keeps it.
4452000	4455000	But, you know, I just want to, I'm just trying to protect Dollywood.
4456000	4461000	And honestly, she's also someone else for her philanthropy that I'm really happy with
4461000	4464000	because she goes out and gives all those books to kids.
4465000	4466000	Oh, yeah.
4466000	4467000	And she does so much.
4467000	4473000	And on top of that, she is so, it's kind of a rarity in the country industry,
4473000	4478000	country music industry to find someone who's so LGBTQA, et cetera, friendly.
4478000	4482000	Luckily, we're seeing more and more of it, especially with the younger folks.
4482000	4483000	So that's good.
4483000	4487000	But I was going to say, since we were talking about perfect people tonight,
4487000	4488000	Jamie Lee Curtis is in that list.
4488000	4491000	I would definitely say Dolly Parton is absolutely in the list of perfect people.
4491000	4492000	Absolutely.
4492000	4494000	Along with Dark Soccer, Rob Roberts and Loki.
4495000	4496000	And Alan.
4497000	4499000	Oh, yeah. Alan's, Alan's all right.
4499000	4500000	I guess you could put Dan in there, too.
4501000	4504000	Okay. Anyway, all joking aside, Bobby Blackwell says,
4504000	4508000	I want Tim Sweeney to carve the initials ZZT into one of the trees.
4508000	4510000	Who would have thought, who would have thought all those years ago,
4510000	4512000	did you ever play ZZT, Alan?
4512000	4514000	Who would have thought all those years ago playing ZZT,
4515000	4518000	that this would be the guy that now is like literally saving the forest
4518000	4520000	because of his success from Fortnite.
4521000	4525000	Bobby also has the comment, the winning comment that says Fire Knight.
4526000	4531000	All we need to do is just have him find like a clearing and put like a,
4532000	4535000	fairy stones in the middle and then just leave it there.
4536000	4539000	All right. With a, with a cast iron pan in the center.
4539000	4543000	Let's move on to a couple more stories before we get to our classic game of the week.
4543000	4546000	Although there might be, there might be a twist, so stay tuned.
4546000	4547000	Y'all wanted a twist.
4547000	4550000	All right. Anyway, we promised a twist in 2019, so stay tuned.
4550000	4552000	You might be hearing about a game you've heard about before,
4552000	4553000	but in a different way.
4553000	4554000	All right.
4554000	4555000	Spoilers.
4555000	4557000	I'm not, you've done like 500 games, Jamie.
4557000	4558000	All right.
4558000	4559000	Have I?
4559000	4561000	Yeah. This is episode 760.
4561000	4562000	There's that many games?
4562000	4564000	You started that segment 250. Anyway.
4564000	4565000	Fucking A.
4565000	4566000	Moving on.
4566000	4568000	Alan, what would you like to talk to us about?
4568000	4574000	Overwatch's next seasonal event, which is for the lunar new year.
4574000	4575000	It's the year of the pig.
4576000	4578000	No comments from the peanut gallery.
4578000	4579000	Thank you very much.
4581000	4583000	Is it the year of the nasty pig?
4583000	4584000	Yeah.
4584000	4585000	I'm gonna leave it at that.
4585000	4586000	Hi, Delvin.
4586000	4587000	I'm gonna leave it at that.
4588000	4590000	Drag her, expose her.
4592000	4595000	People are watching are like, what the fuck are they talking about?
4596000	4599000	From January 24th through February 18th,
4599000	4604000	there's going to be ranked capture the flag mode,
4604000	4610000	new legendary skins and epic skins of the sort of Chinese New Year motif.
4611000	4615000	Soldier 76, who I will talk about in more detail in just a minute,
4615000	4618000	is getting, if anyone ever saw Karate Kid 2,
4618000	4624000	there's those little, I don't know if, what the real context of the culture is,
4624000	4628000	but at the end of Karate Kid 2, they had those little leather bound drums
4628000	4632000	with the little beads on them that each family had its own symbol.
4632000	4633000	I think it's Okinawan.
4633000	4634000	Okay, Okinawan.
4634000	4635000	All right.
4636000	4637000	Oh, yeah.
4638000	4642000	That's very much like Blizzard to have a Chinese New Year event,
4642000	4645000	but then put Japanese cultural things in it
4645000	4647000	because it's all one big mishmash, right?
4647000	4648000	Who cares?
4649000	4653000	New emotes, victory poses, voice lines.
4653000	4656000	You have about, I think, three weeks to get it.
4656000	4658000	You get it via loot boxes.
4659000	4665000	You can earn three loot boxes a week in arcade mode.
4665000	4667000	For every third match you win, you get a loot box.
4667000	4669000	So you win nine matches total. That's three.
4669000	4672000	And then the more you play, you XP.
4672000	4673000	You gain levels.
4673000	4675000	You also get a loot box from leveling.
4675000	4679000	So if you play the fuck out of Overwatch for these three weeks,
4679000	4683000	you get enough loot boxes more than likely to get what you want to get.
4683000	4686000	Because usually you're like, I don't play this character,
4686000	4688000	so I don't really care about that costume,
4688000	4691000	but I really want the Mercy one or whatever,
4691000	4694000	though I think she got one last year, so she's not due for one this year.
4694000	4698000	So yeah, you don't have to give Blizzard your money
4698000	4700000	to buy these loot boxes. Just play the game.
4700000	4701000	But it helps.
4701000	4702000	Yeah, it helps.
4703000	4706000	And also, if you're going to get some money,
4706000	4708000	wait until the last day of the event.
4709000	4712000	Don't just give them $40 and open up a bunch of loot boxes,
4712000	4714000	because you may actually get what you want in the free ones.
4714000	4715000	Yes, yeah.
4716000	4720000	So this was a new story back when it was very stormy,
4720000	4723000	and the show lost its power.
4723000	4726000	Yeah, the OLR week, we had to cut the show short.
4726000	4729000	I will keep this brief, because I know all three of us in here
4729000	4731000	could talk about this for hours.
4731000	4737000	It was announced that Soldier 76 is canonically gay.
4739000	4742000	I've enjoyed the fallout of that announcement
4742000	4746000	from the people that it upset more than I care about the fact.
4746000	4750000	I think 76, honestly, is kind of a boring character.
4750000	4756000	I would have much preferred that Zarya is a butch-les,
4756000	4759000	because I know a lot of lady people that are lady friends
4759000	4765000	who are in love with Zarya and want Zarya to carry them in her big, beefy arms.
4765000	4768000	But what we want in our fanfic isn't always what we get.
4768000	4769000	Yes.
4769000	4770000	More ace characters, please.
4770000	4771000	Yes.
4771000	4772000	Who knows?
4772000	4774000	Or Junkrat, I think would be...
4774000	4776000	He's not your stereotypical...
4776000	4777000	Okay, fan wank all you want.
4777000	4779000	They might release some stuff later, though.
4779000	4781000	But anyway, so people are upset.
4781000	4785000	They're like 76. They made 76 gay for no reason.
4785000	4787000	I'm going to let all of you watching on Twitch
4787000	4789000	and listening on the podcast in on a little secret.
4789000	4794000	I, myself, am gay for no reason.
4794000	4795000	Wait, what, you're gay?
4795000	4796000	Yes.
4796000	4797000	Oh, my God.
4797000	4803000	Just is how I turned out.
4803000	4808000	So the reason why stuff like this is important is
4808000	4812000	people say, who cares, why does it matter?
4812000	4817000	There's nothing in the canon to suggest that 76 was heterosexual.
4817000	4820000	There's no official girlfriend. There's no dead wife story.
4820000	4823000	He has a few lines of conversation with Anna
4823000	4826000	that one could maybe infer was flirtatious.
4826000	4829000	But unless someone says, oh, by the way...
4829000	4830000	I flirt with girls.
4830000	4833000	Oh, by the way, this character is gay.
4833000	4836000	The default is to assume that he's straight
4836000	4838000	even though there isn't any evidence
4838000	4840000	because, again, this is a video game.
4840000	4842000	Some characters, of course, have the dead wife story
4842000	4844000	where you're like, okay, he was married to a woman.
4844000	4848000	He's probably, you know, at least bi.
4848000	4850000	So for them to say, oh, yeah, 76 is gay,
4850000	4853000	for people to get so upset about that,
4853000	4857000	it's because the 14-year-olds
4857000	4859000	that are upset about this announcement
4859000	4862000	don't see a character whose sexuality is ambiguous
4862000	4864000	and go, oh, I can't make assumptions about this
4864000	4865000	because they haven't said either way.
4865000	4867000	No, they're going to assume, unless they're told otherwise,
4867000	4870000	the character is straight, and that is why
4870000	4873000	announcements like this is sort of like,
4873000	4876000	hey, you make up like 85% of the population,
4876000	4878000	so we're not really worried about
4878000	4881000	you not seeing enough of yourself in media.
4881000	4884000	So let's pick a character and just say,
4884000	4887000	hey, I mean, there's already a ton of fanfic
4887000	4891000	that him and Reaper have a very sordid past
4891000	4894000	now that, you know, Reaper is dead and everything
4894000	4897000	and an edgelord in that Hot Topic mask.
4897000	4902000	But, yeah, it's been fun watching people say,
4902000	4906000	oh, I don't care that 76 is gay, why does it matter?
4906000	4907000	But then the same people will also say,
4907000	4909000	I don't want to play 76 anymore
4909000	4912000	because I don't want people to think that I'm a Fraggle,
4912000	4913000	but not a Fraggle.
4913000	4916000	It's another word with an F and two Gs.
4916000	4920000	So it's funny, and I'm glad Blizzard did it
4920000	4924000	just to stir shit, honestly,
4924000	4926000	because ultimately it doesn't matter,
4926000	4932000	and it's like the whole thing about people being triggered
4932000	4933000	and the unique snowflakes,
4933000	4935000	but once something like this comes out,
4935000	4937000	the people that accuse people of being too sensitive
4937000	4940000	lose their goddamn minds is hilarious to me.
4940000	4941000	That's all.
4941000	4943000	Well, Alan, the chat room would like me
4943000	4945000	to do this on your behalf.
4945000	4946000	No.
4946000	4950000	So the one thing that I would like to see,
4950000	4954000	because you could get a spray of 76 and his partner,
4954000	4955000	who we've never heard of before,
4955000	4956000	so this really is like something
4956000	4959000	that Blizzard pulled out of their ass.
4959000	4961000	I thought, wasn't there like a picture
4961000	4963000	from an earlier thing that was brought up?
4963000	4966000	That could be true because the Overwatch lore
4966000	4971000	is so filled with like huge gaps of contradictory nonsense
4971000	4973000	that you don't really follow the story
4973000	4974000	of Overwatch that much,
4974000	4980000	but I would love a dial, because 76, he's like a dad.
4980000	4984000	He wears awful, clashy, plaid polka dot clothes,
4984000	4985000	and he like is a...
4985000	4988000	He wears socks with sandals, for God's sake.
4988000	4990000	Yeah, and he's all about the barbecue,
4990000	4992000	and he dances with like no rhythm,
4992000	4994000	and he's kind of like, you know, this.
4994000	4998000	So I would love it if they still snuck in.
4998000	5001000	Like if Ana says,
5001000	5003000	76, how about after the mission we go to brunch?
5003000	5007000	And he says, you know I love brunch, or whatever.
5007000	5010000	I would find that hilarious
5010000	5013000	if they gave him more little dog whistle things
5013000	5016000	aside from a spray of him and his boyfriend,
5016000	5018000	because it wouldn't make him effeminate or anything.
5018000	5020000	Just say, hey, the man loves his brunch.
5020000	5023000	He likes a French toast.
5023000	5025000	Right. Oh, my God.
5025000	5027000	Sia Tabiri says, bottomless mimosas.
5027000	5028000	That could be a line, yeah.
5028000	5029000	Anyway, sorry.
5029000	5030000	Some of the chatters are saying,
5030000	5032000	ow, that mic drop hurt my ears.
5032000	5033000	I'm very sorry.
5033000	5035000	I had to get the effect for the podcast.
5035000	5037000	I'm sorry. I didn't think it would be that loud.
5037000	5040000	And just if you're worried, there is carpet down here.
5040000	5041000	It's a solid floor.
5041000	5042000	There's like a rug here.
5042000	5045000	So it did not drop on a solid floor.
5045000	5047000	All right, anyway.
5047000	5048000	Uh-oh.
5048000	5050000	Oh, there you go.
5050000	5052000	So isn't that funny?
5052000	5055000	Nifty in chat says, smoosh is breaking our hearts
5055000	5057000	by refusing to make a cameo tonight.
5057000	5059000	And so Dark Soccer just made it happen for you guys.
5059000	5060000	There you go.
5060000	5061000	So that's all.
5061000	5063000	Smoosh will let me hold him sometimes.
5063000	5066000	Blizzard did something really random,
5066000	5071000	and people that claim to be above it all lost their minds,
5071000	5074000	and I found that to be hilarious.
5074000	5076000	And the Lunar New Year event is coming next week.
5076000	5077000	All right.
5077000	5078000	That's all.
5078000	5080000	I don't know if you'll find this hilarious as well,
5080000	5081000	but probably not.
5081000	5083000	But Assassin's Creed Odyssey, you know,
5083000	5085000	I don't know how much you know about this game,
5085000	5086000	but they took the BioWare approach
5086000	5089000	where you could kind of select a lot of different paths
5089000	5092000	for your character and that whole thing.
5092000	5096000	And you can also openly romance whatever gender you want
5096000	5099000	because it's 2019, and so we have that kind of reflection
5099000	5103000	of fluid sexualities in the game.
5103000	5109000	So anyway, the controversy is coming from this first DLC,
5109000	5111000	or excuse me, the latest DLC that just came out,
5111000	5113000	Legacy of the First Blade Part II,
5113000	5120000	because in this DLC, you have a baby with another character.
5120000	5124000	Now, that's not to say that gay folks cannot adopt babies,
5124000	5127000	but you have a baby the old-fashioned way
5127000	5129000	with another character.
5129000	5132000	And so the child grows up and so forth,
5132000	5134000	so some folks are kind of pissed about that
5134000	5136000	because it broke the cannons that they had
5136000	5138000	for their characters before.
5138000	5141000	Now, to be fair, Ubisoft has come out since and said,
5141000	5143000	we missed the mark with the DLC,
5143000	5148000	and they wanted to, according to the creative director
5148000	5150000	named Jonathan Demont, players should not be forced
5150000	5152000	to engage in a lasting romantic relationship
5152000	5154000	with the DLC character.
5154000	5158000	The player can engage to carry on the assassin's bloodline.
5158000	5159000	They can choose to move on afterwards
5159000	5161000	and continue their relationship.
5161000	5163000	So I guess that's something they're going to be changing
5163000	5166000	with the DLC and making that work out.
5166000	5171000	So anyway, not handled the best way to be like,
5171000	5174000	hey, you've got choice, psych.
5174000	5178000	One of the best games that has done this right,
5178000	5181000	I think, is Sims 4, because in Sims 3 or 4,
5181000	5184000	you can be like, can this character have kids?
5184000	5186000	It doesn't ask you what gender they are.
5186000	5188000	Can this character have kids? Yes.
5188000	5192000	How do you want them to, like, whatever?
5192000	5195000	Because it's a video game. It's not real.
5195000	5200000	If they just say, if there's the main character
5200000	5204000	and his male gay romance and they have a baby,
5204000	5207000	just don't explain it.
5207000	5209000	Just don't explain where this baby came from.
5209000	5211000	Oh, we had it the biological way.
5211000	5214000	It's a video game. It's not real.
5214000	5218000	It's not hard in this day and age to figure out
5218000	5221000	how two people of the same gender end up with a kid.
5221000	5223000	There's many different ways to do it.
5223000	5225000	Many, many, many. Anyway.
5225000	5227000	I realize, though, this is a game set in history,
5227000	5229000	but still, come on.
5229000	5233000	You can't do so much of this and then take two steps back.
5233000	5238000	Assassin's Creed is based off of,
5238000	5240000	what's the main storyline? Genetic memory.
5240000	5243000	Where you're going back through your DNA to the memories.
5243000	5246000	That's not real.
5246000	5247000	Good point. That's not real.
5247000	5252000	So, they don't need to make things make sense
5252000	5255000	when it comes to stuff like this, in my opinion.
5255000	5257000	Fair enough. No, I agree. Fair enough.
5257000	5259000	All right. Well, let's move on.
5259000	5261000	Let's get to another segment we like to do here.
5261000	5264000	Every week on the show, we step into the gaming vault.
5264000	5266000	I'm sorry, I did not yet bring in the music,
5266000	5268000	so I don't have the cute little music.
5268000	5269000	Just this week, I'll work on that.
5269000	5270000	I see how it is.
5270000	5272000	I'll work on a proper bumper for next time.
5272000	5274000	Well, technically, tonight's segment is a little different anyway.
5274000	5277000	So, tonight, usually once a week, we have Dark Sakura
5277000	5280000	step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
5280000	5282000	hey, you kids should be playing this game
5282000	5284000	and find a classic game of the week.
5284000	5287000	But, we mentioned at the end of last year, once a month,
5287000	5290000	so what, in 2017, you did classic consoles, right?
5290000	5291000	Mm-hmm.
5291000	5292000	2018, you did classic peripherals.
5292000	5293000	Mm-hmm.
5293000	5297000	In 2019, she's going to do classic soundtracks.
5297000	5298000	So, Dark Sakura.
5298000	5299000	Specific this year.
5299000	5300000	Specific.
5300000	5301000	8-bit soundtracks.
5301000	5302000	Oh, okay.
5302000	5304000	Oh, I didn't know you were going that far.
5304000	5305000	Don't box yourself in, girl.
5305000	5307000	No, because next year, I'm going to do 16-bit.
5307000	5308000	All right.
5308000	5309000	All right.
5309000	5310000	Because I'm lazy.
5310000	5314000	Well, what is the classic soundtrack of the week?
5314000	5315000	Duh.
5315000	5316000	The Guardian Legend.
5316000	5317000	Great pick.
5317000	5321000	Because it has really good music, but since the game,
5321000	5325000	people don't always recognize the game, you know?
5325000	5330000	And it's got such good music that I really am just like,
5330000	5335000	why do not enough people give this game's soundtrack its due?
5335000	5343000	So, the music was composed by Miyamoto Masatomo,
5343000	5345000	and Sanzō Takashi.
5345000	5351000	And it actually, so much of this, I mean,
5351000	5353000	it's still popular today that one of the most popular
5353000	5358000	of the OC remixes is a Guardian Legend remix.
5359000	5364000	It was like the second most popular track they had in 2002.
5364000	5365000	It was pretty crazy.
5365000	5371000	And then even several cover bands,
5371000	5373000	like video game cover bands,
5373000	5376000	have done tunes from the Guardian Legend.
5376000	5378000	But as for the composers themselves,
5378000	5383000	just to give them some attention is Miyamoto did,
5383000	5387000	he actually was one of the music designers for Gardick,
5387000	5392000	and Zanac, and Govellius for MSX2.
5392000	5395000	I'm trying to look at some others that might have been
5395000	5398000	known a little bit better outside of Japan.
5398000	5400000	Xevious Faudrot Saga for MSX2.
5400000	5405000	He mostly did NES, SMS, and NES music.
5405000	5409000	But also, sorry, MSX is what I meant.
5409000	5414000	But is really just like, mostly did the compile stuff.
5414000	5416000	He also did some Godzilla games.
5417000	5425000	As far as Santo, he basically worked on the same music tracks
5425000	5429000	like Govellius for MSX, Guardian Legend for NES,
5429000	5432000	Tombs and Treasure, and Govellius Valley of Doom
5432000	5433000	for the Sega Master System.
5433000	5436000	He also was sound effects designer for Psycho Chaser
5436000	5438000	for PC Engine and Override for PC Engine.
5440000	5444000	But at any rate, I don't know who would argue with me
5444000	5447000	that this doesn't have a place amongst one of the top
5447000	5450000	underrated video game soundtracks out there.
5450000	5453000	I love this soundtrack. It is so underrated.
5453000	5455000	I wish I had found the music for you that's my favorite.
5455000	5457000	It's one of, I think it's like, whatever the point is.
5457000	5459000	I hate the bullet noises in this. They're so loud.
5459000	5461000	So I'm sorry if that's overpowering things a little bit.
5461000	5464000	This is something I'll listen to at the soundtrack in my car.
5464000	5465000	Yeah. Oh no, it's so good.
5465000	5466000	It's pretty amazing.
5466000	5468000	There's some good shout out to OC Remix,
5468000	5469000	because we've been trying to feature them
5469000	5472000	and their talents more and more as we've moved over to Twitch.
5472000	5473000	They've got some great remixes there.
5473000	5475000	They have this orchestral one.
5475000	5477000	It's been up there for years, but I love it.
5477000	5479000	It makes it sound like this game could be a frickin' movie.
5479000	5480000	Yeah.
5480000	5485000	But, you know, we've all ranted and raved about this game,
5485000	5489000	but the thing that, for all of the stuff that this game does,
5489000	5492000	to have such an amazing soundtrack on top of it,
5492000	5498000	it's just like, this is like the Monte Cristo at Disneyland.
5498000	5500000	The perfect sandwich.
5500000	5501000	That's what this is.
5501000	5503000	It's the perfect, perfect game.
5503000	5504000	Do you have like a favorite song?
5504000	5506000	Well, yeah, so I was saying, it's one in,
5506000	5508000	I can't remember the level it is, but it's like,
5508000	5510000	I think the blue background where it's all,
5510000	5513000	it's one of the walking levels, one of the adventure levels,
5513000	5516000	and it's just really chill.
5516000	5519000	It's just a chill piece, and I'll listen to that just over and over.
5519000	5521000	I think my very favorite is the one we just heard
5521000	5525000	with the very first corridor, Area Zero.
5525000	5526000	Yeah.
5526000	5527000	Yeah, I love it.
5527000	5530000	And I like this music too, because it sets the mood for the game.
5531000	5533000	And also, you find Lolo.
5533000	5534000	You do?
5534000	5540000	Yeah, but again, it's just one of, I think,
5540000	5542000	the best soundtracks there are.
5542000	5546000	And like I said, you know, now I guess a month ago,
5546000	5549000	this segment is going to be to highlight soundtracks
5549000	5551000	that you might not be familiar with,
5551000	5554000	or might not have thought of amongst the best,
5554000	5556000	but they really deserve the attention.
5556000	5558000	So you probably will not be highlighting Super Mario Brothers,
5558000	5559000	because everybody knows that one.
5559000	5562000	Everyone knows it, or the Zelda games, or Mega Man.
5562000	5563000	Okay.
5563000	5566000	You know, I'm not going to go in those directions.
5566000	5570000	I'm going to go with the stuff that people don't often think of.
5570000	5573000	And with as much as we talk about Guardian Legend,
5573000	5575000	usually we're talking about how it plays.
5575000	5577000	Yeah, and to be fair, you know, again,
5577000	5580000	we've been doing the Classic Game of the Week since Episode 250,
5580000	5582000	and I'm sure this was one of the first ten.
5582000	5584000	I don't think it was the first.
5584000	5585000	I don't think it was the first.
5585000	5592000	I think you did the game with the witches that you love, scrolling.
5592000	5594000	Not Cotton. I didn't do Cotton, did I?
5594000	5596000	I thought you did do Cotton was one of your first picks.
5596000	5597000	Hold on, hold on.
5597000	5598000	But I'm looking at it.
5598000	5599000	It's Fantasy Zone.
5599000	5600000	It's Fantasy Zone.
5600000	5601000	It's Fantasy Zone.
5601000	5602000	Oh, it's Fantasy Zone?
5602000	5603000	Okay.
5603000	5604000	Yeah.
5604000	5606000	But Guardian Legend had to have been one of the first ten.
5606000	5608000	Guardian Legend was six episodes in.
5608000	5610000	Okay, so yeah, we haven't talked about it in several years.
5610000	5612000	I can't believe I did Blazing Star before that,
5612000	5614000	but I love Blazing Star in Kid Dracula.
5614000	5615000	I think it was one of those things,
5615000	5617000	you were saving Guardian Legend for a week,
5617000	5619000	then you couldn't come up with anything else,
5619000	5622000	and six weeks in, you couldn't come up with anything else.
5622000	5624000	Well, then you did the week after.
5624000	5625000	I did.
5625000	5626000	And then Loki did the week after that.
5626000	5628000	You probably weren't here for a little bit.
5628000	5630000	You probably took a break, so it happens.
5630000	5633000	All right, anyway, anything else to say about the soundtrack here
5633000	5636000	for our Classic Soundtrack of the Month, the Guardian Legend?
5636000	5641000	I am still super pissed that the fan remake got C&D'd, because...
5641000	5644000	Oh, yeah, there's some footage of it out on YouTube, you can see.
5644000	5647000	But I just wish that they would just still do it under the table
5647000	5648000	and release it anyway.
5648000	5649000	Well, you know.
5649000	5650000	That's Lolo.
5650000	5652000	Isn't it Lunar or something?
5652000	5655000	I don't know, but I just bought Lolo because it looks like Lolo.
5655000	5656000	It does.
5656000	5658000	But anyway, all right, I'm going to go ahead and kill the music there,
5658000	5660000	take it back to us in the studio.
5660000	5661000	There it is, your classic soundtrack.
5661000	5664000	Everybody's reading me because it says Classic Game of the Week on the side.
5664000	5665000	I didn't want to ruin it.
5665000	5668000	If I'd put Classic Soundtrack, you would have known you'd get a soundtrack tonight,
5668000	5669000	so just deal with it.
5669000	5670000	All right, anyway.
5670000	5671000	You wrote you.
5671000	5673000	Without any Roxy, thank you.
5673000	5676000	All right, I love the Guardian Legend, it's a great soundtrack.
5676000	5679000	Anyway, we're going to take a little break here in studio,
5679000	5681000	but what's awesome about tonight,
5681000	5684000	so what we've been doing on Twitch the past few weeks,
5684000	5686000	because Dark Soccer has been working Sundays,
5686000	5689000	she's kind of had a segment that fills in here,
5689000	5691000	she's been doing her Classic Game of the Week as a segment.
5691000	5693000	Well, tonight we have something very special.
5693000	5697000	We actually have a viewer video that's going to be talking about MAGFest.
5697000	5700000	So sg100matt sent us a video, and I'm going to play it for you guys now.
5700000	5704000	He did a great job on it, where he's actually going to take you guys to MAGFest
5704000	5706000	to get to experience a little bit of it.
5706000	5711000	And I love this, and with Jamie hopefully coming back to the show full time in March,
5711000	5714000	if everything goes her way with the work situation,
5714000	5720000	I really want to invite other people to kind of help build this segment with us,
5720000	5722000	like a little halfway point during the show,
5722000	5724000	so we have a chance to get up and refill our waters
5724000	5726000	and use the restroom and all that stuff,
5726000	5729000	and hopefully we can feature other Twitch streamers.
5729000	5732000	We can feature maybe some indie games or some other things.
5732000	5739000	So anyway, I'll let sg100matt take it from here with a special look at MAGFest,
5739000	5741000	and we'll be back after this.
5741000	5744000	Hello, LR and VOG Network.
5744000	5746000	This is sg100matt.
5746000	5750000	I am sending you the first ever video email to the mailbag.
5750000	5752000	Now that the show is on Twitch,
5752000	5756000	I figure this will be a fun way to send an email.
5756000	5760000	It also gives Rob's voice a little bit of a rest so he doesn't have to read anything.
5760000	5763000	So for years you've heard me and along with many others talk about MAGFest.
5763000	5767000	I know that I've called in several times over the years to talk about it,
5767000	5771000	and the one thing I always notice is that I've had a hard time articulating
5771000	5775000	and explaining what MAGFest is all about.
5775000	5777000	Now that we have this wonderful platform and video,
5777000	5781000	I figured why don't I just show you what MAGFest is all about.
5781000	5785000	Now over the course of the weekend I took some pictures and shot some video
5785000	5790000	to kind of really show what my experience is there.
5790000	5792000	Now don't worry, podcast listeners.
5792000	5795000	I'll do my best to explain what I'm showing.
5795000	5797000	But enough about me. Let's get to it.
5797000	5801000	So MAGFest is short for Music and Gaming Festival,
5801000	5803000	and it takes place just outside of Washington, D.C.
5803000	5806000	at the Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center.
5806000	5810000	The show runs 24 hours nonstop from Thursday to Sunday.
5810000	5814000	The place hosts the panels, concerts, and various forms of gaming and fandom.
5814000	5816000	The show is run by fans for fans.
5816000	5821000	It's not corporate run, and none of the major studios or console makers are there.
5821000	5823000	It has a strong, independent feel,
5823000	5827000	and almost feels like a big video game party with your friends.
5827000	5830000	The first thing I'm going to talk about is the music portion of the festival.
5830000	5832000	Throughout the weekend in the Grand Ballroom at the Convention Center,
5832000	5836000	various video game cover bands and chiptune artists took the stage.
5836000	5839000	This year's group of talent was a stacked roster of artists,
5839000	5842000	such as MC Frontalot of the Tiberian Sons,
5842000	5845000	featuring Command & Conquer composer Frank Klepacki,
5845000	5847000	and friend of the VOG network, Megaran.
5847000	5852000	There was also Chiptune Rave hosted by a slew of DJs.
5852000	5855000	One concert that I really enjoyed was the Bit Brigade,
5855000	5857000	who played the entire Mega Man 2 soundtrack,
5857000	5860000	while a player speedran the entire game.
5860000	5862000	It was definitely a fun experience.
5867000	5870000	Now the last concert I really enjoyed was performed by Bernalfoss.
5870000	5873000	He performed at the Gaylord Hotel Lobby Bar,
5873000	5875000	which was the first for the festival.
5875000	5879000	It was really cool to kind of see him perform in a piano bar sort of environment.
5892000	5894000	Now the cute aspect that I like about MAGFest
5894000	5897000	is the music wasn't just dedicated to the concert halls.
5897000	5900000	In these little squared off spaces known as Jam Pods,
5900000	5904000	people can bring in an instrument or DJ setup to just jam out.
5904000	5906000	It's kind of like MAGFest's take on street performers,
5906000	5911000	but it's just regular attendees playing a DJ set or an artist covering gaming tunes.
5913000	5915000	Moving on to the rest of the festival.
5915000	5918000	One of the big draws to MAGFest is downstairs at the Expo Hall.
5918000	5921000	The Expo Hall is home to the Vendor's Hall,
5921000	5923000	the MAGFest Indie Games Showcase,
5923000	5926000	as well as the console, free play, and arcade room.
5926000	5929000	Now both the arcade and console room are open,
5929000	5933000	free to play, 24 hours non-stop during the duration of the festival.
5933000	5938000	There are over 100 arcade machines that are provided by collectors and vendors
5938000	5941000	from around the area, and they're all set on free play.
5941000	5943000	No quarters or tokens required, and again,
5943000	5946000	they're running 24 hours the whole weekend.
5946000	5950000	If you have an itch to play a game at 3 AM, you certainly could.
5951000	5953000	So the arcade hall was split up into different sections.
5953000	5958000	There was an area called Candyland that had a lot of Japanese-style sit-down arcade cabinets
5958000	5962000	which had various fighting games and bullet-hell shooters all loaded onto them.
5966000	5970000	There was a Japanese import and music game area that had a lot of Bimani games
5970000	5974000	like Pop'n Music, Bimani 2DX, U-Beat, as well as Technica.
5974000	5978000	Various versions of Pump It Up and DDR were also there.
5978000	5982000	There were just a ton of games there, including Initial D and Bishiboshi, just to name a few.
5983000	5986000	There was a great selection of retro machines as well.
5986000	5993000	I got to play some of my favorite machines like Row Blasters, Virtual On, Dragon's Lair, and Tempest.
5993000	5998000	One great sight was seeing an F-Zero AX full-motion arcade machine.
5998000	6002000	Those were really hard to find and it was a huge line the whole weekend planned.
6004000	6007000	This year had probably the biggest showing of pinball machines.
6007000	6011000	There were so many machines, both new and old, that were fun to play.
6011000	6017000	There were dual table machines. There were tables from both big companies and small companies.
6017000	6021000	There were tables with LCDs. There were tables that were just giant.
6021000	6024000	There were just tables that I had never seen before.
6024000	6028000	If you were a pinball fan, there was a table for you.
6028000	6032000	Now on top of all that, there were periodic tournaments in the arcade hall
6032000	6039000	ranging from games like Killer Queen, to Windjammers, to pinball tournaments, to even a claw machine tournament.
6039000	6043000	There was just so much to do in the arcade hall this year.
6045000	6047000	Let's talk about indie games.
6047000	6053000	The MAGFest Indie Game Showcase is always a treat and a great spot to see and meet a lot of indie developers.
6055000	6058000	A friend of the show YYR showcased there a few times.
6059000	6063000	One game I really liked is a game called Soundfall by Drastic Games.
6063000	6070000	Soundfall is a music-driven dungeon crawler where players hack and slash their way through levels to the beat of music.
6070000	6074000	The game looks beautiful and extremely well done.
6074000	6079000	Be sure to check it out when it comes out this year on PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Switch.
6079000	6084000	Now the Indie Showcase isn't just dedicated to games that are set for mass release.
6084000	6088000	There are some really wacky arcade machines as well.
6088000	6093000	Some of these are just proof of concepts and not meant for mass release.
6093000	6097000	One game in particular had you control characters using four juicers.
6097000	6104000	As you can see here, users touch the direction they want to move their character that's on the screen
6104000	6108000	using said juicer and oranges that were supplied.
6109000	6118000	In the console hall, you can rent out various consoles and games at MAGFest's massive library to play at any time during the weekend.
6118000	6124000	Say if you wanted to play Adventure on the Atari 2600 or TimeSplitters on the PS2 at 3am.
6124000	6128000	Then you can just come on down to the hall and play them.
6128000	6135000	There are over 100 TVs set up for people to play any game they wanted to in MAGFest's game library.
6135000	6138000	And even run a tournament if you wanted to.
6139000	6146000	One of the highlights of the expo hall that has become a frequent guest over the years to the festival are the BattleTech pods.
6146000	6157000	The BattleTech pods are a fun experience where you can play a 10-minute free-for-all mech battle against other people in a fully enclosed pod with flight controls.
6157000	6163000	After your game, you are even given a printout of the complete stats of your match.
6164000	6170000	There were about 8 pods there and were provided by a group called Virtual World from Michigan.
6170000	6176000	All these machines, despite being built in the early 90s, were extremely well maintained and taken care of.
6176000	6182000	And of course, they were free to play and were running 24 hours throughout the festival.
6185000	6189000	Now outside of the expo hall, MAGFest had a lot going on this weekend.
6189000	6193000	There were a ton of different panels running at all times during the festival.
6193000	6201000	There were voice actor panels, there were celebrity Q&As from people like WWE wrestler and hardcore gamer Xavier Woods.
6201000	6204000	There were panels about teaching people how to make things.
6204000	6207000	There was a class about how to make your own chainmail armor.
6207000	6211000	There was a class taught by Freddie Wong about video editing.
6211000	6216000	There were even some strange panels like the lore and mythos of Disney's Haunted Mansion.
6216000	6221000	The one panel I'd been waiting to go for years, but never got a chance to, was the Yoga for Gamers panel.
6221000	6228000	It is something that's always popular, but I just never had the time to do it, but now I made the effort to try it out.
6228000	6234000	This class was taught by an actual yoga instructor, who played some calming video game music while we did yoga.
6234000	6241000	I'd never done yoga before, and for a first timer, this was a really fun experience.
6242000	6246000	Some have said that MAGFest has gotten too big and has outgrown its venue.
6246000	6254000	I don't dispute that MAGFest has certainly exploded and has even branched down into other festivals like MAG Labs and MAG West.
6254000	6259000	But this year's show had so much going on that the crowds felt spread out.
6259000	6270000	There were the concerts, there were the panels, there were the cosplay and LARP scene, the expo hall, there was laser tag, there were bridge commander rooms and demo scene rooms.
6270000	6274000	There was a classic computer museum, which I'm showing right now.
6282000	6287000	There was also a massive board gaming room, which moved to a different location this year.
6287000	6293000	Anyways, it did not feel like the 22,000 plus attendance that MAGFest reported this year.
6293000	6296000	The crowd really just felt spread out and manageable.
6296000	6300000	This was certainly one of the better MAGFests that I attended all my years of going.
6300000	6306000	The staff at MAGFest really focused on being inclusive and accessible to everyone, like there were gender neutral bathrooms.
6306000	6310000	At registration, pronoun ribbons were provided for people who wanted one.
6310000	6316000	MAGFest even provided listening impaired attendees licensed sign language interpreters.
6316000	6319000	All in all, the vibe at MAGFest felt great this year.
6319000	6324000	The big complaint that most people have, though, was the hotel situation.
6324000	6330000	Despite there being five hotels within walking distance of the festival, those tend to sell out quickly.
6330000	6337000	I, for example, had to stay off site two miles away because I did not look at what the hotel lottery system at MAGFest has.
6337000	6344000	But even that turned out fine because the travel to the show through shuttle and ride sharing was manageable and easy.
6344000	6347000	All in all, I had a great time at MAGFest this year.
6347000	6351000	If you're a gamer of any kind, I can't recommend MAGFest enough for you.
6351000	6353000	So that pretty much wraps it up for me.
6353000	6357000	I hope you enjoyed this video email and this little trip to MAGFest with me.
6357000	6361000	And I hope this video inspires you to make your own video content for the show.
6361000	6364000	But anyways, back to the show.
6366000	6370000	That was great! Oh my god, sorry, the video started over again because I didn't hit the button fast enough.
6370000	6374000	But that was great! Thank you so much, s2100matt, for that look at MAGFest.
6374000	6376000	That was so awesome. I loved it.
6376000	6382000	I hope that doesn't scare you guys off from doing your own because I think Matt has a lot of practice editing a video.
6382000	6386000	But I would hope that some other folks will consider doing their own video.
6386000	6391000	I thought that was a great way to take a look at something that maybe not everybody has seen before.
6391000	6397000	I've been to MAGFest a couple of times before, but I haven't been in a couple of years.
6397000	6403000	So it was kind of neat to see how some of the offerings this year were a little bit different and some of that cosplay.
6403000	6407000	I know not everybody on the podcast will get to see this, sorry, do the best we can.
6407000	6411000	But there was a really adorable Snorlax cosplayer that showed up in that video.
6411000	6414000	I was like, oh my god, that's so cute! It was really great.
6414000	6421000	It felt like we got to really see that through the eyes of one of our listeners and people that participate with the show, s2100matt.
6421000	6427000	I would really encourage you guys, if you are going off to conventions that we need to see or be a part of, send some video over.
6427000	6434000	It doesn't have to be as graceful as what Matt did, but send us a little bit of an intro and an outro and we'll figure out a way to put it together.
6434000	6436000	It was very, very, very cool.
6436000	6445000	So yeah, going to chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, we had some really great feedback there on the video.
6445000	6447000	AlphaKnotagram saying very grateful for that.
6447000	6452000	And yeah, it was great. Loved it. So very cool.
6452000	6454000	That was your first time getting to kind of see MAGFest.
6454000	6458000	Do you guys hear Alan and Jamie? Did it look pretty cool? It looked like fun?
6458000	6459000	Yeah, yeah.
6459000	6460000	Lovely cool.
6460000	6462000	Yeah, it looked pretty cool. We'll have to do something like that for DragonCon too this year.
6462000	6466000	So look for that. Maybe VOG will produce our own stuff too.
6466000	6474000	Anyway, we're going to travel around and do some rapid fire news now and talk about some other news that's happened in the gaming industry pretty quickly here in our rapid fire news segment.
6474000	6478000	So let's go over to where are we starting? I think Alan tonight with rapid fire.
6478000	6480000	Yep. Yep.
6480000	6485000	So everyone's favorite video app for watching torrented movies and porn.
6485000	6487000	VLC media player.
6488000	6495000	Or it also powers the videos. The video you just saw from Messaging100Matt was VLC is built into OBS.
6495000	6497000	I believe in truth in journalism.
6499000	6500000	No fake news here.
6500000	6506000	Yeah. So VLC media player, which has been around for ages. That is true.
6507000	6525000	The president and lead developer of it Jean Baptiste Kempf has sort of wondered aloud, maybe VLC on the Switch would be fun and useful for people with Switch because the owner base is quite large because Switch is a smash hit.
6525000	6533000	Right now VLC is available on Xbox One. So this is not completely uncommon for them to do something like this.
6533000	6537000	So that is maybe a thing. He's just sort of, you know.
6537000	6540000	Yet still no Netflix. But VLC.
6540000	6541000	Oh, yeah.
6541000	6543000	Yeah. There's Hulu at least I guess.
6543000	6547000	Funny you should say Hulu. I love that segue.
6547000	6548000	Who who?
6549000	6560000	Hulu is dropping Wii U support the little Nintendo console that just couldn't on February 20th of this year.
6560000	6568000	I don't know if Hulu means or no longer supporting it means you can run the app if you already have it.
6568000	6575000	And if you try to contact tech support about it, they'll be like, no, we that's old news. We don't help people with problems with that.
6575000	6582000	Or if it means it's going to be like if you try to load the app, it's going to give you an error message.
6582000	6596000	The point is, is that they're not if you have Hulu on the Wii U and that is your main source of watching Hulu find literally anything else to watch Hulu on after February 20th.
6596000	6597000	Literally anything else.
6597000	6606000	Yeah. If you if you have Hulu for your toaster oven and that's they support that. Watch your shows on the toaster oven with Hulu or the switch.
6606000	6610000	I imagine many we you people have moved on to switch many, many, many of them. So there you go.
6610000	6616000	Yes. So no longer supporting I think is a vague term. It just means.
6616000	6619000	Run Hulu anywhere else than the Wii U.
6619000	6620000	All right. I'm done.
6620000	6627000	Speaking of things you can run on many different places, Rocket League, that full cross-play compatibility, it's live now.
6627000	6632000	So PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC all can do battle.
6632000	6638000	Psyonix did announce this past week that the cross-play beta supports I guess is the beta, but it's still live.
6638000	6641000	So that means you can now all play Rocket League together. That is awesome.
6641000	6646000	We've come a long way since last year when Sony was really dragging their feet on it. So this is great.
6646000	6650000	I think there's going to be just more and more and more people that go in on this.
6650000	6654000	So anyway, I guess it was three months ago they did the cross-platform beta.
6654000	6657000	So now Rocket League players on all these different platforms,
6657000	6663000	they have the option to randomly match make either with or against each other and all the different online match types.
6663000	6670000	That is awesome. But you do want to make sure that the cross-play platform box is ticked in the gameplay tab.
6670000	6673000	It is not something that necessarily will be enabled.
6673000	6680000	We talked earlier in the show about the Nintendo games coming to the Nintendo games that are on Switch Online.
6680000	6685000	We talked last week about Super Nintendo games possibly coming to Switch Online because of a data mine.
6685000	6691000	Well, the data mine went a step further in this past week probably because of the latest update we just got that brought,
6691000	6695000	what games did we get, Blaster Master and Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link.
6695000	6698000	And then we got that fighting game in Japan only.
6698000	6704000	But anyway, also in that update, descriptions. Some of them for a Super Nintendo game.
6704000	6709000	Apparently the description for Super Mario World that reads,
6709000	6716000	there's no time for vacation when Bowser and his Kooplings are up to no good during a vacation in Dinosaur Land and so on and so on.
6716000	6720000	It's the little flavor text for the game that's in the little library when you go to select games.
6720000	6723000	It's in there now in English for Super Mario World.
6723000	6727000	The interesting thing is that's the only game that has English.
6727000	6734000	But some other languages like Super, excuse me, some other games like Super Mario Kart got a Spanish description.
6734000	6741000	In fact, a lot of games in there now have descriptions in looks like eight different languages.
6741000	6744000	Including German, Spanish, French, Italian and so forth.
6744000	6747000	All the countries where Nintendo usually localizes its stuff.
6747000	6750000	The only one that's in there is Super Mario World for English.
6750000	6755000	But folks have been able to data mine based on the descriptions.
6755000	6758000	Potentially a launch lineup could look like this.
6758000	6760000	Again, this is all rumors.
6760000	6775000	But Breath of Fire 2, Contra 3, Demon's Crest, F-Zero, Kirby Dream Course, Kirby Dream Land 3, Kirby Super Star, Mystical Ninja, Pilot Wings, Poppin' Twinbee, Super Goals and Ghosts, Mario All Stars is still kind of a question mark.
6775000	6780000	Super Mario Kart, Super Mario World, Super Metroid, Super Punch-Out, Zelda A Link to the Past.
6780000	6782000	That's a very solid list.
6782000	6784000	You've got your Marios, your Super Metroid, your Zelda in there.
6784000	6789000	But then you have some deeper cuts like Poppin' Twinbee, like Jamie's kind of losing it over there.
6789000	6795000	Breath of Fire 2, Mystical Ninja and some more like deeper cuts that were good Super Nintendo games.
6795000	6797000	So that's a hell of a launch.
6797000	6800000	I hope this is a thing Nintendo is about to go.
6800000	6804000	You wanted us to bring even more online? Here you go, Thwack.
6804000	6806000	So, we'll see.
6806000	6808000	Again, this is all rumors.
6808000	6814000	But, I mean, why would they put the descriptions in there if they weren't planning to do something with it? Am I right, kids?
6814000	6816000	Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6816000	6819000	Actually, some pretty neat things.
6819000	6829000	Bandai Namco released a little bit of teaser information about a new game focusing on the world of Dragon Ball Z in particular.
6829000	6835000	So, they've just listed as Dragon Ball Game Project Z Action RPG.
6835000	6843000	As well as bringing out more characters for Dragon Ball Fighter Z, including someone from Universe 11.
6843000	6850000	So, now I have to go back and watch all that Dragon Ball again to figure out who the one from Universe 11 is.
6850000	6853000	I have to actually remember what Universe 11 is from Super.
6853000	6856000	That's just how much I remembered of it.
6856000	6858000	I don't know shit about Dragon Ball, sorry.
6858000	6862000	Other than Ultra Instinct and Vegeta losing his shit like he always does.
6862000	6865000	I know that's a meme. I know that much.
6865000	6869000	He always loses his shit. That's just a trope.
6869000	6873000	And then, last but not least in this.
6873000	6880000	There is going to be, well at least it was listed this way as a separate download.
6880000	6887000	They said that Final Fantasy X HD Remaster for Switch is going to be available on the game card.
6887000	6891000	But Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster is download only.
6891000	6895000	Which, I mean, I've got originals. That's cool.
6895000	6898000	I have an import of it. That's also cool.
6898000	6901000	But are they portable?
6901000	6908000	Well, no. But I mean, I think it's just kind of weird that they would have one on the card and not sell the other.
6908000	6913000	Especially with what we were going over for about owning the copy versus the downloadable.
6913000	6916000	Good point. One, this is rumor.
6916000	6922000	But two, it's one of those things that I could really see this happening because Mega Man Legends did the same thing.
6922000	6924000	It might just be cartridge size limitations.
6924000	6927000	And if they were to include a second physical card, they'd have to up the price of it.
6927000	6928000	Why not?
6928000	6930000	Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.
6930000	6934000	Or why not take orders or something for it?
6934000	6938000	But I will say, I know you do have the originals, but the remaster is really good.
6938000	6940000	Did you get the remaster on Playstation 4 or PC?
6940000	6942000	No, I didn't get the remasters.
6942000	6944000	Oh, you should. They are good. They did a good job with them.
6944000	6946000	And they're on PC and PS4 and everything else.
6946000	6948000	Does Titus still have like an idiot?
6948000	6952000	Of course. That's the part you have to have. Ha ha!
6952000	6954000	I'd rather not.
6954000	6955000	Yes, Alan?
6955000	6959000	The X and X2 remasters for...
6959000	6960000	Ten.
6960000	6969000	Oh, sorry. Ten and Ten Two remasters for Steam PC are unfortunately, and I discovered this myself when I tried playing it about a month ago.
6969000	6973000	And then I hit the forums and read it to see if I could do anything about this.
6973000	6978000	It's actually hard capped at 30 frames a second, which on PC seems very silly.
6978000	6981000	I thought there was a hack for it.
6981000	6983000	I looked for one. I couldn't find one.
6983000	6994000	But Square has since learned their lesson because Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2 and the Final Fantasy XII remaster with Balthier and Fran all run at 60 or higher.
6994000	7000000	So it's just Ten and Ten Two, which is one of the first remasters they put out on Steam.
7000000	7005000	Aside from the little single digit ones, like four and five and whatnot.
7005000	7008000	The sort of water colored and 3DS ones.
7008000	7012000	That is an unfortunate thing for the PC version.
7012000	7017000	In our chat room, great comment from Spyro Jonathan, who would know a few things about the Spyro series, saying
7017000	7020000	this same situation happened with Spyro Reignited Trilogy.
7020000	7023000	Everyone had to download Spyro 2 and 3.
7023000	7025000	So it's not like this is unheard of.
7025000	7029000	And as I mentioned before, the Mega Man collection did the same thing.
7029000	7033000	Interesting. For me personally, I love the fact that these games are coming to Switch.
7033000	7035000	I love that they're going to be portable.
7035000	7036000	I'm not going to buy them again.
7036000	7039000	I have them on PC. I have them on PlayStation 4.
7039000	7042000	My need to have it portable is not that strong.
7042000	7045000	How often do you see me playing my Switch portable anyway?
7046000	7047000	When I go on a flight.
7047000	7049000	When Animal Crossing comes out.
7049000	7052000	Or in bed when you're waiting for your eyes to get tired.
7052000	7053000	That's about it.
7056000	7058000	That's it. I think that's it for rapid fire news.
7058000	7061000	But we want to travel around the world and check out some release dates.
7061000	7064000	And check out some video games coming to a store near you.
7064000	7066000	I think we'll start in the US.
7066000	7068000	Are you going to take this over for Loki tonight?
7068000	7069000	Yes.
7069000	7070000	What have you got for us?
7070000	7075000	On the 22nd, Chaos Child is coming out on Windows.
7075000	7076000	For Windows.
7076000	7080000	Also on the 22nd, the Raven Remastered for Nintendo Switch.
7080000	7084000	On the 23rd, we have At the Gates on Windows.
7084000	7087000	The 24th brings us three titles.
7087000	7090000	Battle Fleet Gothic Armada 2 for Windows.
7090000	7096000	Life is Strange 2 Episode 2 Rules on Windows, PS4 and Xbox One.
7096000	7099000	And My Memory of Us on the Nintendo Switch.
7099000	7102000	That's all on the 24th of January.
7102000	7108000	The 25th brings us Resident Evil 2 Remaster on the big three.
7108000	7111000	Actually, that's not big three because Nintendo Switch would be in that.
7111000	7115000	On Windows slash Steam, PS4 and Xbox One.
7115000	7117000	The Resident Evil 2 Remaster.
7117000	7121000	Any releases after that bleed into the next week.
7121000	7124000	So there's going to be another OLR before that.
7124000	7126000	But yeah, the 29th is Kingdom Hearts 3.
7126000	7128000	But again, that is more than a week out.
7128000	7131000	Okay, so here's why I was thinking Kingdom Hearts 3 was this week.
7131000	7133000	Because looking at the Japanese release dates,
7133000	7135000	they're getting Kingdom Hearts on the 25th.
7135000	7137000	So they're getting it a few days earlier.
7137000	7140000	So Kingdom Hearts 3 will be out in the wild officially.
7140000	7141000	Not any of that.
7141000	7143000	Is it 2002 again? What the fuck?
7143000	7144000	I know, right?
7144000	7146000	So in Japan, looking at the Japanese release dates,
7146000	7148000	obviously that is the huge tent pole for this week.
7148000	7150000	And there's not a lot of games going up against it.
7150000	7153000	Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.
7153000	7155000	Very big deal.
7155000	7157000	I believe there's a whole little, like,
7157000	7161000	you can get the game with, like, an art statue thing.
7161000	7165000	I think they may even have a special PlayStation for it out there as well,
7165000	7167000	which is a pretty big deal.
7167000	7170000	But also coming out, actually, Biohazard is coming out.
7170000	7172000	Biohazard 2 is the Resident Evil 2.
7172000	7175000	So it's going up against Kingdom Hearts over there in Japan.
7175000	7177000	So that's pretty cool.
7177000	7181000	And let's see, going over to some other releases.
7181000	7184000	Senran Kagura Burst on the...
7184000	7186000	I'm sorry, that was a U.S. date that snuck in there.
7186000	7191000	Higurashi no Naku Koro no Hyo in Japan is out on the 24th.
7191000	7194000	So there's a couple games sneaking in there the day before Kingdom Hearts,
7194000	7195000	but that's it.
7195000	7198000	Suke to Suke 2-Day Sankaku Renai
7198000	7204000	and Sengoku Hime Senun Sanuraku Guren no Ishii in regular and limited edition.
7204000	7208000	Checking the Switch real quick to see if anything's coming out there.
7208000	7210000	No, I think they're taking the week off.
7210000	7214000	Probably conceding this week over to the PlayStation 4
7214000	7218000	and the huge, huge, huge release of Kingdom Hearts 3.
7218000	7221000	So traveling over to Europe, were you able to get that?
7221000	7227000	The Raven remastered on the 21st on the 24th Resident Evil 2 remake.
7227000	7233000	And also on the 24th, Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story plus Bowser Jr.'s journey.
7234000	7235000	Alright.
7235000	7236000	That's it.
7236000	7239000	Well, we are about to go to the mailbag, but before we do...
7239000	7245000	I just realized I should have downloaded and played the Resident Evil 2 demo for PC.
7245000	7246000	It may not even...
7246000	7250000	Because I know for Resident Evil 7 where you start in the house
7250000	7252000	and you have that flashback of the journalist,
7252000	7255000	that demo, you can't get it anymore because they want you to buy the game.
7255000	7257000	So I hope that that demo is still available.
7257000	7259000	Did you get it for any of your consoles?
7259000	7262000	No. I mean, no.
7263000	7264000	Rob, don't curr.
7264000	7267000	I played the one on PlayStation and I did really enjoy it,
7267000	7271000	but it's just like, again, the scary, violent stuff is not usually...
7271000	7273000	But yet, I live for Silent Hill and all that stuff.
7273000	7275000	So it's like there's exceptions to every rule,
7275000	7278000	but I haven't been up and up on the Resident Evil, sorry.
7278000	7280000	But there was a story we cut from the show tonight
7280000	7284000	that talked about that you can extend the time on the demo somehow.
7284000	7286000	Bobby Blackwell is saying right now in chat,
7286000	7291000	the RE2 demo lasts 30 minutes and then it's over, one-time play.
7291000	7293000	So it self-destructs.
7293000	7294000	I know on YouTube...
7295000	7297000	I know on YouTube and Twitter,
7297000	7302000	I saw links to videos of people beat Resident Evil 2 new demo
7302000	7304000	in under three minutes,
7304000	7307000	which I don't know if it's an 80% glitch thing
7307000	7309000	or you just run past all the zombies and you're at the end.
7309000	7312000	Hey, you don't have to shoot a goddamn thing.
7312000	7314000	People are speedrunning demos.
7314000	7316000	Well, then again, I'm laughing,
7316000	7320000	but our buddy Flaco Jones did the PT thing for a long time.
7320000	7321000	Yeah.
7321000	7322000	People do.
7322000	7325000	Even if you don't finish the demo, it's over.
7325000	7328000	Oh, so it's just you have 30 minutes, bitch, hurry up.
7328000	7329000	Pretty much.
7329000	7330000	Okay.
7330000	7331000	Well, they want you to...
7331000	7333000	The object is to make money.
7333000	7334000	They don't want to give the whole thing away for free.
7334000	7336000	Well, the object should be to entice me to play the game,
7336000	7338000	not frustrate me, but...
7338000	7339000	All right.
7339000	7341000	You know what's a good demo, Ni No Kuni?
7341000	7343000	Stop. Now you're trolling.
7343000	7345000	All right, let's get to the mailbag.
7345000	7349000	You guys like to email us over at participate at orangelontrader.com
7349000	7351000	and we read your emails live on air.
7351000	7353000	I get to take a break this week because Jamie's back.
7353000	7355000	So your turn, Jamie.
7355000	7356000	All right.
7356000	7357000	Hello, Alar.
7357000	7359000	We don't have music for this anymore, do we?
7359000	7360000	Not yet.
7360000	7361000	That's one of my future improvements.
7361000	7362000	Sorry, guys.
7362000	7363000	Okay.
7363000	7364000	We'll have little...
7364000	7366000	My plan is to do little intro titles
7366000	7369000	with little titles and the music and all that dumb stuff.
7369000	7370000	Okay.
7370000	7371000	Yeah.
7371000	7372000	I was just like, why is it quiet?
7372000	7373000	Yeah, sorry.
7373000	7374000	In the future.
7374000	7377000	I write to you with the boldest of bold predictions for 2019.
7377000	7380000	It's probably too late for the time capsule,
7380000	7382000	but it's too ballsy to not share.
7382000	7384000	This is actually a two-part prediction.
7384000	7386000	The first part of this is that Microsoft will reveal
7386000	7389000	the successor to the Xbox One this year.
7389000	7391000	For now, I'm just going to call it the Xbox Two,
7391000	7392000	or maybe it's number two.
7392000	7394000	Ha ha.
7394000	7396000	The second part of this,
7396000	7398000	and the one that could really shock the gaming world
7398000	7399000	if this comes true,
7399000	7401000	is if Microsoft were to come out and say,
7401000	7403000	hi, did you buy the Xbox One X?
7403000	7404000	Well, if you did, guess what?
7404000	7406000	You already own something that will play Xbox Two games.
7406000	7408000	Even better, you'll get to play them
7408000	7410000	before the new console even comes out.
7410000	7412000	As far-fetched as this may sound to some,
7412000	7414000	I believe there's a good chance it could come true.
7414000	7415000	Can I jump in here?
7415000	7417000	Because actually Microsoft,
7417000	7421000	I believe this actually wouldn't quite be the shock
7421000	7422000	that you're saying.
7422000	7424000	I mean, sorry, I don't want to, like,
7424000	7425000	just argue with you,
7425000	7426000	but Microsoft has kind of said.
7426000	7428000	Why don't we let the email finish?
7428000	7429000	Oh, is he addressed this?
7429000	7430000	I'm sorry.
7430000	7431000	Okay.
7431000	7434000	Stop jumping the gun, Rob.
7434000	7435000	Mm-mm-mm.
7435000	7440000	The likelihood is that Xbox Two is just going to be
7440000	7442000	a more powerful Xbox One,
7442000	7444000	down to being 100% backwards compatible,
7444000	7446000	and the reality is the Xbox One X
7446000	7448000	has over four times the graphic performance
7448000	7449000	of the original Xbox One.
7449000	7451000	It's almost a generational power gap.
7451000	7453000	Would it truly be impossible for the One X
7453000	7455000	to run Xbox Two games at a slightly lower level
7455000	7457000	of performance or detail?
7457000	7458000	Microsoft has demonstrated
7458000	7460000	with their backwards compatibility initiatives
7460000	7462000	and other consumer-friendly policies
7462000	7464000	that your investment in Xbox games
7464000	7466000	can move forward in time beyond the console's generation
7466000	7468000	where the investment was made.
7468000	7470000	This would be the ultimate form of doubling down
7470000	7473000	on that philosophy, and I, for one, hope they do it.
7473000	7475000	I'll end this by addressing something
7475000	7477000	that was discussed on last week's show.
7477000	7479000	The whole light guns can't work on LCD things.
7479000	7481000	Namco already developed a gun controller
7481000	7483000	that works on LCDs back in 2007.
7483000	7485000	It's called the GunCon3,
7485000	7487000	and it works using the same type of infrared technology
7487000	7489000	that the Wii Remote uses.
7489000	7492000	However, it uses two sensors instead of the Wii Remote's one,
7492000	7494000	vastly improving its accuracy.
7494000	7497000	The controller works perfectly and is a lot of fun to use,
7497000	7499000	but unfortunately, only three games were ever made
7499000	7500000	that support it.
7500000	7502000	Time Crisis 4, Raising Storm, and Deadstorm Pirates,
7502000	7504000	which I didn't know Deadstorm Pirates came out,
7504000	7507000	and I need to have it, because I fucking love that game.
7507000	7509000	Well, if you're going to buy it on the eShop,
7509000	7510000	you better do it for the 31st.
7510000	7511000	No, I'm going to get the disc.
7511000	7512000	Good.
7512000	7513000	Oh, well.
7513000	7515000	Congrats on the successful move to Twitch,
7515000	7516000	and have a great week.
7516000	7517000	Hugs, Aaron, YYR.
7517000	7520000	Okay, so it didn't totally address what I was going to say.
7520000	7523000	Yeah, we should let our listeners finish.
7523000	7524000	Yes, fine, fine, fine.
7524000	7525000	Let me finish.
7525000	7526000	But here's the thing.
7526000	7529000	When the X, I could swear when they announced Project Scorpio,
7529000	7532000	they said something about that was the direction that they were going,
7532000	7535000	that they want you to be able to like,
7535000	7538000	that Xbox was just going to be like a platform,
7538000	7540000	and that you'd have these different players for a platform,
7540000	7543000	kind of like iPhone, right?
7543000	7545000	Like most iPhone games that come out,
7545000	7547000	you can play on your X, you can play on your 8,
7547000	7548000	you can play on your 7.
7548000	7549000	10.
7549000	7550000	You know, whatever.
7550000	7553000	You can play as, Mortal Kombat X is on the brain tonight.
7553000	7555000	But you can play on all these different phones.
7555000	7556000	They might run a little slower.
7556000	7559000	They might have decreased performance and lower graphics on the older stuff.
7559000	7562000	But for the most part, they'll play on a variety of things.
7562000	7565000	And so I know we've kind of had this talk before,
7565000	7567000	because I feel like Microsoft has kind of tipped their hand
7567000	7569000	that this may be where they're going.
7569000	7572000	Now, where I do think in the email, it's kind of like,
7572000	7576000	oh, I didn't think about that, is when YYR mentions,
7576000	7579000	that you'll be able to play them here first.
7579000	7582000	That would be something kind of, hmm.
7582000	7584000	Like, can you imagine if like, you know,
7584000	7586000	a console is about to come out with these launch titles,
7586000	7589000	but yet the launch titles are playable on what you already have.
7589000	7591000	But if you want to play them better, you'd get the new console.
7591000	7593000	It would be interesting to see what effect that might have.
7593000	7595000	Perhaps it would be like sort of a limited one.
7595000	7601000	Like, for example, some of the RAM cart games for the Saturn,
7601000	7603000	you could play some of them without them,
7603000	7606000	but you would be missing like frames of animation
7606000	7608000	or features in the game.
7608000	7611000	Like, you'd get music or animation or something like that.
7611000	7614000	So I'm not trying to, like, I wasn't trying to be rude to the email.
7614000	7618000	I just feel like we've had this talk about Microsoft
7618000	7620000	and like the phone ecosystem type of thing before.
7620000	7622000	So I feel like Microsoft's kind of tipped their hand
7622000	7625000	that they're thinking about going this way anyway.
7625000	7630000	But you kind of, the rest that you spell out there is very interesting,
7630000	7632000	and we'll see how that plays out.
7632000	7635000	There's only one other email that came out this week.
7635000	7640000	There's a cool game that came out this last week that I've been playing.
7640000	7643000	Grammar, please.
7643000	7646000	I was just curious if anyone has checked it out or not.
7646000	7648000	It's called Farm Together.
7648000	7652000	It's surprisingly extremely fun and a really good time killer.
7652000	7656000	I found myself losing track of time getting lost in the progression system.
7656000	7658000	You can play by yourself. That sounds personal.
7658000	7660000	Or with friends or random people.
7660000	7663000	That sounds fun with random people.
7663000	7668000	It's actually crazy how seamless the loading time is going into other people's worlds.
7668000	7670000	It's only 20 bucks and well worth it, in my opinion.
7670000	7674000	That might just be the perfect kind of game you can stream and play with viewers.
7674000	7677000	Anyway, until next time, Frodo Swagons.
7677000	7679000	P.S. Hi, Jamie. Hi.
7679000	7682000	I did not know this game, but I love listener recommendations,
7682000	7683000	so I might have to check it out.
7683000	7684000	Those show.
7684000	7685000	Thank you.
7685000	7686000	That's it for emails?
7686000	7687000	Yes.
7687000	7689000	All right, well, we hope we will get some more emails.
7689000	7693000	And look, this is how the inbox is supposed to look, Rob.
7693000	7694000	Empty.
7694000	7696000	I can't see because you're not on cam. Sorry.
7696000	7699000	You know what? Look at this.
7699000	7700000	Do you guys see this?
7700000	7703000	This is what the inbox is supposed to look like.
7703000	7704000	Damn it.
7704000	7706000	All right, she can do that now. She couldn't do that before.
7706000	7707000	All right.
7707000	7710000	Moving on.
7710000	7712000	Let's get back into some more gaming news.
7712000	7716000	And then a little later in the show, we're going to be taking your calls via Discord.
7716000	7718000	Stop it, Jamie. Stop playing with the camera.
7718000	7719000	All right.
7719000	7720000	It's kind of fun.
7720000	7721000	All right, let's get to some stories.
7721000	7724000	Alan, what do you have for us?
7724000	7730000	Microsoft, who's the author or, sorry, developer and publisher of Forza.
7730000	7731000	Publisher.
7731000	7732000	Publisher.
7732000	7734000	I believe it was developed by Phase 10.
7734000	7735000	Oh, God, what's her name?
7735000	7736000	Series 5?
7736000	7738000	What's her name? Something 10.
7738000	7739000	Anyway, sorry.
7739000	7740000	I forget the developer in the moment.
7740000	7741000	Womp, womp.
7741000	7745000	I just totally killed my own momentum on this story.
7746000	7748000	Turn 10. That's it.
7748000	7758000	There were going to be emotes of Vine, Internet meme, YouTube culture, the Carlton, the floss,
7758000	7762000	which is what cultural phenomenon Fortnite is also doing.
7762000	7768000	But Fortnite is getting the shit suit out of them by all of these different content creators or dance creators.
7768000	7774000	So in a preemptive mood to avoid all of this BS, my point is that Forza is getting those stripped out.
7775000	7777000	Microsoft is washing their hands of it.
7777000	7784000	At the very least, they want to see how the Fortnite stuff plays out.
7784000	7791000	Because I know that Alfonso Ribeiro of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, who has the Carlton, he also did it on...
7791000	7793000	Silver Spoons.
7793000	7795000	Oh, yes, and Silver Spoons.
7795000	7797000	Little Ricky Schroeder.
7797000	7799000	Little Ricky Schroeder.
7802000	7806000	So he is suing Fortnite.
7806000	7811000	I don't think... I was going to say Soulja Boy, but the Soulja Boy dance is not in Fortnite.
7811000	7813000	But a bunch of other people...
7813000	7823000	Actually, when Jamie was reading the emails, I was furiously Googling to see if something that I had heard on a podcast about choreographers was true.
7824000	7827000	You know, in Hollywood, there's all these different unions.
7827000	7830000	There's the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, Directors Guild.
7830000	7840000	And they all say, if this is a hit and it's being played 15 years from now, or a Blu-ray boxset of this is sold, we still get a check cut to us.
7840000	7847000	Which is why all of the actors from Friends, they don't have to make anything else in their life as far as new material.
7847000	7851000	Lisa Kudrow continuing to grace us with her presence is a favor. It really is.
7851000	7861000	Yes. And I had heard that choreographers were one of the few entities in Hollywood that don't have a union sort of caping for them.
7861000	7863000	So they're sort of free agents.
7863000	7871000	So if there was that lip sync battle show with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, where he did against Anthony Mackie, I think is his name.
7871000	7877000	He did Rhythm Nation by Janet Jackson, which is one of the most iconic dances of all time.
7877000	7879000	With the March March Turn, March March Turn.
7879000	7886000	And I was wondering, obviously they had to pay Janet and her label rights to use Rhythm Nation on that show.
7886000	7890000	But they also copied the dance from the video step for step.
7890000	7896000	Does the choreographer, whether it was Paula Abdul or whoever it is, got...
7896000	7900000	Who really did do some of the choreography with Rhythm Nation.
7900000	7904000	Yeah, that's how Paula Abdul got her started before she went into singing.
7904000	7912000	Anyway, if that person also got paid. It's a very interesting question that this Fortnite dance thing has revealed.
7912000	7920000	The Google reading that I did while emails were being shown were...
7920000	7926000	That actually it's all up to the contract that the choreographer has with that studio.
7926000	7933000	There has to be a recording of the thing that makes it permanent, like this is how this dance goes.
7933000	7939000	Yes, actually, dances can be copyrighted and choreographers can receive royalties.
7939000	7945000	The question is, did these individuals who came up with these Vine and YouTube meme dances,
7945000	7953000	if they had taken that step to copyright that stuff, however that's done...
7953000	7955000	Like Backpack Kid, who's more of a meme than an actual...
7955000	7958000	Yeah, like Backpack Kid, who did the floss on SNL.
7958000	7961000	Which, no, I will not be doing those dances again.
7962000	7971000	If they sort of shot themselves in the foot by waiting until someone else copied their intellectual property before they sued.
7971000	7974000	I find this whole story fascinating.
7974000	7978000	I do too because, again, it just kind of all goes into like there are these new...
7978000	7982000	Like the technology is going faster than the laws that really support it.
7982000	7988000	This has to even do with Let's Play and the things that are big on Twitch and so forth right now.
7988000	7991000	It's this really uncharted space, you know?
7991000	7994000	It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, but I don't blame...
7994000	8001000	It was actually Playground Games did Horizon, Turn 10 did the main Forza series, whatever you want to call it.
8001000	8003000	Sorry, I misattributed that.
8003000	8009000	But Forza Horizon, that's why I was frustrated I couldn't remember who did it because I love that series, it's so good.
8009000	8014000	But I can kind of understand why they're like, maybe we just want to slip that out and see...
8014000	8018000	We got a bunch of other dances in here, maybe no one will notice.
8018000	8021000	But they wanted to take that preemptive caution.
8021000	8026000	So who knows how long the Fortnite lawsuits are going to take or whether they are settled out of court
8026000	8030000	and there's an NDA and we never hear what actually happens, if the dances stay in the game or not.
8030000	8036000	But Microsoft is like, let's have them get muddy
8036000	8045000	and we will watch after the embers cool off, if they're going to put those dances into the game.
8045000	8054000	And I imagine... I'm curious to see if it's settled, if Microsoft will include the dances
8054000	8058000	even if it means they have to write those people a check or if they're going to be greedy and say,
8058000	8063000	okay, actually we can't use these dances but we're not going to pay the royalties either and just strip them out entirely.
8063000	8070000	It's all fascinating to me but anyway, yeah, no dances in Forza. For now.
8070000	8077000	Well, let's move on and talk about something else that seems to not be happening for now, I don't know.
8077000	8079000	But you know, Mighty No. 9, remember that?
8079000	8084000	That was the Mega Man, we're going to make this game because they're not making a new Mega Man
8084000	8090000	and then the actual guy who made Mega Man went over to make this game and it was met with some mixed success.
8090000	8092000	Some people were like it, some people say it's not so great.
8092000	8094000	It was as welcomed as a fart in an elevator.
8094000	8098000	You know what, having done the playthrough, I can kind of see both sides of it.
8098000	8102000	I understand why people were into it but I also understand what it was lacking.
8102000	8107000	But anyhow, the point is when they did this Kickstarter and all this stuff they said it was going to come to these platforms.
8107000	8111000	And now it's interesting because we're seeing this happen with a lot of different Kickstarters
8111000	8115000	and things that have been crowdfunded is that by the time the game is finally ready to come out
8115000	8118000	these platforms don't necessarily exist anymore.
8118000	8122000	So a lot of people have still been asking though, because Mighty No. 9 does have its fans,
8122000	8127000	people are still asking, you know I backed this to see a 3DS version of it, 3DS when?
8127000	8135000	And I don't know guys, but Nintendo of Europe recently removed the listing for Mighty No. 9 3DS on the official website.
8135000	8142000	It is still on the North American website but that should be something interesting that it's removed from the Europe version.
8142000	8147000	You know level 5 did absorb concept so maybe something happened there.
8147000	8150000	Nothing was ever really concretely said on the Vita port either.
8150000	8155000	Everybody's just assuming it's dead because well, not even Sony is planning to support the Vita much longer,
8155000	8157000	certainly beyond this year.
8157000	8163000	So yeah, don't know. And people are wondering, is Red Ash still a thing that's coming?
8163000	8167000	And how is this treatment going to impact Red Ash if at all? And you know, so forth.
8167000	8172000	I don't know, like I have to admit, like if they're just going to kill it on the 3DS platform, fine.
8172000	8178000	Come out and say it's done because the Switch does handheld and it can all happen over there, like just do it.
8178000	8183000	And the people that backed it on the 3DS can redeem it wherever they want on the Switch or the PC or what have you.
8183000	8186000	But it would be nice to kind of have some definitive answers there,
8186000	8194000	but it is a very interesting side effect of crowdfunding and just how long some of these things have taken to download.
8194000	8199000	VG Realness in chat says, okay but for real, how long ago did that Kickstarter start?
8199000	8203000	Bobby Blackwell says, I first donated to it in 1984.
8205000	8207000	It's been around a while.
8207000	8212000	St100mad says, I loved Mighty No. 9. It's really shitty though that they didn't honor what they said they were going to do.
8212000	8218000	I'm a mixed bag. Like the 3DS is still an active platform.
8218000	8223000	Nintendo is still supporting it with the Luigi Mansion 2 and all that stuff.
8223000	8228000	You know how I feel about it. I kind of feel like the Switch is also portable.
8228000	8231000	It's better, whatever, but I get the argument.
8231000	8238000	But Kid's Console, even Loki bought the 2DS for his kids this past holiday and that's been a big thing.
8238000	8242000	I'm sure they were playing that on the car ride down to the broccoli farm, so anyway.
8242000	8246000	Alright, a few more stories for you guys before we get to our Discord calls.
8246000	8249000	Yes, we are changing it tonight. We're going to be taking calls via Discord.
8249000	8252000	I'll outline how that's going to work a little closer to when we get to the segment.
8252000	8255000	But if you are not already on our Discord, you do want to get there,
8255000	8260000	vognetwork.com slash Discord is all you need to get into the Discord server.
8260000	8264000	And all the instructions right now are pinned in the Orange Launch Radio channel, but I will reiterate.
8264000	8270000	We're going to be doing it a very similar way to how we were inspired by some other folks.
8270000	8275000	So we'll illustrate how that's going to work a little later on.
8275000	8279000	But first we have some more news for you guys, including another story from Dark Sakura.
8279000	8286000	Yes, well and it's a shame that Shane isn't around for this one.
8286000	8290000	Because there's a Power Rangers fighting game coming out for my birthday.
8290000	8292000	For me, for my birthday.
8292000	8294000	They made it specifically for you.
8294000	8295000	Well it just says in April.
8295000	8297000	Dark Sakura's Power Rangers.
8297000	8302000	It's called Power Rangers Legacy Wars, Power Rangers Battle for the Grid.
8302000	8308000	So it's Rangers and villains, old and new versus each other.
8308000	8313000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and eventually PC.
8313000	8323000	Being worked on by Enway, Hasbro, and Lionsgate to do 25 years of American Power Rangers stuff.
8323000	8326000	Although, I don't know.
8326000	8332000	I want a game like that, but I want it to be the entirety of all Toei Super Sentai.
8332000	8334000	Which is hundreds of Sentai.
8334000	8335000	Yeah, that would be amazing.
8335000	8338000	The one that Shane was really into was the train.
8338000	8342000	The ones where their mechazords or whatever were trains.
8342000	8345000	My favorite was Mega Ranger, which we got as Power Rangers in space.
8345000	8348000	And I hate Power Rangers in space, but I love Mega Ranger.
8348000	8350000	It seems like they skip seasons here.
8350000	8354000	Like they never brought the train one here, but they bring other ones here.
8354000	8355000	It's interesting how that works.
8355000	8356000	We had Car Ranger.
8356000	8358000	What was it, Turbo?
8358000	8362000	And then they brought, I don't think they did Maji Ranger over here, did they?
8362000	8363000	But anyway.
8363000	8364000	Yeah, I think they do kind of skip seasons.
8364000	8366000	I mean, in Japan, I imagine they do like three or four a year.
8366000	8367000	Shane would know.
8367000	8368000	You're right.
8368000	8369000	I thought they did like one a year.
8369000	8371000	Like one new series a year, but.
8371000	8374000	Nifty in Chat says, I want TV Rita.
8374000	8375000	That would be awesome.
8375000	8376000	Rest in peace.
8376000	8377000	Yeah.
8377000	8378000	Oh, yeah.
8378000	8379000	That's right.
8379000	8380000	So.
8380000	8381000	All right.
8381000	8382000	Well, I'm looking forward to that.
8382000	8384000	I do like a good fighting game and Power Rangers are fun.
8384000	8387000	Even if I'm not as into it as everybody else, I still appreciate it.
8387000	8388000	So anyway, let's move on.
8388000	8389000	We got some more stories.
8389000	8391000	Something in one of your favorite series.
8391000	8392000	Sorta.
8392000	8393000	Right, Alan?
8393000	8394000	Yeah.
8394000	8400000	I bought Elder Scrolls Online like a year or two ago when it was on sale.
8400000	8404000	One of the many 80% off Steam holiday sales type situations.
8404000	8408000	I've never installed it or activated my account or registered it or anything.
8408000	8409000	So think about that.
8409000	8414000	I'm mostly talking out of my ass here, but I am a huge Oblivion Morrow and Skyrim fan,
8414000	8417000	especially when it comes to playing them on PC and mods.
8417000	8420000	He has beat every quest in Skyrim.
8420000	8422000	Besides the generated ones and that.
8422000	8423000	Yeah.
8423000	8424000	Every.
8424000	8425000	Every one.
8425000	8426000	There's one exception to that.
8426000	8427000	The vampire DLC.
8427000	8428000	Oh.
8428000	8429000	I have not finished that storyline.
8429000	8431000	But weren't you like, it's trash.
8431000	8435000	No, it was just like, I need to wait for mods for this to make it better.
8435000	8436000	Okay.
8436000	8437000	To make it better.
8437000	8438000	I thought you didn't like the whole vampire concept.
8438000	8440000	I thought that's what it was.
8440000	8444000	So the latest expansion for Elder Scrolls Online.
8444000	8450000	It's Elsewhere, which is the land where...
8450000	8453000	Ow, what's happening on the camera?
8453000	8455000	Food is important.
8455000	8461000	That is going to be released on, thank you, June 4th.
8461000	8468000	Elsewhere is where the Khajiit has wares if you have coin.
8468000	8471000	The cat, they make really good assassins.
8471000	8472000	You're going to go there.
8472000	8478000	And it's a place that I don't think you've visited since the early, early Elder Scrolls
8478000	8482000	games like that were on the 486 or whatever.
8482000	8491000	Your Dagger Falls and your arena where all of Cyrodiil or Tamriel was available to you.
8491000	8494000	This is what this place looks like with modern graphics.
8494000	8500000	And it's going to be via, I think, Elder Scrolls Online takes place...
8500000	8504000	I don't know where it is on the timeline, but it's way, way, way in the past so they
8504000	8507000	can do whatever they want and not have it worry about the continuity.
8507000	8510000	So there's a trailer for it on YouTube.
8510000	8512000	It looks very pretty.
8512000	8514000	And if you're into the cat people, if you're a furry...
8514000	8516000	No, I'm just kidding.
8516000	8518000	Look forward to it.
8518000	8521000	And that is coming out on June 4th.
8521000	8522000	Alright.
8522000	8523000	Yep.
8523000	8524000	Cool.
8524000	8525000	That's one of those games.
8525000	8526000	I'm like you.
8526000	8529000	I bought it on PlayStation 4 on an Uber sale and then I was like, eh, it's okay.
8529000	8530000	And I didn't really play it again.
8530000	8532000	But I need to check it out again because it was pretty cool.
8532000	8533000	Alright.
8533000	8534000	Anyway, let's see.
8534000	8537000	I think this is our last story for tonight before we get to our Discord calls.
8537000	8542000	So if those of you that are on Discord, if you want to start lining up in the green room, you can.
8542000	8544000	But for now, one more story for you guys.
8544000	8546000	And, of course, it had to be about this.
8546000	8552000	Well, you know, Mario Brothers U, excuse me, new Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe came out on the Switch,
8552000	8554000	which is the reimagining of the Wii U.
8554000	8556000	So, of course, you know where I'm going.
8556000	8557000	You read it in the sidebar.
8557000	8560000	But even those of you listening on the podcast, you know where I'm going with this.
8560000	8563000	Of course, it's been modded and hacked already because hackers are going to hack.
8563000	8564000	And what did they do?
8564000	8567000	They put Bowsette into the game.
8567000	8568000	That's right.
8568000	8573000	Bowsette has already been hacked into new Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe.
8573000	8576000	And folks are playing already as Bowsette in the game because, you know,
8576000	8580000	you're supposed to be able to do this whole like Peachette thing where she takes on Toadette.
8580000	8581000	Yeah.
8581000	8583000	But, of course, somebody made it so that you can play as Bowsette.
8583000	8588000	So, those of you that are like, Bowsette, waifu, you can actually play that
8588000	8592000	and live out your fantasy and the privacy of your own home with the lights off
8592000	8596000	and all that good stuff if that is what your heart so desires.
8596000	8600000	Anyway, actdeftinchat says, I pass.
8600000	8605000	Orangewright says, did they talk about the Donkey Kong 64 charity livestream?
8605000	8611000	No, but I believe that is what I was just reading about that before the show went live tonight.
8611000	8614000	Let me explain the Discord thing and then I'll jump to that Orangewright.
8614000	8619000	So, the way its calls are going to work now on Discord is that if you would like to be on the show tonight,
8619000	8621000	you're going to join our green room.
8621000	8624000	So, in the Discord, there's a channel that says green room.
8624000	8625000	You just join that.
8625000	8627000	There's already some people in there now so you can see where it is.
8627000	8631000	And then if you want to mention a little bit about what your call is going to be about
8631000	8634000	in the Orange Lounge Radio channel, that helps us kind of know like,
8634000	8637000	oh, this is what we're going to be anticipating and expecting.
8637000	8642000	And then one at a time, we'll drag you into the live room where we're here with the studio.
8642000	8645000	And you can be on the show.
8645000	8650000	Please, please do not be offended if you're not picked to be on the show for a night
8650000	8655000	because we're going to try to really mix it up with new people and familiar faces around these parts.
8655000	8659000	Also, although I know our pal Bobby Blackwolf also made a switch tonight,
8659000	8662000	we will not be incorporating video at this time.
8662000	8664000	We're not Orange Lounge video right now.
8664000	8666000	We're Orange Lounge Radio so we're still going to just keep these calls.
8666000	8668000	Audio only for now.
8668000	8670000	Not to say I won't change my mind on that in the future,
8670000	8674000	but especially with the way we're doing it to set up to work with our technical setup
8674000	8677000	where we're using two different computers to accomplish the streaming.
8677000	8679000	It just makes more sense for us to do the audio only.
8679000	8684000	So all that being said, I wanted to address the comment really fast
8684000	8688000	that was said by Orange Right about the Donkey Kong 64 charity livestream.
8688000	8691000	So apparently they were doing, and I'm sorry, I don't know all the details,
8691000	8694000	and Orange Right, feel free to help me out in chat if you know more of the details.
8694000	8696000	But apparently it was like they're doing a charity livestream
8696000	8700000	and it was for some type of trans charity.
8700000	8703000	I don't know if it's education or protecting trans youth,
8703000	8706000	but I know it was bringing awareness for that.
8706000	8711000	And I just know her as AOC now,
8711000	8717000	but she's that one new Democrat in the House that people really cannot stop obsessing about.
8717000	8719000	And with good reason.
8719000	8723000	She's got quite some strong ideas and has no problem putting them out there.
8723000	8725000	Okay, I'm not going to get into politics.
8725000	8727000	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I believe is her name.
8727000	8729000	Is that right? Okay, thank you.
8729000	8732000	So anyway, apparently she was on this stream.
8732000	8734000	And I don't know if they called her or what the deal was.
8734000	8736000	They asked her to come on or whatever.
8736000	8739000	But she actually joined the stream and gave a little chat
8739000	8742000	and talked about how the Nintendo 64 was her favorite console.
8742000	8744000	And even though she didn't have one herself,
8744000	8747000	she went over to her friend's house to play it, which, you know, mood.
8747000	8748000	That was me exactly, right?
8748000	8752000	My buddies upstairs in the college dorms had it, so I had to play theirs.
8752000	8755000	And she then went on to talk about, you know,
8755000	8758000	why the trans protections are important and so on
8758000	8761000	and why the charity was a good thing and kind of give that political angle.
8761000	8765000	But, I mean, it is something to say, despite however you feel about politics.
8765000	8767000	Like, I don't really care right now.
8767000	8771000	It is something to say that a member of the House of Representatives
8771000	8774000	just appeared on a Twitch livestream.
8774000	8779000	Like, if you don't think Twitch is mainstream, y'all, it's here.
8779000	8780000	Right?
8780000	8782000	Have you seen her tweets lately, too?
8782000	8785000	Oh, well, yeah, she's very, she's a meme machine.
8785000	8787000	All your base.
8787000	8790000	Well, you know, even if you don't agree with her politics,
8790000	8792000	I don't agree with her politics 100% of the time,
8792000	8794000	but I'm at a good, like, 70, 80%.
8794000	8799000	But anyway, she had this picture of herself with a glass of wine
8799000	8802000	watching Drag Race, and I was like, mood.
8802000	8804000	She says she wants to be a judge.
8804000	8808000	I think part of the reason why I like her from that element,
8808000	8810000	again, you know, I'm really trying not to touch politics,
8810000	8814000	but just, like, I feel like I see somebody from my generation
8814000	8818000	and my people in Congress, and that is a really cool feeling.
8818000	8819000	You know what I mean?
8819000	8820000	Yeah.
8820000	8821000	So, that's part of why I really like it.
8821000	8824000	And to see her jump into a Twitch stream, I think, is really awesome.
8824000	8827000	So, anyway, let's see.
8827000	8829000	I do have one.
8829000	8830000	Yeah, please.
8830000	8835000	My favorite headline and response to AOC
8835000	8839000	and whatever controversy her antics inspired.
8839000	8840000	There was a story.
8840000	8842000	I don't know if it was Wall Street Journal, wherever,
8842000	8844000	that was like, given AOC's antics,
8844000	8848000	should we be electing more millennials to Congress?
8848000	8851000	And the response was, well, given how linear time works,
8851000	8853000	I think that's going to work itself out.
8853000	8854000	Yes.
8854000	8856000	I died.
8856000	8857000	Yes.
8857000	8860000	Well, yes, I think that will just inherently happen.
8860000	8863000	Anyway, all right, we're going to, for the very first time,
8863000	8865000	start to take some calls via Discord.
8865000	8868000	So, we're going to get to our very first Discord caller,
8868000	8869000	who I think should be there.
8869000	8870000	Hello.
8870000	8871000	You're on Orange Tons Radio.
8871000	8872000	Who's this?
8872000	8873000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
8873000	8874000	Hey, Akdeft.
8874000	8875000	It is great to hear from you.
8875000	8876000	You're the very first one.
8876000	8877000	Do we sound okay?
8877000	8879000	Yeah, you sound pretty okay.
8879000	8880000	Pretty great.
8880000	8881000	Hey.
8881000	8882000	You sound great to us.
8882000	8883000	So, welcome.
8883000	8885000	And I know you wanted to talk about something tonight
8885000	8886000	that I kind of addressed earlier in the show,
8886000	8887000	but I want your take on it.
8887000	8889000	So, please, what's on your mind tonight?
8889000	8891000	Well, Pokemon Go.
8891000	8893000	Yeah, like always.
8893000	8897000	But, yeah, like you already talked about on the beginning of the show,
8897000	8899000	it was the Phoebus event.
8899000	8904000	It was the most frustrating three hours I have ever, ever lived.
8904000	8909000	And I really don't want to do that again ever.
8909000	8911000	Like, wow.
8911000	8913000	Why did you hate it?
8913000	8914000	Why did you hate it?
8914000	8917000	It's not necessarily that I hated it,
8917000	8921000	because the concept itself, when it was announced,
8921000	8925000	I was, oh, this does look cool.
8925000	8929000	It seems like a really, really good way to play
8929000	8935000	instead of just like trying to catch a random Pokemon
8935000	8937000	like in other community days.
8937000	8943000	So, it was okay on the concept, but the execution really, really failed.
8943000	8946000	And like we were saying at the beginning of the show,
8946000	8948000	three hours wasn't enough.
8948000	8953000	It should have been probably a whole week, even just a weekend,
8953000	8959000	just like Saturday, Sunday, do the missions or the investigations.
8959000	8962000	Like a mini event, like they did the love discs and stuff like that.
8962000	8964000	Yeah, and it would have worked fine.
8964000	8970000	Like really, really okay, but only three hours was not enough.
8970000	8971000	It was really frustrating.
8971000	8974000	Even though I did get a Phoebus shiny,
8974000	8979000	and it was actually like good percentage of IVs, it was 93%.
8979000	8984000	It's still like, my God, I was exhausted.
8984000	8991000	Even my records, because I was driving with my friend,
8991000	8995000	and we were pretty much traversing all over the city,
8995000	8999000	searching for PokeStops that gave the missions.
8999000	9003000	Do you have a lot of spots in, because I know you're in Mexico,
9003000	9005000	and you're in Mexicali, if I remember right.
9005000	9009000	I know sometimes in the other countries that aren't like the US and Japan,
9009000	9012000	PokeStops can be kind of sparse, because Ingress portals are sparse.
9012000	9018000	Do you have places like graveyards or parks or places that have a lot of portals,
9018000	9022000	or do you really have to travel from place to place?
9022000	9024000	We're starting to get more portals now,
9024000	9030000	because more people are actually playing Ingress and getting to level 10.
9030000	9035000	Even in my own house, my brother is a level 10.
9035000	9038000	So we're making portals off Ingress.
9038000	9040000	And you know, actually, just a real quick aside,
9040000	9044000	Ingress really stepped up some of their OPR reviewing right now,
9044000	9046000	and they're doing like rewards.
9046000	9051000	I got a new portal up in Ingress, because I reviewed 100 candidates in OPR,
9051000	9054000	and it bumped my submission to the top, and I got a new portal over at,
9054000	9056000	I don't want to say where, because I don't want to give away where I live,
9056000	9058000	but a nearby park, and we just went there today.
9058000	9060000	Because I was like, oh, there will be a new PokeStop there, and there sure was.
9060000	9061000	So it was kind of fun.
9061000	9064000	But anyway, Alan, you wanted to jump in here too with something.
9064000	9070000	Yes, I was going to say, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to set aside
9070000	9073000	the three hours to grind these missions.
9073000	9078000	So when the event started, I cleared out my missions, and I got three of them,
9078000	9080000	because that's how many you're allowed to have,
9080000	9083000	and those three were ultimately all I did.
9083000	9089000	Two of them were to walk your buddy and earn a candy,
9089000	9091000	so I loaded up, of course, Magikarp.
9091000	9097000	So after I got those three Phoebuses, and neither one of them were shiny,
9097000	9101000	I mean, I didn't even finish those last two quests until six or seven in the evening,
9101000	9104000	which was way after it had finished.
9104000	9107000	I did a total of four quests.
9107000	9113000	And I absolutely understand Niantic asking themselves the question,
9113000	9118000	how can we incentivize playing the game for a certain period
9118000	9121000	that's not as blown up as a community day?
9121000	9122000	And this is not it.
9122000	9123000	It was a swing and a miss.
9123000	9127000	So as far as experimenting goes, great.
9127000	9130000	But guys, this is not it.
9130000	9132000	I did 32.
9132000	9135000	Oh my god, you did 32?
9135000	9136000	Yeah.
9136000	9137000	I know Shane did a lot.
9137000	9141000	Shane did a lot, and he got a shiny on his first and one of his last,
9141000	9144000	but he went over to the college here,
9144000	9148000	and because he tried to go downtown,
9148000	9151000	but the Women's March was going on the same day, which is cool,
9151000	9153000	but it shut down all the streets.
9153000	9156000	So he got frustrated trying to park, because there's people everywhere,
9156000	9158000	which is a huge event.
9158000	9160000	So I guess he'd never been over to the college.
9160000	9162000	And by this point, when we were kind of hearing,
9162000	9165000	like, downtown's a mess, this event is a mess,
9165000	9168000	Alan and I were like, let's go get brunch.
9168000	9170000	We'll just pick up some things.
9170000	9171000	Fuck it.
9171000	9172000	We're just going to go get brunch.
9172000	9173000	And that's what we did.
9173000	9176000	We just went and had brunch, and then we picked up these quests
9176000	9178000	that were like, catch 15 Pokémon,
9178000	9181000	and of course, there's nothing spawning at brunch.
9181000	9184000	Luckily, I save all my quest rewards.
9184000	9185000	I don't know why, but I do.
9185000	9186000	They were on brunch too.
9186000	9188000	Yeah, apparently they all were too.
9188000	9192000	So I got all my 15 catches for my quest rewards I had stocked up.
9192000	9193000	So, anyway.
9193000	9195000	Any other thoughts you wanted to get out on Pokémon GO
9195000	9197000	or anything else, Akdept, before we let you go?
9197000	9200000	Yeah, returning a little bit to the Pokéstops thing
9200000	9202000	and the portals thing on Ingress.
9202000	9205000	Yeah, they're kind of sparse here,
9205000	9210000	but not necessarily that they do not exist,
9210000	9212000	so there's not too many.
9212000	9218000	They're just, the big locations here are pretty much in some places,
9218000	9225000	so we had to go to downtown, to historical downtown,
9225000	9227000	then to the university here,
9227000	9231000	and other many places that have those many Pokéstops,
9231000	9234000	because, yeah, even though more portals,
9234000	9237000	more Pokéstops are appearing in the town,
9237000	9240000	it's not necessarily that great still,
9240000	9243000	but we're working there, at least.
9243000	9246000	But to be fair, even in a place like where we live, Sacramento,
9246000	9249000	if we want to get a concentration of Pokéstops,
9249000	9252000	we have to go downtown, to the capital or to the college.
9252000	9256000	Alan and I live in suburbia,
9256000	9260000	so we're lucky to live right down the street from a park,
9260000	9262000	so we have a couple of things, a couple of portals,
9262000	9264000	but that's really it.
9264000	9266000	We have to kind of get in the car and go somewhere
9266000	9268000	if we want to really get stops.
9268000	9271000	But not to be, because we probably do have it better.
9271000	9273000	There's probably more stuff here,
9273000	9275000	just because we have more people to play Ingress
9275000	9278000	and network here than probably where you do where you are.
9278000	9282000	But it will be interesting that Niantic making that change to OPR
9282000	9284000	is going to have a ripple effect.
9284000	9287000	I've seen at least five new portals in our area
9287000	9290000	and talking about suburbia go live in the last week
9290000	9293000	since they made this change, and they're all becoming stops or gyms.
9293000	9295000	We actually got a new gym out of the whole thing,
9295000	9297000	so it'll be interesting to see how that all plays out.
9297000	9300000	So, anyway, thank you so much for the call, ActDeft,
9300000	9303000	and for being our very first caller on Discord.
9303000	9305000	Appreciate it. Have a good one, buddy, okay?
9305000	9307000	Hey, thanks for having us always.
9307000	9309000	Yeah, no problem. Thanks for being here.
9309000	9311000	All right, that was ActDeft here on the program.
9311000	9314000	Let's get to another call here on Discord.
9314000	9315000	We're going to go to this call.
9315000	9317000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9317000	9321000	Hey, this is Metal Mayhem, also known as Raging Eater.
9321000	9323000	Hey, Metal Mayhem, how you doing?
9323000	9324000	I'm good, how are you?
9324000	9327000	A little bit on the cold side, but always good.
9327000	9329000	Yeah, I know. We've been having some really bad storms.
9329000	9331000	It's not cold here.
9331000	9333000	These are not bad storms.
9333000	9336000	Well, they're California bad, girl.
9336000	9338000	They're not even a storm.
9338000	9340000	Our power got knocked out. It was bad enough.
9340000	9342000	Yeah, for 30 minutes. That's nothing.
9342000	9343000	All right, anyway.
9343000	9345000	How many candles do you have?
9345000	9347000	You haven't even burned that one yet.
9347000	9349000	Everybody has it because I have a flashlight in my pocket.
9349000	9351000	Everybody has it worse than we do. Anyway, sorry.
9351000	9354000	What's on your mind tonight, Metal Mayhem?
9354000	9362000	All right, well, since Dr. Stocker did a segment earlier on game soundtracks,
9362000	9368000	I would like to talk about that just to tie in with the show.
9368000	9374000	Now, as the three of you obviously already know,
9374000	9379000	game soundtracks have been included in games for a while now.
9379000	9382000	You can buy them on iTunes and stuff like that.
9382000	9389000	But at one point, they were a bit of a rarity to be included with games.
9389000	9397000	That being said, assuming that you have game soundtracks in your personal libraries,
9397000	9401000	the first one that you ever got.
9401000	9403000	Okay, so here's my answer to this.
9403000	9405000	So, Dr. Stocker, I don't know if you heard the whole question,
9405000	9407000	but basically asking about game soundtracks.
9407000	9409000	I know you would probably have an impressive library
9409000	9412000	because game soundtracks were not like before there was iTunes,
9412000	9414000	before there was Spotify, game soundtracks.
9414000	9417000	You had to go to import stores to get them and stuff.
9417000	9418000	Or Chinatown.
9418000	9420000	Yeah, they weren't very common in the states.
9420000	9421000	Or anime conventions.
9421000	9423000	Yeah, but anyway, here's the funny thing, Metal Mayhem,
9423000	9427000	something you may have forgot in the design of this question, and that's okay.
9427000	9431000	Remember where Orange Lounge Radio started as a dance dance revolution
9431000	9435000	and music game related show because that is my honest answer.
9435000	9439000	I started getting into game soundtracks with the dance dance revolution soundtracks
9439000	9442000	because I loved me that cheesy Eurobeat that you heard in things like
9442000	9445000	Dance Dance Revolution third mix and stuff like that.
9445000	9450000	And that kind of went on to the dance mania albums, which were big in Japan,
9450000	9453000	which were a lot of the licensed music came from.
9453000	9456000	If you ever listened to OLR in the early, early, early days
9456000	9461000	when it was a live 365 station, we would play music not just from
9461000	9464000	like Bimani games, Konami games, we played dance mania mix
9464000	9467000	because we wanted to do it because obviously DDR freak radio was a thing
9467000	9468000	and we wanted to be different.
9468000	9469000	We were first though.
9469000	9472000	Yeah, so well, you know, but we wanted to be different.
9472000	9474000	So we kind of had that whole different take on things.
9474000	9477000	So, yeah, I mean, that's when I really started getting into gaming soundtracks
9477000	9479000	and realizing there was stuff to import.
9479000	9481000	I had a shit ton of anime soundtracks back in the day.
9481000	9482000	Yeah.
9482000	9484000	When did you first get into gaming soundtracks?
9484000	9487000	Well, Dan and I were kind of into it right away because when I moved out here,
9487000	9490000	he had already had he imported Symphony of the Night,
9490000	9491000	which came with the soundtrack.
9491000	9493000	So we were already listening to that.
9493000	9495000	And then, you know, we were picking him up for fighting games.
9495000	9500000	I had I got like a Street Fighter Alpha 2 soundtrack that came with like
9500000	9507000	a screensaver and shit, you know, back for Windows 95 or me or whatever.
9507000	9511000	And then we had picked up all the Marvel versus Capcom ones.
9511000	9513000	We had some King of Fighters soundtracks.
9513000	9518000	When Busta Move came out, I paid something like 45 bucks
9518000	9521000	and bought a legit Busta Move soundtrack.
9521000	9525000	And then I tore up AX looking for Busta Move 2.
9525000	9530000	And I want to say I like downloaded MP3s on like Napster
9530000	9533000	of the Busta Move slash Groove soundtrack.
9533000	9534000	Remember, I also ripped mine.
9534000	9535000	Yeah.
9535000	9536000	You know, who knows?
9536000	9539000	I mean, I may have downloaded your rips on Napster before I even knew you.
9539000	9542000	Well, I remember giving you a CD of all my rips for one.
9542000	9543000	Well, yeah, but that was later.
9543000	9544000	Yeah.
9544000	9545000	I remember downloading it.
9545000	9549000	But I also, though, was kind of, you know, very much into J-pop at the time, too.
9549000	9554000	So I had like two mix albums and Globe and Mr. Children.
9554000	9558000	One of my favorite albums still, like from the DDR days, you already,
9558000	9562000	IU Trance, which is the Ayumi Hamasaki Trance album.
9562000	9563000	True story.
9563000	9565000	I think it was like three or maybe even a fourth one as a voice.
9565000	9566000	True story time.
9566000	9567000	I love that first CD.
9567000	9573000	We were at DragCon this year and there was no line for YUHA, Hamasaki.
9573000	9575000	I always feel bad for those queens to get booted early.
9575000	9576000	They were so talented.
9576000	9577000	Bless you.
9577000	9580000	So but anyway, we were just jawing with her because there was nobody there.
9580000	9584000	And I was like, well, I know that you said that you got your name from Ayumi.
9584000	9586000	Are you actually fans of the AYURO remix?
9586000	9587000	And she's like, oh, my God.
9587000	9589000	Yes, someone has heard of them.
9589000	9592000	And Victoria is there like watching us like, huh?
9592000	9593000	Yeah.
9593000	9598000	And we're just talking about Ayumi's Para Para, you know, Para Para,
9598000	9602000	things on stage and everything, just completely gushing.
9602000	9603000	And then, OK, we got to get this picture done.
9603000	9606000	So, yeah, I love I love that you brought it back to drag.
9606000	9611000	And then her photographer messaged Monet Exchange saying that Victoria was coming over.
9611000	9612000	All right.
9612000	9613000	Because she's wearing the sponge dress.
9613000	9616000	OK, I got to I got to get some of these comments from chat.
9616000	9620000	Orange, right, says I bought imported soundtracks from Red Octane back when they were a store.
9620000	9626000	Act F says I have the Scott Pilgrim, the game OST on vinyl, which apparently DJ Romas helped
9626000	9627000	out with.
9628000	9631000	I was importing sound anime soundtracks from Play Asia back in the day.
9631000	9634000	I had a couple of rare's from various DDR tournaments.
9634000	9635000	You know what?
9635000	9637000	I might still have all of mine.
9637000	9642000	I think I still have in the studio from like an OLR giveaway pile that we never gave away.
9642000	9646000	I need to see if I have more there, like the rare CDs that we just never gave away.
9646000	9650000	I need to like just offer to send them to people or something.
9650000	9651000	I don't know.
9651000	9654000	I think I also got one of the game crazy exclusive ones, like a pile of them from Dan.
9654000	9657000	Now I'm looking to see if they're fully hoarders.
9657000	9659000	So we have them.
9659000	9662000	We don't throw stuff like that out.
9662000	9666000	I there's some shelving over here that you guys can't see on Twitch, but I was seeing
9666000	9669000	if it was over there because I thought I had some on the shelving over there, but I guess
9669000	9670000	not.
9670000	9674000	I don't know what actual vinyl I still have because I have weirdos mandatory fun because
9674000	9675000	he signed it.
9675000	9677000	We have even worse by Weird Al.
9677000	9681000	I have the Xanadu album because of course I do.
9681000	9687000	And I have a sealed Parlophone release first printing of Demon Days by Gorillaz that I
9687000	9688000	never opened.
9688000	9691000	And apparently I could get me like five hundred bucks.
9691000	9694000	Go big if I ever sell it.
9694000	9697000	OK, Metal Mayhem, we've been doing all the talking quickly, though, before we get to
9697000	9698000	our next call.
9698000	9700000	What about you and game soundtracks?
9700000	9702000	Like what what got you into collecting?
9702000	9705000	If that's the thing you do or did you wait till the digital age?
9705000	9710000	Oh, you know, I didn't start out with the intention of collecting.
9710000	9714000	It just happened to be a happy accident.
9714000	9721000	My first soundtrack I got was the one that was included with the Super Nintendo version
9721000	9723000	of Killer Instinct.
9723000	9726000	And I love these.
9726000	9727000	Killer Cuts, right?
9727000	9728000	Killer Cuts.
9728000	9729000	Yeah.
9729000	9730000	Yeah.
9730000	9733000	I played it so much.
9733000	9734000	You know, it was ridiculous.
9734000	9740000	You got to a point where my tiny family hated that CD after a while and.
9740000	9749000	You know, throughout the 90s, I went to my local record store, you know, I just walked
9749000	9750000	through.
9750000	9752000	We're looking for like that.
9752000	9756000	Metal Mayhem, could I count the Mortal Kombat motion picture soundtrack?
9756000	9760000	Because it did have the who is it, Utah Saints or who did that?
9760000	9761000	The the techno song.
9761000	9762000	Everybody knows.
9762000	9763000	Utah Saints.
9763000	9764000	Doo doo doo.
9764000	9766000	Does that count?
9766000	9769000	Actually, you know, slight modification.
9769000	9774000	You know, Utah Saints did the later versions of that song.
9774000	9777000	The original Irish was called The Immortals.
9777000	9778000	Oh, right.
9778000	9779000	OK, you're right.
9779000	9780000	You're right.
9780000	9781000	Yes.
9781000	9782000	Yes.
9782000	9783000	OK.
9783000	9784000	Utah Saints.
9784000	9785000	Yeah.
9785000	9786000	Another mix that they did.
9786000	9787000	You're right.
9787000	9788000	They did.
9788000	9789000	I think they did one later that had like more fighters.
9789000	9790000	The original song was Twilight Zone or no.
9790000	9791000	It was.
9791000	9792000	It's very similar.
9792000	9793000	It's got a very similar rift.
9793000	9795000	But Twilight Zone came out around the same time.
9795000	9796000	It was all that 90s.
9796000	9797000	Yeah.
9797000	9798000	Anyway.
9798000	9799000	Metal Mayhem.
9799000	9801000	I got to I got to wrap up so we can take another call.
9801000	9802000	But I'm good.
9802000	9803000	Good topic.
9803000	9804000	We love talking about game soundtracks.
9804000	9805000	It's something we've lost here.
9805000	9806000	Real quick.
9806000	9808000	Anything else you want to mention before we let you go?
9808000	9811000	Oh, not not not much.
9811000	9814000	You know, you know.
9814000	9818000	I'm glad that you finally made your way over to Twitch.
9819000	9826000	You know, I know the focus is on talking the audio, but sometimes it's nice to put.
9826000	9828000	You know, the people talking, you know?
9828000	9829000	Yeah.
9829000	9830000	Yeah.
9830000	9834000	Well, first off, I'm glad that this segment is working tonight, because you might remember
9834000	9837000	last week it broke the show and, you know, a couple of weeks ago.
9837000	9839000	So I'm just glad we have this segment working again.
9839000	9841000	And who knows, we might be able to bring video back in the future.
9841000	9845000	But, you know, I do want to be very aware that we do have podcast listeners and I don't
9845000	9848000	want listeners to call in going, I want to show you something.
9848000	9850000	And then it's like, it'll be really weird for a little bit.
9850000	9854000	So I think in general, most of our podcast listeners kind of like understand that we've
9854000	9855000	made this move to Twitch.
9855000	9858000	So there are going to be some little things here and there that end up being visual cues.
9858000	9863000	But I do want to I do still want to remember, you know, it's the goal is to be a little
9863000	9866000	more like when Howard Stern is on E.
9866000	9870000	You know, it's still mostly the radio, but there's that visual enhancement to it.
9870000	9871000	That's where I kind of want us to be at, too.
9871000	9873000	But anyway, thank you so much for the call, Middle Mayhem.
9873000	9874000	Take care, buddy.
9874000	9875000	All right.
9875000	9876000	Let's see.
9876000	9878000	I think we got room for one more call here.
9878000	9879000	And let's do it.
9879000	9880000	Let's do it.
9880000	9881000	Hello.
9881000	9882000	Hello.
9882000	9883000	You are on orange on radio.
9883000	9884000	Who's this?
9884000	9885000	Hey, what's going on, everybody?
9885000	9886000	It is Rama.
9886000	9887000	Hey, Rama.
9887000	9888000	It is so good to hear from you.
9888000	9889000	And congratulations, by the way.
9889000	9893000	I know anime jam session had its debut on Twitch as well this week.
9893000	9894000	So congratulations.
9894000	9897000	I know you guys had some some audio, but I mean, look at us.
9897000	9899000	We're still having issues every week.
9899000	9903000	If we get to the end of the show tonight, knock on wood, it'll be the first show we've
9903000	9908000	had without any technical issues since maybe the very first show on Twitch.
9908000	9910000	Achievement unlocked.
9910000	9911000	Yeah.
9911000	9914000	So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9914000	9917000	I just want to thank you for derailing my topics for tonight.
9917000	9921000	Because when you start talking about classic soundtracks, I'm remembering the many times
9921000	9927000	I have taken the Greyhound bus to conventions with buying import CDs and listening to them
9928000	9933000	on my CD player from times where I would go with my squad to Chinatown.
9933000	9939000	We will be buying these these quote unquote import anime and some may.
9939000	9940000	Yes.
9940000	9941000	Sorry.
9941000	9946000	I just want you to know I finally got rid of all just all of my son may CDs, except
9946000	9950000	for the run the ones for obvious reasons.
9950000	9953000	Some lying around that had like stuff from like slayers and everything.
9953000	9954000	Sorry, I didn't.
9954000	9955000	I didn't mute.
9955000	9956000	I was trying to cut back that echo.
9956000	9958000	There's some echo coming through on Rama's headset.
9958000	9959000	So I was killing our mics for a little bit.
9959000	9960000	Sorry.
9960000	9965000	Oh, I was just going to say, like, I still have like a few of those like multi show anime
9965000	9970000	some may disk somewhere like the best of 95 best of 96.
9970000	9977000	And yeah, I remember when Rob's hooking my video, I remember going to this was picking
9977000	9979000	up second and third mix soundtrack.
9979000	9982000	So I'm just like, where's the first?
9982000	9984000	And it took me a while to realize.
9984000	9985000	Oh, it's all together.
9985000	9986000	Nevermind.
9986000	9992000	So I'm sure you have an opinion on this whole bows that hack that we talked because I feel
9992000	9994000	like you're the bows that defender here on.
9994000	9998000	But I'm sure you have an opinion on this hack we talked about.
9998000	10003000	It's not even that it just reminded me of something that happened a few months back
10003000	10012000	and at the height of bows that some people started champion as bows it as the official
10012000	10014000	representation for trans rights.
10014000	10016000	And I saw that I'm like, you know what?
10016000	10021000	I'm just going to go over to this side of the Internet.
10021000	10026000	I'm like, I'm welcome to claim, I guess, whatever.
10026000	10028000	I'm actually really bad, by the way.
10028000	10033000	You might want to check your discourse to make sure the echo canceling is on.
10033000	10035000	But I'll try to I'll try to push through here.
10035000	10037000	Actually, what I'm going to do, I'm going to mute you real quick.
10037000	10039000	Well, I mean, it's so wrong that they can't hear you right now.
10039000	10041000	I'm just going to mute you while I respond to that part real quick.
10042000	10046000	But as far as like the bows, that thing goes like, you know,
10046000	10050000	and people claiming that as the icon and so forth, like, you know, that's it.
10050000	10051000	People people got to do that.
10051000	10055000	You were talking earlier in the show, like the Zaria, like is the icon and so forth.
10055000	10059000	You know, people want to see themselves as the content they consume.
10059000	10065000	Yeah. So whenever anything new springs up, someone somewhere is going to say, OK,
10065000	10070000	well, we this the the official developer is never going to say this outright.
10070000	10075000	So we would we would like to claim this person within our conversations in our community.
10075000	10079000	So, yeah, why not? Yeah. Anyway, I have you on the speaker again.
10079000	10083000	Rama, anything else you want to bring up on the show tonight?
10083000	10089000	Couple things. Magfest, when you're talking about the Snorlax, I've seen him there every year.
10089000	10095000	And it's really awesome there. I believe in the footage I sent somewhere.
10095000	10099000	There is footage of Snorlax fighting a Scyther. And I thought that was pretty cool.
10099000	10102000	Wasn't your first year the year after I stopped going?
10102000	10107000	Unfortunately, I just want you to know that we had a blast going.
10107000	10111000	But Mako's like, I'm not going unless all of VOG is going.
10111000	10117000	I'm just like, I think it'd be easier to pull the rest of the teeth out of my mouth.
10117000	10124000	Or it might be easier to just get her to Dragon Con. But yeah, I would love to go to Magfest again.
10124000	10128000	Just the unfortunate thing is, this is not the job that pays my bills.
10128000	10134000	As generous as y'all have been with the bitty donations and the subscriptions and things like that.
10134000	10141000	Unfortunately, it doesn't really pay the bills. But I'm hoping maybe I'll have the time available to do it next year.
10141000	10145000	But the reality is we're going on a cruise in March. So, I don't know if it's going to work out.
10145000	10148000	But you never know. Never say never. Anything is possible.
10149000	10155000	And I totally get that. But this is something that I always discuss when we do our convention reviews.
10155000	10161000	It's like this. If this is your first time going to the con, commit a day early.
10161000	10164000	Stay an extra day. Do the silly touristy shit.
10164000	10170000	If you got friends there, stay longer and then come back the following year and just hang out.
10170000	10173000	I did that. I speak from experience.
10173000	10178000	I still do that with Dragon Con every year. I do that to accommodate for jet lag and all that stuff.
10178000	10183000	And actually this year, it looks like my plans are cementing up a little bit. I haven't bought the flight yet.
10183000	10187000	I don't even know if Bobby knows this. I've said I might do this, but I am going to do this.
10187000	10192000	I'm actually this year going to fly into North Carolina where Xtaphir moved to.
10192000	10197000	And then we're going to road trip to Dragon Con together because Xtaphir is coming to Dragon Con this year.
10197000	10200000	It's official. It's his first year at Dragon Con.
10200000	10205000	So this time instead of spending a bunch of time in Atlanta.
10205000	10209000	Well, I'm still going to be there at least the day before because the hotel is covered that day.
10209000	10215000	So we'll still get in like on the Wednesday when the con, technically I guess now starts on Thursday.
10215000	10217000	I mean, but it used to be a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday thing.
10217000	10220000	But now, you know, Thursday is the new Friday, whatever.
10220000	10222000	But Thursday was always like my touristy day.
10222000	10225000	So I guess that'll kind of be the case this year.
10225000	10229000	But now this time I will have spent a little time because I'm going to fly out to visit Xtaphir.
10229000	10233000	So there, it may be a very real possibility there's going to be two weeks with no OLR.
10233000	10237000	Because I may fly out to visit Xtaphir on like a Saturday and then stay there like Sunday.
10237000	10239000	And I'm taking the entire next week off.
10239000	10241000	So it'll be fun this year.
10241000	10244000	Road trips are absolutely fun like that.
10244000	10250000	I mean, me and my squad, we did it from New York to Raleigh for an amazement couple of years.
10250000	10251000	It was a blast.
10251000	10252000	Yeah.
10252000	10255000	And Bobby reminds me, we did do that for MAGFest one of the years.
10255000	10259000	Because I have a picture of Rob going across the National Mall going to an Ingress portal.
10259000	10260000	Yes.
10260000	10262000	That I did one of the missions one year or something like that.
10262000	10263000	And yeah.
10263000	10268000	And I remember one year I was with some of my other buddies and we stayed like an extra night out in Virginia.
10268000	10270000	I'm going to mute you again. Sorry, buddy.
10270000	10271000	It's just the echo is too much.
10271000	10276000	But we stayed an extra night out in Virginia and we did some of the touristy stuff the next day.
10276000	10280000	Thank gosh, we did it a few years ago and didn't try to do it this year when the government was closed.
10280000	10282000	But that year it was all open.
10282000	10284000	So anyway, let me unmute you, Rama.
10284000	10287000	And any other final thoughts for us before we let you go tonight?
10287000	10293000	I have my finger on something and I can't remember what it was.
10293000	10294000	Oh, yeah.
10294000	10296000	One thing about MAGFest.
10296000	10299000	Friday night, I'm like, OK.
10299000	10300000	I'm like, I can't wait.
10300000	10307000	The car's almost over and I'm looking at my watch and it's like, wait, it's Friday, not Saturday.
10307000	10313000	I'm used to Thursday as day zero to chill and relax and just just meet up with people.
10313000	10316000	Then we do the con, not whereas we're here Thursday.
10316000	10317000	It's day one.
10317000	10319000	You hit the ground running.
10319000	10323000	That threw me off that that screwed me up.
10323000	10326000	My first best two is I flew in on a Friday.
10326000	10330000	I flew in on Thursday expecting I'd have that day.
10330000	10336000	And nope, it was like the panel I wanted to see was Thursday night and I like barely made it.
10336000	10339000	So anyway, Rama, I'm going to let you go.
10339000	10340000	Thank you so much for the call.
10340000	10344000	And congrats again to anime jam session on its transition over to Twitch.
10344000	10346000	And we'll be looking forward to seeing you again this Tuesday.
10346000	10348000	Thank you. Appreciate it.
10348000	10349000	Worked a little more kinks.
10349000	10353000	We're going to have a lot more fun and I'm going to start a new segment called the weekly.
10353000	10354000	All right. Sounds good.
10354000	10355000	Look forward to it.
10355000	10357000	Take care, buddy. Thanks for the call.
10357000	10358000	All right.
10358000	10359000	There it is.
10359000	10362000	And that was that was everybody that had lined up in the green room.
10362000	10364000	So that's going to do it for calls tonight.
10364000	10365000	Thank you guys so much for calling in.
10365000	10366000	Really appreciate it.
10366000	10370000	So it's about time to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio here.
10370000	10373000	First off, I want to say before we get to final thoughts.
10373000	10375000	Alan, thank you so much for filling in tonight.
10375000	10376000	You're welcome.
10376000	10382000	Chatters, tell me if you guys agree, but I think Alan did a fantastic job tonight because you were so well researched on your stories.
10382000	10386000	And consider you don't even get you are well researched than we ever are.
10386000	10388000	You were ready to talk about those and you didn't even really get to pick those.
10388000	10391000	I gave those to you this morning and you were like ready to talk about.
10391000	10392000	Yeah, well, I did.
10392000	10398000	I did look at them before the show, but the MK 11 one is with it's something that I'm into regardless.
10398000	10402000	Usually I try to pick the stories that play to people's fandoms.
10402000	10404000	Like if it's about Mass Effect, I'm going to give it to her.
10404000	10412000	So Mortal Kombat 11, of course, I gave you one of the new characters in MK 11 is people have been pronouncing it Garris.
10412000	10417000	But and I'm like, there's only one Garris and this is not it.
10417000	10419000	So it's not my space bird husband.
10419000	10420000	Garus.
10420000	10421000	How's it spelled?
10421000	10425000	It's like G-A-R-E-S or G-A-R-U-S.
10425000	10432000	So, yeah, it's anyway, I my ears perk up when I hear that character's name on the fighting YouTube that I follow.
10432000	10438000	And I'm like, that's no, that's not hashtag, hashtag not my Garris.
10438000	10440000	I want a Mass Effect fighting game now.
10440000	10442000	So you have a lot of love from our chatters.
10442000	10444000	V.G. Realness says, bring in more Alan.
10444000	10446000	S.G. 100 Matt says, Alan is a great fill in host.
10446000	10448000	Active says, yay for Alan.
10448000	10453000	Spyro Jonathan says, this year, maybe you could stream from Dragon Con on here.
10453000	10460000	The only downside to that is that Internet, Wi-Fi and all that stuff can sometimes be unreliable.
10460000	10470000	But there is a very distinct reason why amongst this whole move to Twitch, we scaled things down to a miniature or mini sized computer.
10470000	10473000	Because it makes it very, very easily transportable.
10473000	10479000	And the convenient part about Dragon Con is that really Bobby brings his whole setup anyway because he'll do the VR stuff.
10479000	10484000	But I would say even if you don't get something live because the Internet is kind of, I mean, we'll see.
10484000	10487000	We'll see where maybe we'll have 5G everywhere then. I don't know.
10487000	10493000	But barring that, I'm certainly something in video form, I think is a given.
10493000	10494000	You're going to have to see something like that.
10494000	10497000	So we'll see. Stay tuned, G.I.s for that.
10497000	10500000	Anyway, Alan, thanks again for being here. You did fantastic.
10500000	10504000	And I'm not just saying that. Do you have any final thoughts for Alyssa or Snyder?
10504000	10506000	Anything else you want to address before we head out?
10506000	10510000	On the show role, it still talks about the FUs of the week.
10510000	10518000	And I don't have one actually. I was going to say I got some really good news that hopefully will become even better news in the coming week.
10518000	10522000	So I will announce that on Twitter and Facebook when it's appropriate.
10522000	10527000	But if there was an FU of the week, I was going to abstain because I'm all about putting positivity back into the world.
10527000	10532000	Good. Good. FUs of the week are now on a on demand situation.
10532000	10535000	Jamie's like, I need it. Then we do it.
10535000	10539000	OK. All right. But thank you again for being here. You did great.
10539000	10543000	Dark Soccer, it's so lovely to have you back in studio. I've missed having you here in studio.
10543000	10546000	I've missed being here because I hate working Sundays.
10546000	10550000	I know. I know. But you know what? Congrats to you and everything you've been going through in your job.
10550000	10553000	I know part of that was moving on up into something you wanted to do.
10553000	10558000	Yeah. So super what I wanted to do. But I'm going to four by tens. Oh, good.
10558000	10564000	So I've done it once before. But, you know, I was also one hundred eleven pounds heavier and got tired a lot easier.
10564000	10572000	So hopefully this will be easier on me. And hopefully if everything works out, I'll be off Thursday, Friday and Sunday.
10572000	10578000	OK. So that means I get my Shabbat back and it means that I get my will not daytime Shabbat, of course,
10578000	10582000	but I'll get my Friday nights back for services and I get my Sundays for the show.
10582000	10586000	Well, fingers crossed, because we we really need to have you back here in studio.
10586000	10590000	I mean, Loki and I, Loki and I do a good job and at least we get in the classic game of the week.
10590000	10597000	But it's not the same, you know. Also, though, I will be in San Francisco on Easter for Sisters in the Park
10597000	10602000	because it's the fortieth anniversary of the the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.
10602000	10606000	I thought you were going to bring up the sexy Jesus competition. Yeah, hunky Jesus.
10606000	10611000	Well, they have sexy Mary and hunky Jesus. Oh, that's sorry. And then the Easter bonnet.
10611000	10617000	But but I would just like to say that it would be nice that if you're in the area, come out.
10617000	10623000	And it's actually back at Dolores Park. I am really looking for more conventions to attend.
10623000	10627000	I'm even looking at possibly going up to Portland Retro Expo with me.
10627000	10632000	Well, I'm talking about like video game related things for the show. There are I mean, video game cosplayers there.
10632000	10639000	True, true. But so if you have conventions, especially West Coast, because it's much easier for me, places I can drive in a weekend.
10639000	10643000	And Portland and L.A. are about as far out as I can go. So I can't really go East Coast in a weekend.
10643000	10646000	But, you know, I'm looking for more opportunities to do things like that.
10646000	10649000	I want to get the word out about Orange Mountains Radio and Vogue Network and our move and all that stuff.
10649000	10655000	So, yeah, I also I actually now I'm actively looking for co-host for pinball thing.
10655000	10661000	And I'll talk to Dan, too. So. All right. Well, we'll see you at least on tape next week.
10661000	10665000	But we hope to have you back here in person soon. So, dude, if I had the time to call in, I do it.
10665000	10670000	But I had no money, not no money, but I have that bronchitis that killed it. So fair enough.
10670000	10675000	What else? What else? Thank you, American health care system. My final thought tonight.
10675000	10681000	Just thank you, guys. I am just very happy that like a lot of improvements worked tonight.
10681000	10687000	The discord thing worked. Hopefully the recording works. I'm still going to find out about that with that whole change.
10687000	10692000	And the video is looking sharper and great. And I'm just like really happy and how far we've come in a month.
10692000	10697000	I've been trying to improve little things every week and it's been going great. And thank you, guys, for being here.
10697000	10701000	Of course, you guys are such an important part of that. And that's it.
10701000	10704000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange On Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10704000	10707000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10707000	10710000	But we can only really air those voices if they're here to air them.
10710000	10717000	So help us spread the word. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you heard about this show goes an awful long way.
10717000	10722000	We also appreciate all the followers and the biddies. I'll acknowledge you guys here on Twitch after the credits.
10722000	10726000	Thank you guys again so much for just being here and supporting Orange On Radio and helping us grow.
