0	8000	Hey everybody, it's Rob Roberts. I know this is a really weird way to kick off the podcast, but this is a really weird episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8000	17000	So here's what happened. It's going to be a little bit of a shorter show than usual this week because we actually recorded this while there was a big storm going on in our hometown of Sacramento, California.
17000	25000	And it actually ended up that there was a storm so big that it kind of presented hurricane-style winds, which is really unheard of in California.
25000	31000	And it knocked out power for 100,000 people in the area, which unfortunately included us at Orange Lounge Radio Studios.
31000	39000	But unlike the one or two times in our 15-year history where this has happened to us before, this time we were broadcasting on Twitch.
39000	45000	So all of our audio was actually saved thanks to the fact that we were broadcasting on Twitch.
45000	51000	So I was able to stitch together a little piece of the podcast here, thanks to Bobby Blackwell for his help by the way in saving some of this audio.
51000	56000	So we can at least present the parts of the show that we were able to do on Twitch.
56000	62000	But for that reason, the audio is going to sound a little weird. It does some weird cuts and things that you might not be used to hearing on the podcast.
62000	68000	Some audio is going to be really out of whack when we're running some video at the same time, so I apologize for all that.
68000	72000	But it's better than nothing, which is what Mother Nature wanted us to do.
72000	81000	So here you go. Here's the first part of the lost episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this past week, episode number 758.
102000	106000	Expected excitement and plenty of other happenings are already in progress and there's plenty of news to cover.
106000	110000	So let's jump right in and start the show where every gamer has a voice.
110000	113000	Orange Lounge Radio.
115000	120000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
120000	129000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 758 of our show for this January the 6th of 2019.
129000	132000	Back for the first show of the new year after a little holiday break.
132000	137000	I am Rob Roberts and joining me as always here in studio is Techmaster Loki. How are you doing?
137000	138000	It's me. I'm here.
138000	139000	You're here. You're back. How you doing?
139000	140000	I'm good.
140000	141000	Yeah? Did you have a good holiday break?
141000	147000	It was alright. I had a lot of opportunity to play games that I didn't take.
147000	149000	Okay. Okay.
149000	154000	So instead I worked on stuff, I guess.
154000	158000	So you worked on stuff or you worked on gaming projects? Your own game?
158000	168000	I worked on step mania stuff and I think I may have played, maybe I played a few games, but it was mostly step mania stuff.
168000	171000	Alright well we'll get into that during our gaming weeks in a little bit.
171000	177000	Now the resolution that people want to know from about three episodes ago, that in-joke that had everybody dying,
177000	183000	about you guys telling the kids you were going to take them to the broccoli farm when in reality that was the trip to Disneyland, right?
183000	185000	Okay so you were going to unveil that whole thing on Christmas, right?
185000	189000	I wanted to, but we have not done that.
189000	191000	So they still think they're going to the broccoli farm?
191000	194000	They're still convinced that there's a broccoli farm out there that they're going to.
194000	198000	Do they know that the broccoli farm is in Southern California?
198000	200000	Yeah, they know that they're going to-
200000	202000	You didn't tell your kids on Christmas?
202000	207000	No, we didn't. So we're going, yeah, they know that they're going to Los Angeles.
207000	208000	Okay, okay.
208000	215000	Some relatives of ours though are like, they're all, yeah, we're going on vacation to Southern California.
215000	217000	Oh, wait, you guys going to Disneyland?
217000	223000	I'm like, no, we're not going to Disneyland. We're going to Los Angeles. Shut the fuck up.
223000	230000	I love it. I love it. As Akh Def says in our Twitch chat, the broccoli farm of the stars.
230000	232000	Yes, who knew all that on Broccoli Way?
233000	237000	Not here tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. She is still on a work break.
237000	240000	She will be joining us here in studio January 20th.
240000	245000	So we're going to have to rearrange the look of everything to fit one more in here.
245000	247000	No, we're not. She's just going to sit on the other side of the camera.
247000	249000	I think she wants to show off the wigs.
249000	252000	Oh, she's going to show off wigs?
252000	258000	My favorite idea for getting Jamie was the Dr. Claw, where you'd be able to see her arm and maybe we'd have like a robot arm or something.
258000	260000	I don't know. I like that idea, but we'll see.
260000	263000	And then maybe a little wig. But we'll see how we work that out with her later.
263000	269000	I haven't messed with OBS enough to know, like, can we do like Instagram filters on there and shit, you know?
269000	274000	I think, yeah, because you can kind of do like the chroma key. Like, I use some other plugins.
274000	280000	Do like some motion tracking for like an animated thing that's over her so you don't see her.
280000	282000	I don't want to do all that garbage. I just know.
282000	286000	So we'll see. I'm going to work out whatever she's comfortable with so you guys can check that out.
286000	290000	Because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
290000	294000	We're part of the voice geeks network live with the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday night.
294000	298000	So we are right after him. He's on at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern.
298000	305000	And we are right after it about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern and other great podcasts on the voice voice geeks network that you can check out.
305000	308000	Not all of them live on Twitch yet. Some of them don't want to be.
308000	312000	But I know anime jam session going to be making the move over to Twitch later this month.
312000	316000	And I think I think that whole filter thing you're talking about, I think they are doing something.
316000	320000	I don't want to give too much of their stuff away, but I've heard they may do something like that.
320000	324000	So that's all I'm going to say. So stay tuned for that with it.
324000	328000	And again, session comes to Twitch. So we are going to get into some news.
328000	331000	I know we have some big stuff that's going on with Japan and these laws.
331000	336000	But first, I want to wish a happy mag fest to those that actually went out to mag fest.
336000	338000	It looks fun. It does. It does look fun.
338000	344000	Actually, what's pretty cool is that we actually sent some B roll of like, this is what mag fest actually looks like.
344000	348000	So our pal Ramo was actually at mag fest. So we don't know what mag fest is.
348000	354000	It's like this big festival that goes on using games fest that actually goes on out in the DC area.
354000	358000	And they have other satellite ones. They do smaller shows. They do a mag west.
358000	362000	So, I mean, mag is kind of this thing that they're putting all over the place.
362000	365000	And this is, I think what they're calling super mag fest right now.
365000	368000	So they're actually doing this back.
368000	372000	And so, sadly, you guys can't see this in the podcast, but for those watching on Twitch,
372000	377000	we're actually looking at footage that DJ Rama has shot of the game room from this year,
377000	379000	where you saw some people playing karate games.
379000	382000	They have a very impressive collection of pinball tables as well.
382000	389000	And the whole, the whole like, catch to this whole thing or whatever is that these are open.
389000	395000	These rooms are open like 24-7, basically, for people to play in, participate in.
395000	402000	So people can go to play in these rooms and play games the whole time.
402000	407000	Ramo wants to clarify, it wasn't from his cell phone. It was actually his DSLR camera.
407000	410000	Oh, my bad. I thought it was his cell phone. Oh, my bad. My bad.
410000	415000	I guess I confused uploading from cell phone. So sorry that time was bad, Rama, but there you go.
415000	419000	Anyway, so, yeah.
419000	423000	But you can see there's several people playing U-beats.
423000	427000	There's lots and lots of music and representation that happens there,
427000	431000	which is interesting because I know they were having some problems in like Tokyo Attack and their agreement,
431000	437000	but I think they were able to find somebody else to kind of take over and provide lots of music-based games,
437000	445000	as well as some of the other, like, classic arcade games.
445000	451000	I think at one point in here, they'll get to where people are playing rock bands,
451000	456000	like projected up on a wall, which is something that you can actually see as well.
456000	459000	I guess the chat is telling me that the video is really, really loud.
459000	462000	I thought I turned it down, but I'll turn it down even further.
462000	464000	So hopefully you guys can hear me a little better.
464000	468000	You can see they actually have, like, little pods that they bring in for MAGFest and so forth.
468000	473000	So it's a lot of fun, and what's not in this video, unfortunately, but, you know, there's only so much we can fit in.
473000	475000	Are those, like, the virtual pods?
475000	478000	No, I think there's something, like, a little bit different, actually.
478000	480000	But, yeah.
480000	481000	Oh, there it is. Yeah.
481000	483000	Yeah, there's the rock band that's playing on the wall.
483000	489000	But anyway, they have lots of stuff that's going on at MAGFest, including concerts that go on the entire time.
489000	494000	They actually have bands that are playing Chiptune music and doing, like, other awesome things all that time,
494000	497000	while everybody's gaming in these rooms.
497000	500000	Console rooms, and I'm sure there's places where you can do RPGs.
500000	502000	The typical panels that you would expect.
502000	504000	I mean, it's a really fun convention. I'm really sad I missed it.
504000	508000	But the reality is, you know, OLR is not my job that pays the bills.
508000	515000	I have a day job just like he has a day job, and Dark Sakura obviously has a day job, which is why she's not here for a little bit.
515000	518000	And so the day job, you know, I only get so much time off.
518000	523000	And so Dragon Con, and then, you know, Alan and I got to take a trip here and there.
523000	527000	So, you know, I don't have quite the time to be able to do MAGFest.
527000	529000	Maybe next year.
529000	533000	But I wonder if I should be saying this this early, but what the heck? Why not?
533000	535000	Just for you guys. A little secret between us.
535000	538000	So next year, I already have a trip planned for March.
538000	541000	So guess who talked me into something pretty big?
541000	549000	It was Grandpa from the Starboard Power Coupling, right?
549000	555000	So Grandpa actually talked me into going on the Star Trek Cruise.
555000	556000	Star Trek Cruise?
556000	558000	Yes, there's a Star Trek Cruise.
558000	569000	So they're actually going to have, like, some of the celebrities from Star Trek that actually, like, get on the cruise, get on the boat, and it travels all around like the Miami, the Bahamas, and all this stuff.
569000	573000	Grandpa is actually there right now. He's actually there.
573000	577000	So they're booking for next year already. So he talked us into it.
577000	579000	So that's going to be a fun trip for next year.
579000	583000	But sadly might be the reason I can't do MAG next year, but we'll see.
583000	586000	Because the cruise is in March next time, so we'll see.
586000	589000	Well, that's different.
589000	590000	Yeah.
590000	596000	I would, if it were me, you know, if I was one of those Star Trek actors, I'd be like, I'm going to get on a boat with these people.
596000	603000	They make money. They get their money from autographs and pictures. It's like a floating convention. It'll be a lot of fun.
603000	610000	And I know Bobby's a big cruise person. I don't remember if I told him this yet, so I'm sure he'll be excited for me, too, and that whole thing. So, yeah.
610000	611000	So, it'll be fun.
611000	618000	All right. Anyway, enough talk about fun and conventions. Let's talk about more serious things, like the law.
618000	624000	Let's talk about what's happening in Japan, because there's a big new modding law that went into effect over in Japan.
624000	625000	Right, Logie?
625000	630000	Yes. So, it's illegal. Don't be doing it.
630000	641000	So, you know, a lot of the Japanese companies are pretty strict when it comes to modding and different piracy devices or whatever.
641000	648000	But you may remember very recently last year that Nintendo cracked down against some ROM sites.
648000	656000	You know, in the past, they've come after, of course, modding devices like the R4.
656000	664000	But now, they basically are part of Japan's Association of Copyright for Computer Software.
664000	672000	Modding game save data and consoles violates the country's unfair competitive prevention law.
673000	681000	And basically, it sounds like the DMCA here, but more strict.
681000	689000	The problem, though, with it, I think, is that a lot of the stuff that you're going to get in trouble for is if you're selling tools.
689000	698000	Like, for example, there's this company, Cyber Gadget, that has a save editor tool that allows users to put in cheat codes and stuff like that.
698000	703000	Well, they have to stop selling the save editor on their Japanese site.
703000	709000	But I think a lot of this, if you do it in home, they're not really going to catch you and, like, put you in jail or something like that.
709000	712000	It's if you just try to make money off of it, it's more like it.
712000	717000	So that's, well, I mean, to be fair, some of that is a questionable reality in the U.S. as well.
717000	719000	Like, in extreme circumstances.
719000	725000	Like, I seem to remember we've had stories on the show about people that run bots in, like, World of Warcraft or even, I think, like, League of Legends.
725000	730000	People that run bots and cheats for these games, they usually get taken to court in a civil sense.
730000	732000	I don't think anyone's been, like, dragged off to prison over this.
732000	733000	Yeah.
733000	735000	But you know how we're all so happy here in America.
735000	737000	Well, it's, yeah, it's not illegal to do that. It's illegal.
737000	745000	I think in those cases, it's just maybe they're saying that they're in violation of the end user license agreement or something.
745000	747000	And so they're taking, it's a civil case.
747000	752000	But it's not like it's against a lot of the, in fact, actually, I think quite the contrary in North America.
752000	758000	They have the, I want to say that you have the right to be able to root your own console.
758000	761000	I think you can mod your consoles and, you know, fix them and stuff like that.
761000	767000	But they, you know, of course, the company doesn't have to let you onto their services if you do that.
767000	770000	But it's not illegal for you to modify your consoles.
770000	773000	It's just that you may lose some functionality from that.
773000	779000	Now, the other thing I kind of think about is something that's been very popular lately, especially with the PlayStation Classic.
779000	783000	We were out for a week because of the holidays. So we haven't been live in two weeks.
783000	788000	So we missed kind of the week. I mean, not a lot, a lot happens between Christmas and New Year anyway,
788000	791000	because most of the game industry is also taking a vacation as well. Right.
791000	797000	But I know that one of the big things that happened in that break that we were out is that the PlayStation Classic all of a sudden dropped in price.
797000	801000	Right. Like a lot of people, it's only 60 bucks now.
801000	807000	So we were kind of like doing like super couponing at Target to like get it down even further.
807000	811000	I was seeing on Twitter, people were getting it like 30, 40 bucks. And it was like through it was through a Target hack.
811000	818000	You know, couponing with their I think you use like a normal coupon, but you could also use the cartwheel.
818000	822000	You know, that app, the cartwheel. And I'm sure the red card is.
822000	825000	So anyway, you ended up with like a double coupon. So people are getting that thing even cheaper.
825000	833000	But my point is, people are starting to now, I think, take interest in that PlayStation Classic because they want to mod the hell out of it.
833000	837000	But technically in Japan, you're like breaking the law doing that.
837000	847000	But we're kind of interpreting this to be the problem would be if you then turn around and flip those consoles on eBay or the Japanese equivalent, which I think Yahoo auctions is still a thing over in Japan.
847000	853000	So. Right. You know, but but whatever, regardless, like modding those consoles, then turn around and flip it around. That's illegal.
853000	859000	But what you do in your own home, the government is going to have a hard time tracking that down. Right.
859000	869000	Yeah, I mean, I don't think that if you're modding your console, like, say, if I modded a switch or something like that and I'm in Japan, I don't think Nintendo is going to turn you over to the authorities for that.
869000	878000	But if you're trying to, you know, say you create a mod chip to put into the switch and that makes it really easy and try to sell that, then you might be in trouble.
878000	882000	But it seems it does seem very short sighted about the global situation.
882000	887000	I mean, many times a lot of these chips and things are coming from other countries. Right.
887000	894000	Like even all the way back to when we would plug in something in the back of our PlayStation ones so we could play burn discs.
894000	901000	A lot of those were coming in from, ironically, Japan, but also places like Hong Kong. Yeah. You know, other countries, basically.
901000	907000	So, I mean, Japan, I guess, could say in this law that you can't really import them or sell them.
907000	924000	But I mean, this is such a hard thing to enforce. It is. And but now if you do get you do get in trouble with this, you can face up to five years in prison and up to a five million yen fine, which is about forty six thousand dollars.
924000	932000	Truthfully, that doesn't seem that bad unless it's like per offense and it stacks up quickly, kind of like what happened with the ROMs on those ROM sites.
933000	936000	I wouldn't want to go prison for anything. I mean, that's stupid.
936000	943000	Oh, is it both? I thought it was prison or the fine. I missed that. Yeah, it's it's both. Yeah.
943000	950000	Yikes. Go into our chat at Twitch TV slash Vogue Network. Code Man says, just just got a call from Nintendo, Rob.
950000	955000	They are suing you for wearing that shirt. This shirt is actually I've seen a ton of other people wearing this shirt, too.
955000	965000	It's on. I guess I can give him a shout out. It's from Threadless. And for those on the podcast, it's got like little eight bit representations of pretty much like every Nintendo thing they've ever made.
965000	970000	And I know I've seen other people wearing this shirt on like YouTube and other things. So it's a pretty popular shirt.
970000	984000	So but they wouldn't. Why would you sue me, the consumer? This actually as much as a tongue in cheek comment as that is, I think it does relate to what's going on with this story, because Japan, you know, with this, I'm sure it's got a lot of sensationalist headlines about,
984000	996000	oh, you mod something in Japan, you're going to go to prison. But it seems like it's much less the moderate, the individuals themselves with the people who are taking that and turning around and putting it out there for other people to consume.
996000	1007000	I would bet these three D.S. cards that allow you to, you know, Nintendo hates those things. Oh, yeah. They like dump the like the flash carts and stuff. That's what they want to stop.
1007000	1014000	Yeah. And this is probably to prevent that. You know, it's just, I guess, more ammo for them to be able to come after them.
1014000	1020000	But do you think they're going to take the time to shut down nude Skyrim mods? Because that's what I don't know about Loki.
1020000	1027000	Now, that's that's different. See that. And this is more of like it says modifying game save data. That's a little weird, though.
1027000	1041000	I think they're talking about devices to do that, maybe patches and stuff, but like I wouldn't think that just because of this, like it would be illegal for you to use mods and like, you know, like you mentioned Skyrim because of this.
1041000	1046000	I don't think it has anything to do that, because that's basically you're, you know, allowed to create content for.
1046000	1055000	I think it's more of like I just hack and cheat devices, basically. If it's morally wrong, although new mods might be morally wrong to some people.
1055000	1066000	But if it's like breaking the game in a way that, you know, is unfair, then, yeah, it's probably that. Like, you know, if you're selling aimbots or something like that.
1066000	1073000	Profiting off of someone else's game, essentially, which is interesting because then how does streaming fit in all that?
1073000	1080000	Like, I don't think it's I'm not I have no idea like where streaming culture in Japan is that like I'm obviously completely ignorant to that.
1080000	1082000	I would love to hear from listeners that might know that.
1082000	1085000	But like, I don't know if it's even on the same level as it is here.
1085000	1093000	I don't know. Like, it would be interesting to see now this laws in place, what you know, what actually is going to be was going to be used for.
1093000	1101000	Because, yeah, I don't think they're going to go after everybody. I think they're just going to use this to go after people that, you know, do different things.
1101000	1106000	It's just like, you know, it's the whole DMCA stuff. Yeah, those laws are on the books. Yeah, it's illegal to do certain things.
1106000	1113000	But do people still do those things? Yeah, because I mean, it's not going to stop the individual person from modding or doing whatever.
1113000	1121000	It just might make it a little harder to get the tools to do that. Or, you know, if you're looking to profit off of that, maybe you might think about not doing that.
1121000	1130000	Bobby's kind of pointing out that modders do get hired sometimes, though, like especially you think about like Valve and a lot of their teams and things like Team Fortress 2.
1130000	1137000	Like Team Fortress was a Quake mod, right? Dota, the original Dota was a Warcraft 3 mod, right? So Valve loves modders.
1137000	1144000	So, you know, mods, it is an interesting kind of counterpoint, though, is that modders are not always like a bad thing.
1144000	1154000	But I believe ID always loved the Quake modding thing. I know Warcraft embraced the modding thing.
1154000	1165000	Like sometimes the original games kind of embrace the modding scene and really encourage you to do that stuff. Hell, with Blizzard Starcraft 2, like that whole arcade thing is mods, mods, mods, right?
1165000	1172000	I'm just surprised, though, that they just even bring up modding save game data. I would think that it's modifying consoles would be something.
1172000	1179000	But I don't know unless that they're talking about save game data as in, you know, patching a new ROM onto your system.
1179000	1183000	So they're basically saying soft mods and hard mods is what I'm thinking.
1183000	1187000	There's a couple of other great comments in chat. I want to get out here before we move on to the next story.
1187000	1194000	Questbuster says, Japan has also cracked down on gaming bars for playing games without consent from the publishers.
1194000	1204000	That's so fascinating to me. I mean, and you think like, God, there's bars here that do game night all the time that I'm sure are not paying any royalties.
1204000	1209000	In fact, I know at least some of the local bars. I went to a gamer night that was like Smash Brothers or something.
1209000	1215000	And like, they're not they're not paying Nintendo money for that. But I also kind of look at it as it's kind of like free advertising for Nintendo.
1215000	1221000	But bars have jukebox, jukebox laws technically when you play music like at a bar.
1221000	1226000	Yeah. You're supposed to pay the music industry for that. But like, I don't get like.
1226000	1230000	I don't know. I just think the whole even that I think is kind of ridiculous sometimes.
1230000	1236000	But I mean, I understand that licensing and everything, and it's just what we let these industries get away with.
1236000	1244000	As far as like being able to play a game in like a location or something and having to pay rights to that, I think that's dumb.
1244000	1257000	I understand like movies, because that's basically, you know, watching a movie or listening to a song is basically the same as if you went to see it in a theater or you're listening to it on the radio or whatever the case.
1257000	1266000	So that I can understand, you know, paying licensing rights for playing a game at a tournament or something doesn't seem that that's the same thing.
1266000	1271000	Because a lot of times, you know, you you interact with the game actually makes the experience watching somebody do that.
1271000	1276000	That doesn't I don't know. I think it's just a weird grab for cash at that point.
1276000	1278000	It's like you purchase the game.
1278000	1287000	It all sorry, but it all comes back to this thing that like copyright, IP, trademark and just like knowledge protection.
1287000	1294000	I don't know what else to call it, but those types of laws in the U.S. were written way before all this technology has stepped in.
1294000	1298000	And every year we're moving more and more into uncharted territory.
1298000	1302000	And because this country, you know, not to get on a political soapbox, I try my best.
1302000	1308000	But I mean, the reality is, clearly, if you look at what's going on in politics right now, they're focused on all this other stuff.
1308000	1314000	Right. Nobody's nobody cares about trying to reform trademark or IP or trying to bring that into.
1314000	1318000	Well, not right now. Yeah. Well, certainly not at this moment.
1318000	1322000	But do we feel do we feel like anybody's going to run on that platform in 2020?
1322000	1325000	Because I really doubt it, considering everything else is going on in the world politically.
1325000	1328000	You know what I mean? Like, I feel like it does need a major overhaul.
1328000	1332000	It does. Like somebody we just need to come to the table and evaluate it in this technological age.
1332000	1340000	Because, you know, not only do we have a global market where, you know, even like game releases,
1340000	1349000	they don't come out a year earlier in Japan anymore because people know if they're if the gap is too big.
1349000	1353000	Sorry, I look shocked because was that thunder that just shook the I don't know.
1353000	1358000	Holy crap. We have storms going on here in SACRA. Our show is based right now.
1358000	1362000	And we don't get thunder like that here. I think it's just wind.
1362000	1366000	It's really windy out there. Wow. That just that shook the whole door over there.
1366000	1369000	Sorry, I got derailed. Well, the wind is coming from that direction.
1369000	1373000	So that's scary. That's scary because I had to drive in it just a second ago.
1373000	1375000	And then that wasn't that wasn't much fun with stupid people.
1375000	1379000	They don't know how to drive in the show. Just suddenly disappears tonight.
1379000	1384000	Y'all know what it's because Thanos snapped his fingers and we all vaporized.
1384000	1388000	Well, the rapture is happening in Sacramento right now, actually.
1388000	1393000	No, I'd get on my phone and I'd hop in the chat and say what's going on real fast.
1393000	1398000	Speaking of saying to folks in chat now, I did notice that we have cheesy tots.
1398000	1402000	Ninety six and chat says first time listening live. Well, welcome.
1402000	1405000	I'm glad this twitch thing and cheesy tots are delicious.
1406000	1411000	But I'm glad this whole move to Twitch is kind of exposing to new people.
1411000	1414000	That's what we were. That that was the plan, Loki. That was the whole idea.
1414000	1418000	We had a plan. We just like the Cylons. There was a plan somewhere in there.
1418000	1426000	They have a plan. Let's see. Also in chat, Code Man says, can we get a modder to mod the new Sonic movie poster?
1428000	1433000	Perhaps. I don't know. Let's see. Photoshop is going to fix that movie poster.
1433000	1436000	Act Deft in chat says, Rob, what about that UPS?
1436000	1439000	OK, so the chat's been raising razzing me. I saw one the other day.
1439000	1444000	I seriously I was, you know, because I should have asked when I took my kids to their gymnastics class.
1444000	1451000	We always make a trip over to the goodwill is next door. And I saw UPS sitting there for like five bucks.
1451000	1458000	But I should pick it up because I don't that is I don't know if it's any good because it's that, you know, it's a goodwill.
1458000	1460000	So who knows? It can't be any worse than what we have now.
1460000	1465000	I should have picked it up because I was like, oh, you know, we don't have one of those.
1465000	1472000	I'll check next week. All right. Sounds good. But no, no, you because I've spent money on getting the video going and all that stuff.
1472000	1477000	Come on, guys. Priorities. Sorry. It's just it's one of those things you don't think about until you need it on a day like today.
1477000	1482000	We're like, I wonder if the show is going to shut off. But the nice thing is now, because we're streaming to Twitch,
1482000	1485000	there is going to be a backup of any audio that's done. There's going to be a backup on Twitch.
1486000	1489000	You know what I mean? Yeah. So worse comes to worse. I go back and record that.
1489000	1496000	And so we can have a podcast of what went out. But yeah, the lightning strike in the house and all that is definitely no fun.
1496000	1506000	I know that. I understand. Anyway. All right. Anyway, anything else you want to say about the Japanese copyright law before we get into our gaming weeks?
1506000	1509000	Or modding law. Sorry, I shouldn't say copyright law, but I feel like it all ties in.
1509000	1515000	I think it's that the wording seemed to be kind of a reach as far as like modding save game data.
1515000	1527000	But I don't know the actual details. This is like, you know, distribution of game save data, editors and programs distribution, selling auctioning,
1527000	1531000	serial codes and product keys without the software maker's permission.
1531000	1540000	Oh, that's to get at those companies like G2A, whatever. That's probably not the right name, but it doesn't matter anyway, because they're kind of they're kind of sketchy as we got into on the last show.
1540000	1551000	Services that offer editing hacking of save data and modifying hacking of game consoles. So it sounds like it's more of like the programs and stuff.
1551000	1557000	It is interesting how these laws are very like corporation friendly, isn't it?
1557000	1564000	Well, I notice it's distribution of a game save data and not using it necessarily a distribution of those serial codes.
1564000	1574000	I mean, just don't use G2A and services. And so it's offering services and tools, not necessarily the actual process of doing it yourself.
1574000	1581000	So I think it's, you know, if you're going to use ROMs on your device, that's fine.
1581000	1585000	Just, you know, don't tell anybody or don't tell Nintendo that you're doing it or whatever.
1585000	1591000	But don't put up a goddamn website offering ROMs for anybody to download, because then that's going to get you in trouble.
1591000	1596000	Yeah. Go on to torrents like everyone else did. I mean, I wouldn't know anything about that. What are you talking about anyway?
1596000	1603000	All right, let's move on. Let's get into our gaming weeks. Let's talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1603000	1608000	Loki, you mentioned you haven't really been able to play a lot, but I'm sure you're still playing your DDR machine here and there.
1608000	1611000	Right. I haven't played my DDR machine too much. I'll tell you why.
1611000	1616000	So like what happened was, is I was trying to put a new mix onto the machine.
1616000	1621000	And so apparently I think it's the disk I burned was not great because I burned it really quick.
1621000	1628000	And I was like, eh, it'll work fine. So I've been like, it took me a while to find a mix that worked on the machine again.
1628000	1634000	I ended up going back to extreme because it's like, I'm just not fucking with this anymore because I, every time I swap a mix out, that's 15 minutes.
1634000	1640000	So like the other day I was going to stream, but it took me, I tried to go to fifth. I tried to go to max.
1640000	1647000	I tried to go to a Disney rave again. And then I was like, fuck it. I'm just going back to extreme.
1647000	1657000	And that's like 15 minutes between each swap. And then on top of that, I thought the drive might've been bad because I swapped it to the, the second or third drive that I bought.
1657000	1663000	That was the one I was supposed to have. And it works. It's just, I think the disc is bad.
1663000	1668000	I think the disc is just not burnt. Right. Um, so I just went back. Isn't there a thing with like really old lasers?
1668000	1676000	Like if you burn a disc at like 48 speed or something way too fast, like burn it that fast. I burned it maybe four speed or one.
1676000	1681000	It was four speed. I think I dialed it way down because I know that if you burn too fast and yeah.
1681000	1692000	And it's just the machines, um, are very picky on the analog mixes and stuff in which, you know, technically the newer mixes aren't,
1692000	1700000	analog mixes, they're the, you know, digital stuff, but it's the older mixes are just really picky on reading.
1700000	1708000	Um, so I would get it installed just fine. But then when it goes to read the actual data off of the disc to load everything, it just wouldn't do it.
1708000	1712000	It'd give me a CD ROM error. So, um, I just went back to extreme because I'm like, ah, fuck it.
1712000	1718000	I'm not going to worry about this because next thing that's going on there is going to be the, um, set meeting machine anyways.
1718000	1725000	I already have the PC built. Um, I've got everything loaded on there. I'm just building the theme right now.
1725000	1732000	So that's what I've been doing is, um, well I had a, I had a design and then I just didn't like the way it looked.
1732000	1741000	And so I'm doing something different. And then my stupid dumb ass got this like really elaborate idea because nothing I do can be simple.
1741000	1750000	So, so now we're going, we're going to do something that involved me downloading hundreds of freestyle videos from the DDR scene.
1750000	1761000	Yes, because my theme is based around DDR freestyle. Um, and it's pretty bad ass. Like I, I'm not going to show this on camera, but I'll show it.
1761000	1768000	I'm going to show Rob on camera blindsiding me. I'm going to show you what my logo looks like, but it's going to actually have more.
1768000	1772000	This is the type of thing Mel B would give you a big hug for. This looks awesome.
1772000	1776000	Yes. And it's exactly the type of thing that, yes, they're going to be.
1776000	1780000	So are you saying you're going to put like freestyle videos in the background of like DDR songs?
1780000	1787000	Um, it's going to be in the intro of the whole thing. So it's like, so here's what you have to do.
1787000	1791000	You, you made these projects so huge so that you'll never finish them.
1791000	1796000	No, no, no. I have like I have the template or the theme I'm building off of.
1796000	1802000	I just wanted the intro part to look nice because I originally I had like my idea was going to have like a video looping in the background.
1802000	1806000	But for some reason and I, I don't know if it's the video I'm choosing or something.
1806000	1813000	I can't get like a DDR ace. They have a cloud video that keeps looping, but I can't get any other video.
1813000	1818000	I try to swap that with or like put something that loops like that to loop perfectly.
1818000	1824000	It like stutters and it doesn't seem to loop like continuously. I don't know.
1824000	1831000	So I was going to change up how I'm doing the theme and everything with that video, but all the songs in the background.
1831000	1835000	So we're going to have like video backgrounds and it's going to it's going to be awesome.
1835000	1839000	But I don't know why I'm even bothering to discuss this is just shit.
1839000	1844000	I'm going to be streaming on on camera and you're not even necessarily going to even see the intro.
1844000	1848000	But here's why, though, because eventually I do want to like distribute the theme.
1848000	1853000	But in Japan, of course, because I want to get arrested in Japan, it's it's not modifying it.
1853000	1856000	I mean, it's modifying a program, an application.
1856000	1861000	So. Yeah, I spent a lot of time just researching like how to do different things.
1861000	1872000	And so I'm in Blender now actually doing a 3D mockup of it so I can do like a pan around of a 3D logo and everything to project.
1872000	1879000	Basically, here's the give you an idea. So. I was looking for.
1879000	1886000	Like the the how you would call like, you know, projecting like an image, because I thought it was like 3D projection or was was called,
1886000	1893000	but that's actually something different where you actually project 3D project like a computer image up to three objects and do fun stuff like that.
1893000	1896000	But so I was looking for the terminology for that.
1896000	1904000	And I came across, of course, the Marvel, you know, the Marvel Cinematic logo theme that they do with all the video stuff.
1904000	1909000	I'm like, I want to do something like that. So I may end up doing something like that, but we'll see.
1909000	1915000	Anyways, so enough. So I yeah, I did. My cabinet is ready to play on again.
1915000	1922000	So I am going to start streaming again this week. I meant to do it last week, but I wanted to do a different mix and I just couldn't get it to work.
1922000	1930000	So I'm like, fuck it. Go back to Extreme again. And so it's all ready to go. I just have to go play now.
1930000	1934000	But ironically, I've had the TV available to me most of this week.
1934000	1946000	Why have I had the TV available to me this week? Because I or Santa Claus got the kids 2DS's for Christmas.
1946000	1957000	And so with that, they got it came with a new Super Mario Bros 2. I bought them both 3D or Mario Maker and Animal Crossing.
1957000	1963000	And you had to buy them both the game. Yes. Because they don't know how to share. No, they don't know how to share.
1963000	1969000	So here's why, though. It's important, though. It's so they can play together and they don't have to take turns because the whole point is they fight over the console.
1969000	1976000	Okay. Okay. But there's an ironic twist to this. So Animal Crossing. So my my son, Josh, loves Animal Crossing.
1976000	1981000	My son, Danny, doesn't give a shit about it. But guess who does give a shit about Animal Crossing wife, my wife.
1981000	1985000	And she's been playing Animal Crossing this entire week.
1985000	1991000	So so you finally figured out how to get your wife off the TV was to get her a DS and Animal Crossing.
1991000	1995000	And now Isabel and her are off being BFF. So they're talking about playing Animal Crossing.
1995000	2001000	And I've had the opportunity to play games on the TV. I've just I've sat down and going, I don't even know what I want to play.
2001000	2006000	It's like I was like, well, I could play Red Dead Redemption, too. I'm like, I don't really want to.
2006000	2010000	And then I was like, I should buy just cause for something like that.
2010000	2016000	But I I didn't want to buy another game with all these games in my I should start a complicated media project that nobody's going to see.
2016000	2023000	But myself and learn how to use Blender to create this elaborate introduction is going to do me literally no good now that I have access to the TV.
2023000	2027000	Yes, that's exactly what I decided to do instead.
2027000	2033000	You're such a man. You're such a man with man problems, but actual games.
2033000	2039000	So the actual games they did play. So I did play a game. I bought one on on steam recently.
2039000	2046000	And I can't remember the name of it now. It was it was called.
2046000	2049000	Well, it must have left an impression. No, no, I just.
2049000	2054000	And that's the part where the power went out for the first time. So it was a really quick hiccup.
2054000	2062000	It only went out for probably about 30 seconds, but it was enough to shut down all the computers and make us have to come back up on Twitch.
2062000	2066000	So we did give it another go and spare me the UPS jokes, guys.
2066000	2074000	It does come up on the stream a little bit, but just with all the investment that's been going on and some of the new hardware and stuff to do the conversion of the Twitch video.
2074000	2080000	Buying a UPS to prevent a freak storm was not exactly the first thing on the list.
2080000	2086000	Whoops. Could he use that tonight? Anyway, here's the smaller, unfortunately, because it happened again.
2086000	2091000	Spoiler alert. But here's the smaller second part of the show that was broadcast live.
2091000	2098000	All right. Welcome back to Orange launch radio. So what happened there in the little gap you're going to hear the podcast recording is that we actually did have a power failure.
2098000	2103000	So all that talking about I'm afraid this is going to happen. Sure enough, came to light.
2103000	2108000	We did have a power failure, so we lost Twitch and everything. We lost everything, obviously, for a couple minutes.
2108000	2110000	And everything's still flickering.
2110000	2113000	Everything's still flickering, so we may be hosed.
2113000	2119000	So if it does happen again, sadly, at that point, I'm going to call the show. At that point, it's just not safe to keep doing the show.
2119000	2125000	But yeah, all I can say is that these storms are crazy. Like for California, they're crazy.
2125000	2129000	For the rest of the world, they're probably not so bad. But for California, they're pretty crazy.
2129000	2135000	And yeah, so the wind is blowing like mad and I'm sure this will shut down the power.
2135000	2142000	So anyway, thankfully, because we do broadcast on Twitch, we are getting the audio pulled so we will have that for the podcast.
2142000	2146000	We won't like lose the episode completely, but it's just what a pain. Yeah, an absolute pain.
2146000	2150000	Anyway, when we left off, we were talking about your gaming gaming.
2150000	2153000	We were talking about some of the things you're going through with your DDR machine.
2153000	2158000	You talked about your wife and the DS's and that Animal Crossing addiction, all that.
2158000	2162000	Yeah, so they like their DS's and everything. So they've been playing that.
2162000	2166000	So she's been doing that. I haven't decided what to play on console yet.
2166000	2171000	Metronomicon was the game I played and it's a rhythm like RPG game.
2171000	2176000	I know Bobby's played it, but that's the game I purchased on Steam.
2176000	2182000	So it's kind of like DDR, but it's an RPG. So it's kind of neat.
2182000	2188000	So I played that a little bit and then Katamari reroll.
2188000	2191000	Finally got around to playing that, which is Katamari.
2191000	2196000	And then Pokemon Go, still been playing that.
2196000	2201000	I think that's pretty much it, unfortunately. It's been pretty minimal.
2201000	2205000	So for my gaming week, the week we were off, since I knew you were doing family stuff that Sunday,
2205000	2210000	and Dark Sakura still had her work thing, so there just wasn't enough of us to do a show that week.
2210000	2213000	But I ended up doing a stream of Katamari Damacy reroll.
2213000	2217000	So yeah, that went really well, actually, since a lot of the people that would usually show up for OLR
2217000	2220000	are watching that stream. So that was a really great thing to do.
2220000	2226000	And the game's fun. Once I got past that introduction, I was able to get the video configuration.
2226000	2228000	It's just dumb. I don't know why they do that.
2228000	2232000	It's so weird, because I think it's a lazy dump from the Switch version. But whatever, whatever.
2232000	2234000	That was a lot of fun to play.
2234000	2236000	I also took advantage of the Steam sale and I bought another game.
2236000	2239000	I bought Soulcalibur VI, but I actually haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
2239000	2243000	I'm hoping to do that in the next week. But another game I bought, part of the reason I haven't gotten around to Soulcalibur VI yet,
2243000	2246000	I bought Groove Coaster. So you know, Groove Coaster, right?
2246000	2247000	Yeah, I remember that.
2247000	2251000	It's a music game, and it originally came out on the iPhone in 2011, 2012.
2251000	2258000	It's been out on iPhone for years, but I think more people know it now because of its Japanese arcade machine release.
2258000	2263000	And if you go to round one, or I even saw it in the MAGFest footage we were looking at earlier,
2263000	2267000	they have these big Groove Coaster machines. So this game is really popular in the arcade.
2267000	2269000	So they actually have a version of it available on Steam.
2269000	2274000	So I picked that up on the Steam sale, because that's only, I think it's only been out for about six months.
2274000	2278000	And I had no idea, I somehow missed. We probably had talked about it on the show.
2278000	2284000	Talking about it on the show does not always translate to me going over to my computer and pressing the purchase button on Steam,
2284000	2289000	because I remembered to do it. So I finally did get it during the sale, and that's been fun to play.
2289000	2295000	It doesn't recognize my Xbox 360 controller for some reason, which is weird, because it has controller information in there.
2295000	2301000	So I actually play with the WASD and the IJKL, and that whole thing.
2301000	2304000	So I actually play with those two thumb sticks.
2304000	2308000	But it works like I'm actually able to play it.
2308000	2311000	So if you don't know what Groove Coaster is, it's a music game.
2311000	2316000	It's very bright, very colorful, very ravy, and you're going down this track.
2316000	2323000	They call it Coaster because it's like your little sprite, which a lot of times is the Space Invader, because it's, you know, the same company.
2323000	2329000	It goes down this track, and as you go through the track and hit notes, like notes will come onto the track, and you hit buttons in time with it.
2329000	2334000	But sometimes it's not just tap, sometimes it's tap both, sometimes it's slide, sometimes it's wiggle.
2334000	2337000	You know, it has you do these different things with the controllers.
2337000	2343000	And it's fun. So it's just a fun little tap-along music game, so people that are into music games I think will get a kick out of it.
2343000	2351000	And it's presented pretty well for Steam. I like the fact that it will recommend songs for you to play based on the difficulty of other songs that you've been playing.
2351000	2357000	So that's kind of neat. Obviously there's a ton of DLC. I haven't really explored a lot of the DLC. I know Undertale stuff is available.
2357000	2360000	That's kind of how I heard about this actually, because a friend of mine was getting the Undertale DLC.
2360000	2366000	So they have some interesting stuff on there. So yeah, I've been playing a little bit of Groove Coaster on PC, so that's been fun.
2366000	2371000	And continuing my adventures in World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy, and Final Fantasy gets a big patch next week.
2371000	2375000	Final Fantasy XIV, that is, gets a big patch next week. So I'm really excited about that.
2375000	2380000	And yeah, I think that's the bulk of the big stuff I've been playing.
2380000	2386000	I still need to pick up Beat Saber, because I actually charged all my move controllers and all that with the intention of getting it.
2386000	2389000	But then I just, I didn't get around to it that night.
2389000	2390000	You just played Rez instead.
2390000	2394000	I have played Rez, but just not, yeah, not recently.
2394000	2397000	But I talked about Rez VR a couple weeks ago, right? Yeah.
2397000	2400000	So I did finally get around to playing that. It was great. I really liked it.
2400000	2404000	But, like, Beat Saber's probably the next thing I want to pick up on PlayStation, so.
2404000	2410000	I guess one other, I should mention this game too, and it's my buddy Delvin's fault from VG Realness here on Twitch.
2410000	2416000	He started playing Grim Dawn, which is like a Diablo-esque type of game that came out probably about a year or two ago.
2416000	2417000	I think they're on their expansion now.
2417000	2421000	And so he was playing it so much, I was like, well, shoot, I want to play.
2421000	2425000	So I started playing, I got a character up to like level 15, like further than I'd played it before.
2425000	2427000	So I was having fun with that.
2427000	2428000	Game Grim Dawn?
2428000	2429000	Grim Dawn, yeah. It's Diablo-esque.
2429000	2432000	So it's that same like RPG, but in the action sense.
2432000	2437000	And, you know, you build your character's classes, but it's a lot more complicated than Diablo, in my opinion.
2437000	2441000	It's a little more, I think it's built more for fans of that genre.
2441000	2442000	But it's a fun game.
2442000	2447000	I just, I wish my inventory was bigger because I feel like I'm always like having to go back to do inventory management.
2447000	2449000	And that's the part of those games that gets a little bit dry.
2449000	2454000	But I know pros of the genre would tell me, well, you have to pick what to take with you.
2454000	2458000	And I'm just kind of like, yeah, but that's not, you know, other games like Diablo have spoiled me.
2458000	2461000	And all that stuff, you know what I mean? So, exactly.
2461000	2466000	So, good guy Bobby Black Wolf already has Dropboxed the first part of the show to me.
2466000	2468000	So I can do post-production really easy tonight.
2468000	2469000	Yay!
2469000	2470000	Thank you, Bobby. Appreciate that.
2470000	2473000	And thank you everybody for your support continuing on in our chat room there.
2473000	2474000	I really appreciate it.
2474000	2479000	ActDeft, speaking of chat, says, I'd kill for a Theatrhythm on Switch.
2479000	2482000	I would love Theatrhythm to come back.
2482000	2484000	Like, I love the arcade version of Theatrhythm.
2484000	2485000	I've been able to play that at round one.
2485000	2487000	And so I think it's a lot of fun.
2487000	2491000	And yeah, I would love to play that again, especially like on the Switch.
2491000	2495000	Or even if Nintendo's going to insist on keeping the DS being a thing,
2495000	2499000	I would love another version of that on DS, to be frank.
2499000	2502000	KArts1 in our Twitch chat says,
2502000	2508000	What's the name of that one free Diablo like on PC with the insanely big skill tree?
2508000	2511000	You're thinking of Path of Exile, I think, is the one.
2511000	2513000	Path of Exile is also available on consoles.
2513000	2517000	They have that on Xbox One, and I believe it was recently put out on PlayStation 4.
2517000	2519000	And it plays pretty well on consoles, all things considered.
2519000	2521000	Just like Diablo kind of does.
2521000	2525000	So yeah, Path of Exile, I like the soundtrack in that game, too.
2525000	2526000	It's got a really sweet soundtrack.
2526000	2528000	I know it's a weird thing to compliment, but like, you know,
2528000	2531000	when a game soundtrack is really good, like, you notice, you know.
2531000	2534000	So I noticed that Path of Exile had a pretty sweet soundtrack to it, too.
2534000	2536000	So and it's free, which is what people really like.
2536000	2542000	But because it's free, like, respecing is going to cost you money.
2542000	2545000	If that's what, you know, they find ways to kind of nickel and dime you.
2545000	2547000	Lots of cosmetics, of course.
2547000	2550000	But I don't think, like, they don't do it in an intrusive way.
2550000	2554000	You know, the way they do it, they're doing pretty good for themselves,
2554000	2556000	and they have a pretty successful franchise.
2556000	2558000	So there is that.
2558000	2560000	So all right.
2560000	2562000	Well, we're going to try to get on into some news here on this storm.
2562000	2565000	I think the wind finally calmed down, so hopefully the worst of it has passed.
2565000	2567000	I don't know. We'll see.
2567000	2571000	Good thing I shut off my computer in the other room and all that other stuff before tonight's show.
2571000	2574000	It's just a bummer we were trying to do live internet radio tonight.
2574000	2575000	What can you do?
2575000	2577000	All right, let's move on. I guess we're going to get into some news, right?
2577000	2578000	Let's do it.
2578000	2583000	So, you know, brand new console being announced by Slightly Mad Studios.
2583000	2587000	They are the developers of Need for Speed Shift and Project Cars.
2587000	2595000	And they basically made the CEO, Ian Bell, put out on Twitter,
2595000	2600000	or he created a Twitter account and put out some tweets regarding this console
2600000	2604000	that they're claiming is going to be the most powerful console ever built.
2604000	2606000	Eye roll there.
2606000	2610000	And it's projected specifications, according to him.
2610000	2615000	It's going to be capable of 4K output and VR gaming at 120 frames per second.
2615000	2620000	And that it'll be including a full engine for free game development.
2620000	2628000	And they said that, you know, apparently that it's going to be price competitive with upcoming console prices.
2629000	2631000	Okay, why are you sighing, though?
2631000	2633000	I'm just sighing because I've heard this before.
2633000	2640000	To be fair, our chat is lighting up to the Phantom 2, says Pod Culture.
2640000	2643000	Even more powerful than the Soulja Boy consoles, says K Arts.
2643000	2646000	So there's a lot of skepticism going on here.
2646000	2652000	I'm so skeptical because you don't have any fucking experience in developing a console.
2653000	2657000	One, two, we've seen this shit before.
2657000	2663000	Like with fucking Ouya, fucking Oton console, if anyone remembers what the fuck that is.
2663000	2665000	I mean, there's lots of promises.
2665000	2668000	You can fucking throw out numbers all fucking day long.
2668000	2672000	But until that fucking console comes out, I'm not believing one iota of this shit.
2672000	2673000	It's a tweet.
2673000	2674000	It's a fucking tweet.
2674000	2679000	It's a tweet that game journalists and blogs and all that are running with
2679000	2682000	because OMG new console announcement in a weird way.
2682000	2686000	So you're just like, I'm skeptical until the proof is out there.
2686000	2691000	But if you come to an E3 stage and you show this or whatever you want to use in this day and age
2691000	2696000	and you show one of these things in public and people play it and it's badass, then the hype turns against you.
2696000	2700000	The only thing that's missing from this right now is a crowdfunding campaign for this shit.
2700000	2701000	Really, that's it.
2701000	2703000	I mean, at least they're not doing that yet.
2703000	2705000	Or I don't know if they're planning on doing that.
2705000	2712000	But like, you know, even other tweets like, yeah, we're going 90 per eye, 180 FPS internally.
2712000	2715000	My CTO has just called me and confirmed that's what we'll be able to deliver.
2715000	2717000	You don't know what the fuck you're going to be able to deliver
2717000	2720000	because you haven't even figured out what the internals of this thing are going to be yet.
2720000	2721000	I'm sorry.
2721000	2724000	I'm highly skeptical of this.
2724000	2726000	And then they put out like a 3D render of like the console.
2726000	2730000	But hey, we blurred the inside because we don't know what the fuck's going inside of it yet.
2730000	2732000	But here's what we've designed on the outside.
2732000	2734000	And by the way, it's fucking large.
2734000	2736000	It looks like a PC case.
2736000	2738000	I'm just, I don't care.
2738000	2740000	Do we really need another console?
2740000	2745000	Is this, we don't even know what the next gen of consoles are going to be yet.
2745000	2748000	Like, and you can't say that, oh, this is going to be the most advancing.
2748000	2749000	Fuck you.
2749000	2752000	I mean, seriously, just saying, Loki, go off, drag her.
2752000	2753000	It's dumb.
2753000	2757000	I just don't like, what is the purpose of this?
2757000	2762000	Let me, let me get to some less skeptical comments from our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network.
2762000	2766000	Kaijuto says it sounds good, but it's going to take a while for them to get any playable games on there.
2766000	2768000	I believe them.
2768000	2774000	Bobby says, I roll my eyes at this, but I'm also excited to have positive things to think about the new Intellivision.
2774000	2775000	So I'm a hypocrite.
2775000	2779000	But I mean, but Intellivision, you know, there's a lot of names going into that.
2779000	2780000	There is console experience.
2780000	2784000	And Intellivision's not trying to like, oh yeah, 4K, 180 FPS.
2784000	2788000	True, Intellivision actually kind of trying to lower your expectations in a way, right?
2788000	2789000	Yeah, and I'm fine with that.
2789000	2792000	They're trying to say like, we're not going to be PS4.
2792000	2795000	This is exactly, like, they're clear with where their target is.
2795000	2801000	I have huge skepticism for anybody out there that comes out with, oh, we've got the most powerful console coming out.
2801000	2802000	We're designing it.
2802000	2806000	We don't know what the fuck we're doing, but we're designing the most, it'll be the most powerful thing.
2806000	2818000	And it'll be competitive because, like, it always seems with this type of stuff, the closer we get to it, the more vaporware this becomes and the more they start scaling back their expectation.
2818000	2825000	And just, I don't know, I've never seen a new console just launch like this and actually be successful.
2825000	2828000	To be fair, to be fair, it's a tweet.
2828000	2835000	The gaming people that have nothing better to talk about because the holidays have been going on and this is a very slow time of year.
2835000	2839000	And that, unfortunately, is where it cut out for good.
2839000	2846000	At that point, our power went out and it stayed out past the point where Loki ended up going home to make sure his family was okay.
2846000	2849000	And we weren't even getting data on our cell phones.
2849000	2851000	It was, the power was out.
2851000	2852000	So that was it.
2852000	2855000	We couldn't really do any more Orange Launch Radio for this week.
2855000	2858000	So that kind of stinks, but Mother Nature, what can you do?
2858000	2859000	Freak storm.
2859000	2861000	Climate change isn't real.
2861000	2870000	Anyway, what we can do, though, is that even though we didn't get to that part in our show role, which is like our list of everything we're going to talk about for the week,
2870000	2877000	you guys probably figured out by now that when we're talking about Radio Magic, we mean, yeah, we taped this segment a little earlier in the week.
2877000	2882000	So we actually do have the Classic Game of the Week segment already done.
2882000	2887000	So we'd like to present to you for this episode the Classic Game of the Week.
2890000	2897000	So that music must mean it's time to take a trip back in space and time and visit the Classic Game of the Week,
2897000	2908000	where every week we are joined by, well, hopefully we're usually joined by the one and only Dark Sakura to pick a classic game for the gaming vault for us to celebrate every week.
2908000	2911000	And we have via the Skypline tonight, Jamie is here.
2911000	2912000	Hello.
2912000	2913000	Hi.
2913000	2915000	Hi, welcome back.
2915000	2916000	Yeah.
2916000	2917000	We missed you.
2917000	2918000	New year, new me.
2918000	2919000	Yeah, new year, new you.
2919000	2923000	Have you really changed that much in 2019?
2923000	2925000	I got some wigs.
2925000	2933000	Oh, well, I can't wait for you to be back to the show and show off some of those wigs on our new Twitch stream, which has been going very well, but we missed you.
2933000	2937000	I've been, yeah, I've been playing, my current game is new wig, who dis?
2937000	2938000	New wig, who dis?
2938000	2941000	All right, well, let's get to it.
2941000	2942000	New week, which game?
2942000	2944000	Let's talk about the Classic Game of the Week.
2944000	2946000	What'd you pick for us?
2946000	2948000	I pick a really, really old one, Rob.
2948000	2949000	It's like super old.
2949000	2952000	Oh, I'm so, yeah, obviously I'm a little clued in on what it is.
2952000	2955000	And this is one of those games where like, I'm mad that this is 10 years old.
2955000	2962000	I am mad that this game is 10 years old, because that means it's been 10 years since I remember this game coming out.
2962000	2965000	Yeah, it's the City of Final Fantasy.
2965000	2975000	And while it came out in North America in August of 2009, it actually came out in Japan December 18th, 2008, so it counts.
2975000	2985000	So, there was also an international version that came out in Japan based on the North American version called City of Final Fantasy Universal Tuning that came out November 1st, 2009.
2985000	2992000	What's up with that? Square Enix always does that international version stuff. Always, always.
2992000	2996000	It's as reliable as, you know, bears shitting in the woods.
2996000	2998000	Square Enix is always going to do international versions.
2998000	3001000	Well, you know that they make our version better, because our version comes out afterwards.
3001000	3002000	True.
3002000	3003000	Yeah.
3003000	3017000	So, at any rate, the game basically takes characters from different Final Fantasy games and puts them on this big conflict between Cosmos, who's the goddess of harmony, and Chaos, the god of discord.
3017000	3025000	And so the two gods will summon different warriors to fight for their sides in their, quote, 13th war.
3025000	3034000	So, in the story, you know, you play 10 characters, chosen by Cosmos, who are the protagonists from the first 10 Final Fantasy games.
3034000	3042000	And you also have other features that are in the international version, such as an arcade mode.
3042000	3056000	So it was actually created because Nomura Tetsuya, who is the director for Kingdom Hearts, wanted to do a Kingdom Hearts spinoff, but they changed to Final Fantasy.
3056000	3062000	And so he designed all the characters in it and, you know, tried to make it appealing to Western players for some reason.
3062000	3068000	But it got really good reviews and generally considered a fun, pretty game.
3068000	3074000	I did not know it was originally a Kingdom Hearts thing. I wonder if that means we would have had, like, Disney characters and stuff.
3074000	3076000	And maybe I could have finally kicked Donald's-
3076000	3077000	That's probably why it wasn't.
3077000	3079000	I could have finally kicked Donald's ass for not healing me.
3079000	3083000	Right? Or, goofy for taking all the potions.
3083000	3084000	True.
3085000	3091000	Well, at any rate, the game was described as what's called Dramatic Progressive Action.
3091000	3100000	And so it is a full 3D game. It has- you can do wireless one-on-one multiplayer, and you can use the different skills of the different characters.
3100000	3104000	You can also customize your characters by adding equipment to them.
3104000	3116000	You know, it's fully 3D field map, you can do special maneuvers in the environment, you've got traps you can set off, all kinds of fun stuff like that.
3116000	3123000	And you then get experience and go from the battles, you can add, you know, more equipment and further customize your characters.
3123000	3129000	So basically, you know, you're supposed to reduce your enemy's HP to 0.
3130000	3137000	Your defensive and offensive power is shown in what's called BRV, or Bravery Points.
3137000	3144000	You start off with a certain amount, and you basically just have to use different HP attacks.
3144000	3152000	You can steal BRV from your opponents with different types of BRV attacks, and there's all kinds of weird shenanigans that go on in the game.
3153000	3163000	But basically, if you have depleted your BRV, basically if it's past 0 and into the negatives, you go into Break Mode,
3163000	3171000	which you can't cause any more HP or BRV damage, but every attack against you is critical.
3171000	3178000	You know, kind of like when your meter goes, like, max in Smash Brothers.
3179000	3190000	You also have an EX gauge that you can fill in different ways, like doing damage or taking damage or, you know, stealing or taking EX cores from the field.
3190000	3195000	But once it's filled, you go into EX mode where it increases your power and gets new attacks.
3195000	3201000	You get EX bursts, so you have some very damaging special attacks, kind of like the Limit Break.
3202000	3208000	And then in another mode that's more exclusive to the Western versions, you have Arcade Mode,
3208000	3216000	which makes it into a traditional fighting game with all of the RPG elements removed and the characters' abilities just down to the basics.
3216000	3226000	So you've got three tiers in that Normal, Hard, and Time attack, and beating any tier of Arcade Mode will give you player points that you can use for stuff in Story Mode.
3226000	3233000	And all the characters, including the villains, are available in Arcade Mode except for Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht.
3233000	3238000	They need to be bought with the PP catalog from other modes.
3239000	3242000	And so that really is just the big thing about the game.
3242000	3249000	You've got your, you know, your ten characters, which starts off with the Warrior of Light in the first game,
3249000	3257000	Furion, the Onion Knight, Cecil, Butts, it says Bart, but I call him Butts because that's how I first started playing Final Fantasy V.
3257000	3258000	Because you're a mature adult.
3258000	3261000	He needs Butts. You know what? Whatever.
3261000	3262000	It was Batsu.
3263000	3266000	It was Chara, or Tina as she was in Japan,
3266000	3269000	Cloud, Squall, Zidane, and Tidus.
3269000	3272000	Or Tidus in the Japanese one.
3272000	3276000	And so they have to retrieve the ten crystals, which will help them defeat Chaos.
3276000	3281000	And so, you know, you basically have this whole big, overwhelming story.
3281000	3285000	And you've also got two other storylines, one called Distant Glory,
3285000	3291000	where Shanto, I'm going to mispronounce it, Shantoto, sorry,
3291000	3298000	and Gabranth are introduced with two different areas that they are trapped in and have to find a way out.
3298000	3303000	And then you have Inward Chaos, which is an alternate scenario in which Chaos has never been defeated.
3303000	3307000	And you're guided by something called Shimoyu to defeat Chaos.
3307000	3315000	So yeah, basically it was meant to be a spinoff from Kingdom Hearts when they were developing Kingdom Hearts II.
3315000	3319000	But Nomura was like, he didn't want the Disney characters to fight each other,
3319000	3322000	and so he opted to use the Final Fantasy characters instead.
3322000	3328000	Although the idea did lead up to the development of Kingdom Hearts 3.58 by two days.
3329000	3336000	And then it also led up to other new developments, too.
3336000	3342000	Like, some of the other games that had influence on this were also A Little Bit of the World Ends with You.
3342000	3345000	So they really tried to involve different things.
3345000	3349000	So they were able to just throw in all kinds of other things.
3349000	3355000	And of course, as the game progressed, they were able to do sequels for this,
3355000	3358000	because people wanted other characters, too.
3358000	3366000	So they were also trying to include other characters that had tie-ins to the main characters.
3369000	3374000	So it's just really, overall, a very dynamic game.
3374000	3381000	And then the game was originally licensed in the US as just Dissidia.
3382000	3387000	But then they connected it with Final Fantasy, of course, later on through the Japanese website.
3387000	3395000	The soundtrack was done by Ishimoto Takeharu, and the soundtrack by itself was released in December 2008.
3395000	3403000	It had a regular and special edition, and just really, really good music for it, too.
3403000	3407000	Lots of merchandise that came out for it, the international version, like I said.
3407000	3415000	There was also a Mystic Silver PSP that came out with a copy of Dissidia Final Fantasy 2GB Memory Stick,
3415000	3421000	and a copy of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children that came out in August of 2009.
3421000	3428000	And then there was Dissidia Final Fantasy Ultimania Alpha, which was a reference guide for the game.
3428000	3432000	And it was part of the Ultimania series for what they did.
3432000	3442000	Suntory, which is like a whiskey and brewing company, also collaborated with Squenix to do the Dissidia Final Fantasy potion drinks that came out in Japan.
3442000	3451000	And then there were trading arts figures for the game that had Cloud, Squall, Zidane, Tidus, and the Warrior of Light.
3451000	3457000	And then there was a second one that had Sephiroth, Terra, Butch, Fearion, and Cecil.
3457000	3460000	So it sold pretty well.
3460000	3465000	Yeah, it was the 12th best selling game in Japan in 2008.
3465000	3471000	The United States debuted in 7th place in 2009 in August, despite only having been out for four days.
3471000	3475000	Wow. Well, the Final Fantasy name is a strong thing.
3475000	3480000	Yeah, so there we go. The game is Dissidia Final Fantasy.
3480000	3484000	Awesome. I have to admit, I tried to, I didn't really play it on the PSP.
3484000	3486000	I tried to get into it with that recent PlayStation 4 release.
3486000	3491000	I wasn't really feeling it, but maybe I need to go back and experience the original.
3491000	3494000	I don't know. Maybe I was doing it all wrong.
3494000	3495000	Possibly.
3495000	3500000	It was just, it was really hard to understand, but I've had that happen with video games.
3500000	3504000	Is that like, it goes really over my head and then I'll go back and like play it again.
3504000	3507000	And then I'm like, okay, this isn't as bad as I thought it was.
3507000	3511000	So sometimes the problem isn't the game, Jamie, it's me.
3511000	3514000	Well, sometimes it is the game though.
3514000	3517000	It sometimes is the game, but I don't think in this case. So anyway.
3517000	3519000	All right. Well, there it is. Classic of the week.
3519000	3523000	We do have to get back to the live show, but quickly, Jamie, since it's been a little bit since the listeners heard from you,
3523000	3532000	do you have any like gaming resolutions for 2019? Anything you're looking forward to playing or destined to catch up on?
3532000	3534000	I'm going to stream some shit.
3534000	3543000	So think of, think of, I would like the listeners to think of a SNES game that they would like to see me play through.
3543000	3547000	And maybe I'll do it if I have it, which I, chances are I do.
3547000	3549000	If it's in the vault somewhere.
3549000	3550000	It's somewhere in there.
3550000	3552000	It's true. You're not going to be restricted.
3552000	3553000	I still want to copy.
3553000	3557000	I was just saying, you're not going to be restricted to just the classic consoles or I'm sorry.
3557000	3560000	I mean the classic, like the SNES classic and those things.
3560000	3563000	You're not just restricted to those because chances are you probably have the original hardware.
3563000	3568000	I mean, I mean, you certainly have the original console, but you probably have the original cart somewhere too.
3568000	3574000	Well, yeah, I've got the original console that has a lot of original carts.
3574000	3590000	And if I need to, because I was actually thinking I've got this big Sony Vega in here that would be perfect for not having to deal with the input lag from the component cable.
3590000	3591000	So we'll see.
3591000	3592000	All right.
3592000	3593000	Well, best of luck to you in that endeavor.
3593000	3596000	I know a lot of people are trying to focus on streaming this year.
3596000	3600000	I guess us at OLR included with this whole Twitch move we just started a couple of weeks ago.
3600000	3604000	So, yeah, it's going to be a big year for streaming.
3604000	3605000	Absolutely.
3605000	3611000	All right. Before we let you go, any final words for the listeners before we let you go?
3611000	3618000	I wish I could eat ice cream.
3618000	3622000	And with that, that's everything we had for Orange Launch Radio this week.
3622000	3625000	So I know it's a really weird episode, but what can you do?
3625000	3630000	Anyway, let's all cross our fingers and our toes that we're not going to get hurricane style storms next week.
3630000	3639000	And we will be back live on Twitch next week, God willing, literally on January 13th.
3639000	3644000	So you can check that out Sunday, January 13th at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
3644000	3646000	Thanks, you guys, as always, for subscribing to our show.
3646000	3647000	We really appreciate it.
3647000	3650000	Thanks for listening this whole way through, even though it was a really weird episode.
3650000	3652000	Really appreciate you guys.
3652000	3654000	And we'll see you next time, okay?

3657000	3659000	Tweets would be great, too, at OLR.
3659000	3661000	And that's it.
3661000	3663000	Awkward ending, but what can you do?
3663000	3664000	That's it.
3664000	3666000	Fade to black.
3666000	3667000	Bye.
