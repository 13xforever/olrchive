00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are you ready for competitive farming? Well then, let's get ready to tractor!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're mowing through this and more in the week's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 761 of our show for this January the 27th of 2019.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Robertson joining me here in studio. Techmaster Loki's back. Hey, I'm back. Hey, good to have you back.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, it's good to be back. So what I know a lot of people want to know about is the kind of conclusion to the broccoli farm saga.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because you told the kids, for those that are new to Orange Lounge Radio, you had talked a few weeks ago about how you planned this trip to Disneyland a couple months ago.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But you told the kids you were going to be taking them to the broccoli farm. You didn't tell them Christmas Day, you didn't tell them on Hanukkah, you didn't even tell them on the car ride down, did you?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, well we told them that they weren't going to a broccoli farm, but we just didn't. This is all why Loki wasn't here last week.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So if you watched last week's show, you saw Alan was here, Dar Sager was in the studio, but you weren't because you were finally taking the big broccoli farm trip.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, so we didn't tell them where they're going. In fact, we actually got to the place we were going to the place we were staying.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We didn't tell them, and they went upstairs and they put their stuff away, and then finally we had them come downstairs and there was,

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:55,000
it was like a, not an envelope, but there was like a picture, like they had set up something for my son's birthday, you know, basically saying,

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you know, hey, I hope you guys have fun, stuff like that, happy birthday. And so we were asking them like, so where is it that you think you're going?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, we're not going to a broccoli farm, so where is it that we're going? And they're like, I don't know, my wife's like, well look around the room,

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
look around, what do you see, you know, where do you think that you are right now? And so they saw like some of the Disneyland stuff.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Knott's Berry Farm?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They don't know what Knott's Berry Farm is, come on.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Nobody does.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Um, so we're going to Disneyland, so they, you know, they got pretty excited about, actually mildly excited, I don't know if they were like super excited,

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
like, you know, we have it recorded.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, I was just, your wife posted a video, I didn't want to share the video because that's your personal business.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, I don't care, yeah.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But, um, so, uh, but what I, I, I was watching the video and, um, I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted because Smoosh just walked into the studio.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know what he's doing tonight, he's probably, he's looking for the plug, he's probably going to unplug it, oh boy.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, well anyway, um, so I saw the video and my favorite part of the video was that, yeah, you know, the boys are like, you know, they're kind of excited for a minute,

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and then your oldest kind of goes, yeah, but what about the toilet? And then it cuts off.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because I guess, I don't know if there was something with the bathroom or what the deal was.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because he had used the bathroom and the toilet was still running for some reason.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was just one of those, like, the, the, the water, something you don't push the handle all the way.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It, it's just like, it just, yeah, it, it stuck running a lot, um, but that was apparently very distracting for him.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But no, they, they had, they had fun, and it was funny because, like, we were trying to get them ready for bed and then they started launching fireworks for their nightly show,

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and so, you know, they got to see that the first day, which was pretty cool, yeah.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Great. So the family have, I know we are a video game podcast, I promise we're gonna get to games, but, you know, this is, this is the conclusion of a weeks-long saga here.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Did the kids have a good time at Disneyland?

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, they had a great time at Disneyland. Um, my, uh,

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What a dumb question, right?

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, uh, Josh went on, like, all of the roller coasters and stuff. My youngest son, Danny, was a little bit more cautious.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He went on Thunder Mountain once, and then we took him on it again the second time at night, and it's harder to see the turns at night, so he didn't like it.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So Danny got your feelings on roller coasters.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, I, I got over my fear of roller coasters pretty quick after,

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Was there anything you wanted to ride?

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I, I went on Thunder Mountain a few times, um, and I got to do Star Tours. See, the first time I went on Star Tours, or the only time I went on Star Tours was, like, back when the original Star Tours opened,

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and so, that made me, that made me pretty motion sick, you know, the first time.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But the new Star Tours is pretty awesome. You don't get motion sick in that, and it's, it's awesome.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So that was, uh, my youngest son's favorite ride was going on that, so we went on Star Tours, like, five or six times.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Did you go, I would say the craziest ride there is California, oh wait, um, Incredible Coaster, or whatever?

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Incredible Coaster, yeah.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Did you go on that?

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My wife went on that. I didn't go on that.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Uh,

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We'll give her her.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You saw the loop? You saw the loop?

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Not the loop, it's just how fast it goes. I, I, like, I probably could do it, but I just don't want to.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did you do the, um, Radiator Springs, the cars?

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh yeah, see, see, we tricked our, our youngest son, cause he didn't want to, he's like, is this as fast as, uh, Thunder Mountain?

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm like, no, no, it's not as fast, and I'm looking at it, and it just goes by, I'm like, this is much faster.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're tricking the child and yourself.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is much faster. No, I was like, I thought it would be fine, but like, it went pretty fast, so like, I, I was trying to tell him, like, yeah, it'll be fine.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He's like, is it going to go fast now?

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You were driving faster down the freeway.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Exactly, we were driving faster down the freeway, but, uh, no, and, and there was a bit of drama, so like, we had three days, and, and we were coming home, and he gets car sick, and so he throws up in the car, so that was fun.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Um, yeah, um, it was just because he was doing, like, his tablet and stuff while he was in the car, so, which is weird, though, cause he did it all the way down, but, I don't know, for some reason, something was bothering him.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Um, but, yeah, we had a lot of fun, we, um, ate at the, they had food trucks down in downtown Disney a few times, so we ate the dumpling food truck a few times.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, yeah, cause probably the food truck's probably cheaper than most of the stuff that's in the parks.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, a lot of it.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thank you.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All right.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's way too damn expensive.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Look, we could do a full Disney podcast, but it is a video game podcast.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let me ask this real quick, though, before we get into the kickoff topic for tonight.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Um, did you, um, get to, uh, do any gaming at Disney?

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, I, I didn't.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I, Stark, the, uh, was it a Starkade, or whatever they call it?

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It closes at 4.30, so anytime I got over to Tomorrowland, it was already closed.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wow, I wonder why so early?

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't know, but it, it closes, I think, at 4.30.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Every time I got there, the doors were closed.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The neon sign's still there, but the doors are closed.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, the neon sign's kind of iconic, yeah.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, so I don't know if it was open earlier in the morning.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I didn't notice it, but I didn't get a chance to actually go there and do that.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And they also have, like, some VR.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was not really, like, it's VR, but it's VR with, like, wireless, uh, backpacks and everything.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's almost, like, not, sort of like laser tag, but not, you're just playing, I guess, against the computer or something like that.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But you're basically free to move around, like, a whole arena type thing.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So they have that with, like, Star Wars and something else.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I wanted to try that, but I didn't get a chance to do that.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I also didn't get a chance to, because we were just getting back too late each night, to go down to round one to play anything, so.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, bummer.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Um, yeah, I just, I couldn't do it.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Family was more important, so I'm glad you guys had a good trip.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Alright, real quick, it got brought up in our chat room, because we do tape live at Twitch TV every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blockwolf show at the VOG Network Twitch channel.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And by the way, guys, pour one out for the radio feed.

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's, uh, it's, uh, if it's not gone as of now, it's going to be gone tomorrow.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The official cancellation went through, so, uh, just, uh, yeah, it's all, it's all about, uh, Twitch and the continued distribution of our, our other shows that we network with, um, through their, uh, various podcasts.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But, uh, pour one out for the radio feed tonight, guys.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Um, but, uh, we are, of course, it's all about Twitch now, uh, for the live stuff, which is over at our Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
VOG Network, the voice of geeks network.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, uh, big question we're getting in the chat.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Space Mountain.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Did you brave that one?

109
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can't see that one.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Um, I didn't go on Space Mountain.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Um, my, my oldest son and my wife did, though.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Um, I've been on Space Mountain before, so that was fine.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Um, I just, because my youngest son wouldn't go on anything, I was stuck going on there.

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And my wife's like, well, you sure you want, you know, I could, you can go on with, you know, Josh or I can, but she likes roller coasters more than I do.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So I'm like, you, you just go, I'll just stay here with him and I'll go on whatever he wants to go on.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, um, like, you know, Winnie the Pooh and, uh, we went on Star Tours like a bunch of times, but like, and that was fine.

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Um, but yeah, I mean, they went, she went on Matterhorn and it's like, I mean, they give you an idea how long it's been.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Like when I went on Matterhorn last time, it was like, you had to pretty much sit in each other's laps as you go in there.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now it's all completely different.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They made it single rider.

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, so it's, um.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We're going down the Disneyland path again.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sorry.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's all right. I can talk about Disneyland for three hours too, but we do want to get into, uh, some gaming tonight.

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We'll switch to the food then because Dole Whip, fucking awesome.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know, love Dole Whips.

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And then, um, did you get the bacon one that's limited time?

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, they didn't have that there, but they also had, uh, the food is a lot better there from what I remember.

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Cause before it used to be like the same shit in every single like spot.

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They always have just like burgers and whatever, but now it's actually pretty good.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Um, and then the ice cream place.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right. Well, since you're talking about entertainment, it does kind of tie into our kickoff topic tonight.

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I got to admit it's, I feel like overall, it's been a little bit of a slower news week, so I don't have something that's like a deep dive on an actual like gaming topic.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But I mean, well it is, but it's not like about a game, a specific game or an event or something.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's more kind of about where the industry is at, a kind of a state of the industry sort of thing.

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because, um, there's an article that went out this last week, uh, that actually came from Variety.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Variety is a little bit more of a magazine that focuses.

139
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, it's what is newspaper magazine on? It's like a weekly publication.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Of course they have the online presence as well.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I'm sure Bobby's already talking in chat.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He was quoted or he was, he was identified.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And yeah, he wants, he has an article there.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But, uh, all that aside, um, they're usually more focused on like the movie industry.

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You talk about like that end of the entertainment industry.

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sure they're talking about what's going on on TV and things like that.

147
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
With the, that being the Oscars season, they talk a lot about that.

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A lot of the movie studios that actually want to run those four-year consideration campaigns on why a star is born should win Best Picture or Glenn Close should win Best Actress or whatever.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm barely following it this year.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But, um, those ads run in Variety because a lot of trade people, uh, from the entertainment industry that do that magazine.

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So the whole reason I'm setting that up is because Variety ran a pretty big piece on gaming this week.

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And the state of the gaming industry.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So they, um, ran an article with the line, uh, headline.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Americans spent more than 43 billion, with a B, on video games in 2018.

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Now this all ties into now that we're getting towards the end of January.

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We're getting our couple weeks delayed numbers from December from the MPD group and all that, right?

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I think we have a story later on about some of those specific sales.

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But we can kind of talk in general about what, you know, those results are saying.

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is that the gaming industry, if you didn't already know, is a pretty big deal.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Wow, 43 billion dollars.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I guess we don't need to do any more loot boxes or anything, right?

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Because they've made enough money, right?

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Some of that might have come from loot boxes.

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Anyway, it is a record-breaking 43.4 billion in revenue that they made in 2018.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That is through the Entertainment Software Association and the MPD group.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That is a 18% growth from 36.9 billion in 2017.

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So put those two numbers side by side.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, I know you joke about loot boxes, but love them or hate them.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's probably part of it.

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, and it's only going to get worse, and here's why.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because, you know, this type of growth is not sustainable.

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And so this is where you get, you know, the next year, we're going to have layoffs,

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and you're going to see more of this bullshit that they're going to try to monetize things,

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
like every which way, because they're trying to sustain that growth, which is just not sustainable.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Well, let's see. Let's continue on some of the places that these numbers come from.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Hardware revenue was up 15%, so there's that.

177
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I mean, you could attribute some of that to Nintendo Switch and the success there and so forth.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Software sales, physical and digital, in-game purchases, subscriptions, 18% growth.

179
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
A comment from President and CEO Stanley Pierre Lewis, the ESA.

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The impressive economic growth of the industry announced today parallels the growth of the industry

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
in mainstream American culture.

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Across the nation, we count people of all backgrounds and stages of life

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
among our most passionate video game players and fans.

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Interactive entertainment stands today as the most influential form of entertainment in America.

185
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So with that quote, kind of attributing a lot of that growth to,

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
hey, it's not just a teenage boys in their basement type of thing anymore.

187
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It never really was. I know we all know that.

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But now it's, you know, much more mainstream with men, women, young, older, everything.

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And yes, Gen X2, there's all those articles about millennials versus baby boomers.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But yes, Gen X2 is playing video games as well.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So everybody's playing video games is really a big part of that.

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So of course 2018, record setting year.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There was another quote here I want to make sure we talk about too, which is mobile games.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The number of mobile game players in North America, an increase of 5% over the prior year.

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is the number they report.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Of the 283.1 million mobile users in the U.S. and Canada, 210.9 million are gamers.

197
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Another quote from games industry analyst with the MPD group, Matt Piscatella.

198
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Mobile gaming reviews have continued to grow in the U.S. and Canada,

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and it now represents the largest segment within the gaming marketplace.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
60% of Americans and Canadians play mobile games because of the rich library of content available.

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I almost said cache of clans, but that...

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That would still be accurate.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Pokemon Go, which obviously we talked a little bit about that game here on the show before.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Roblox. I always forget what a big game Roblox is.

206
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It is a huge game.

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He has a huge game. Tons of kids.

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Like tweens, I guess maybe.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like in that kind of like, maybe just a little older from where your kids are at,

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
but younger than like 18 too.

211
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I think Roblox is like really big with that set.

212
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is what I've heard.

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I have friends that are like, yeah, my kids play it.

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, my kids play it.

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Do they play Roblox?

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, my oldest son plays it.

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay, so then right about in that area.

218
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Fortnite, of course, and that's probably a big one to attribute to a lot of people.

219
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I swear to God, when we do get him on the show eventually, and it's gonna happen again,

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the dude, he is fucking flossing all of the goddamn time.

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And not his teeth.

222
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
All of the time.

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Just flossing like all, just like randomly just, I'm bored, I'm gonna start flossing.

224
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This is all of the time.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And no, I'm not doing it again.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I have pictures too, like we took pictures.

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Save those for the yearbook when he's 18.

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We took a picture, I should have taken a video, but we took a picture when we were waiting for my wife to go on the Incredicoaster.

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They had, you know, Mr. Incredible there.

230
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And so, you know, they took pictures with him.

231
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And what's he start doing?

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He starts flossing.

233
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Again.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm like, why are you doing that?

235
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He's like, I don't know.

236
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Maybe the kid's gonna be a dancer.

237
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know.

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Anyway, so Slottomania, the other one, I don't even know what the hell that is.

239
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But anyway, among many others are examples of the breadth and depth of engaging experiences available on mobile platforms.

240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So it is interesting to note that they didn't talk about loot boxes there.

241
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Of course not.

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It seems like in here, what I'm kind of getting from this article is that, and maybe your interpretation is different,

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
but what I'm kind of getting from that is that they are attributing a lot of this growth to the fact that more people are playing games at the end of the day.

244
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
More people that own mobile phones are playing games because you've got these mobile games that are just getting bigger and bigger between Pokémon Go and Fortnite, Roblox, everything I just named there and more.

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's really causing that industry to grow.

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Right.

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So, I mean, so the gaming industry is, you know, it's interesting because you and I remember in our lifetimes when the gaming industry was a very like niche thing.

249
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
People didn't talk about games.

250
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
People past a certain age usually didn't understand what video gaming was all about unless they were like in the industry that made them.

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Now, we're talking about an industry that is getting very competitive with, if not exceeding in some ways, the movie industry.

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't know how much the movie industry made it last year.

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm pretty sure it has exceeded the movie industry.

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think it has in some metrics, maybe not in others, but I mean that's, I'll let Variety magazine hammer out those specifics.

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The reality is as an art form, gaming is on a level certainly with movies and, you know, everybody knows what a movie is.

256
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Everybody knows what a TV show is.

257
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Heck, you know, I notice that our numbers for people watching on Twitch tonight probably a little bit lower and that's because, that's fine, but that's probably because of like TV stuff because you've got the,

258
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and don't go switching the channel, but you've got the rent live thing going on which, you know, well traditional TV in some ways is super hurting.

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Not to get too much on a tangent, but traditional TV networks like your ABC, CBS, NBC and all that stuff is hurting a lot because of gaming, right?

260
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Because more people are turning to gaming for their entertainment, right?

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's part of the Fortnite, things like that.

262
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And certainly cable, there's so many cable networks.

263
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There's that kind of in between, things like Twitch and what you're doing right now by participating with our show.

264
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You're opting instead to watch Twitch and us, thank you for that by the way, as opposed to watching Rent Live or the SAG Awards I think are tonight or I think there's a big baseball game going on.

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
There's a variety of those.

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Those award shows, honestly, folks, I mean, just wait for the next day when they clip all the good stuff out and you have your list of winners.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Do you really need to watch the whole thing live?

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's how I feel, but then when it comes to things like sports, like even though I don't watch sports, I totally understand why other people want to be their life.

269
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But my point was is that a lot of like the old school networks are really making their, like where they're going now to kind of compete with streaming and that other stuff.

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You get this huge focus on live stuff.

271
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I think that's why you're seeing more musicals that are being done in prime time.

272
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Like, you know, you've got the rent thing going on tonight, although plot twist, I hear it's not actually live.

273
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They ended up running a tape.

274
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They they ran the dress rehearsal as if it's live because one of the lead actors like rolled his ankle earlier today.

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No, make him do it with the rolling.

276
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah, we're doing it live.

277
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's going to be live.

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's why I thought you had understudies, but that's a whole nother fight.

279
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Fine. They're running the dress rehearsal instead.

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So there's all that.

281
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But then like things like, you know, like the celebrity big brother and those that, you know, that's more live stuff and sports like it's very hard to compete with sports because sports is, you know, also like a live presentation and all that.

282
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And many people get very excited about the sports stuff still.

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So, yeah, it's just I know it's just it's just interesting to see like these things growing while these other industries that probably thought they were going to be around forever are like having to adapt or die.

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think there's a very distinct possibility within our lifetimes.

285
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The next, you know, before we're like too old, but I would say before Medicare, before we're 65, I would say there's a really good chance.

286
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:51,000
NBC, CBS, ABC or Fox, one of them goes under or complete or I should say completely transforms from what we know it as today.

287
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like maybe goes completely online and there's no more broadcast TV.

288
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know, but that's maybe that's a whole nother thing.

289
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I mean, ABC knows could be anything. So and I guess, you know, one of the things it should be worth saying, one other thing that I think these or these networks do pretty decently is local coverage.

290
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Like, you know, you know, even though our show is based in Sacramento, we're not really like we're not like focused on that.

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We're a worldwide gaming show. So we talk about gaming everywhere so that we can get listeners from all all different parts of the globe.

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But that's not maybe the same outlook that TV networks have on it.

293
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Also, I don't pay attention enough to what's going on in our area anyways.

294
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Actually, the thing about that the other day, I was like driving by a golf land.

295
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I was like, what if there's any other arcades out here?

296
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You know, because I remember before, like we used to go try to scout arcades like, oh, which one has like this mix of DDR, you know, the play and stuff.

297
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And now it's like, I don't even know. I know where there is an arcade.

298
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I couldn't tell you which ones have DDR in them.

299
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, I I could tell you off air. I don't get it. I want to get a local.

300
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Right. I am the same for ninety nine point nine percent of listeners. They don't care where the DDR machines are right in your garage.

301
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's the one you need to know about going to our chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network.

302
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Quest Buster in chat says even Netflix admitted that one of their biggest competitors was Fortnite.

303
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And, you know, but the bubble is going to burst on Fortnite someday.

304
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know, there's always that kind of like game darling that seems to like be all what the mainstream is all about and obsessed with.

305
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And then eventually it just kind of fades to the next big thing.

306
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like I kind of feel like not everybody's going to agree. And that's fine.

307
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Maybe be a voice and chat if you strongly disagree. But I kind of feel like Minecraft.

308
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't say Minecraft's dead. I'm not saying Minecraft's dead. But Minecraft peaked.

309
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like Minecraft is not where it was a couple of years ago before Fortnite.

310
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You know, Five Nights at Freddy, you know, with all the stuff that they sell at Target and all those stores.

311
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You know, again, I kind of think the fever pitch of that kind of peaked a little while ago.

312
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I might come back with the movie or if, you know, the guy decides to release a new game or I do want to see a movie.

313
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't really care for the series, but a movie. I think a movie would be awesome.

314
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, I would love to see that. But anyway, and then Bobby Blackall says it was Minecraft before Fortnite.

315
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And then what? What before Minecraft? I can't even remember that far back. Maybe.

316
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't know. I don't know if there was a game that especially talking about, you know, what the variety article gets into with growing.

317
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Who is playing games? Because Minecraft was really big at attracting Warcraft audience or Warcraft.

318
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Maybe are like every quest is. I don't even know the MMO MMOs in general.

319
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Maybe I might go with that anyway. Let's see.

320
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Quest Buster with another great comment saying Microsoft may have missed on their initial messaging for the Xbox one,

321
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
but they weren't wrong about where the living room was headed digitally.

322
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And he has a very smart comment because it's absolutely right.

323
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Like for all the crap that Microsoft got with the Xbox ones launch,

324
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
they weren't wrong on some of the things they were predicting. They really, really were not wrong.

325
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But it's a couple key decisions and ultimately messaging that really tanked that whole thing for them.

326
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You know, again, I really think and I'm sure many of you view it the same way, and I'm not talking bad about the Xbox one.

327
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's a fine system. But I think in many ways, we're in kind of like a flip flop of where we were last gen,

328
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
where PlayStation three really missed the mark on the messaging and then kind of had to play catch up.

329
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And eventually they caught up. And I kind of feel like Microsoft's kind of been in the flip side of that ever since that all went down a couple of years ago when it was first announced.

330
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, it's going to be, I would think, a pretty even playing field, though, when we come to the next generation of consoles,

331
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
because I don't know, I don't have a ton of goodwill for Sony right now.

332
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I mean, it's just the way they're treating their customers and all the mod support and backwards compatibility and that kind of stuff.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It kind of sucks because like like I was even, well, I guess I'll get into it later in my gaming week.

334
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And so I actually dug out my PlayStation two to try to mess with that.

335
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But like it'd be much easier if we had that backwards compatibility support on a PlayStation four.

336
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I guess my PlayStation three could do it because I have an original PlayStation three, but it's still pain in the ass.

337
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. One other comment I want to address here before we start to get into some of the other stories tonight in our gaming weeks.

338
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Black Mamba 1977 in chat at Vogue Network on Twitch says cable is getting less and less views because everything is going digital, too.

339
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's I think that's a huge point as well. Like I was randomly watching. And this is a funny thing now.

340
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Do you know where I watch cable more than anything now? I don't watch it on my TV.

341
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm watching it now on my second monitor because they do the whole streaming, even like stream cable now, basically.

342
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And then I'm playing a game on my first monitor. But I was watching a cable network. I was watching Pop, I think.

343
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And they were showing reruns of House. And it looks like garbage because, you know, there's only so many HD cable networks and the other ones are standard def.

344
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And they look terrible because it's like standard def. But with the black bars, because the original was in HD.

345
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So it's like and it's all like here's the best part, like, you know, because I have Comcast and Comcast charges you more money.

346
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If you want HD channels, you have to pay for an HD tuner, which costs fourteen ninety nine a month.

347
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I say fuck you. And I just stream all your shit through the other apps. And guess what?

348
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's in fucking HD and I'm not paying you any additional money and I get to watch it all when I want.

349
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You showed them. All right. But anyway, my point is, is that but there's so much digital.

350
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And now you see some of these networks going digital like CBS, you know, CBS with their all access.

351
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
As much as people really hate that because they feel like, oh, I'm paying to play or excuse me, I'm paying to just watch Star Trek.

352
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And there's not a lot of other offerings. You know, they don't compete with Netflix right now, even though the new Star Trek is great, just saying.

353
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But do you have to pay for all access, even if you have like you can't link it to your cable subscription to like watch that?

354
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No, it's it's a premium like that. I know. I know. But again, that's what piracy is for.

355
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They they looped in like the big brother feeds and all that. There's other stuff besides Star Trek.

356
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I guess a good fight. And, you know, they're trying. There's the the Twilight Zone reboot.

357
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But anyway, my point is, oh, those have doesn't have like Neil Patrick Harris or someone or who Jordan Peele is to reveal.

358
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, starring in it. He's like producing it. I'd watch them get out.

359
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, I'm very interested in that, too. But anyway, this is a TV show.

360
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But here's the other thing about the CBS all access thing is that when you have it and you're, you know, paying for the Star Trek and everything,

361
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
you can also tune in to through the app, your local CBS station or like CBS's subsidiary.

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Like they have a sports channel, a weather channel, those types of things. Maybe it's entertainment. I don't know.

363
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But anyway, my point is, it's kind of going around Comcast in a way. CBS is selling that direct to you through their all access.

364
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And I wonder if Comcast, the reason why they're nickel and diming all these other places, because they're in.

365
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And you notice, like a company like Comcast really is trying to sell the phone line, the home security there.

366
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They're not focused so much anymore. They really need to cut off the phone line. No one fucking wants landline.

367
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You know, there is if people are buying it, they're going to try to keep selling.

368
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But the point is, they're doing that stuff because they can see what's happening is that the future of TV might be these providers that are going around.

369
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Traditional television. Anyway, I'm sorry. We got a little off the topic about video games, but I think at the end of the day, honestly,

370
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I mean, as much as you might kind of roll your eyes and say, I thought it was a gaming show.

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I kind of think it does all tie together because you're going back to the story, you know, because of the growth of the gaming industry,

372
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
because gaming is one of those things that's taking away from the traditional television viewership and what we know about cable and things like that.

373
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It is all having an impact on one another and everybody's kind of having to innovate.

374
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And that's kind of the fascinating thing about where the entertainment industry is at right now.

375
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Anyway, going to our chat over at Twitch TV Vogue Network, Tiger class says,

376
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think it's pointless to subscribe to all access if the only show you watch is Discovery.

377
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
All the other shows are crappy and paid for old people.

378
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I you know, I've watched a little bit of it, but I pay for it, whatever.

379
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Well, I'm actually thinking about adding Hulu, too, because I want to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but they only have season six in the app now, the NBC app.

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So honestly, if I were to pay for Netflix, Hulu and CBS and probably one other two,

381
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
it would still be less than what I pay for cable. Yeah. Right.

382
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So I don't know. And that's the reality a lot of people are facing right now. Let's see.

383
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Going to other comments here, Bobby Blackall says, I really wish Comcast would give me unlimited bandwidth because I have digital preferred cable TV.

384
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
They cap they cap my data because of people getting just Internet to cut the cord to go around them.

385
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So, yeah, I guess, you know, the data cap of. Well, it's a good thing that the FCC is, you know, in the pocket of these cable industry folks.

386
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So, you know, once we get that overthrown, then maybe we can get somebody to say, hey, bandwidth caps are fucking illegal.

387
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And you can't do it. Well, we'll see. I don't know. It's probably not the current guy, the FCC, but things might change.

388
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Who knows? Anyway. But to tie it again together back to gaming, because and as somebody mentioned earlier,

389
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Microsoft was probably in many ways ahead of its time with the Xbox one.

390
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I think a lot of this stuff we've been talking about as much as, you know, it might not be directly related games.

391
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I think when we talk PlayStation five and we talk the next Xbox and whatever else,

392
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the soldier boy console, ha ha, whatever else in seriousness is out there in the future,

393
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
we might be looking at things that are more integrated with the other types of entertainment beyond just it plays Blu-rays.

394
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It has a Netflix app. There might be some more like real integration there.

395
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And you kind of see Sony, I think, in some ways dipping their toe in the water with their whole like they don't call it PlayStation cable,

396
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
but that's what it is. PlayStation TV view, whatever calm place. It's yeah, PlayStation view.

397
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I actually had subscribed to that's going to be more integrated.

398
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I tried it for like a month or two and it was all right.

399
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But then they lost Comedy Central. I think they lost some big networks.

400
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And I was just like, no, I don't want it anymore because I was kind of all I was tuning in for.

401
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But there was a lot of channels I just didn't want on there.

402
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But it wasn't bad. It was just they need more content.

403
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And they lost their losing content and getting content that I just didn't give a shit about. Gotcha.

404
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So. All right. Well, anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some things that are a little more directly related to video gaming.

405
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

406
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So how was your gaming week? Loki, if you want to cover two weeks, I guess since you weren't here.

407
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I wish being two weeks that I played a lot more things. I did not.

408
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It was mainly just trying to you were at Disneyland. I was at Disneyland. Yes.

409
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I tried to I was mostly trying to get the DDR cabinet stuff to work.

410
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So I had I'd mentioned I think before I left that I had bought some memory card slots for my DDR cabinet because I wanted to get those.

411
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And I found them for a pretty good price. So I picked some up.

412
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And so I got those in finally and I had to wire everything up because I didn't know how it was supposed to go.

413
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And thankfully, I I figured it out. So I wired those up and then I had my memory cards and they just weren't reading in there first.

414
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And so I was like, oh, crap. You know, so what the hell?

415
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Finally figured out what it was. It's just the memory card slots are so old that the pins inside there are kind of bent out.

416
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So you can even I even my PlayStation 2 is kind of the same way. You have to not quite insert the card all the way.

417
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And I want to say, like when I was playing DDR and stuff in arcades, the card slots are kind of like that, too.

418
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You have to kind of be just push it until you feel like some friction on there and then you just let don't touch it and then it will read just fine.

419
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So I did all that and got it working. I loaded the edits I had on my memory cards.

420
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I had only two or three that no two cards that had edits on there.

421
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And some that I used to play are just gone. I don't have backups for them anymore.

422
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But the rest, though, I did end up finding and this was really challenging.

423
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I ended up going online to try to find the sites I used to use for finding edits.

424
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And I did find some of those, but a lot of them are no longer there anymore.

425
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I had to go back through the wayback machine to find stuff.

426
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But I did find there is a current edit database out there that people actually do upload stuff for, but it's for DDRX.

427
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But you can still use those saves if you convert it and stuff to actually work in the cabinet.

428
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So I downloaded pretty much the entire library, just everything that they had, and downloaded everything.

429
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And then I loaded them onto memory cards. I have about eight cards worth of memory of edits on there.

430
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And so I slowly converted them over. I bought the old PlayStation 3 memory card adapter they have for PlayStation 1 stuff.

431
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So I had to take that. I made an HD loader boot disk thing because I found out once I got my PlayStation 2 back from my sister,

432
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
the disk drive doesn't work anymore. So I had to get that thing.

433
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Why do we loan anything, however?

434
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's just old. It's an old-ass system. It just doesn't work anymore.

435
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I didn't technically use the disk drive anyways. It was mainly just used to run the disk for HD loader.

436
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But now it just runs off of a memory card. So, eh, who cares if the disk drive's not working.

437
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So I managed to transfer everything onto a USB drive, transfer all of those onto memory cards, transfer all of that onto the arcade cabinet.

438
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So now I have like 150 plus edits on my arcade cabinet.

439
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's funny enough, though, it's like some of them are mine, but I don't remember which ones are mine until I actually play them.

440
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Some of them I recognize. I'm like, I think that one's mine. And then I play it and I'm like, yeah, that was mine.

441
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Man, I was really mean when I made that edit.

442
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I found, and as you probably would have seen in the last two streams, if you watch my Twitch streams at twitch slash logy o-l-r.

443
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You should go follow logy.

444
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes, go follow me.

445
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They, people that make edits for doubles like to use the entire pad.

446
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And usually both, you know, one side and the other side, very often you're stretching quite a bit.

447
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And, oh, I can still do that, but it, ow.

448
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It will, it is very hard on my feet.

449
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So, but I had a lot of fun playing some of those and not all of them are bullshit.

450
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
There was actually some that were pretty fun.

451
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So it was mainly this week is just playing DDR stuff and just getting all of that working.

452
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because it was kind of a hassle to get, figuring out what was wrong with the memory cards.

453
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And then finally figured out it was just, they're just finicky.

454
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And then what else? I downloaded Goat Simulator for the Switch.

455
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Because my kids want to play that.

456
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And they played a little bit of that.

457
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And then just Pokemon Go pretty much.

458
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I tried getting Pokemon Go, I mean, because I was playing it in Disneyland.

459
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because there's just PokeSops everywhere.

460
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Of course, I'm sure.

461
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The problem though was like my gotcha was being stupid.

462
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And so I had to, I ended up having to reboot my phone a couple times.

463
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But like it was just like, it would, it would stop working after a while.

464
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I think it's just, there's so much going on at Disneyland.

465
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Because I remember, I haven't done it in Pokemon Go because I haven't been to Disneyland.

466
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Well, no, I'm not a, I think I've gone, I haven't gone to Disneyland.

467
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I think I went when Pokemon Go was first out.

468
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But I haven't gone since it started tracking the gyms and all that.

469
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Like I think it was kind of a different game then.

470
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But I remember with Ingress, with all the portals that were there.

471
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
They're like Downtown Disney and everything because I was there once for BlizzCon.

472
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I think I had just started playing Ingress at the time.

473
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And I got one of my like unique portals.

474
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh damn, I should have played Ingress.

475
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh!

476
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah, you missed opportunity.

477
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah, lots and lots of uniques there.

478
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You barely play, you barely play that anymore.

479
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I don't. Yeah, I don't play that at all.

480
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But I did get a lot of walking though.

481
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Like 15 miles in a day is ridiculous.

482
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But you've been a more fit lifestyle guy lately.

483
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So that walking is probably a really good thing.

484
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah, so, yeah, I mean that's pretty much it.

485
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I didn't really, like I said, play too much this week.

486
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It was just pretty much that.

487
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I almost picked up and I still kind of, I know we have to pick up Smash by the end of this month.

488
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
In order to get the free Piranha Plant thing.

489
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't know if that's gonna happen though.

490
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm not sure.

491
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't know if I would like buy the whole game right away just because you want Piranha Plant.

492
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Like you could always just buy it later.

493
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yes, it's more money, but if you're not ready, don't take the plunge.

494
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Although I think it's a great game, you should take the plunge.

495
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I should, but like I just, the problem is I can't get the switch enough times.

496
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And it sucks because my wife's been really just hammering Animal Crossing.

497
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So I've had the PlayStation available on the TV.

498
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's been practically available to me for the whole month.

499
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And I've just, I've booted up the PlayStation 4 so many times and just sat there going,

500
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I don't even know what the hell I want to play on this.

501
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Like, I just, I wanted to like, I was like, maybe we should jump in the Just Cause 4 or something.

502
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But I'm like, I don't want to buy another game because I'm just gonna buy another game.

503
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And it's just gonna sit there and I'm not gonna finish it.

504
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Just like Red Dead 2 and whatever the hell else I was playing before that.

505
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I've got so many started games that it's just gamer ADD.

506
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I understand. All right. Well, my gaming week, probably not as varied.

507
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I played a little, I played a little bit Diablo 3 because on that event for the Diablo 1 in Diablo 3,

508
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
although it's not really Diablo 1, it's just like some maps that kind of look like Diablo 1 in a filter.

509
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The Darkening of Tristram, that's what they call it.

510
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I finally like needed to get around to playing that event and unlocking all the achievements.

511
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So I did that because there's one achievement where like you have to start a brand new character

512
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and go straight there and like clear it the whole way through to level 20.

513
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Which is actually kind of challenging because you don't get as many loot drops as you'd hope for in that.

514
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But I did it. And so I played that whole thing, got the achievements.

515
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That was my big Diablo 3 accomplishment of the week.

516
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Now I'm just waiting to get power level the rest of the way of 70.

517
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Or maybe I need to do it all again on the Switch to get the achievement there too because I'm sick

518
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and I own Diablo on multiple platforms, but I might do it. I don't know.

519
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I've been playing some World of Warcraft still. My main warlock, I got up to item level 370 today

520
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
thanks to all the bumps in the last patch.

521
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And my resto shaman I've been working on as well is up to about a level I think 111.

522
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But I did play something new this week. I did want to try to do some new games for my game week 2.

523
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So I finally downloaded and I've been meaning to just pick up this game for like 6 weeks.

524
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But I'm always like, it's like 30 bucks. I need to hold off because I don't know what's happening

525
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
with my husband's job situation and all this stuff. I need to just hold off.

526
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Well finally this week I dropped the money and picked up Beat Saber already.

527
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Which I had already played before because Bobby Blackwolf brought it to Dragon Con and he has the Vive version.

528
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So I was familiar with it already. So the game, I kind of knew what I was expecting.

529
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But it was nice to be able to play it on Playstation VR in my living room.

530
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And it took me a minute man. Did you know like to get the move controllers synced

531
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You can't use just any USB cable. You have to get a specific one that will do

532
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Like I guess some of them will only charge but they won't actually communicate and do the syncing.

533
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So I was like, no it happened. It wouldn't work through one cable.

534
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But then when I was like, Alan! I need every cable in the house to try them.

535
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And the third one I tried worked.

536
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Unless they have like pins that are connected.

537
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
They will be finicky sometimes but what you have to do is you have to push the reset button in them.

538
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So you have to get like a paperclip out and push the reset button.

539
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And that will occasionally happen even when you have them synced already.

540
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Like I did that the last time I was playing the Playstation VR.

541
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I had to push the reset button to do that.

542
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh! No I did play a game. I forgot. I played Accounting Plus.

543
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I fucking love that game. It's so inappropriate but I love that game.

544
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So I played Accounting Plus.

545
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But yeah so the last time I played Playstation VR I had to do that.

546
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So they do that every now and then.

547
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But if you run into problems like that just try pushing the reset button.

548
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Well I got it eventually by digging up. I was like, Alan I need every cable that's a match.

549
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And one of his phone charger cables did it. So whatever. It's fine.

550
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I got it to work and I got to play the game but it just took me a minute to get it up and running.

551
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
But if you haven't played Beat Saber it's a music game.

552
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I know we have a lot of music game people that listen to OLR because that used to be our bread and butter.

553
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So I know for those of you that enjoy music games you probably already know about Beat Saber.

554
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But I got to tell you it's a lot of fun because you really do kind of have to get the motion.

555
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You get a higher score if, and I think the technical thing is that,

556
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
if your controller ends at such and such an angle from when you slice through the notes.

557
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So basically instead of sitting there going ee ee ee to like slice the notes.

558
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Just like with your hands. Just little motions.

559
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
If you do these big flourishes and you know just extra.

560
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
If you play the game you get rewarded for being extra and over the top in Beat Saber.

561
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And I think that's what's kind of really cool about it.

562
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I've been having some minor problems like getting the aim right.

563
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Because you can calibrate where the floor is but I can't get the right setting.

564
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And I think it's just because my camera is too low.

565
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I have a camera below my TV because trying to get it on top of the TV like you know it's hard to balance.

566
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TV's are so thin it's hard to balance.

567
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah the floor thing. I really don't like the floor calibration thing.

568
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
There is one game. I think it may have been Accounting Plus.

569
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It was one of them but most of them have it.

570
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay it's like okay lower the floor raise the floor until it looks right to you.

571
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Well that's hard to figure out.

572
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So the one though I had it calibrated is it gave me the floor raising and lowering.

573
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But it also said what height it was.

574
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So you just set it to your height and boom done.

575
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But like in Beat Saber you can kind of change the height but you can't.

576
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Like it just kind of measures to where you're at. It's weird.

577
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But anyway whatever I figured it out eventually.

578
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I got it playable and that's the most important thing so whatever.

579
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And the calibration stuff aside once I got in there and played it I had a lot of fun.

580
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It was a decent workout like doing all those like playing all the Beat Saber and flinging around so it was good.

581
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I hope they expand it with more songs later.

582
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I mean not that the songs are bad they're really good.

583
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But you know everybody on PC is modding everything you can think of under the sun into that game.

584
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So it would be cool if maybe the Playstation gets some expansion packs and DLC soundtrack stuff.

585
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So I would pay for more of the same stuff.

586
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Some of those like chiptune dancy songs are really good.

587
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So I like Beat Saber.

588
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I highly recommend if you're a VR owner or a music game fan or you know both especially.

589
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I picked that game up if you haven't already.

590
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

591
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So I don't have a whole lot of housekeeping to get into.

592
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't foresee any shows off we have planned.

593
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I do know Jamie is returning to the show and I already forgot the date.

594
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But she got her work schedule rearranged when they start their new schedules.

595
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's either the last show in February or the first show in March.

596
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So she'll be back with us in studios.

597
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That means we're probably going to look a little different.

598
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Because I'm going to move this whole thing over there where the Playstation 3 is now.

599
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And then the camera will kind of be up and over at us.

600
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And he'll catch Jamie over the shoulder so she can be Dr. Claw.

601
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Or Ms. Claw as the case may be.

602
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So it'll be fun.

603
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Anyway.

604
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Alright.

605
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Let's get into some other gaming news.

606
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So Loki has some stuff to start us off tonight.

607
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So for all those people waiting for Metroid Prime 4.

608
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You're going to have to wait a little longer.

609
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Because guess what?

610
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's under a new studio now.

611
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So I don't remember who it was that was developing it originally.

612
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But now it's Retro Studios which is great because Retro Studios makes great games.

613
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But they had to reboot the whole development process.

614
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So unfortunately they did this really short video.

615
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Shinya Takahashi who is Nintendo's development head.

616
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Basically made this kind of apology video saying,

617
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Hey you know we are rebooting the development on this.

618
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And it's going to take some more time to get it done.

619
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So probably not going to see that.

620
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So he said without saying.

621
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
In my own words.

622
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
He said,

623
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The game ain't good y'all.

624
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So we're going to bring in the folks that kind of did this before to start over.

625
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But if you thought or assumed or had your podcast speculating that Metroid Prime 4 would be out this year.

626
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah.

627
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm going to need you to hold off those expectations.

628
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Because we're looking like maybe 2021 or 2022 at this point.

629
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Is that an accurate summary of what he said?

630
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't know about 2021 but maybe like end of 2020.

631
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't know.

632
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That's not what I was getting from that.

633
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I think if they're starting over Loki.

634
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I mean they might be able to reuse some of the art assets maybe some of the ideas.

635
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But I think 2021 is a little more realistic.

636
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Not so much.

637
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I think you know if they're coming out with an announcement like this.

638
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
They mean like it's it's bumped back.

639
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You know but I appreciate at least Nintendo being transparent.

640
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You know I think we all know that this happened with like Final Fantasy 15 right when it went from versus 13 to Final Fantasy 15.

641
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And the game we got doesn't look anything like that.

642
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Well I mean maybe a little bit but like it's very different from that early footage like this happens in the gaming industry sometimes.

643
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But maybe it says something about this Internet culture and you know the way we interact with folks immediately on Twitter and setting those expectations and things.

644
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Where maybe Nintendo felt like maybe we announced this too early.

645
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
We announced this early to get you excited about the switch.

646
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And now we wish we hadn't done that.

647
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Maybe we padded out our E3 announcements too much.

648
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So interest isn't that interesting isn't that a damned if you do damned if you don't sort of thing because people want game studios to announce this stuff so well then I can they do it's like oh but the reality is well I guess that means we have more room for remasters.

649
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So hey let's get a Mario maker remaster or Metroid Prime trilogy. I'd be down for that. Heck yeah portable.

650
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And they already took out the Wii controls because they did they sold it on the Wii U.

651
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It doesn't the 1 2 because 1 and 2 were GameCube 3 was a Wii game and they repackaged it it was either like I think it was like a Wii download on the Wii U but they that you could do it without motion controls essentially.

652
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So I feel like the hardest stuff has already been taken care of in Metroid.

653
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It would be great if they had a few resources to maybe bump up some of the textures but you know what whatever.

654
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Obviously anything they do for that would take away from Prime 4 maybe.

655
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So I don't know it would be it would be very cool though if they would re-release the trilogy to maybe wet our appetite a little more for Metroid Prime 4.

656
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That would be cool.

657
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But don't I mean don't get me wrong with this delay you know and I think one maybe refreshing thing about what I'm seeing on Twitter is instead of angry people going like oh fuck Nintendo I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

658
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I didn't really see that it was more like alright I mean that's disappointing but totally understandable.

659
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Like don't release a crappy game and call it Metroid Prime 4.

660
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Exactly sometimes it's better to you know delay your game and restart development rather than hold a beta that looks kind of eh and then release your game a month from now.

661
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Would you be talking about the next story in our showroom potentially?

662
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Is that maybe what you're referring to?

663
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
No I'm not referring to that one but.

664
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh the one that happened this weekend.

665
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The one that happened this weekend.

666
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh okay we'll get into that later but I mean I think I think there might be another good example.

667
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yes.

668
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
As well right?

669
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yes that would also be a good example of that.

670
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Now BobbyBlackWolf over in our Twitch chat says the only people upset are probably investors and shareholders because they know a crappy Metroid Prime 4 would still be a million seller.

671
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah but as a Metroid fan I really appreciate they didn't release a crappy Metroid Prime 4 because I don't want the series to die because Metroid Prime 4 is crap.

672
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And exactly and if you start releasing crappy games then you're going to lose all of that reputation that Nintendo has of being a company that releases quality games.

673
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You don't want to be another EA or Activision come on folks.

674
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Let's see SG100Matt says I completely forgot about Prime 4 being announced so I'm obviously okay it's delayed.

675
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Really? Because I talk about it a lot on this show.

676
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
How excited I was for it.

677
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
But again I'm in the camper I'm like aw damn I was looking forward to that but again very happy they're not going to murder Metroid by releasing a half ass game.

678
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Or slapping the Metroid name on another game that luckily I think everybody's forgotten about at this point.

679
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Did y'all forget?

680
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No I have not forgotten.

681
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
They did release kind of a snoozer Metroid game but.

682
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh no I remember.

683
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I knew it wasn't a Metroid game.

684
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'm talking about the 3DS multiplayer thing Prime was not Prime Hunters no that one was actually rad.

685
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The other I don't even know what it was called.

686
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That tells you how great that game was.

687
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Let's see.

688
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Prime piece of shit.

689
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Federation Force thank you Bobby that was it.

690
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
No they had the other one was like Metroid going Doom multiplayer that game that was like the demo thing on the 3DS that was cool.

691
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I wish that that should have caught more.

692
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
They should bring that out on Switch.

693
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'd be down for that you guys.

694
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh my gosh.

695
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Why not?

696
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I don't know.

697
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I don't know maybe I don't know.

698
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Pie in the sky you know again I want him to work on Metroid Prime 4 so maybe I should just shut my mouth with all these other side projects.

699
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Let's see Tigerclaw says Nintendo should look at Metroid Samus Returns on how to do a proper Metroid game.

700
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I know the Prime series is 3D but I don't like it always being first person all the time.

701
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah I'm kind of with you.

702
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I've always preferred the 2D Metroids to the 3Ds but like I don't hate the 3D Metroid games.

703
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So like you know if and it has been a while since we did get Samus Returns I feel like okay it's the time is right for them to try a 3D game again.

704
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Now with the technology of the Switch you know and the technology has come a long way from the GameCube even to the Wii where Metroid Prime 3 was to you know the Wii U's happened since then and now we're on the Switch.

705
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That can run Doom reboot which is a pretty you know graphically intense sort of shooter.

706
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm kind of excited to see what Metroid might look like in first person or third person because maybe now with the technology and the chips that are in those guys maybe you'll be able to switch.

707
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Which ironically which would you know be kind of cool right just like you can in Skyrim right and the Switch runs Skyrim and you can do first person third person whatever you want to do right.

708
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Sure.

709
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So maybe we'll see.

710
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Let's see Spyro 557 John in our chat says I actually have Federation Force but never played it lol.

711
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Well I think that's probably a good thing not to do that.

712
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Anyway.

713
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
All right.

714
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Let's move on to our next story Logie.

715
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Oh no I'm sorry it's me I'm sorry I'm getting backwards here.

716
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,000
We need to because I kind of shaded this a little bit already so I thought I talked about it has to do with rumors about Fallout 76.

717
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
There were some rumors going around the Internet as they sometimes do that.

718
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Fallout 76 crashed and burned so bad y'all that it's going free to play.

719
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well usually companies don't come out you know usually the companies will say we don't comment on rumors or speculation but Bethesda came out and said no this is BS basically basically.

720
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So anyway I've never seen ever just you know the rumor was founded because EB games in Australia apparently pulled copies from store shelves.

721
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So that's that's where the rumor came from is that oh my God y'all they're pulling it from store shelves because this game tanked you know like that you know how the Internet and Twitter runs they all run their mouths with that right.

722
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So anyway a message on Twitter where Bethesda and the actual Bethesda accounts we don't know who said it but they said there is no truth to this rumor.

723
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So yeah they are not going free to play with Fallout 76 or tinfoil hat if they are they just don't want to tell you right now.

724
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But anyway now I don't I don't you know I think the game I think the logical step is for the game to get drastically reduced in price like 20 bucks then go free to play.

725
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I don't think it's going to go straight from $60 price to Black Friday sales and some of the you know minor 10 15 20 percent cuts you saw around that time to free free to play.

726
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I think they would try to sell it for 20 bucks first.

727
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
What does it even mean sold for now.

728
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I mean let's see aren't they still trying to get the 64 or am I wrong on that.

729
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Maybe I don't think it's 60 anymore.

730
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Loki's looking it up right now.

731
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
If you guys are trying to beat him to the punch.

732
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Thank you for scrolling down the page.

733
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Why do you do that.

734
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So he's busy searching a popular retailer on his laptop there to see what they're currently charging for it and even see it listed on here.

735
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Other than that there's a bundle there's a bundle and a bunch of shirts.

736
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Do they not have the game.

737
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh here we go.

738
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Here we go.

739
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Thirty nine ninety nine down to 40.

740
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
All right.

741
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Well speaking of thirty nine ninety nine.

742
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Well your deep discounts I saw but I checked online I didn't see the price points but I might pick it up for this kind.

743
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I saw that there was someone had taken a photo of a Wal-Mart that was clearing out PlayStation classics for twenty five dollars.

744
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I was like for that price.

745
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yes I would pick that up.

746
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I wanted to find like a retail.

747
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
All I could see was that picture on Facebook.

748
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It was a Wal-Mart.

749
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah.

750
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Boston.

751
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I was like Wal-Mart picture on Facebook.

752
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That's kind of shaky ground right.

753
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Somebody could have photoshopped that.

754
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
OK.

755
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I was looking for a retail listing so I went to Wal-Mart site to see there.

756
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And that's not what they were charging on Wal-Mart charging that reduced fifty nine I think or what.

757
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah.

758
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
The cheapest thing online right now is like fifty four ninety nine.

759
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But I was going to tweet it to Bobby and say is this close enough because he said something on his show about when it comes down to twenty bucks.

760
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I'll finally pick one up.

761
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I was going to tweet him the twenty five dollars.

762
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah yeah.

763
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And be like close enough.

764
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Twenty five I think would be all right because that's that's you know that's worth it for like Bobby.

765
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Bobby's clarifying in chat.

766
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Still too much.

767
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Twenty is my line.

768
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
He drives a hard bargain.

769
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
All right.

770
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Let's see.

771
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Frodo Swagan says that the only good thing about that game.

772
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I think Fallout 76 here was the power armor helmet with the ultimate edition.

773
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But some comments on the rumors.

774
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Quest Buster simply saying this rumor was absolutely dumb.

775
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Well at least it wasn't like somebody completely making it up.

776
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
They had some sort of.

777
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
But I agree it was a little bit of a jump to conclusion sort of thing.

778
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Bobby Blackwell says fans were probably trying to shame Bethesda into going free to play.

779
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
As if it works like that.

780
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But I get the comment.

781
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Some people think it does work like that.

782
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So I get it.

783
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And that's why that follow up about the PlayStation being twenty five bucks.

784
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I want.

785
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:09,000
That's why I'm kind of questioning and I didn't link it to Bobby because I was like I wonder if somebody is trying to like get that rumor going to see if competitors buy it.

786
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
If retailers like Amazon really will cut the price that low because you know right.

787
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah I gotcha.

788
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
We live in a crazy world.

789
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Who knows.

790
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
All right.

791
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Now we can go on to the next story Loki.

792
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Sorry.

793
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
All right.

794
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So let's talk about Deep Mind.

795
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So Deep Mind is this wonderful A.I. system that they were using the plays like some different games before they had go.

796
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And I want to say was it chess not Pokemon go but the ancient game go.

797
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah.

798
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So now of course you know we're stepping it up instead of you know those simple games that we're going to take on Starcraft 2.

799
00:55:48,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And so they actually took Deep Mind they trained it against or to play Starcraft 2 basically cramming I was 200 years worth of gameplay into two weeks because they sped up the games and had basically sped up the simulations.

800
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So then they they basically pit them against some of the best Starcraft 2 players.

801
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And apparently I did win because some of the it's sort of unfair I guess in the way that it operates because they can see the whole map it basically doesn't have to zoom in to different spots.

802
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So the fog of war.

803
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Well the fog of war is still there for them.

804
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
But I would say it doesn't have to like study things or be like what's that because the computer kind of it already knows.

805
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah.

806
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But in and of course it played very unconventionally.

807
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So you know it was hard for the competitors to basically counter some of this stuff.

808
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Interesting though because A.I. is programmed by humans.

809
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But this one though this one though it basically learned to play the game and it played itself.

810
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And so it didn't really pick up any like their strategies I think.

811
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So very cool. I would love to see like some video of this but just be careful.

812
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
This is how Cylons were made.

813
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But I don't know man should we be threatened that the fact that you know that it's able to play Starcraft 2 so well I mean what's next.

814
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
No because Starcraft isn't real life yet.

815
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
What about Overwatch or like Fortnite or something like that.

816
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
A.I. is going to just take over everything.

817
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
As long as there's a plug to unplug it.

818
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
S2-100 Matt with the mandatory Skynet comment in our chat at VOG Network.

819
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So kind of interesting. I mean it's interesting as an exhibition sort of thing but obviously computers winning game tournaments.

820
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I don't know if it's that. I mean I don't know.

821
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But then again during awesome games done quick don't they do like the assisted speed runs.

822
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Well those are the tool assisted ones. Those are basically kind of like recording.

823
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It's like recording a demo type thing.

824
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But I don't know. Those are still all human input stuff but it's just that you're recording it so you can make it frame perfect.

825
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
DJ Rama asks in chat asks how is this any different from Deep Blue beating Kasparov at chess.

826
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I guess on face value it's not. But there's the complexities of what Starcraft 2 is compared to chess.

827
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm not saying chess isn't a complex game. Of course it is.

828
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,000
But the rule set for chess all things considered is very simple and doesn't have a lot of variables per se.

829
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The only variable is responding to the moves of your opponent right.

830
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Right.

831
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But in Starcraft 2 your maps could be different.

832
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Your positioning of things could go from what 64 squares on a board to millions of pixels.

833
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So I think it's more like that level of complexity that goes with the Starcraft 2 game versus a chess game that makes this you know.

834
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But you're right. Is this a repeat of what we've heard years ago with A.I. beats human at chess.

835
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm curious. So if they're doing ink you know it's nonstandard strategies or something.

836
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Can can we learn from this to basically play Starcraft 2 better.

837
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yes. Can can Deep Blue come up with a solution to end the government shutdown.

838
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I think that's pretty good. That's pretty easy way to keep that cans of worms locked.

839
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I had I had to make the joke I had to.

840
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,000
All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about something going from a joke to a bit of a mess.

841
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Maybe another different type of joke and that is the anthem demo this weekend.

842
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Look I y'all know I've been a little I've been a little bit skeptical a little salty about anthem here on this show.

843
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And that's just because I haven't agreed with the the way that EA has been running things and making a lot of decisions.

844
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week but I tried to play the anthem demo by and talk about it because I feel like I didn't really play it.

845
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Here's what happened. I was given a code to the VIP demo or the preorder demo.

846
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But I guess a preorder got to invite one or two or three other people out of depending on maybe what level they preordered.

847
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't know. Regardless I got an invite from a friend so I was like all right well might as well check this thing out because maybe who knows.

848
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Maybe I'll stop being such a hater. Maybe the single blow me away and I'll change my mind.

849
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So I downloaded the multi gig thing on origin set that all up.

850
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So yes I tried to do it on PC because that's where I would prefer to play because I play a lot of games on PC.

851
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I load up the demo. Now I didn't play it till Saturday because in my mind I was like when the doors open right away it's going to be a clusterfuck.

852
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Sure enough what happened on Friday. Total clusterfuck right. Servers can't handle all the people and all that stuff fine.

853
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So I knew in my head I was like it ain't going to really work till like Saturday or so they'll figure out the issues.

854
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
How do the servers like they know how many keys they gave out right.

855
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Why servers just weren't prepared for the number of people. It's like so it's interesting.

856
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So so Bobby actually addresses that perspective a little bit tonight on his show and what you're saying isn't really different from the way a lot of people on the Internet would say things and basically like you know how many people are going in.

857
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You should have the servers infrastructure for that. But I suppose it basically comes down to this and I don't necessarily disagree with this.

858
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I don't hate it for this reason. I hate it for other reasons. It's not that like they didn't necessarily have the server set up ready to go and all that.

859
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
But it's that some things you just do not know how it's going to work until you unleash it to the masses.

860
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Right. I guess take our move to twitch for example some things we tested we thought would work.

861
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We thought would go great. And then poof one week Skype breaks our soundboard that didn't occur in the testing. Who knew. Right.

862
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Well I didn't know until we were there. Right. It's typical that Microsoft sub breaks everything.

863
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
But that's that's the gist. I'm kind of simplifying what's a more complicated issue. But that's the gist. Yeah. OK. So fine.

864
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But here's the I go into the demo. I'm able to get past that log in screen. I'm playing for a little bit and then I get to a loading screen and the loading screens just loading and loading.

865
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And I get to the loading screen after being asked like 17 times are you sure you don't want to play with other people.

866
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Anthem is best experience when you play with other people. Push this button right now to join an experience with other people.

867
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And I'm just like OK look I know how trash fires on the Internet are if I don't already know how to play this game.

868
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
By the time I join a group with people they're just going to talk smack even beta or not. It doesn't even matter.

869
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So I want to just play a little single player so I can like how do how do I move.

870
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
How do babby crawl. Like I just want to play single player to figure all that out. Right.

871
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
But then I'm on the loading screen loading your load as you lose. And it's just I'm sitting on the loading screen for five minutes.

872
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And this is after like for some reason I can't play on my main monitor.

873
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I have to play on my side monitor because yes this is a 4K monitor and I can't play 4K gaming with my current setup.

874
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But I had it downscaled to 1080p resolution but it still wouldn't play on my 4K monitor but like frame skip like.

875
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
So I had to play it over here which is weird. So I was already frustrated and I'm stuck on the loading screen.

876
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And finally after five minutes of sitting on the loading screen I was like you know what.

877
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Reclaiming my time. Reclaiming my time. I'm not. This is it's broken.

878
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I don't I don't. Whatever. What was I thinking. What was I thinking. And I just I stopped.

879
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And that's why I didn't talk about it during my gaming week and I didn't want to come out here and just be like.

880
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Anthem sucks. I didn't play it because it wasn't really ready to be played this weekend.

881
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Now I said to some extent I understand all these engineering things and that some things you're just not going to figure out until you go.

882
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Here's where I have a problem. Here's why I think EA continues to screw with BioWare and their releases.

883
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And why they're setting Anthem up to potentially and I might be wrong because some of the people that did get in and are playing it seem to enjoy it.

884
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So maybe it'll do just fine. EA sold this as like a VIP sneak peek.

885
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Who is in that preview this weekend. People that paid extra money or at least committed to.

886
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I realize all the preorder systems are different but people who said they were going to spend extra money and preorder this more advanced edition of Anthem.

887
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And that's who this was for. Their open demo for the public and for everybody is next weekend.

888
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Now I'm not a big fan of paying more money to access games early as it is.

889
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
But that's just kind of the day and age we live in now.

890
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Why didn't EA if they didn't truly know what they were going to be facing and if they knew they were basically going to be testing multiplayer with this whole thing.

891
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Because they want you to go multiplayer very very badly through all the in-game prompts.

892
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Why did they not do the open let's have everybody in it test first and market it as stress test.

893
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,000
This test will offer you experience of Anthem levels but you will probably experience frequent issues.

894
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:00,000
If they had sold it as what it was as opposed to the VIP very special people access edition.

895
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I'd hate this whole thing a lot less. But that's the problem is that EA was tempting people with extra money and spend this extra stuff to get in this thing early.

896
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
They ain't even going to fucking work. But you see you're paying money to be our testers.

897
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So you see if I were if it wasn't called a VIP test then where would be my sense of pride and accomplishment with EA.

898
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I wouldn't feel as special. I wouldn't feel like this special snowflake that I was that I dropped money to play and that I'm just showing EA look at me.

899
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I'm ready to give you money for no thing because it still would have been you could have been the little snowflake all you wanted because they would have marketed as a very special one level preview capped at level 10 to stress to stress test the servers.

900
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Like sold it for what it was sold it for what it was as opposed to what it ended up being.

901
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That's where I get into issues with EA.

902
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And you know what this whole thing I'm complaining about has nothing to do with the hardworking people that made the game has nothing to do with the artist the engineers that are trying to fix the servers as fast as they're identifying the problem.

903
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
My issue if you think about it has nothing to do with that.

904
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It's how it was marketed and sold by EA which when I got ticked off about a lot of things with Mass Effect Andromeda.

905
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Guess what it was about decisions that EA made about how they were going to preview the game in advance when it wasn't really finished and all this other stuff.

906
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well here's my question. We only have like a month away. Do you think it's going to be ready in time.

907
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Well then I heard another thing and I don't know if this is true or not but I heard another thing that the demo people were playing was apparently like a six month old demo.

908
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I don't know if that's true or not. Take it with a grain of salt. But that just made me even go more like why would that be what you're putting out there for VIP people two weeks before the game launches.

909
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Because I bet you there are people with those preorders that played that thing this weekend and canceled their preorder just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda when all of that started coming out.

910
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Don't believe me. I know some of the person that gave me the key was thinking about doing it. I don't know if they did it but there are people that are going to cancel the preorder based off of what happened whether it's rational or not.

911
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:30,000
This is just what happened and then you know what else is going to happen because EA likes giving you that early access if you pay them the extra money because people are going to get that early access and see how much of a clusterfuck it is and then people are going to cancel more preorders that way to

912
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Quest Buster in the VOG Network Twitch chat says that's kind of true. The blog statement by BioWare said that the demo was an older build. Well speaking of which this is it wasn't just my opportunity to rant about anthem but I actually did have a whole little thing here where BioWare has talked about what's going on basically this weekend.

913
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:59,000
So Chad Roberts with BioWare said in a BioWare blog post we've been testing the entire game and platform for several months but there were a few things we missed real world play frequently leads to unexpected issues.

914
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I want to dispel one comment we've seen that we under plan for server capacity to ensure stability. We intend to manage our servers to match the player population as it grew.

915
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Overall we had excess capacity to prepare for population increases and continue to do so. That said what's important is that all parts of the game work is designed to meet players needs and that did not happen in the opening hours.

916
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:33,000
So why did you sell it like something that was going to be different then. Like that's the problem EA stop lying to us. Like stop thinking we're all stupid just so you can take our money.

917
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Like tell us what it really is and maybe these things won't happen.

918
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
That makes too much sense.

919
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
We can't do that honestly.

920
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That's not nice warm fuzzy marketing.

921
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Anyway some of the issues that have been cited rubber banding connection issues blocked entitlements blah blah blah blah blah.

922
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I guess investigations are ongoing stuff is going to be fixed before the next demo.

923
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Another comment from the same guy. I want to be upfront that this is a difficult one and something we may not resolve during this weekend.

924
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Many players are not seeing this issue and the last thing we want to do is destabilize the experience for everyone.

925
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:26,000
You know what this is. You know what this is. I got the perfect analogy because this is what everybody's talking about all over again because of some documentaries that hit Netflix and Hulu this week.

926
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:35,000
This is gaming's version of the Fyre Festival a very elite VIP experience for those of you that spent a little extra money.

927
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I got to watch that experience this special event.

928
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Thanks EA for putting on the Fyre Festival demo this weekend.

929
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Maybe I'm over maybe I'm being a little over dramatic here on this program but I think there's some merit to the comparison I'm making there.

930
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
All right. Let's move on. I don't I don't want to live in a negative space.

931
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You know what. For those of you that are looking forward to Anthem.

932
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I hope it's all I hope they've learned what happened this weekend.

933
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I hope the game comes out. I hope it's wonderful. I hope you all have a happy time gaming.

934
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Who knows maybe I'll come around on it.

935
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Maybe I'll have to eat my words and be like I was wrong.

936
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But right now I ain't spending 60 bucks on it. I got other stuff I can play like Kingdom Hearts 3 is out on Tuesday.

937
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So yes that will probably keep me busy for like six weeks with the slowest I am on games.

938
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So anyway let's move on to another story.

939
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Loki so e-sports is definitely changing.

940
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So one game company giant software is actually getting into the e-sports game and they're doing that with none other than farming simulator.

941
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That's right. The first season of the farming simulator league is going to be starting soon.

942
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It's going to consist of 10 tournaments that are going to take place in Europe.

943
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:57,000
They're going to have a chance to win up to two hundred eighty thousand dollars in prize money put up by the developer.

944
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Now for those that are listening on the podcast you're going to hear like low motor noises because we're actually looking at footage of farmer simulator 19.

945
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Because I'm I'm I have to be honest like I was like I don't like what what do you do in farming simulator like I far.

946
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I know this has been like a game people talk about things for a long time.

947
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But what what exactly what where's the competitive head to head and it's going to be with this.

948
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And right now on the stream we're watching this guy with a tool chop a tree into smaller bits.

949
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Now granted I probably did. I just picked a random like two minutes of gameplay here.

950
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Maybe not pick the most exciting stuff in the world but a lot of the gameplay looks fun.

951
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Maybe. Yeah no I'm not I'm not like dog in the game at all.

952
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Like if this is like the type of thing you're into like people play flight simulators right.

953
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Like you know we have I know we have a caller. He hasn't called in a long time but used to talk about flight simulators and stuff.

954
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And that's cool. Like if you are into farming you're a 4-H person or whatever.

955
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And the graphics do look really good. I'll say that then maybe this is going to be a game that's like right up your alley.

956
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
But like I don't really understand like what's what's the competitive side of this.

957
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Even a slow dry game something like civilization or something.

958
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You know I kind of I get that at least there's like a competitive edge or something like that.

959
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
No but they're going to do something.

960
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:22,000
But anyways they're saying they're going to hold 10 different events that says each event will allow teams and players to earn circuit points and win prizes.

961
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And they said once the season has concluded the teams with the most points are earn will gather at Farm Con 2020.

962
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Apparently they have Farm Con and to crown the farming simulator champion.

963
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
The winner will take home one hundred and ten thousand dollars in prizes.

964
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Apparently they're going to time these events around major gaming events like Gamescom and Paris Game Week.

965
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I guess they've sort of kind of dipped their toes in the water with this.

966
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:59,000
They've done some competitive farming simulator stuff with the farming simulator championship series.

967
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But I'm trying to see what they what the actual events are.

968
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Let me let me while you're looking at that let me get some comments in our chat over at VOG Network on Twitch.

969
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Questbuster says I saw a good response to the same question on a forum that the actual management of things in the game actually requires quite a bit of skill to handle well.

970
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
To keep your farm successful. It's like Starcraft but with farms I guess.

971
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I mean I'm just saying the footage didn't convey that but OK.

972
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I mean no I mean there's there's management to it that you know it's probably interesting for folks that are like super into that.

973
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
So cool.

974
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And Act F says very plainly I don't get World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 either.

975
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I'm going for my jugular but I get it.

976
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Those games aren't for everybody either but it's something that entertains people right.

977
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
This game might not be fun for me but it might be fun for you so you should go have a blast with it.

978
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yeah. So I'm not really sure what else they've got there.

979
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It says they have a you know operate the competitive events and different agriculture related events.

980
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
They really say like I don't know if they like doing specific what the challenges are.

981
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Oh shit they have like an actual like yeah like a whole whole controller.

982
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah that's like a awesome controller.

983
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:15,000
It looks like like the that mech game that you'll be telling less steel with telling them more like a lot of stuff.

984
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I don't know. Anyway.

985
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Looks like the Microsoft racing controller there.

986
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Frodo swaggin's in our chat says this game is way too buggy to be an e-sports game.

987
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
A lot of the simulator games sometimes it doesn't plan for what needs to be simulated I guess.

988
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I don't know. I check it out.

989
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Bond's double assist at six acts asks again.

990
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So the contest purse is how much. It was one hundred thousand dollars.

991
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Well yeah they said two different amounts here so they apparently they're going to do this.

992
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:51,000
This tournament that's going to have 10 different tournaments across Europe and that has up to two hundred eighty thousand dollars in prize money.

993
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And then there is this thing that they're going to have this farmer farming simulator champion that's going to take one hundred ten thousand dollars in prizes.

994
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So I'm guessing that throughout the whole tournament they're going to have you know various prizes in the grand prize at the end is one hundred ten thousand dollars.

995
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So throughout the rest of it you have one hundred seventy thousand that you can earn with all the other minor tournaments.

996
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I guess.

997
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And how much can I win from playing a DDR tournament.

998
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I don't know.

999
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Eighty percent of the pot and a free pizza.

1000
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Sadly I don't think we're at that same level just yet just yet.

1001
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Yeah I think there was just a world championships they probably did offer a slightly bigger prize.

1002
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Well funny to me this is being the only sport we ever like super got into this is being put up by the developer the publisher so Konami.

1003
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Where's where's the money.

1004
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Something about like they had to do like a thing across the street from the actual event to actually get like more people to participate or something like I don't.

1005
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It just sounds like Konami.

1006
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Yeah.

1007
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Konami is a mess.

1008
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
What else is new.

1009
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Anyway maybe I shouldn't you go play all of your you know your cabinets out there and maybe save some of that money for prize pools.

1010
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
All right well moving on to another game that people are talking or game series I should say that people are talking about this week Resident Evil.

1011
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Lots of people talking about the Resident Evil 2 remaster because I know that just recently came out so I think some folks have been playing it.

1012
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I passed on it because I like the old Resident Evil games but I don't I don't know if I really want it because they're with the V.

1013
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I don't know this new one support VR.

1014
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I know seven had the VR and I was like nope.

1015
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
It was too much too scary too scary.

1016
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I can't.

1017
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Anyway but I know Resident Evil isn't only a successful game franchise but it's a successful movie franchise although the movie franchise like kind of wrapped up right.

1018
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
They said they made the last one but we all know there's going to be a reboot in the future or things like that.

1019
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:53,000
But there may also be something else as well because Deadline another one of those industry magazines reported this week Resident Evil TV series is in the works at Netflix.

1020
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Because Netflix is making so many shows these days.

1021
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Why not.

1022
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
They've had some success from video game based things like Castlevania.

1023
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
We know they're doing a thing on Witcher.

1024
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So although Witcher technically a book too but anyway.

1025
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
No no reason why Resident Evil doesn't head to Netflix.

1026
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So that's the report coming out this week wasn't.

1027
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I can't.

1028
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
No that was a rumor.

1029
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
The Zelda thing was a rumor.

1030
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
The thing was a rumor.

1031
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
We never really got anything as ingress anime.

1032
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
That's a game.

1033
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
That's that's Netflix.

1034
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Netflix paid for rights for that which by the way it's still not out.

1035
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It's supposed to be out last year.

1036
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But Netflix just bought like distribution rights to that anyway.

1037
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Who's making the Resident Evil Netflix show German production and distribution company.

1038
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Konstantin film.

1039
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
They were behind the Resident Evil movies that were kind of based on the games.

1040
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
They had some characters in common.

1041
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
They had zombies.

1042
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
They did.

1043
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
It was zombies.

1044
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And there was characters the same names.

1045
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And that's about it.

1046
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:59,000
No show runner yet but the deadline report says that they think the plan is for the series to expand the Resident Evil universe and deepen the existing mythology.

1047
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The series will keep the basic premise which served as a setup for the movie franchise.

1048
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
The drama series will explore the darker inner workings of Umbrella Corporation and what happens when the T virus breaks out.

1049
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It's in early stages.

1050
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Apparently there's action sequences Easter eggs all being planned.

1051
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
We don't know when but give us some of that walking dead money.

1052
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Not too surprised.

1053
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I mean the Resident Evil films are kind of you know I know a lot of horror movie buffs because the stuff I work with with the cult movies the Rocky Horror and everything.

1054
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I know people that and Resident Evil like that whole series is kind of like a cult thing.

1055
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Like some people here locally made like a whole fan film about Resident Evil that I always see promoted around here.

1056
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So it's just you know it has its fans and I'm sure people will be very excited about a Netflix series.

1057
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
You know going back to the ingress anime.

1058
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh boy.

1059
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
All right.

1060
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I would love if the ingress anime was actually about people playing ingress sitting in your car.

1061
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
What are you doing.

1062
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
That little 70 year old girl.

1063
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
My portal right now.

1064
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I'll show her.

1065
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I'm Logan.

1066
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
All right.

1067
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Anyway let's see.

1068
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Metal mayhem in chat says the Resident Evil movies weren't good movies based on video games.

1069
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Good action movies.

1070
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Maybe.

1071
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Let's see.

1072
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
S.J. 100 Matt says it's five years too late for the walking dead money.

1073
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Well maybe they want something to come take its place.

1074
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I don't know.

1075
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
There's always going to be zombie fans.

1076
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Zombie movies have been around forever.

1077
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You know in horror movies gore movies people are just always into that.

1078
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
That's the thing.

1079
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So I wouldn't say that just because The Walking Dead is kind of less like people seem to care about it less now.

1080
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Like it kind of peaked a while ago.

1081
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Like I wouldn't say that that means that Resident Evil can't be successful.

1082
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I'm sure if it's a good show it's a good show.

1083
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Netflix had a lot of good shows like everybody.

1084
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I still haven't watched it myself but everybody's talking about that haunting of Hill House.

1085
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
It's like a phenomenal series.

1086
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
It was a movie in the 90s that was kind of a right.

1087
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
That was House on Haunted Hill.

1088
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
No they did they did they did that and they did the haunting which was the same thing.

1089
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
They came out like the same year.

1090
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
There were two movies except one had Jeffrey Rush the other had Liam Neeson.

1091
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I'm telling you there were two haunting move to haunted house movies and the one with Liam Neeson is the one that's being adapted in this TV series.

1092
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Because the one that I remember from the 90s was the one it was the remake of the old Vincent Price movie.

1093
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yes that was the Jeffrey Rush one.

1094
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Oh yeah that was going to.

1095
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah anyway but they're both kind of.

1096
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
But anyway the point is that Netflix series is apparently very good.

1097
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Sabrina the Teenage Witch cheesy ABC TV comedy show and Melissa Joan Hart although I did love it.

1098
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I really did love the Sabrina series but you know totally different direction Riverdale style direction for Netflix and apparently it's really good too.

1099
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Like Netflix has had a lot of like really good shows.

1100
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
So anyway.

1101
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
All right.

1102
01:20:49,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I think I think we should maybe focus a little less on the now and maybe go back to some classics with the classic game of the week.

1103
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And so we take a look behind the door that says do not open and we find a journey through space and time where we're joined by the one and only dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

1104
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Hi Jamie.

1105
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Hi we have a loading screen when you open my door.

1106
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Is it a blue screen of death or an orange screen of death if you will.

1107
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
No it's a loading screen that shows someone going up a ladder.

1108
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I see.

1109
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
All right well you're actually joining us I know on a work break tonight and joining us with not a whole lot of time to spare.

1110
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
But the show just wouldn't be the same without your presence.

1111
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Excited to have you back in a month.

1112
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Well thank you for having me.

1113
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Well let's get to it.

1114
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
The classic game of the week.

1115
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
So I know you picked something a little timely this week.

1116
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
So tell us about it.

1117
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
The classic game of the week.

1118
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Well I picked Resident Evil 2 for our classic game of the week.

1119
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Well you can't do that.

1120
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
That just came out.

1121
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
No I'm picking the original silly beans.

1122
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Oh OK.

1123
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
That works.

1124
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Yeah.

1125
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
The original original original version came out actually in North America before it came out in Japan.

1126
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Of course over there it was biohazard 2.

1127
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,000
It came out January 21st 1998.

1128
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
So almost a full anniversary.

1129
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Which the funny thing is that of course I think that was also the release date for no.

1130
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
But yesterday was the release date so it was a little bit later than that then.

1131
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
But at any rate it was produced by Capcom.

1132
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And it's survival horror.

1133
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And you play as Leon or Claire who are trying to escape Braxton City after all the zombies have taken over.

1134
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
The big thing with this one that made it different over the original.

1135
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:51,000
The first game is that while it does focus on exploration and puzzles and combat.

1136
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
It has different branching paths for each player character.

1137
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Different obstacles.

1138
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
So it's a different story for each play through.

1139
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
There was now this one was kind of the interesting one.

1140
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
There is a and I've seen the full beta watch actually a full play through.

1141
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Is that there was what was called Resident Evil 1.5.

1142
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And it had a lot of stuff in common but instead of Claire it had another another lady in it.

1143
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And gosh now I.

1144
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Most of the time remember her name I don't remember her right now.

1145
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
But it started with NC.

1146
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I'll have to look her up again.

1147
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
But at any rate she eventually became Claire.

1148
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Although in the new game right now her outfit is one of the unlockable outfits for Claire.

1149
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So it's pretty funny.

1150
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I'm sure everybody in the chat room is yelling out the name right now.

1151
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
But it doesn't work when we walk through the door.

1152
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I'm sorry guys.

1153
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And I'm at work right now and I kind of don't care.

1154
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I don't care to look it up.

1155
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,000
At any rate it has been on so many different systems.

1156
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
We had the PlayStation.

1157
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:15,000
We had a second version which was the DualShock version that came out later in the same year.

1158
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It had a Windows version.

1159
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
It had a Nintendo 64 version.

1160
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Nintendo was a Dreamcast version.

1161
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And a GameCube version.

1162
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So it is considered.

1163
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I mean it goes back and forth.

1164
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Some people consider this better than the original.

1165
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Than the first game.

1166
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And then some people say the first game was better.

1167
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It has had better voice acting.

1168
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I'll give you that.

1169
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
But at any rate it has had so many other ports.

1170
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
There was even a modified 2.5D version for the Gamecom.

1171
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And guess who had that version?

1172
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
That would be me.

1173
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Nerd.

1174
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Well I don't know if I still have it.

1175
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
It's somewhere in there.

1176
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And of course there was the sequel, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis.

1177
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Which was, as I call it, the Jill game.

1178
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And of course we just got the remaster which is pretty freaking amazing.

1179
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But moving forward, since it is a survival horror game.

1180
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
You basically have to solve puzzles.

1181
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You get guns with ammo.

1182
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So you have to be very strategic with how you use it.

1183
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You can also have your life that you can check on.

1184
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And you can smoke the green herb to refill your life.

1185
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I'm sorry, eat it.

1186
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Or what Dan and I do is that there's the one where he mixes certain colors with brown things.

1187
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
We call it the brown pile.

1188
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Wow.

1189
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And you get first aid sprays and stuff.

1190
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Yeah, we call it the brown pile.

1191
01:25:51,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And so you have, you know, your health reflects in the posture and movement speed of your character.

1192
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
So if they're wounded they'll hold their stomach and limp a little bit.

1193
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
But if they're near death they're just going to drag.

1194
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
So they also have a limited number of items that you can store in different places.

1195
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
You can, I think it was only Claire before that got the hit pack.

1196
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,000
But now you can actually, well at least as far as we've found so far, you can get two hit packs in the current game.

1197
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
So that's pretty good.

1198
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You also save your game using a typewriter.

1199
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
But in the original one you had ink ribbons that you had to collect to be able to save your game.

1200
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Whereas this one is just save, save, save as much as you want, thank God.

1201
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Because it's hard.

1202
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Even in the easy version it's actually kind of hard.

1203
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:53,000
But anyway, the game had real time models that, you know, your characters would move around.

1204
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
But the backgrounds were all pre-rendered.

1205
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And it used kind of like a tank control, so meaning you used one to move and another one to rotate.

1206
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And then you had the zapping system.

1207
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,000
So where you have the two different puzzles and storylines for the characters.

1208
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:21,000
And if you finish scenario A with one protagonist, the B scenario has different things unlocked.

1209
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
So like if one person did one thing in scenario A, then scenario B has to pick up from it or do two different things.

1210
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The original version of Resident Evil 2 had two scandal and mini-games.

1211
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,000
One called The Fourth Survivor, where you play as an Umbrella Agent called Hunk.

1212
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Who also ended up being like a character in, was it Outbreak I think it was?

1213
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Like with his Delta Team and everything.

1214
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
It was pretty neat.

1215
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:57,000
And then you have the Tofu Survivor, where you play as a giant box tofu with a hat and a knife.

1216
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And the more damage he gets, the redder he gets.

1217
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And I think he can't heal either.

1218
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:10,000
The Nintendo 64 version, actually no, all of the other versions except the Nintendo 64 version had a mini-game called Extreme Battle.

1219
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Which had four playable characters in three stages.

1220
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So it was pretty neat too.

1221
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Now, as far as I understand, the Fourth Survivor and the Tofu Survivor have made it into the new game.

1222
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:33,000
So, the thing about the Tofu Survivor is that it was actually a placeholder character for working on the collision detection.

1223
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
And they left it in as a playable.

1224
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I'm reminded of the killer Tofu song all of a sudden.

1225
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Well, at any rate, two months after, basically this game is set two months after the original Resident Evil 2.

1226
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Which is really great because the remake is also still set in the 90s.

1227
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
So, and I'm not going to go into the story because if you don't know it by now, then whatever.

1228
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
But let's go back into a little bit more though of the development.

1229
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So, Resident Evil 1.5 was basically, it was Elza, Elza is the name of the character.

1230
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Anyway, so this game was all laid out, it was mostly done.

1231
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You had different, you know, different characters in this one.

1232
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I like to consider it a gore if I like pre-release beta.

1233
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
That some of the characters evolved into other people.

1234
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And then basically though, after certain things happened in the real world.

1235
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:45,000
And you know, there were certain things that just did not mesh well with, not just the development team.

1236
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
But with the powers that be at Capcom, they axed it and started all over.

1237
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So basically, that's how we get the current version that we see.

1238
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:09,000
All the music was composed by Ueda Masami, Uchiyama Shisaku and Mishigaki Eshin.

1239
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And one track composed by Nusita Nalshi.

1240
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:21,000
But it was all meant to be like mood music, you know, all kinds of horror themes, you know.

1241
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
In the new game, by the way, if you get the deluxe edition, you can play with the original soundtrack, which is pretty cool.

1242
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,000
But the music basically went between like the ambient music to kind of industrial music.

1243
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And you know, certain places were orchestral.

1244
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It just really was inspired by like real movies.

1245
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:47,000
They actually did an orchestra album that was recorded by the New Japan Philharmonic.

1246
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
So it's pretty cool.

1247
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
There's also a remix album called Biohazard 2 Remix Metamorphosis.

1248
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
But yeah, as I said earlier, there were all these different versions.

1249
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:04,000
The PC port was a Windows 9x base, you know, so nothing really awesome.

1250
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Of course, Nusita 64 was going to have some pretty big limitations because the full motion video had to be super compressed.

1251
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
And its port cost about a million to do.

1252
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:28,000
They also added some different in-game information called the X-Files, like EX.

1253
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
But they'll capital E, lowercase x.

1254
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
They had different documents and different lore associated in the game.

1255
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And its resolution was of course different.

1256
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It did support the extension pack, which put it at 640x480.

1257
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Ooh.

1258
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It's just like Windows 3.1 back in the day.

1259
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
They did spin a port for the Sega Saturn.

1260
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I actually do have the original Biohazard on Sega Saturn.

1261
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It got cancelled due to some weirdness.

1262
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Parking on the Saturn says the Saturn is kind of weird.

1263
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And then the games.com one only had Leon's story and removed a whole bunch of elements.

1264
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:13,000
There was also, and this is the one I was talking about, there's an unfinished build of Resident Evil 1.5 that got leaked onto the internet.

1265
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And someone actually made it playable.

1266
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
So there's full playthroughs now on the internet.

1267
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And then the game though in Italy was banned temporarily due to criticism from the civil rights movement over there.

1268
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Which re-looked at the depiction of a violent.

1269
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:46,000
And also La Guardia di Sinangla, which is I guess a law enforcement agency in that part of Italy, seized 5500 unsold copies.

1270
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And then they lifted the ban after Sony requested a re-examination.

1271
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
This was all a lot going on during multiple violence and video games.

1272
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You know, big stink that was being posed a lot of stuff.

1273
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Just being posed all over the place.

1274
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And you know, a lot of people found the story of course far-fetched but very compelling.

1275
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
And a lot of people really liked that adapting system.

1276
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And of course its graphics at the time were pretty awesome for its day.

1277
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:29,000
The only one that, you know, basically the subsequent versions that came out after the PlayStation except for the Nintendo 64 port didn't get rated as well as the original.

1278
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:37,000
But now the Dreamcast one though was really, really lauded for its better sound development.

1279
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:47,000
At any rate, you know, the game sold, gosh the advertising alone was $5 million in 1988.

1280
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:56,000
And it broke like, gosh, like some records right at the start.

1281
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:05,000
But the pre-orders itself in Italy were over $100,000 which came to about $6.6 million.

1282
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And it was the fastest selling video game in North America.

1283
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:15,000
It sold in the weekend right after its release, it sold 380,000 copies and grossed $19 million.

1284
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And it surpassed the revenue of all but one Hollywood movie at the time and broke the sale record set by Final Fantasy 7 and Super Mario 64.

1285
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I wonder if the remake is going to get banned in Italy too.

1286
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Probably not.

1287
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Alright. Well I'm running out of footage so we've got to wrap up.

1288
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Okay.

1289
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
But there it is.

1290
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:43,000
At any rate, there were tie-in stories, there was an evil uprising and then the Dark Knight Chronicles and then one of the, I think, gun survivor games.

1291
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
So there you go.

1292
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Alright, your classic game of the week but it's new all over again thanks to the remaster.

1293
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Resident Evil 2.

1294
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Hey, Jamie, we've got to get back to the show.

1295
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
It's amazing.

1296
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
But before we get back to the show, quickly, your thoughts on the remaster because I doubt Loki's played it.

1297
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I haven't played it.

1298
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
So what are your thoughts on the remaster because I know you've been playing that this week.

1299
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:10,000
We started off with the Claire scenario and honestly I find the voice acting is amazing.

1300
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And you know how picky I am on voice acting.

1301
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:20,000
The voice acting is very good instead of, you know, having space between one person and saying something, it actually sounds like a real conversation.

1302
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Some people were talking about the face models.

1303
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I thought the face models were excellent.

1304
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And one thing that I, you know, I've kind of looked at this after the whole sync with Mouse Effect Andromeda is I've been looking at the characters eyes.

1305
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And the eyes have fantastic reflections.

1306
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
They meet their tone.

1307
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:47,000
And there's even, well, I'm going to spoil it because, you know, there's that character, Marvin, who was the cop that you meet up in the thing.

1308
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,000
They actually showed his skin getting ashier and ashier as the game progresses, as he's, you know, dying.

1309
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
They show like a realistic look of somebody bleeding out.

1310
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
The head explosions and the people getting torn apart.

1311
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Okay, I know this is gross, but it's anatomically right.

1312
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Well, I'm serious. Like, Dan magnums somebody in the back of the head because we're taking turns with it.

1313
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And you can actually see the ocular cavity in their skull. It was pretty amazing.

1314
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
No, thanks. I'll be passing on that. But hey, for you gore fans.

1315
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Girl, it's not that bad. It's not that bad.

1316
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
You only have a few sections.

1317
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:34,000
But one of the little tiny, tiny things is that they put nods back to the old game, like they had misspelled welcome, like with two L's for Leon's welcome thing.

1318
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:41,000
So there's a big banner hanging over this. Has it spelled right that there's a gap between the L and the C, and you can find an extra L on the ground.

1319
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And then they have references to characters from other games like Rita, What's-Her-Face from Outbreak.

1320
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,000
It's actually really well done, and her Easter eggs tie in the lore so amazingly well.

1321
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
All right.

1322
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
You even have tied zombies.

1323
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
All right. Well, we're running long. We got to get back to the live show.

1324
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:05,000
But any final thoughts from you, DarkSakura, before we bid you adieu for this week?

1325
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I can't wait to have my Sundays off again, really.

1326
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:22,000
We can't wait to have her back. So there's DarkSakura joining us earlier today with the classic game of the week.

1327
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
We're back here live in our studio with episode number 761 of our show already in progress.

1328
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And I guess I guess now I'm figuring out why there's less and less people, I guess, tuning in tonight.

1329
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I guess there's a big wrestling thing going on right now.

1330
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Oh, yeah. Royal Rumble.

1331
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yeah, because Bobby was looking at the he likes to kind of see like, oh, how are we doing on Twitch right now with the against like other channels and stuff?

1332
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And he said, oh, there's a bunch of people, I guess, that will like watch wrestling and comment on it, like the kind of like watch parties or whatever.

1333
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
They're not showing it. They're just like it's like come here and we'll kind of watch together sort of thing.

1334
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
So kind of kind of interesting, I guess.

1335
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
We'll talk a little bit more about that Twitch community feeling in an upcoming story a little bit later on.

1336
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Some quick, quick housekeeping with VOG Network before we get back into some news, including some rapid fire news.

1337
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
But I did want to point out here, there's some big changes with VOG.

1338
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Some of the like old stuff into some of the new stuff.

1339
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
And I mentioned earlier the radio feed is going to be sunsetting.

1340
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It's no longer going to be there, probably by the time a lot of you guys hear this in our podcast feed.

1341
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
But obviously we had many wonderful years there via shoutcast.

1342
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
So thanks to all of you that supported through the radio and will continue to do so through the video and Twitch TV.

1343
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
And of course, the podcast that have always been there.

1344
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
So many of our shows have been around a long, long time.

1345
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
And so available through the podcast feeds.

1346
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Also, one other thing that's going to be going away very soon.

1347
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,000
This could be the last week where you can actually check in to Orange Lounge Radio and participate with the gamification with VOG Network dot com.

1348
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
The reality of the situation is more people were kind of into it in 2012.

1349
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
It's kind of a newer thing.

1350
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:58,000
And, you know, when four square was bigger and more people were using that, it was kind of like a little bit about where the idea was kind of inspired by of sorts.

1351
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
But just less and less people doing that now.

1352
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,000
We just kind of want to focus our resources on getting more eyeballs on Twitch and what we're doing over here and all that fun stuff.

1353
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:15,000
So unfortunately, the gamification is going to be going away a little bit, which hopefully will, you know, just kind of allow the resources to go to recruit more help here to get some more original VOG programming and things of that sort.

1354
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
So. All right. Let's move on.

1355
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Let's get in to get into some more gaming news, including some rapid fire news.

1356
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Loki. Yes. So, um, Minecraft is getting an update soon and they're adding composting.

1357
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So you actually be able to take some of your unwanted crops now and be able to turn it back into bone meal to help build crops.

1358
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Although from what I read so far that while it's nice that they have those there, it doesn't seem to be a very good source of getting bone meal.

1359
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's almost easier just to wait for, you know, skeletons to just die.

1360
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:00,000
But it is an option. And also people are using them to kind of look they look a little bit like beehives.

1361
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So, you know, people have set them up to look like mock beehives, I guess, for their farms.

1362
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
But yeah, it is something that they're working on right now. So that should be coming soon.

1363
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,000
One of my friends started those Minecraft realm servers and I keep meaning to like get in there.

1364
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But I I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do it. He said he invited me and I went to Minecraft.

1365
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I don't see it. So I have to figure it out. I don't know. Yeah.

1366
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
We'll have to figure that out for us, too. Yeah. Or even just running.

1367
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Maybe just ran the PC version again. But now the console version will be better.

1368
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
We'll do that. I like the Windows 10 version. That's what I play mostly. Yeah.

1369
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Yeah. And then, of course, you know, even though the movie's not yet out and I have high hopes for it,

1370
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Detective Pikachu is already going to be getting a sequel. So that's pretty awesome.

1371
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Apparently, they said they have hired, I guess with Oren Ziel,

1372
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:04,000
who has written for such movies as 22 Jump Street, The Clover Paradise.

1373
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Let's not talk about Cloverfield anymore. The Cloverfield Paradox. OK, so he has one good movie attached to it.

1374
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And he's also writing for the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie and the upcoming moral comic.

1375
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
They're doing another moral comic film. Yeah, supposed to be doing like a reboot.

1376
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Well, 22 Jump Street is good, I guess. But he's going to be right. It's not 21 Jump Street.

1377
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It's 22 Jump Street. The second one was funny. Both of the movies were great, actually.

1378
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And I'm disappointed that they were supposed to be doing a crossover between 21 Jump Street and Men in Black.

1379
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:50,000
That would have been fucking hilarious. But they didn't do it because they don't have the balls to pull something that awesome off.

1380
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So we'll get Men in Black International instead and whatever. I want to see this Detective Pikachu.

1381
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I got to admit, I like good. I like the take they're taking with putting Pokemon in the real world instead of it being super cartoony.

1382
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I'm curious. I'm down to see the movie. I think a lot of that curiosity is why they're already greenlighting a sequel.

1383
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I think they see what the buzz is and that there's a lot of people that are approaching these trailers with cautious optimism

1384
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,000
and are probably, you know, re sharing re sharing the trailers and stuff. You're laughing. No, no, no, no, no.

1385
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I'm not laughing about this. OK. I'm just thinking to myself, I really want the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer.

1386
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I need that trailer. I need to see what we're dealing with here. And I'm you love to carry.

1387
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I love Jim Carrey. And if Sonic is like. Twitter Sonic.

1388
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
We may be in for a good. Yeah, a good movie, but I will see it anyways, no matter how it up.

1389
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And I just referenced it in our chat. There was a meetup between the the Twitter Sonic people and the movie Sonic people like met up.

1390
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But that means they didn't write the movie. Just just to be clear, I did go see Glass this week, which it was all right.

1391
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Yeah, I had watched like all the spoiler reviews and stuff like that beforehand and not a lot of people liked it.

1392
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And I see with their points, it was OK, but.

1393
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It's kind of like it's it's not the M. Night Shyamalan that made split and unbreakable.

1394
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:26,000
It's M. Night Shyamalan that made the Happening and all of the other movies, but not as so not as terrible as that.

1395
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,000
But it's just like. That's not really the way they are.

1396
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
All right, well, Detective Pikachu looks great.

1397
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Looks like it might already be happening based on some of that positive spin. So let's see. Anyway, moving on to more rapid fire news.

1398
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Remember, I talked earlier about how the game's got to get the price cut before it goes free.

1399
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Yeah, ironically, Overwatch is getting a price cut this week.

1400
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Overwatch on PC is down to twenty dollars. So if you want to get the standard edition of Overwatch for PC, it's down to twenty dollars.

1401
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
The original price was forty dollars, which I think was even probably a discount from there.

1402
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
The legendary edition, if you want some more character skins and the crossover stuff is now forty dollars.

1403
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,000
It was previously sixty dollars. So I'm not saying that like Overwatch is going free to play.

1404
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
This is a very different story. Overwatch been out for like two years. It might.

1405
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I know that's a lot of buzz that always seems to come up is that, oh, Overwatch might go free to play, but it doesn't seem to be yet.

1406
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It seems to be they're still continuing to take the price down. I imagine the console versions will follow pretty shortly if they're not already there.

1407
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I think this is going to encourage more people to pick it up on a second system.

1408
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I think there's a lot of that happening because remember, Overwatch is not cross-play, nor do they seem interested in making it cross-play.

1409
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I think Blizzard kind of wants to keep the keyboard mouse people separate from the controller people.

1410
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I'm fine with that.

1411
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:49,000
It would be nice if they would put the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 people together, but they just don't seem motivated to do it.

1412
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Well, they could do the Xbox One and PC people together because they would have, you know, the keyboard mouse support, you know.

1413
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Or just separate, you know, cross-play.

1414
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
They're not going to do it. You're fanfic-ing. They're not going to do it. That's the reality.

1415
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I don't even care.

1416
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
But it's only $20 if you want to get a different version of it.

1417
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
But, you know, the console version's not changing, at least not yet.

1418
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
But we don't know what the future might hold.

1419
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
We do know what the future holds for the Epic Games stores and their free games giveaway.

1420
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
They're giving away Jackbox Games, the very first one right now.

1421
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Oh yeah, I should have picked that up.

1422
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
You can get that on PC. It's free.

1423
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
The next game they're going to be giving out starting February 7th, Axiom Verge.

1424
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
That's a pretty good title to be giving away for free.

1425
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
That is a Super Metroid-esque kind of clone.

1426
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Obviously, they did some things different with different types of power-ups and things, but obviously very heavily inspired by Super Metroid.

1427
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Axiom Verge. Great soundtrack.

1428
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
All done by one dude.

1429
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
One dude did, like, the whole thing.

1430
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So it's a very, very great production.

1431
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:54,000
So yeah, I mean, I already own it on PlayStation 4, but I'll probably pick it up again for PC. Why not?

1432
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
It's free.

1433
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Exactly.

1434
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I think I have that on PC, actually.

1435
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
You should double-check and check that out.

1436
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I don't know. I have a vast library of stuff I don't play.

1437
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Metal Mayhem asks, where is the Jackbox giveaway again?

1438
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
It's in the Epic Games store, so I don't have a link because I'm trying to do a show.

1439
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Just go to the Epic Games store.

1440
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Epic Games dot com, and once you install the store, it'll be there.

1441
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
And then, let's see, Dekeman says, just grab that on Switch. Great game.

1442
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I'm assuming that's Axiom Verge, not the Jackbox thing.

1443
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But they're both great, in my opinion.

1444
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Actually, both of them are on there, too, I think.

1445
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Both are on Switch, you're absolutely right.

1446
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
So, yeah, Axiom Verge is cool.

1447
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
If you are a Super Metroid fan, like I am, I think you'll get a big kick out of Axiom Verge.

1448
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I thought it was great.

1449
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1450
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
And what's coming to a store near you?

1451
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I think I know the big one, right?

1452
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Well, let's start it off with Kingdom Hearts 3.

1453
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this week.

1454
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
We have a game called Penguin Wars that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.

1455
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,000
The Sinks and the Cursed Mummy on Nintendo Switch.

1456
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Dragon Marked for Death on Nintendo Switch.

1457
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Robotics Notes Dash and Robotics Notes Elite HD on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1458
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown on PC.

1459
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And Wargroove on PC, Switch, and Xbox One.

1460
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Alright, traveling over to Japan.

1461
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Not coming out this week, Kingdom Hearts 3, because it's already out.

1462
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Came out on Friday. I actually have a buddy that imported it and has been playing it this weekend.

1463
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
So, yeah, I guess it really happened, you guys.

1464
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 really is releasing after all this time. It's pretty exciting.

1465
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
But that already released in Japan, so that's why it's absent from the releases this week.

1466
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
But what you do have on the release dates, you have Nelke and the Legendary Alchemist,

1467
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Ateliers of the New World, that's coming in a regular anniversary and premium box.

1468
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So there's a lot of different editions of that coming out from Koei Tecmo on the PlayStation 4.

1469
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Conception Plus, Oreno Kodomo Wu Undukure comes out this week from Spike Chunsoft.

1470
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And a collector's edition of Stardew Valley goes to retail for the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.

1471
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Also, Dragon Ball FighterZ Deluxe Edition is available on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1472
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Traveling over in Japan real quick to take a look at the Switch.

1473
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
It looks like that same Nelke and the Legendary Alchemist is also available on the Switch.

1474
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
As well as Robotics Notes Dash is available on the Switch as well.

1475
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Dragon's Marked for Death, Fate Xtella Link, that same Stardew Valley collector's edition.

1476
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And Opus Collection, which includes The Day We Found Earth and Rocket of Whispers.

1477
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
That is all out. Oh, another duo edition on the Switch.

1478
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Child of Light Ultimate Edition with Valiant Hearts The Great War double pack.

1479
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
So, busy week on both platforms.

1480
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I guess now that the Kingdom Hearts 3 release happened, everybody else can come to the party.

1481
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Filling in for the year updates, Loki, while Dark Soccer is still out.

1482
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I will do my best, because apparently certain sites don't know how to sort by date.

1483
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Yeah, she was really thrown by that last week, too. She was not happy.

1484
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
So, we'll have to find a new...

1485
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Alright, so...

1486
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Where are you guys in Europe getting your release dates? Because we might need to follow suit.

1487
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
So, anyways...

1488
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
So, Ace Combat 7, Sky's Unknown collector's edition out on PC this week.

1489
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
We've got... let's see...

1490
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Jesus Christ.

1491
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Christ Sings in the Cursed Mummy. That's on the Switch.

1492
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1493
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,000
We've also got Child of Light and a Valiant Heart double pack that's coming out on the Switch.

1494
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And Crash Dummy on the Switch and PlayStation 4.

1495
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Dragon's Dawn of the New Riders on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1496
01:49:47,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And Song of Memories on PlayStation 4 and 8-Bit Hoards on PlayStation 4 as well.

1497
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And I think that may be it.

1498
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Alright.

1499
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Yeah, that is it.

1500
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Close enough. Alright.

1501
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Well, we're going to move on to the mailbag.

1502
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
You guys email us over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com

1503
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
and we read your emails here live on air.

1504
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
So, I really appreciate you guys who take the time out to email us during the week.

1505
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Let's get to the emails.

1506
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
First email tonight from Tom who emails us saying,

1507
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Hey all, congratulations on making the jump to Twitch.

1508
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
All said, it looks to have been pretty successful.

1509
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
I've been listening since the live 365 days and you've never failed to make me smile.

1510
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I've been wanting to give back in some way, so here's my OLR archive.

1511
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:42,000
A super ugly, super simple webpage that lists every OLR MP3 I could find.

1512
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I guess I'm okay to give out the link here because it's in our email.

1513
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:53,000
https://olarchive.samurailink3.com

1514
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I've pulled all the episodes I could possibly find on the website,

1515
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Misty's archive, and a couple others.

1516
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
If I'm missing anything, let me know. I'll get it added.

1517
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
This does auto-update every week, so there's no maintenance to it.

1518
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Feel free to mirror, advertise, or link.

1519
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Very cool.

1520
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
That's awesome.

1521
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I don't know where it's pulling those MP3s from.

1522
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Is it pulling from our own server?

1523
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
If it's pulling from the SkyDrive archive that was up there previously,

1524
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
or what all that pulls from.

1525
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I didn't look that deep into it, but that's still really cool.

1526
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
This does remind me, though, to warn you guys.

1527
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
This was something I really was supposed to take care of about six weeks ago,

1528
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
but OLR is going to actually be switching hosts behind the scenes.

1529
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
This should be a seamless thing.

1530
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
You guys shouldn't notice.

1531
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
It's just that the lovely space we've been donated for so long

1532
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
can only sustain to be donated for so much longer.

1533
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
So we're going to be moving it to a different space.

1534
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Probably something a little more like,

1535
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I'm not going to say it's going to be one of the big podcast hosts,

1536
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
but likely one of the ones you're a little more familiar with,

1537
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
which the good news is that's going to open it up to get it really easy

1538
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
for us to get on things like Spotify and stuff like that.

1539
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:59,000
But the downside is that because it will not be donated

1540
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
and the space will not be limitless,

1541
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
a lot of the old episodes are going to disappear.

1542
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
So if you are linking to anything at orangeontrader.com right now

1543
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:13,000
that is an old episode, I would urge you to grab it and save it elsewhere

1544
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
because they will be going away in a few weeks.

1545
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Now, again, going to be seamless.

1546
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
If you're just interested in the last ten episodes, the last five episodes,

1547
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:26,000
you'll be fine because we'll copy those over when we go to the new solution.

1548
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
But the vast archive that we have already on orangeontrader.com

1549
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
will be going away.

1550
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
So this email is actually very timely so I can kind of warn you about that.

1551
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Of course I would have still given you some warning,

1552
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
but I do want to let you guys know it's coming.

1553
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I've referenced it a little bit on the show before.

1554
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Again, if you're listening to the pod, it's seamless.

1555
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
My big thing is that I don't want to lose the people already subscribed

1556
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
because that's a big deal.

1557
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
We've been on iTunes a very long time since the day they launched podcasting.

1558
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
So I don't want to lose the people we already have subscribed.

1559
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
So we'll make sure that that all gets done seamlessly for you guys.

1560
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Anyhow, dgramaS says, Rob, tell that person to contact me.

1561
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I have a few hundred episodes.

1562
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,000
So there you go, some OLR listeners networking together to listen to old OLR.

1563
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
But I really do want to warn you, old OLR is very different from new OLR.

1564
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
We've evolved a lot in 17 years.

1565
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
So please do not judge the current state of Orange Launch Radio

1566
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
based off of episode three.

1567
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Very different.

1568
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Anyway, Bobby says, oh, he's hosting each MP3 himself.

1569
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Wow, that's pretty cool.

1570
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Because I was going to say, there's actually more,

1571
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
and Bobby might be interested in this too.

1572
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:47,000
For other super nerd programmers like myself, Bobby, here's the API endpoint.

1573
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:51,000
It will give you a JSON array of all episodes.

1574
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
JSON, JSON, JSON array of all episodes.

1575
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:03,000
So, https://api.olarchive.samurailink3.com.

1576
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
So that same link, but with API dot in the front.

1577
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
So have a ball with that.

1578
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Anyway, if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or hate mail, let me know.

1579
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
We now return you to your regularly scheduled RuPaul coverage.

1580
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
And that is from Tom.

1581
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I think it's awesome.

1582
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Well, we don't, because we have an email.

1583
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
We are not covering Drag Race right now.

1584
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
That's right. We have an email, so no Drag Race coverage this week,

1585
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
which is a bummer, because there's a lot I could talk about.

1586
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
But you'll just have to listen to Reading is Fundamental

1587
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
with my buddies from gamebuoy.org and video game realness doing that.

1588
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
So, anyway, thanks.

1589
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
That's cool.

1590
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Yeah, I endorse it.

1591
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Why not?

1592
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Again, the footnote.

1593
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Old OLR is for you hardcore nerdy fans of the show,

1594
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
which I love you and I appreciate you.

1595
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
It's for you guys only.

1596
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I don't want new people to like, hmm, what's this Orange Launch Radio show about?

1597
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I've always heard of this, so they go and they don't download episode four.

1598
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Like, what the hell is this?

1599
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
It's old.

1600
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
It's very different. Very different.

1601
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

1602
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Let's talk about an email from YYR.

1603
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Hello, LR. I wanted to take a moment to clarify something

1604
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
about the impending closure of the We Shop channel.

1605
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Tuesday, January 29th is the last day that you can purchase content

1606
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
from the We Shop channel using Wii points you already possess.

1607
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
So, time is running out. You better get on that.

1608
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
You got until Tuesday.

1609
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Beginning Wednesday, you will no longer be able to buy

1610
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Virtual Console or WiiWare titles,

1611
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
and any remaining Wii points you have will be forfeited.

1612
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It will be reinvested by Nintendo to make more money.

1613
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
However, according to Nintendo's website, you will still be able to download,

1614
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
re-download previously purchased software even after January 29th.

1615
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
You will also still be able to use the Wii to Wii U transfer tool.

1616
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
These services will be discontinued at a future date,

1617
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
but that date has not yet been announced.

1618
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
So, that's interesting because all the websites are kind of running with something else.

1619
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
So, sorry.

1620
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
So, interesting about that.

1621
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
But, yeah.

1622
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,000
I guess, though, I'm still okay with all the hysteria being out there about the closure

1623
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,000
because I think a lot of people probably haven't checked their Wiis in some time,

1624
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
but this sets them up for that.

1625
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
You know, this sets them up to make sure you spend your points

1626
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
so Nintendo doesn't just take your money for free

1627
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
and make sure that, you know, you've bought everything.

1628
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
And if you know the re-downloading ability is going away at some point,

1629
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
you might as well just kind of have all that in order,

1630
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
even if we don't know the exact day yet.

1631
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
And I still think because it is scheduled to go away,

1632
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
everything we said last week about the reality of digital and all that other stuff,

1633
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I think it still all holds.

1634
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
And there are, I think, tools to still be able to download that stuff.

1635
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I think people have a lot of that backed up,

1636
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
and you can still download it even if you don't.

1637
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
But, you know, you should.

1638
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And why do you still have Wii points? Seriously.

1639
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I mean, like...

1640
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Spend them.

1641
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I don't even think they've sold those.

1642
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
I need to just double check on my Wii U because I transferred it all.

1643
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I need to double check just to make sure.

1644
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I feel like I have, like, a 100-point balance.

1645
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I have one of those balances where I can't buy anything

1646
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
because nothing is under 500 points, you know what I mean?

1647
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Yeah.

1648
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's where I'm at.

1649
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
They got me.

1650
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
They did the whole, like, what is it, 10 hot dogs in a pack but 12 buns?

1651
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
That whole thing? They got me.

1652
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Anyway.

1653
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Yeah.

1654
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Moving on.

1655
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Oh, YYR finished up.

1656
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So don't worry yet about losing access to those NES games you bought 13 years ago.

1657
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Life goes on.

1658
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Well, I'm worried.

1659
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Anyway.

1660
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
FrodoSwagons with our last email of the week saying,

1661
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So, I've heard a lot of hype about the new Kingdom Hearts game.

1662
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I have to admit, I have never played any of the games.

1663
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
That being said, I don't really know a lot about them.

1664
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Can you explain what the games are all about?

1665
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I kind of need something new to play and I'm hoping this may potentially interest me.

1666
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
And that's from FrodoSwagons.

1667
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Alright, y'all. Pull up a chair. We got a six-hour show tonight.

1668
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
We're going to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

1669
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I honestly think that there used to be a YouTube channel that would do these wrap-ups of plot.

1670
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I don't know if they actually launched it or if I'm spoiling something.

1671
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I really hope I'm not.

1672
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:20,000
But I know Captain Spike over at Game Buoy was supposed to be doing a Kingdom Hearts show at some point

1673
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,000
that was going to kind of wrap it all up.

1674
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:27,000
So, I mean, obviously I want to endorse the content that my friends are making.

1675
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
So there is that.

1676
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
But here's the thing. Look, obviously we're kind of joking.

1677
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:38,000
We cannot possibly sum up the plot in even five minutes, let alone five hours.

1678
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I see that Eurogamer has a plot synopsis of the games that you need to know before you play Kingdom Hearts 3.

1679
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
So you could try that.

1680
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I know there's other more entertaining channels that will do a plot summary of stuff.

1681
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Just do a quick YouTube search and you'll find several videos talking about the story.

1682
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Here's the thing. Let me actually approach the question a lot more simply

1683
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
because he didn't say explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

1684
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
He said, can you tell me what these games are all about?

1685
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Why are people getting excited about them? Here's the reason.

1686
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:17,000
So when the Kingdom Hearts franchise first launched, it was Square Enix getting access to the Disney property.

1687
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:23,000
The Disney games that we had until then, I mean, you'd have a couple good ones like DuckTales, right?

1688
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
The epic game. Mickey Mousecapade was pretty cool on the NES as well.

1689
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
So you'd get some kind of hit and miss when it came to Disney games.

1690
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
But the thing that was special about Square Enix partnering up with Disney

1691
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:39,000
is that you had a Square Enix RPG type of game but featuring Disney characters.

1692
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Now that's basically what Kingdom Hearts is.

1693
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Now it's not an RPG like Final Fantasy, although some elements are in that.

1694
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
It's a little more real-time action-y. It's more of an action RPG.

1695
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
It wasn't so much like Final Fantasy before, but now it's pretty similar to some of the Final Fantasy games

1696
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
because those games are now real-time.

1697
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I would say mix it a little more with the gameplay of a game like Zelda.

1698
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,000
You know how Zelda is more action-y and in the moment and has RPG elements?

1699
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:11,000
That's kind of like mix Zelda with Final Fantasy and that's kind of like how Kingdom Hearts kind of plays.

1700
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:17,000
And I encourage you to go there. Believe me, everybody under the sun is going to be streaming Kingdom Hearts 3 this week

1701
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
because everybody's going to be like, I'm the first to stream Kingdom Hearts.

1702
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Everybody's going to be streaming Kingdom Hearts 3 on Tuesday.

1703
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I say everybody, but I can already see some people are going to be like, not me, not me.

1704
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:33,000
That's fine. But when I say everybody, I mean a lot of your favorite streamers are going to be looking at it or checking it out.

1705
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
So go check out some of the folks that are streaming it. It will give you a better sense.

1706
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:42,000
But I think people get really excited about Kingdom Hearts because it is original Final Fantasy creators.

1707
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:50,000
The main, excuse me, characters. The main characters in the game were like created by Square Enix kind of like for Disney.

1708
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So like Sora, Riku, those characters were made by Square Enix but kind of like for Disney specifically for this game.

1709
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:03,000
But those characters basically travel to different worlds based on Disney franchises.

1710
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Which if I remember right, in the very first game, the very first place you go, once you get past like the town where they're all from

1711
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:14,000
and you get to the central hub, the Traverse Town. I think the first one is Alice in Wonderland, if I remember right.

1712
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
So you go to a whole world based on Alice in Wonderland.

1713
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:24,000
And so you team up with, you don't team up with the Queen of Hearts, but you team up with either the White Rabbit or like one of the guards.

1714
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:30,000
It's been a long time since I played you guys. But like those guys will actually join like a party and will play with you.

1715
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:36,000
And like what you're trying to help bring order these different worlds and so forth and push back against the Heartless.

1716
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
And now I'm getting into the story that could go on for hours and hours.

1717
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:44,000
But this is why people love Kingdom Hearts because people really like Square Enix games, like Final Fantasy.

1718
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
And by the way, the Final Fantasy characters show up in these games too.

1719
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:56,000
So like when you go to this Traverse Town, like Aerith is there, Sephiroth is there, who is voiced by Lance Bass in the original Kingdom Hearts game.

1720
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
That is a true statement.

1721
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Sora was voiced by Haley Joel Osment, who I think is still voicing him even for the third game, even though he's like full on adult now.

1722
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But when the first game came out, he was still kind of that kid that was in the sixth sense. You know what I mean?

1723
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:14,000
So it's kind of interesting. But anyway, so it's like Final Fantasy worlds collide with Disney worlds.

1724
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
And that's what get people very excited about it because there's a lot of Disney fans out there too.

1725
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I mean, look at the opening moments of tonight's show.

1726
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
We geeked out for 10 minutes about Disneyland and Loki's trip there.

1727
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,000
How much Kingdom Hearts content did you see at Disneyland?

1728
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
None.

1729
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Isn't that unfortunate?

1730
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Well, I didn't look either. We spent very little time in shops.

1731
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I'm sure there was something, but I didn't go seeking it.

1732
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I didn't see any Tron stuff either. So, you know.

1733
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Yeah, that's unfortunate. Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is giving some input on this email as well.

1734
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:55,000
There was an interesting video from I think GameSpot that actually talks about the history and how Nomura wanted to make a game like Super Mario 64.

1735
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Square said the only way you could get that over is if you had something recognizable like Disney characters.

1736
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Then it went into the stuff about how they pitched it to Disney and how Disney pushed back.

1737
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
And Nomura was like, no, we'd make the game my way or we don't make it at all.

1738
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
And Bobby says Sora is still Haley Joel Osment in a higher voice.

1739
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Dinkman says Leon, or Squall, is voiced by David Boreanaz, Angel.

1740
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
If y'all are Buffy fans.

1741
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Let's see.

1742
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,000
DarkTichyas says wasn't Kingdom Hearts the original elevator pitch since they were in the same office building?

1743
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Oh yeah, I think I've heard that story too.

1744
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Dinkman says they have a Kingdom Hearts version of Donald and Goofy they pull out on special occasions in different Disney parks.

1745
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:42,000
One time I saw something Kingdom Hearts related at Disneyland. It was actually California Adventure.

1746
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
And I'm still sad to this day. I couldn't afford that statue.

1747
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I would love a Kingdom Hearts movie series.

1748
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
That would be just such a badass movie.

1749
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
We know Disney will do crossover because that new Wreck-It Ralph movie had that scene with all the princesses.

1750
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
It would be so fucking amazing.

1751
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I am so down for this.

1752
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Oh my god, a Netflix Kingdom Hearts show.

1753
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Except it would be on Netflix because Disney is launching their own Netflix.

1754
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So on the Disney service, Disney Go? Is that what they're called? I forget.

1755
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
But anyway, that would be great.

1756
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Oh, Bobby Lockl says there was supposed to be a Kingdom Hearts TV show on Disney XD. It got tabled.

1757
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Well, bring it back for this new Disney Netflix competitor.

1758
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
As if we need another thing to subscribe to.

1759
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Anyway.

1760
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Alright, let's move on. That was a good email.

1761
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Sometimes we gotta go back to the basics.

1762
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,000
We have to remember too, I think it's very important to recognize that first Kingdom Hearts game was what, like 2001?

1763
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Like, some of our listeners, this is so weird to say, some of our listeners were probably like 5 years old when that first game came out.

1764
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
And they're like 20 now.

1765
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
And they're like, what was the big deal, you guys?

1766
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I think this is a big reason why in the past few years, Square Enix kind of did those HD re-releases of Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5.

1767
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Which kind of get people familiar with those again.

1768
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
So, anyway.

1769
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Alright, let's move on. We do have some more stories to get out for you guys before we get to your calls via Discord.

1770
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:06,000
If you're not already aware, last week we said goodbye to Skype and we said hello to Discord.

1771
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So if you want to call into the show tonight, you will have to be on our Discord at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1772
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I'll detail how that all works again in a little while.

1773
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Or you can refer to the pinned message in the OLR channel once you get there.

1774
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
In the meantime, some more news stories for us. Loki.

1775
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Alright, so the GDC put out a survey to game developers.

1776
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
And we got some interesting information.

1777
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,000
So 4,000 game developers filled out the survey.

1778
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:37,000
And it basically goes over different things, including working conditions, and uni-

1779
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Uni-

1780
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Uni-

1781
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Hi, I can't speak today.

1782
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Unionization.

1783
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
So, let's go ahead and kind of run down some of the trends that we saw here.

1784
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:54,000
So, first off, the survey came back with about 50% of the game developers actually wanting to unionize.

1785
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Which is pretty cool.

1786
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:04,000
18% of the people that they had surveyed had also said that they were developing a game for a next gen console.

1787
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:10,000
And that Steam is the dominant PC and Mac download platform.

1788
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:17,000
But 59% of the people that they had responded to it, just like the 30% rev share.

1789
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Which makes sense.

1790
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Some other fun figures.

1791
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Nearly half of the game makers work over 40 hours a week.

1792
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Including, they said, 44% spent over 40 hours with about 3% averaging 60 hours a week.

1793
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
The driving factor of that is mostly self pressure.

1794
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
And wanting to work overtime just to get some of that stuff done.

1795
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,000
And, let's see, other fun things.

1796
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Aside from Steam, some of the other storefronts that are high on the list here.

1797
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
So Steam was the top with 47%.

1798
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Basically selling directly, so via your own websites, was 26%.

1799
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Followed by publisher owned Humble Store itch.io.

1800
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
17, 18%.

1801
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Last being Discord and Cartridge. I've never heard of Cartridge.

1802
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
That's something new.

1803
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Switch. Switch Cartridges.

1804
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
No, Cartridge is a website with K. Not necessarily Switch Cartridge.

1805
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:33,000
And, of course, they want, of course, a better portion of their profits.

1806
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
As far as unionization, they think that 47% believe that they should unionize.

1807
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
26% maybe. 16% no.

1808
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Whether they think that workers will actually unionize, 39% or maybe.

1809
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,000
21% yes. 24% no.

1810
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Interesting. And this is all from GDC related organizations.

1811
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
And GDC is coming up in March.

1812
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
So I wonder if you'll be hearing more talks on this sort of thing.

1813
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
And maybe there'll be unions there trying to tempt people to unionize.

1814
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Just something like that. Could be very interesting.

1815
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:12,000
They're saying that the majority of the split right now in the game industry as far as developers is about 80-20 men to women.

1816
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,000
They're saying that most of the devs are coming from Europe and North America.

1817
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,000
That most of the people that responded have been making games for less than a decade.

1818
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,000
So definitely I can see that with a lot of the trends.

1819
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
A lot of those tools have become available more recently for free even.

1820
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Makes sense.

1821
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
It makes it a lot easier to get into it now.

1822
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Let's see. What else?

1823
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:42,000
As far as the company size that they're working for.

1824
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
We'll just kind of go over this real quick.

1825
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
So larger companies over 500. About 20 percent.

1826
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Also tied with that though is myself only.

1827
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
So 20 percent working for themselves.

1828
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
2-5. 15 percent.

1829
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
And then kind of around that 100 person range. About 10 percent.

1830
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
So, pretty neat.

1831
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Yeah. And the results are all what Loki's reading from is all available online if you want to check that out yourself.

1832
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Yeah. You can go to I think the GDC's website actually had the survey.

1833
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
You can check out. They have like a brief little summary there.

1834
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Let's see. Yeah. It was at reg.gdcconf.com.

1835
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
And then it's GDC's.

1836
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
That's their registration site.

1837
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Yeah. So it's their red site.

1838
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Interesting. I'll be. I'm very curious to see where this talk about the unionization and everything kind of leads in the future.

1839
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:36,000
You know that's not the first time that folks have talked about kind of coming together to unionize for you know some of these working conditions to be improved and so forth.

1840
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,000
So I guess the only way it gets better is if everybody threatens to walk out if it doesn't.

1841
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,000
But then there's a whole other flip side of that. Well we can replace you with somebody younger.

1842
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
And so it's going to be an interesting battle to see what ends up happening there.

1843
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:56,000
So I think I think in a way what's really happening is that I think especially as you talk about with those numbers with how big the studios are.

1844
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I think you have a lot of people that are just like I'm out. I can make my I must start my own studio with my buddies and they'll be four of us and we'll get the Marvel license and make a new card game.

1845
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Right. I think that's kind of in some ways.

1846
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I feel like that is where the why they're not going to unionize is going to happen.

1847
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:22,000
It may be the case because you have a lot of people just get fed up quit go do their own thing and then they're perfectly happy doing it because the tools are out there to succeed as an independent person.

1848
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Look at look at Axiom Verge which we brought up earlier in the show. I was one dude.

1849
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:43,000
You know another one last interesting thing so that half of the devs that responded said that the switch was the most interesting platform and of those went out for have had their game sell the best on the switch as a platform.

1850
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:53,000
So that's pretty interesting. Yeah. All right. Well let's move on. I want to talk about something it's kind of a follow up to something we talked about last week because this is more late breaking news during our show last week.

1851
02:10:53,000 --> 02:11:05,000
And I don't know if you heard it all about this Loki but there was a twitch stream that was going on that was trying to raise some money for a gender dysphoria charity which is transgender issues.

1852
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Mermaids is the UK charity that was raising this money and what's and I still don't understand the how and maybe somebody in chat kind of knows how this happened.

1853
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:25,000
But apparently what happened is that Congresswoman Alexia Ocasio excuse me Alexandria Ocasio Cortez AOC as people are calling her now ended up calling into this stream.

1854
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:37,000
And then that kind of had the streamers like sort of floored and she was able to talk about you know why transgender rights are important and how we're still fighting for you know those those qualities and so forth but also kind of talking about

1855
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:47,000
like her own political platforms and you know some things because she's very recently in Congress and you know I realize she's a very polarizing person and I'm not here to get into our politics right or not.

1856
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I'm just getting into isn't it fascinating that this is how she's communicating with people and I think is in a way and I must admit part of kind of what draws me to her is almost almost like she understands memes.

1857
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:04,000
She knows to go on Twitch like I think very often times we feel very disconnected.

1858
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I think for Washington is like oh it's just a bunch of old fuddy duddies that don't know what they're like there are a lot of old funny there are still there's lots I mean like you watch just like you watch any of these like different congressional hearings that they have about like Facebook and stuff and where they're asking just like grandpa questions about stuff like you don't know how to fucking computer work stuff.

1859
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Well well it's like it's just it's embarrassing you're embarrassing yourself.

1860
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:42,000
So I think when we talk about like you know where the Gen X and the millennials kind of feel a little distance from the boomers it's like it's to see that representation more I guess millennial in AOC's case representation.

1861
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:56,000
You know in Congress is pretty exciting for a lot of people just because you know you hear she is going on Twitch streams to promote you know her politics and the things she's talking about and I I kind of look at that and again regardless of whether you agree with her politics or not.

1862
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:04,000
It's kind of one of those things where it's like wow like we feel a connection to Washington D.C. in the gaming community.

1863
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Anyway Bobby Blackwell in our chat room says the way I understood it is that she tweeted about it someone working the stream and not on the air reached out to her and worked out how she could call in.

1864
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:19,000
So it was a match made on Twitter. What another frickin like how many people in Washington would you see connecting via Twitter.

1865
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Maybe the president has done a lot of business dealing on Twitter.

1866
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:34,000
It's hard to see these connecting with people. Let's see anyway. Deep man says she made a joke earlier about setting up a smash tournament in Congress. She's hip. Yes. How do you do fellow kids.

1867
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Anyway and then fifth dream says she made an all your base joke. And today she did the why not both thing. So she she's the meme Congress woman basically.

1868
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Anyway all that aside again I don't want to make this an AOC segment but my point is isn't that fascinating where like politics came to twitch and that's where we were kind of talking about last week.

1869
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
We kind of got into the conversation where it's like dude if you all thought twitch was an underground thing that people didn't know about before.

1870
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Like it's getting bigger and bigger and this is you know going back to the very beginnings of the show talking about you know where television going is the future of broadcasting.

1871
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:16,000
We're looking at it and what's kind of developing here very homegrown it's very very fascinating.

1872
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Anyway there was a very interesting article written over at Ars Technica that talked about the new online town square.

1873
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:35,000
And so I'm kind of citing that Web site in their article specifically because I thought it was a very interesting perspective on why everybody was kind of talking about this whole thing.

1874
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And you know also I'm talking about you talked about how like a game like World of Warcraft is sometimes like an interactive chat room.

1875
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:48,000
The simplistic gameplay is something to keep you occupied. But while you talk with friends you know that's how some people view it.

1876
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:54,000
And then you know now Fortnite a lot of people view that as less of a game and more of a social network.

1877
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,000
You know as you know more and more personalities are coming up around Fortnite and things like that.

1878
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:12,000
So anyway they say in an excerpt from the article here a quote perhaps more than any other artistic medium games provide a handy latch point for that kind of casual secondary social interaction.

1879
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:19,000
And so they go on to talk about you know Twitch and so forth where the game itself is secondary to the people that are playing it.

1880
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:24,000
And then so lastly the article kind of sums up here.

1881
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,000
When people ask me what Twitch is my default answer is that it's a place to watch people playing video games.

1882
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
But that's really an incomplete answer.

1883
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:46,000
These days Twitch is often just a place is just as often a place where watching video games serves as a convenient excuse to gather with like minded streamers and viewers in the closest thing we have to a live digital town square.

1884
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:51,000
And I thought so shout out to Ars Technica and I believe that was Kyle Orland who wrote that article.

1885
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I thought that was a really neat perspective on the whole situation and very accurate.

1886
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
You know we've talked about how like Orange Lounge Radio for you.

1887
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I don't want to be like we started the trend but you know I've tried to say it here at Orange Lounge Radio for years.

1888
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:15,000
We've all said like oh this show started because it was like it was us all gathering at the dinner table after playing DDR we were at the diner talking about you know DDR the music games and other games we enjoyed and just sitting around.

1889
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Talking about video games and that's kind of what we wanted to bring to the Internet.

1890
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Well it turns out that's a lot of people are bringing to Twitch is this very virtual space to have these conversations and kind of kind of what we're doing now.

1891
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I'm pretty sure everything you guys are seeing here on the side with the headlines that are coming up and everything you guys probably are already somewhat in tune with this.

1892
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Maybe not everybody.

1893
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,000
I know there's a few listeners out there that maybe follow games a little more casually so they hear about some things for the first time on here.

1894
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,000
But I think there's plenty of you that already damn well know the gaming news.

1895
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:55,000
You're here for the discussion and I think that's super awesome and why we want to be able to participate with our listeners so it's not just Loki barking you and me barking you and all that stuff.

1896
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:04,000
It's you know us having a conversation and I think that's really cool and just so interesting about where the future of broadcasting and so forth might be headed.

1897
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
So what do you did you did you hear about that.

1898
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
The politician on Twitch and all that.

1899
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Yeah I remember reading a little bit about that I just didn't follow too closely but that's cool.

1900
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I mean I hope that helped out their stream with getting more coverage and maybe more donations.

1901
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Oh yeah sure.

1902
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I think the goal was like five hundred dollars and they ended up making like three hundred thousand.

1903
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Don't quote me on those numbers but it was like yeah the awareness because it wasn't just AOC that came on the stream.

1904
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,000
They got like Jim Sterling a lot of like you know personalities and people to call into that too.

1905
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,000
So whoever the PR person was that did that.

1906
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I mean that's that's a person that ought to be hired like an EA or something to manage the communication there because whoever like managed that charity stream that was you know only aiming for you know a minor amount.

1907
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:03,000
All these I mean five hundred dollars is nothing to I'd love to raise that kind of money for an awesome charity but I mean just when that was the goal and they just shattered through the roof like that's that took some talent.

1908
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
So props to the organizers quite frankly.

1909
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I'm looking at our chat over at Twitch at our own little town hall at a twitch TV slash vog network.

1910
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Fifth dream today is gives the tongue in cheek answer saying you go to my free cams and do the same thing with naked ladies.

1911
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Hey you know what.

1912
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
We all worship at some kind of temple I suppose.

1913
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Anyway bonds double six says filthy casual here.

1914
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Hey there's nothing wrong with that.

1915
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:38,000
That's why that's why I really don't like I don't like to talk down to the audience ever and I'm not perfect and I'm going to have my moments where I should have said something better.

1916
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:48,000
But I really do try to approach things where it's like I want to assume that like we're not just like like we're not the first person to break this news to you but at the same time if you haven't heard before.

1917
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Here's kind of like our take on what's going on it's kind of like a interesting fine line you have to walk sometimes right.

1918
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Yeah so anyway let's see guys you know says the twitch thing is cool but at the same time you don't want outsiders knowing about our secret places.

1919
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Once they see the twitch models dancing on their streams they're going to say it's a porn site and try to attack it.

1920
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:19,000
But I think that's just again that's like one small part that's like saying somebody met somebody on World of Warcraft and took them across the state line and killed them like that doesn't happen to everybody.

1921
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:27,000
It's it's horrible and it shouldn't happen to anybody but just you know unfortunately these types of crappy incidents happen in place.

1922
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,000
I guess I just compared porn to murder sorry see what I mean about choosing my words better.

1923
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:38,000
But I mean you know what I mean like that is one small part that the the porny thing you know obviously you can't have full on porn on twitch.

1924
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:45,000
But the you know the the boys and girls that are you know using a little more appeal to sell you know their stuff.

1925
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
I think that's really one small part of what twitch is offering.

1926
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:56,000
So anyway let's see other comments here.

1927
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Bobby Blackwell says I'd love to raise five hundred dollars for my favorite charity vog network LLC.

1928
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Hey we appreciate all the subscriptions and the bitty donations we really do.

1929
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:13,000
We've been very very pleased with how many of you guys are actually subscribing to visit the video archives or just support the network financially with your.

1930
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:19,000
You know a lot of you guys just using your twitch prime that you get anyway once a month on vog network and that's awesome.

1931
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Thank you thank you thank you.

1932
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:26,000
We you know we appreciate it and we we promise to spend your money wisely and really appreciate you guys kicking that in.

1933
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
But it's not mandatory it's never been mandatory and it's never going to be mandatory.

1934
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Fifth dream today also making the comparison that's like read it.

1935
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Some of it is a toxic hellhole but some of it can teach you some shit.

1936
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
That's true that's true. All right anyway let's move on.

1937
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Let's go to another story here and we're going to hear from you guys and open it up to the town hall of discord a little later on.

1938
02:20:50,000 --> 02:21:00,000
But first Loki I sort of got you know what is this 2019 and still we have game developers setting up their games to have the physics run based on the frame rate.

1939
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Why why are we still doing this in 2019.

1940
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Apparently that's the situation though with Fortnite so Fortnite on the switch runs at 30 frames per second.

1941
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:22,000
And apparently with that you know apparently your guns fire a little bit slower at 30 frames per second versus like the 60 frames per second that you get on PC.

1942
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:30,000
So for example they took one of the guns and at 30 frames per second it took twenty seven point five two seconds to unload the whole clip.

1943
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:37,000
But at 60 frames per second they got it to unload the clip in twenty six point zero eight seconds.

1944
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:44,000
And of course you can actually increase that amount too with a higher frame rate if you have it unlocked.

1945
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:55,000
So is that very bad when we've got this cross platform thing going on. It is bad but it's also it's so like you know I I'm assuming it's pretty much similar to other game engines.

1946
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:02,000
But like I know with like Unity and stuff they have the time delta time stuff and I think that's part of just most programming languages.

1947
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:12,000
And that allows you to you know have all of your physics or all of your timing run at a consistent frame rate or a consistent rate based regardless of frame rate.

1948
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Why you lock it to stupid frame rate is beyond me. I mean other than I don't know the reason why you would do that but.

1949
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Here we are you know still doing that crap. So I don't know if they're going to fix this stuff but at the.

1950
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Well I'm sure now that it's been pointed out very much.

1951
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Yeah they said that they're aware and they're working on fix but they haven't gone in taking details of what that's going to be.

1952
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:44,000
But I don't know why they should even be pointed out in the first place it's done. But like you follow 76 to the same shit and even worse.

1953
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
So just mentioned by a chatter 53 today in our chair.

1954
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:56,000
So I mean along with that there is some good news though Fortnite is going to be changing the way that they do their loot boxes with this Fortnite save the world.

1955
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:02,000
So what they're going to be doing now is instead of the loot boxes or loot llamas.

1956
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Basically they're going to players will be able to buy them and then open them to find out what they've received.

1957
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Apparently though the update the v bucks llamas are becoming x ray llamas.

1958
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:23,000
And before buying these new x ray llamas you'll be able to see exactly what they're going to receive in the players don't like anything in the llama.

1959
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
They can wait until the next day when the contents inside the llama will change.

1960
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,000
That's a pretty clever way to get people to calm down about this a little bit. I kind of like that idea.

1961
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,000
X ray llama x ray llama. Yeah I like that.

1962
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:45,000
And then they're saying you know. So I guess I mean that's a neat idea I guess it's still going to be kind of random but you'll be able to see what you're getting.

1963
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:50,000
But you know what random thing you're getting. Yeah you can save your v bucks or something. Yeah.

1964
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Adept in chat says isn't it still the same though it's random. Yes but it's very different when you know what random assortment you're getting up front.

1965
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:02,000
So your purchase isn't random. That makes sense. Yeah. What's your what you ultimately the transaction does not end up being random.

1966
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:09,000
There's no gambling involved. I mean you know what it is you're going to get. It's just what's generated that's random.

1967
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Right. And you can only it'll be different each day I guess. I don't know if you can purchase like more than one of these something and then it'll be different each time you'll have to play more for a night to find out.

1968
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:31,000
I'm not spending money on this. I did. I don't think I talked about it in my game because I think it was a couple of weeks ago at this point but I know it was like last week I went into Fortnite just to like fuck around in there and I was actually playing like the little like level editor and build your own thing.

1969
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:40,000
So it's kind of something I was doing messing around with on Fortnite trying to trying to get a little more of the creative mode as opposed to like shooting people in alpha because I'm not good.

1970
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:51,000
I'm not good at that part. But anyway. All right. Let's see a deep man says it's also great for data mining exactly what the player base is looking for.

1971
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Very interesting. They can kind of weigh like what selling and what's not interesting because you can't do that with a traditional blue box.

1972
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Frodo swaggin says I wish Rocket League could do that. Well you know if it does very well for Fortnite I'm sure other studios are going to look at that and go I want to do an x ray loot box.

1973
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:20,000
So we'll see. Anyway meanwhile hey remember PUBG. That was the game everybody was talking about before Fortnite and there's still there's still a lot of people playing player unknown battlegrounds.

1974
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I'm being a little silly but I think it's really cool like what PUBG is actually doing. So there's an Xbox one event going on with snow sunglasses and it's a scavenger hunt basically.

1975
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:39,000
So I guess it's a new snow map in player unknown battle. Yeah. So if you are an Xbox one player playing on this map you're doing a scavenger hunt.

1976
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:49,000
So like they're posting a picture like here. And if you respond with a picture of found the spot here it is you go here then the first person upload that screenshot gets a bonus item.

1977
02:25:49,000 --> 02:26:04,000
But you can only get that once the same person and get it every time. And there's actually some real life things you can win to a picnic mat a PUBG logo eco bag and a winner winner chicken leg dinner bag charm whatever that is neat.

1978
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Yeah I think it's I think it's cute. I like that. So I like when they kind of like blend the real world with games and have those kind of like I know they're not offering any of those grease proof controllers or anything anymore.

1979
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Not that I've seen but stay tuned. All right. All right. It's so nice to hear Rob at this from Bobby in our chat.

1980
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:33,000
It's so nice to actually hear Rob say PUBG since he said a year ago that he'd never be able to say it and would always say PUBG.

1981
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I still think the name PUBG is cuter and if it was a game involving pugs would be like super duper cute.

1982
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Somebody posted on my Facebook wall and I think I feel like we talked about this game before but some like shooty game where the cat was the weapon and you would pet the cat to reload.

1983
02:26:49,000 --> 02:27:04,000
It's adorable. I didn't see that. Do you see that like post. So he posted on my Facebook wall. I just assume though the game where a modern cat and the cat reloaded I assumed it was that postal probably with the cat silencer.

1984
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Probably. Hopefully they give away some pugs and the x x ray. I don't see the Xbox pinata the x ray pinata. All right. Anyway let's move on.

1985
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:22,000
We got I think one or two more stories and then we're going to get to discord. So you might want to start lining up in our discord room over in the green room.

1986
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I got to say though if like they had ran you know how they have all those blind bags and stuff at the stores if they offered them in pinata form that might be a little bit more appealing because at least you get to beat the crap out of it first to get you know the

1987
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:45,000
stuff out. It would be fun. All right. So let's talk about sales numbers. So the 2018 MPD numbers are out and they have some more information to share about that.

1988
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:54,000
So they saw I guess we saw three point four billion dollars spent on games hardware and accessories and game cards.

1989
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:12,000
And apparently there was a overall growth of 13 percent over 2017. And then so for hardware Nintendo Switch sold the most in December and generating the highest dollar sales in the month.

1990
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:32,000
And then of course along with that let's see video games hardware sales overall is up eight percent to five point one billion dollars and then software wise seven point one billion dollars across all platforms seven percent growth over the year as well.

1991
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And apparently the highest annual amount since 2012 the top games for 2018 Red Dead Redemption 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and NBA 2K 19.

1992
02:28:48,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Let's see software charts. So for December we had Smash Brothers Ultimate number one Red Dead Redemption 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 4 Battlefield 5.

1993
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Those are top four there that Mario Kart 8 at number six. Still that is a lot Mario Kart 8 at number six Super Mario Party Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Spider-Man.

1994
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Overall of course I mentioned the top three that we had Madden Smash Brothers Ultimate number five for the entire year after one month after one month.

1995
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Spider-Man Far Cry 5 God of War Monster Hunter World and Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

1996
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:40,000
That's pretty good for Monster Hunter being the number nine best selling game all year when I think for a long time they kind of thought the U.S. didn't get it so to speak.

1997
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I think we're going to see more Monster Hunter games in the future.

1998
02:29:44,000 --> 02:30:00,000
In talking a little bit more about Smash so Smash Brothers Ultimate was sold so well that it set a new release month dollar sales record for an exclusive game beating the last previous record holder which was Halo Reach in 2010.

1999
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Well it sounds like Nintendo had a great year but it sounds like a lot of games did very well this year so you know that kind of ties in.

2000
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I think this is a lot of the same report that was in the very first story we talked about tonight.

2001
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:17,000
It was a huge year for gaming period. You know that doesn't really touch on the mobile end of things but still a very very good year.

2002
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:27,000
FertileSwagons in our chat before we get to our last story here says I think Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is going to die. They're not releasing enough content at a good pace.

2003
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Red Dead Redemption 2 is going to have a problem just because with Grand Theft Auto Online there's so much you can do with it like you can just go out and then they've done a lot of that where it's just like wacky shit with it.

2004
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:51,000
They've got like a battle royale mode they have a mode now that's sort of like oh what the hell was it we just talked about it sort of like Rocket League.

2005
02:30:51,000 --> 02:31:03,000
They've got you know all sorts of different modes and like racing and stuff you can do in it but you can't really do that with Red Dead Redemption you're kind of limited to what exactly you can put in the game.

2006
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Like you can't be too weird I think with it and I just don't think we're seeing the appeal that they have with Grand Theft Auto Online. I don't think they're going to get as much of a return on investment they would hopefully get.

2007
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:22,000
I know I'm not really interested in it. I haven't even finished a single player campaign yet.

2008
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Better get to it. Yeah. All right. Well one more story for you guys tonight and this has to do of course. Of course we had to talk about this. I saved it for last but there was a brand new dance dance revolution game announced this week.

2009
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:44,000
So there was a solid gold cabinet. That's right. Solid gold cabinet. It's called DDR Ace 2 0 or a 20 if you want to be very American about it.

2010
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:58,000
A 20. But I guess it's actually pronounced ace 2 0 because last year was ace. So I guess this is ace 2.0 something like that. Anyway lots of people photoshopping the logo to say for 20 because if you look at the logo like you said make one minor little change.

2011
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:08,000
It was like it says DDR for 20 which would be a green cabinet not a gold cabinet. And then I did a really funny tweet. I thought I was being funny or I I photoshopped as bad Photoshop.

2012
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I took out I actually used like the Apple drawing thing on the phone and I took out the two. And so it just says 40. So I said you think I remember what I I tweeted something like bitch I'm too old for DDR.

2013
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:31,000
I am dance dance revolution 40. So is this you know like one of those like it's hard for me to get excited about new DDR games anymore when I'm out of breath after I play Beat Saber.

2014
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Anyway it's not like we have a song list or anything like that it's just that hey the next DDR is a special 20th anniversary edition a shiny gold cabinet cabinet coming soon Japan of course.

2015
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:54,000
You know we'll wait. And it is a different cabinet they have. It's like it's based off of like almost like a dance rush cabinets that they have. So very slim. The arrows are kind of different too.

2016
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:18,000
So instead of the arrows being colored they're all gold and the LED lights underneath are red and blue. And I know that kind of playing that I guess the way they play is a little bit different too because I know that kind of affected some of the perfect attack competition that they're doing that some of the Japanese players are able to adapt to them faster than the U.S. players.

2017
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:30,000
But that was not the only game though that they announced. They have other games too. They have mobile games coming which is kind of neat. So they've got mobile games for sound voltex for BeatMania 2DX and for Dance Dance Revolution.

2018
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And these aren't just like you know the mobile phone games you may be thinking of. They're actual like it's like you plug in your phone or tablet into a TV and they have wireless dance.

2019
02:33:41,000 --> 02:34:00,000
So they're going to be selling brand new soft pads and and for all of those who were growing up with DDR and saw way back in the day when they had on the PlayStation 2 the the arcade style controllers the ones where they're a thousand dollars that you could never touch because you couldn't buy them.

2020
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:10,000
You can only buy them through Konami style or something like that. Well they're going to be selling some of those too. Oh wow. And so they're going to be available for I assume this mobile version as well.

2021
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:23,000
They're also they have Bluetooth controllers as well for the 2DX and I think sound voltex as well. Very I would be so excited if I could play 2DX at home again.

2022
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:32,000
He's so good. But yeah it looks it looks very cool. I saw like some gameplay of 2DX and stuff and you can use a touch screen on there you can also use the wireless controller.

2023
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:42,000
So I'm curious to see how much all that's going to cost. But like here's a here's a picture like of the the actual arcade style controller. You can't say that when I can't show it. Sorry. We're looking at a picture but you can't see it.

2024
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:57,000
But it looks like it's fine. It looks like it looks like a DDR stage like a metal state. It looks like a solo a solo pad sort of with the it looks just like the old arcade style controllers that they had for the PlayStation 2.

2025
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:10,000
It's a metal pad with arcade arcade accurate everything. Although this one doesn't have like on the arcade they actually have like light strips around the whole thing on the bottom which is kind of cool.

2026
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:22,000
But very much like the old PlayStation controllers. But it looks really nice. I have a cabinet so I don't really need this crap anymore. Well we'll see. We'll see what develops to that. I'm excited about that.

2027
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:31,000
You know even if I joke that I am getting old for DDR maybe I just need to play more regularly again and then I could you know get get fit again playing some DDR. That would be very cool.

2028
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:44,000
All right. We are now going to open up the discord channels for your calls. If you missed last week's show and you don't know how the calls work now we said goodbye to Skype and we now open up our discord server for calls.

2029
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:55,000
So here's how it works. And I'm going to explain this a few more weeks and I probably will explain it less and less and refer you guys all to the pin post. But if you want to call into the show you just have to be a member of our discord.

2030
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:05,000
It's it's totally free. You just go to vog network dot com slash discord and you join it just like any other discord server like where your Pokemon people are rating or how you're playing an MMO online or whatever.

2031
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:14,000
And then if you do want to call into the show tonight you go to a channel called the green room and you can sit with some other all our listeners and chat amongst yourselves or test your audio if you want.

2032
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:25,000
But please be nice to and respectful to each other. You can sit in there while you wait for us to pull you in just again due to time due to resources due to me usually preferring people that haven't been on the show before.

2033
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:33,000
I may not get to everybody. Please do not be butthurt if you are not selected for all I try to get a good sampling if you want to increase your chances of getting on.

2034
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Tell us a little bit about what you want to call in about over on our orange lounge radio channel so that I know you're prepared.

2035
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:47,000
All right. Anyhow I think that all being said we're ready to get to some calls and look you didn't get to experience this last time right. This is your first time on discord.

2036
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I haven't been able to experience the wonder that is the wonders. I think the auto quality is a little better. I don't know. We'll see. Anyway let's get to it. We are getting to our first caller tonight.

2037
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.

2038
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Yeah. This is Bellamy. How are you. Hi. Good. Welcome back to all our what's on your mind tonight.

2039
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Well as you can see my one message on discord as I call in about games seemingly being dumbed down.

2040
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:20,000
No gradually over the past decade or so. No I mean.

2041
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Tell us a little more about that. Like yeah obviously the podcast listeners couldn't see your pitch there in the orange on radio channel but yeah I was I was kind of curious what your perspective is on this.

2042
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:36,000
You feel that games in general have been dumbed down in the past few years. Tell me tell me more about that.

2043
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Yeah. All right. Case in point you know most of us have grown up with stuff like this original Nintendo or Super Nintendo stuff like that.

2044
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:52,000
And those games generally speaking have been brutally hard.

2045
02:37:52,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Those games never held your hand. They just gave you a flimsy you know instruction manual.

2046
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:14,000
We said good luck. You know kind of assumed that you're intelligent enough to figure out how to beat the game. I mean you know case in point.

2047
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Sure. Like the old school Mega Man games were very like you really had to memorize patterns to get through those games. It's like I go back and I play them today and they're quite difficult to play those games today.

2048
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Exactly. Now and to cite an example Resident Evil series at least once on the PlayStation 1.

2049
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:50,000
This may not be a great example but it's a little bit more recent.

2050
02:38:51,000 --> 02:39:03,000
In order to save your game you have to use the ink ribbons. Those ink ribbons were in limited supply. So you can spit and the CAs every 30 seconds.

2051
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:12,000
You know now if every point five seconds if you want to. Yeah. Safety heart's desire.

2052
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:19,000
To be fair though wasn't the ink ribbon thing kind of fucking annoying. Like I kind of thought it was annoying even when I was younger and that was first out.

2053
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:32,000
But I mean I get I get it like I get what you're overall trying to say like it feels like you know games were like really really hard and now you know there's a lot of like easy modes and but there's folks in our chat room you know that that kind of like the easy modes.

2054
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Bobby Black Wolf you know he's a fan there. Gally in our chat room over at Twitch TV VOG Network says I play games to relax. So give me easy mode.

2055
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Let's see. Act Def says that's probably why I didn't like Mega Man back in the day. Here's the thing. I mean it seems like I don't know a lot of games that just went like full on easy mode.

2056
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:57,000
I mean maybe they've re approached some of the design things like the ink ribbon concept you gave. But I even think of like let's say OK the old Mega Man games are really hard.

2057
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:06,000
The newer Mega Man games just have a sliding difficulty level. So if you want to play like a really easy level you can do that and you can get through the game and experience the story and all that stuff.

2058
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:12,000
But if you're the type that wants to bang your head on the wall and only have a certain amount of lies we're going to go all the way back to the beginning a level and so forth.

2059
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:21,000
You can kind of do that. So I mean I think that's kind of like where the games right now is that there's a little bit more of a sliding scale and I think I think Metal Mayhem were a lot of that.

2060
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:30,000
A lot of that I think probably has to do with accessibility in some ways. And you know we talked about how gaming was a very and this goes back to the very beginning of the show.

2061
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:39,000
We started at you know 6 o'clock Pacific talking about how you know the gaming industry has grown it's grown and grown and it's a multi-billion dollar industry.

2062
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:46,000
And now we have politicians going on Twitch feeds to talk about Donkey Kong 64 and these sorts of things that were unheard of several years ago.

2063
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:54,000
And I think part of that is because more and more people can understand games and can play games easily.

2064
02:40:54,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Because for some people Rage Nator and I know for like hardcore gamers like you and me this is sometimes a tough concept to grasp.

2065
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:10,000
But like with an Xbox controller if I were to hand I'm pretty sure I did this when I like was showing my mom you know when she was still with us different video games.

2066
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:17,000
She'd be like there's too many buttons on this thing how do you remember what button this is there's so many buttons on this thinking thing right.

2067
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:29,000
That's how a lot of people kind of react to controllers right now you can play so many different types of cell phone games just with your finger just touch doing very intuitive sorts of things.

2068
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:39,000
And I think I kind of think that accessibility and the easiness part I think also opens up games to more people.

2069
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Because there's a lot of video games out there that are very narrative based let's take a game like Mass Effect for example.

2070
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:51,000
That you know what some people don't necessarily want to do pew pew shooty shooty they just want to experience the story well guess what EA wants that money too.

2071
02:41:51,000 --> 02:42:00,000
So there's an easier mode in the game but for those that like the combat and that stuff you do have that more sliding scale level of difficulty I feel like you were going to say something.

2072
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Yeah I was going to say that you know I do I was kind of on on the same side with how you know I feel that a lot of games they had dumbed down but not necessarily done.

2073
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I think it's now that they've added a lot more accessibility this stuff I know with my kids you know trying to get in the games they wouldn't have the patience to play a harder game like that if they kept losing at a game they're just not going to want to play it anymore because you know 5,000 games.

2074
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Well it's just like everybody kind of has like ADD when it comes to like just entertainment in general if you're going to get if something is going to bring you frustration because it's so hard then you're just not gonna play it whereas remember when we started playing games you know a long time ago.

2075
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Arcade games were kind of the thing that was popular and you were used to games being hard because they would eat your quarters and that was the point of the game was to make money for the arcade.

2076
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:58,000
And then you take the home game and it's slightly easier because hey guess what I don't want to keep paying money to play this game.

2077
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Yeah it's insanely hard still and that could be just because they're porting stuff over from the arcade and they didn't change anything or that's just you know the attitude that they had.

2078
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:20,000
They didn't need to you know dumb things down so much but and also controls are a lot more simpler than I think now like with all the accessibility options they have like with some of the Mario games stuff that add this like a little bit easier mode into it.

2079
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I think it does help people you know keeps kids and stuff entertained in the game without getting overly frustrated with it.

2080
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:37,000
And I noticed in our chat room also some folks talking about Celeste. Bobby Blackwolf points out I also like how Celeste handled the assist mode.

2081
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:44,000
They never degraded you for it. They just said here it is. We'd love for you to try to play first without it but we understand that may not be the case. We hope you enjoy our game.

2082
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Here's something else to think about. I'm sorry Metal Mayhem I keep talking and don't let you speak but I'll let you speak out of this.

2083
02:43:49,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Here's something else to think about. Like you know if you take more of the concept of a game anybody can get out there and pick up a basketball and try to throw it in the hoop.

2084
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Anybody can do that. But sometimes the rules get changed a little bit depending on the crowd right. If you have kids playing maybe you won't mind so much if they hold on to the ball and don't constantly dribble it if they do a little bit of traveling.

2085
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:23,000
But you know what. I mean if you want to get elitist about basketball or you know the fact that you know well it takes a long time to get really good at basketball. Yeah it does.

2086
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:34,000
But the mere concept of basketball ball in hoop that's very accessible for everybody but it takes a lot a lot of time a lot a lot of practice to get really really good at basketball.

2087
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:43,000
So you can do those that shit where you fly through the air and do the dunks and all that stuff and get paid millions of dollars to do it in front of an auditorium of screaming fans.

2088
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:59,000
But at the end of the day basketball and pretty much put any physical sport in there is really only limited by the cost to buy a ball to buy the stuff needed to play the game which even then I think some people improvise.

2089
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:08,000
We're going to play basketball but we're going to just do it with this bouncy ball that I just kind of had available. Anyway your thoughts your thoughts on our response middleman.

2090
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Well accessibility is all well and good but you know some sometimes things have been at least in my experience been done for accessibility.

2091
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Yeah. Okay. Take you know you know you know to a large degree like for example you know in some of the Metal Gear Solid games you know you know something in the outside you know you get a bid bid dialogue.

2092
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:51,000
You know the colonel may say ah I see you found this item to use this item. You think push the click button.

2093
02:45:51,000 --> 02:46:01,000
That's just kind of that's also kind of like the game just kind of like giving you a tutorial without that's like a you know a game a game maker and a storyteller can kind of choose.

2094
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Do they want to just have a little pop up menu that comes up and says here's how to control your character use the stick to this.

2095
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Some games do it that way but some games kind of choose to do it in a very like tongue in cheek way where they have the characters explain it to you.

2096
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:21,000
And that's just that's just kind of like a narrative choice on the part of the developers. Anyway Metal Mayhem great topic and great question.

2097
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:31,000
I am going to let you go so we can get some more calls tonight. But thank you very much. I thought that was a good discussion if nothing else on accessibility and games and the difficulty and all that and kind of where we come.

2098
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Here for next night. Yeah you too. Take care buddy.

2099
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:44,000
All right. Again if you would like to call into Orange Lawns Radio join our discord and you sit there in the green room channel which is only one person in there now.

2100
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:53,000
There's about to be zero and you can give us a call. It really does help to to tell us a little bit about what you want to talk about tonight down in our Orange Lawns Radio channel on discord.

2101
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:57,000
But for now let's get to another call. Hi you are on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this.

2102
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Hey what's going on. It's Ron. Hey Ron. It's always good to hear from you. What's on your mind tonight.

2103
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Oh some stuff besides the fact that I rebuilt my computer in two hours today. That was kind of fun. Hey I was seeing you chat about some of that earlier in the chat room.

2104
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Congrats on that. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. It was like it happened Thursday night. I'm like go out buy a new power supply to get it working.

2105
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Didn't work. Talk to one of my staffers and we got my rebuild going showed up yesterday. I came home from my trip put it together.

2106
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:38,000
I'm more happy about the fact that I did not have to reinstall windows or any other application but that's not why I call.

2107
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Some people speed run video games you speed run computer building and that's fine. All right. No. In all seriousness what's on your mind tonight.

2108
02:47:47,000 --> 02:48:06,000
In response to earlier talking about cable and and digital streaming services. I pay one hundred and thirty five dollars a month for files and that's for their near extreme package that I've been grandfathered in and a one hundred one hundred megabit connection.

2109
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:22,000
And sometimes I look at the stuff that I DVR and I'm like do I really need half these channels. But then I realize if I change those channels I'll lose my HBO and my Showtime that I will watch maybe four or five times out of the year.

2110
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:45,000
And it's like I kind of want to cut that down because we're kind of getting to the point where cable providers just need to offer you the base package with some base programming and your choice of like four different streaming services you can add to your bill for like a hundred bucks a month. You know it's crazy.

2111
02:48:46,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I'm also typing with our multitask typing with our twitch room. But yeah. No. No. I was worried about the echo factor. I'm just like I just rebuilt this machine. We can't happen. No no no. We hear you fine. You're you're you're totally good.

2112
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Sweet. Yeah. You it's I mean even like HBO. I mean HBO is kind of selling their own online service too right. Yeah. But here's the thing.

2113
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:30,000
You can get all of HBO's content and I believe access to the state channels for like 17 bucks a month or you could probably pay a few dollars less a month and get through your cable provider and just add the app because the app is so different from the streaming service.

2114
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:42,000
It's the same thing. And sometimes if you're lucky providers will tell you like for like 20 bucks a month pick three premium movie packages and it's like you can't go wrong with that. You know.

2115
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Yeah. I do want to warn you buddy. The echo is back a little bit. You know we are hearing ourselves that go through. So you're going to have some more troubleshooting to do maybe and some testing. Sorry buddy.

2116
02:49:53,000 --> 02:50:06,000
I'll have to try another USB port on my machine. My apologies. No it's fine. It happens. That's what that's what happens anyway. But I am going to let you go for now. Everybody I hope we'll check out anime jam session on Tuesday nights here at Vogue Network.

2117
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. Take care buddy. Bye bye. All right. And that is that's everybody that wanted to call in so far. I'll give it a couple more minutes to see if anybody else calls in. But do you have any last minute stories of the things you want to get to right now.

2118
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Real quick. Yeah there is over 500 games on backwards compatibility for Xbox One now. Nice nice milestone that they've hit and they're saying that 538 titles and holy moly.

2119
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Yes. They said currently only 33 original Xbox games are backwards compatible. Hey better than zero. This is true.

2120
02:50:46,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I was trying to see if they had like a count of four of the most popular games on there but I don't see it. That's too bad. Oh yeah. That'd be cool to know like which games are being backwards compatible played the most. I bet like the original Red Dead Redemption is way up there.

2121
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Probably oblivion. Oh here we go. Here's a breakdown. Let's see. They actually have some numbers. Yes. The top most requested. Oh this is the most requested titles by votes. Black Ops 2 Red Dead Redemption Elder Scrolls Skyrim mostly Call of Duty so Modern Warfare 2 Modern Warfare Modern Warfare 3 World of War Mass Effect 3 Fallout New Vegas.

2122
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:41,000
I thought the trilogy was the whole trilogy was playable on backwards compatibility. These are the most requested tiles by 2015. Oh that's old numbers franchises fully playable on Xbox One backwards compatibility just cause mass effect.

2123
02:51:42,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Bioshock. Let's see here. Saints bro. Hey you know you got to get Microsoft credit. That's and as Bobby points out in chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network. Do you have to rebuy all any of them if you own the original discs. No you do not. Yeah it's pretty awesome. Yeah very awesome.

2124
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I hope if Microsoft can kind of keep that messaging going into their next console they're going to win a lot of fans. We'll see. Yep. It would be great if Microsoft could be like hey because of trademark law and patents the time on the original PlayStation hardware has run out.

2125
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:36,000
So the new Xbox will let you play PlayStation 1 games. I'm totally fan faking. It's not serious. But why don't they sell those we blame now. They sell those like fakie Nintendo Super Nintendo 5 or they sell those like fries and you know pretty soon people are going to be able to do that with original PlayStation.

2126
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:51,000
So it'd be hilarious if Xbox are we getting. Are we going to have a soldier boy Microsoft collab here. Is that what we're doing. Let's hope not. All right. I'm so sorry I even suggested it. Anything else for last minute stories.

2127
02:52:52,000 --> 02:53:04,000
There was it looks like a mod that's being worked on that's trying to put legends all that into doom. Yeah I kind of saw it reminded me of when somebody tried to go the V.R. route with you. Yeah it's like three.

2128
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:16,000
And I was like some things just don't need to be done. No it it does look cool though. But if I remember right. Didn't the guy like he started it but he's not able to finish it. So he's kind of like here's everything I've got. Hope somebody else will pick it up and finish it.

2129
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Yeah. So he's released it. It's a Zelda slash Doom mod that's on mod DB. You can go check it out if you want to look at it or finish it or whatever. All right. Well it doesn't look like we're getting any other callers in tonight.

2130
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:43,000
So I think we will go ahead and kind of wrap up here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight. So I do want to really thank you guys for listening to the show tonight whether you're watching us live over on our twitch TV vogue network channel or if you were downloading the podcast and listening to this.

2131
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:54,000
And if you've just found the show tonight randomly on Twitch remember we have a whole back library of episodes available in all your favorite podcast places like iTunes and Google Play probably being the two big ones.

2132
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:59,000
So if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio we certainly appreciate all the follows and the biddies and all that good stuff.

2133
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:04,000
But we really appreciate if you tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2134
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:18,000
But we can only have those voices. So many of them heard unless we get more people here. So you could tell a friend and that goes a nice long way a little a tweet or a five star recommendation on a place like iTunes goes a very very long way.

2135
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Loki great to have you back this week. We missed you this week. But hey everybody needs a Disneyland vacation once in a while or some type of vacation. It's been a long time it's been like eight years.

2136
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Yes sir. You know more than eight nine years actually. So do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight. My final thought is I'm going to try to stream more this week. I know I've been kind of slacking on it but it's been it's been like a combination between just I just don't want to do it at this time or fighting with hardware because like it seems like every time I go to streams like something else is broken.

2137
02:54:51,000 --> 02:55:11,000
What is it going to be today. I haven't streamed in like two weeks. Most of my energy and time has been going into this. I have my I've been neglecting my personal stream so I really want to get back. But then then Bobby and I are chatting off the side and it's like what if we did this new thing and that new thing and I'm like it's going to be a long time before I get back to my personal channel.

2138
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:33,000
But really exciting stuff on the horizon. It's not a bad thing. Still trying to get affiliate. Haven't quite hit that yet. What are you missing the followers. I'm probably missing everything. I don't know. Just keep keep at it. You'll get there. I don't know. But yeah it's just still not quite there. I definitely don't have the followers yet. I'm just trying to see if I can even see where I'm at here.

2139
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:55,000
I think if you go to the either act stream summary I think is where it see stream summary and analyze that's where you can see on the right side. There should be a section that says path to affiliate. You guys probably scroll down. You're not going to see it yet. Let's see. Maybe not. I know. I know it's somewhere here. Maybe in the very channel here. Oh here we go. Analytics channel.

2140
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Anyway we don't want to bore the listeners. We've got to wrap up. Not there yet. So you'll get you'll get there. Just keep at it. Keep at it. You your setup is great as more people discover you. I think you'll you'll have more of a base watch in the DDR stuff especially because it's classic stuff. Anyway my final thought tonight is I'm going to play some more Beat Saber and clear some more songs because I had a lot of fun doing that. That was my way of getting some exercise this week. I also still need to come cameo at your house and on your stream. That's still a thing we need to set up. Yeah we do need to talk about that. So maybe we'll try to make that happen.

2141
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:41,000
This week or next. So anyway thanks again for listening to or watching orange entree or whatever the case may be. We'll be back in seven days to do all over again. I know next week is Super Bowl Sunday so a lot of you are going to be preoccupied but we will be here because I don't really have a say in football.

2142
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:52,000
I don't even know who's doing the halftime show this year. Sometimes I get excited about the concert. I don't even know who's playing this year and the commercials they're all posted the day before at this point. So I'm kind of like whatever on Super Bowl.

2143
02:56:53,000 --> 02:57:05,000
So we'll be here and Loki I know you're not really a football watcher so you will you'll be here too. So I'm so yeah I need I'm at 40 followers. I don't have I need 10 more followers to do that.

2144
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:17,000
And then an average of three viewers in the last three days I'm averaging two and then any more chatters. So we're almost get there. I don't care. Whatever it's fine.

2145
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:29,000
You'll get there. All right. Oh they say in chat Maroon 5. Oh I didn't realize. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever they do will be all right anyway. Sorry to the Maroon 5 fans out there anyway. We'll be here Sunday Bobby will not be here.

2146
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:43,000
He does a big like gathering. It's a big day for him and his friends which is the case for a lot of you will still be here producing a new show if you can't be here. We hope you will be here live. But if you can't be here live of course check the podcast feed next week or for those of you that subscribe to our twitch channels.
