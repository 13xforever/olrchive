Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Are you ready for competitive farming? Well then, let's get ready to tractor!

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
We're mowing through this and more in the week's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 761 of our show for this January the 27th of 2019.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Robertson joining me here in studio. Techmaster Loki's back. Hey, I'm back. Hey, good to have you back.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
Yes, it's good to be back. So what I know a lot of people want to know about is the kind of conclusion to the broccoli farm saga.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
Because you told the kids, for those that are new to Orange Lounge Radio, you had talked a few weeks ago about how you planned this trip to Disneyland a couple months ago.

01:06.000 --> 01:16.000
But you told the kids you were going to be taking them to the broccoli farm. You didn't tell them Christmas Day, you didn't tell them on Hanukkah, you didn't even tell them on the car ride down, did you?

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
No, well we told them that they weren't going to a broccoli farm, but we just didn't. This is all why Loki wasn't here last week.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
So if you watched last week's show, you saw Alan was here, Dar Sager was in the studio, but you weren't because you were finally taking the big broccoli farm trip.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Yes, so we didn't tell them where they're going. In fact, we actually got to the place we were going to the place we were staying.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
We didn't tell them, and they went upstairs and they put their stuff away, and then finally we had them come downstairs and there was,

01:44.000 --> 01:55.000
it was like a, not an envelope, but there was like a picture, like they had set up something for my son's birthday, you know, basically saying,

01:55.000 --> 02:04.000
you know, hey, I hope you guys have fun, stuff like that, happy birthday. And so we were asking them like, so where is it that you think you're going?

02:04.000 --> 02:16.000
You know, we're not going to a broccoli farm, so where is it that we're going? And they're like, I don't know, my wife's like, well look around the room,

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
look around, what do you see, you know, where do you think that you are right now? And so they saw like some of the Disneyland stuff.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Knott's Berry Farm?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
They don't know what Knott's Berry Farm is, come on.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Nobody does.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
Um, so we're going to Disneyland, so they, you know, they got pretty excited about, actually mildly excited, I don't know if they were like super excited,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
like, you know, we have it recorded.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, I was just, your wife posted a video, I didn't want to share the video because that's your personal business.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Oh, I don't care, yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.000
But, um, so, uh, but what I, I, I was watching the video and, um, I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted because Smoosh just walked into the studio.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
I don't know what he's doing tonight, he's probably, he's looking for the plug, he's probably going to unplug it, oh boy.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
Alright, well anyway, um, so I saw the video and my favorite part of the video was that, yeah, you know, the boys are like, you know, they're kind of excited for a minute,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
and then your oldest kind of goes, yeah, but what about the toilet? And then it cuts off.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Because I guess, I don't know if there was something with the bathroom or what the deal was.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Because he had used the bathroom and the toilet was still running for some reason.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
It was just one of those, like, the, the, the water, something you don't push the handle all the way.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
It, it's just like, it just, yeah, it, it stuck running a lot, um, but that was apparently very distracting for him.

03:29.000 --> 03:38.000
But no, they, they had, they had fun, and it was funny because, like, we were trying to get them ready for bed and then they started launching fireworks for their nightly show,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
and so, you know, they got to see that the first day, which was pretty cool, yeah.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
Great. So the family have, I know we are a video game podcast, I promise we're gonna get to games, but, you know, this is, this is the conclusion of a weeks-long saga here.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Did the kids have a good time at Disneyland?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, they had a great time at Disneyland. Um, my, uh,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
What a dumb question, right?

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, uh, Josh went on, like, all of the roller coasters and stuff. My youngest son, Danny, was a little bit more cautious.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
He went on Thunder Mountain once, and then we took him on it again the second time at night, and it's harder to see the turns at night, so he didn't like it.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
So Danny got your feelings on roller coasters.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, I, I got over my fear of roller coasters pretty quick after,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Was there anything you wanted to ride?

04:17.000 --> 04:27.000
I, I went on Thunder Mountain a few times, um, and I got to do Star Tours. See, the first time I went on Star Tours, or the only time I went on Star Tours was, like, back when the original Star Tours opened,

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
and so, that made me, that made me pretty motion sick, you know, the first time.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
But the new Star Tours is pretty awesome. You don't get motion sick in that, and it's, it's awesome.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
So that was, uh, my youngest son's favorite ride was going on that, so we went on Star Tours, like, five or six times.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Did you go, I would say the craziest ride there is California, oh wait, um, Incredible Coaster, or whatever?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Incredible Coaster, yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Did you go on that?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
My wife went on that. I didn't go on that.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Okay.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Uh,

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
We'll give her her.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You saw the loop? You saw the loop?

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
Not the loop, it's just how fast it goes. I, I, like, I probably could do it, but I just don't want to.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Did you do the, um, Radiator Springs, the cars?

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh yeah, see, see, we tricked our, our youngest son, cause he didn't want to, he's like, is this as fast as, uh, Thunder Mountain?

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm like, no, no, it's not as fast, and I'm looking at it, and it just goes by, I'm like, this is much faster.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
You're tricking the child and yourself.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
This is much faster. No, I was like, I thought it would be fine, but like, it went pretty fast, so like, I, I was trying to tell him, like, yeah, it'll be fine.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
He's like, is it going to go fast now?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
You were driving faster down the freeway.

05:32.000 --> 05:44.000
Exactly, we were driving faster down the freeway, but, uh, no, and, and there was a bit of drama, so like, we had three days, and, and we were coming home, and he gets car sick, and so he throws up in the car, so that was fun.

05:45.000 --> 05:56.000
Um, yeah, um, it was just because he was doing, like, his tablet and stuff while he was in the car, so, which is weird, though, cause he did it all the way down, but, I don't know, for some reason, something was bothering him.

05:56.000 --> 06:05.000
Um, but, yeah, we had a lot of fun, we, um, ate at the, they had food trucks down in downtown Disney a few times, so we ate the dumpling food truck a few times.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh, yeah, cause probably the food truck's probably cheaper than most of the stuff that's in the parks.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, a lot of it.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Thank you.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
All right.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It's way too damn expensive.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Look, we could do a full Disney podcast, but it is a video game podcast.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Let me ask this real quick, though, before we get into the kickoff topic for tonight.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Um, did you, um, get to, uh, do any gaming at Disney?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
No, I, I didn't.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
I, Stark, the, uh, was it a Starkade, or whatever they call it?

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
It closes at 4.30, so anytime I got over to Tomorrowland, it was already closed.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Wow, I wonder why so early?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I don't know, but it, it closes, I think, at 4.30.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Every time I got there, the doors were closed.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
The neon sign's still there, but the doors are closed.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah, the neon sign's kind of iconic, yeah.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, so I don't know if it was open earlier in the morning.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I didn't notice it, but I didn't get a chance to actually go there and do that.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And they also have, like, some VR.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
It was not really, like, it's VR, but it's VR with, like, wireless, uh, backpacks and everything.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
It's almost, like, not, sort of like laser tag, but not, you're just playing, I guess, against the computer or something like that.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
But you're basically free to move around, like, a whole arena type thing.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
So they have that with, like, Star Wars and something else.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I wanted to try that, but I didn't get a chance to do that.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
And I also didn't get a chance to, because we were just getting back too late each night, to go down to round one to play anything, so.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh, bummer.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Um, yeah, I just, I couldn't do it.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Family was more important, so I'm glad you guys had a good trip.

07:28.000 --> 07:38.000
Alright, real quick, it got brought up in our chat room, because we do tape live at Twitch TV every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blockwolf show at the VOG Network Twitch channel.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
And by the way, guys, pour one out for the radio feed.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
It's, uh, it's, uh, if it's not gone as of now, it's going to be gone tomorrow.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
The official cancellation went through, so, uh, just, uh, yeah, it's all, it's all about, uh, Twitch and the continued distribution of our, our other shows that we network with, um, through their, uh, various podcasts.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
But, uh, pour one out for the radio feed tonight, guys.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
Um, but, uh, we are, of course, it's all about Twitch now, uh, for the live stuff, which is over at our Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
VOG Network, the voice of geeks network.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So, uh, big question we're getting in the chat.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Space Mountain.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Did you brave that one?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Can't see that one.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Um, I didn't go on Space Mountain.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Um, my, my oldest son and my wife did, though.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Um, I've been on Space Mountain before, so that was fine.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Um, I just, because my youngest son wouldn't go on anything, I was stuck going on there.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
And my wife's like, well, you sure you want, you know, I could, you can go on with, you know, Josh or I can, but she likes roller coasters more than I do.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
So I'm like, you, you just go, I'll just stay here with him and I'll go on whatever he wants to go on.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
So, um, like, you know, Winnie the Pooh and, uh, we went on Star Tours like a bunch of times, but like, and that was fine.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Um, but yeah, I mean, they went, she went on Matterhorn and it's like, I mean, they give you an idea how long it's been.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
Like when I went on Matterhorn last time, it was like, you had to pretty much sit in each other's laps as you go in there.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Now it's all completely different.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
They made it single rider.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, so it's, um.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
We're going down the Disneyland path again.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Sorry.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
It's all right. I can talk about Disneyland for three hours too, but we do want to get into, uh, some gaming tonight.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
We'll switch to the food then because Dole Whip, fucking awesome.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You know, love Dole Whips.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And then, um, did you get the bacon one that's limited time?

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
No, they didn't have that there, but they also had, uh, the food is a lot better there from what I remember.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Cause before it used to be like the same shit in every single like spot.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
They always have just like burgers and whatever, but now it's actually pretty good.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Um, and then the ice cream place.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
All right. Well, since you're talking about entertainment, it does kind of tie into our kickoff topic tonight.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
I got to admit it's, I feel like overall, it's been a little bit of a slower news week, so I don't have something that's like a deep dive on an actual like gaming topic.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
But I mean, well it is, but it's not like about a game, a specific game or an event or something.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
It's more kind of about where the industry is at, a kind of a state of the industry sort of thing.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Because, um, there's an article that went out this last week, uh, that actually came from Variety.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Variety is a little bit more of a magazine that focuses.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Well, it's what is newspaper magazine on? It's like a weekly publication.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Of course they have the online presence as well.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
And I'm sure Bobby's already talking in chat.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
He was quoted or he was, he was identified.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And yeah, he wants, he has an article there.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
But, uh, all that aside, um, they're usually more focused on like the movie industry.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You talk about like that end of the entertainment industry.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm sure they're talking about what's going on on TV and things like that.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
With the, that being the Oscars season, they talk a lot about that.

10:28.000 --> 10:38.000
A lot of the movie studios that actually want to run those four-year consideration campaigns on why a star is born should win Best Picture or Glenn Close should win Best Actress or whatever.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm barely following it this year.

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
But, um, those ads run in Variety because a lot of trade people, uh, from the entertainment industry that do that magazine.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
So the whole reason I'm setting that up is because Variety ran a pretty big piece on gaming this week.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And the state of the gaming industry.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
So they, um, ran an article with the line, uh, headline.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
Americans spent more than 43 billion, with a B, on video games in 2018.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Now this all ties into now that we're getting towards the end of January.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
We're getting our couple weeks delayed numbers from December from the MPD group and all that, right?

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
And I think we have a story later on about some of those specific sales.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
But we can kind of talk in general about what, you know, those results are saying.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Is that the gaming industry, if you didn't already know, is a pretty big deal.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Wow, 43 billion dollars.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So I guess we don't need to do any more loot boxes or anything, right?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Because they've made enough money, right?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Some of that might have come from loot boxes.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
Anyway, it is a record-breaking 43.4 billion in revenue that they made in 2018.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
That is through the Entertainment Software Association and the MPD group.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
That is a 18% growth from 36.9 billion in 2017.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
So put those two numbers side by side.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I mean, I know you joke about loot boxes, but love them or hate them.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
That's probably part of it.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Well, and it's only going to get worse, and here's why.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Because, you know, this type of growth is not sustainable.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
And so this is where you get, you know, the next year, we're going to have layoffs,

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
and you're going to see more of this bullshit that they're going to try to monetize things,

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
like every which way, because they're trying to sustain that growth, which is just not sustainable.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
Well, let's see. Let's continue on some of the places that these numbers come from.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Hardware revenue was up 15%, so there's that.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I mean, you could attribute some of that to Nintendo Switch and the success there and so forth.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
Software sales, physical and digital, in-game purchases, subscriptions, 18% growth.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
A comment from President and CEO Stanley Pierre Lewis, the ESA.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
The impressive economic growth of the industry announced today parallels the growth of the industry

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
in mainstream American culture.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Across the nation, we count people of all backgrounds and stages of life

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
among our most passionate video game players and fans.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Interactive entertainment stands today as the most influential form of entertainment in America.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
So with that quote, kind of attributing a lot of that growth to,

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
hey, it's not just a teenage boys in their basement type of thing anymore.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
It never really was. I know we all know that.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
But now it's, you know, much more mainstream with men, women, young, older, everything.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
And yes, Gen X2, there's all those articles about millennials versus baby boomers.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
But yes, Gen X2 is playing video games as well.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So everybody's playing video games is really a big part of that.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
So of course 2018, record setting year.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
There was another quote here I want to make sure we talk about too, which is mobile games.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
The number of mobile game players in North America, an increase of 5% over the prior year.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
This is the number they report.

13:42.000 --> 13:50.000
Of the 283.1 million mobile users in the U.S. and Canada, 210.9 million are gamers.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
Another quote from games industry analyst with the MPD group, Matt Piscatella.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Mobile gaming reviews have continued to grow in the U.S. and Canada,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
and it now represents the largest segment within the gaming marketplace.

14:02.000 --> 14:09.000
60% of Americans and Canadians play mobile games because of the rich library of content available.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
Mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I almost said cache of clans, but that...

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
That would still be accurate.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Pokemon Go, which obviously we talked a little bit about that game here on the show before.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Roblox. I always forget what a big game Roblox is.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
It is a huge game.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
He has a huge game. Tons of kids.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Like tweens, I guess maybe.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Like in that kind of like, maybe just a little older from where your kids are at,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
but younger than like 18 too.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I think Roblox is like really big with that set.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
This is what I've heard.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I have friends that are like, yeah, my kids play it.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah, my kids play it.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Do they play Roblox?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Well, my oldest son plays it.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Okay, so then right about in that area.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
Fortnite, of course, and that's probably a big one to attribute to a lot of people.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
I swear to God, when we do get him on the show eventually, and it's gonna happen again,

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
the dude, he is fucking flossing all of the goddamn time.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
And not his teeth.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
All of the time.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
Just flossing like all, just like randomly just, I'm bored, I'm gonna start flossing.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
This is all of the time.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And no, I'm not doing it again.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
And I have pictures too, like we took pictures.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Save those for the yearbook when he's 18.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
We took a picture, I should have taken a video, but we took a picture when we were waiting for my wife to go on the Incredicoaster.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
They had, you know, Mr. Incredible there.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And so, you know, they took pictures with him.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
And what's he start doing?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
He starts flossing.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Again.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm like, why are you doing that?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
He's like, I don't know.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Maybe the kid's gonna be a dancer.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
I don't know.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Anyway, so Slottomania, the other one, I don't even know what the hell that is.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
But anyway, among many others are examples of the breadth and depth of engaging experiences available on mobile platforms.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
So it is interesting to note that they didn't talk about loot boxes there.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Of course not.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
It seems like in here, what I'm kind of getting from this article is that, and maybe your interpretation is different,

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
but what I'm kind of getting from that is that they are attributing a lot of this growth to the fact that more people are playing games at the end of the day.

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
More people that own mobile phones are playing games because you've got these mobile games that are just getting bigger and bigger between Pokémon Go and Fortnite, Roblox, everything I just named there and more.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's really causing that industry to grow.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Right.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah.

16:24.000 --> 16:33.000
So, I mean, so the gaming industry is, you know, it's interesting because you and I remember in our lifetimes when the gaming industry was a very like niche thing.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
People didn't talk about games.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
People past a certain age usually didn't understand what video gaming was all about unless they were like in the industry that made them.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
Now, we're talking about an industry that is getting very competitive with, if not exceeding in some ways, the movie industry.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I don't know how much the movie industry made it last year.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm pretty sure it has exceeded the movie industry.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
I think it has in some metrics, maybe not in others, but I mean that's, I'll let Variety magazine hammer out those specifics.

16:58.000 --> 17:07.000
The reality is as an art form, gaming is on a level certainly with movies and, you know, everybody knows what a movie is.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Everybody knows what a TV show is.

17:09.000 --> 17:18.000
Heck, you know, I notice that our numbers for people watching on Twitch tonight probably a little bit lower and that's because, that's fine, but that's probably because of like TV stuff because you've got the,

17:18.000 --> 17:28.000
and don't go switching the channel, but you've got the rent live thing going on which, you know, well traditional TV in some ways is super hurting.

17:28.000 --> 17:39.000
Not to get too much on a tangent, but traditional TV networks like your ABC, CBS, NBC and all that stuff is hurting a lot because of gaming, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Because more people are turning to gaming for their entertainment, right?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
That's part of the Fortnite, things like that.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
And certainly cable, there's so many cable networks.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
There's that kind of in between, things like Twitch and what you're doing right now by participating with our show.

17:54.000 --> 18:05.000
You're opting instead to watch Twitch and us, thank you for that by the way, as opposed to watching Rent Live or the SAG Awards I think are tonight or I think there's a big baseball game going on.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
There's a variety of those.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
Those award shows, honestly, folks, I mean, just wait for the next day when they clip all the good stuff out and you have your list of winners.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Do you really need to watch the whole thing live?

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
That's how I feel, but then when it comes to things like sports, like even though I don't watch sports, I totally understand why other people want to be their life.

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
But my point was is that a lot of like the old school networks are really making their, like where they're going now to kind of compete with streaming and that other stuff.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
You get this huge focus on live stuff.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
I think that's why you're seeing more musicals that are being done in prime time.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
Like, you know, you've got the rent thing going on tonight, although plot twist, I hear it's not actually live.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
They ended up running a tape.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
They they ran the dress rehearsal as if it's live because one of the lead actors like rolled his ankle earlier today.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
No, make him do it with the rolling.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah, we're doing it live.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
It's going to be live.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
That's why I thought you had understudies, but that's a whole nother fight.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Fine. They're running the dress rehearsal instead.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So there's all that.

19:04.000 --> 19:16.000
But then like things like, you know, like the celebrity big brother and those that, you know, that's more live stuff and sports like it's very hard to compete with sports because sports is, you know, also like a live presentation and all that.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
And many people get very excited about the sports stuff still.

19:19.000 --> 19:31.000
So, yeah, it's just I know it's just it's just interesting to see like these things growing while these other industries that probably thought they were going to be around forever are like having to adapt or die.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
I think there's a very distinct possibility within our lifetimes.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
The next, you know, before we're like too old, but I would say before Medicare, before we're 65, I would say there's a really good chance.

19:41.000 --> 19:51.000
NBC, CBS, ABC or Fox, one of them goes under or complete or I should say completely transforms from what we know it as today.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Like maybe goes completely online and there's no more broadcast TV.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I don't know, but that's maybe that's a whole nother thing.

19:56.000 --> 20:08.000
I mean, ABC knows could be anything. So and I guess, you know, one of the things it should be worth saying, one other thing that I think these or these networks do pretty decently is local coverage.

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
Like, you know, you know, even though our show is based in Sacramento, we're not really like we're not like focused on that.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
We're a worldwide gaming show. So we talk about gaming everywhere so that we can get listeners from all all different parts of the globe.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
But that's not maybe the same outlook that TV networks have on it.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Also, I don't pay attention enough to what's going on in our area anyways.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
Actually, the thing about that the other day, I was like driving by a golf land.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
I was like, what if there's any other arcades out here?

20:35.000 --> 20:42.000
You know, because I remember before, like we used to go try to scout arcades like, oh, which one has like this mix of DDR, you know, the play and stuff.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
And now it's like, I don't even know. I know where there is an arcade.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
I couldn't tell you which ones have DDR in them.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Well, I I could tell you off air. I don't get it. I want to get a local.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
Right. I am the same for ninety nine point nine percent of listeners. They don't care where the DDR machines are right in your garage.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
That's the one you need to know about going to our chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
Quest Buster in chat says even Netflix admitted that one of their biggest competitors was Fortnite.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
And, you know, but the bubble is going to burst on Fortnite someday.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
You know, there's always that kind of like game darling that seems to like be all what the mainstream is all about and obsessed with.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
And then eventually it just kind of fades to the next big thing.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Like I kind of feel like not everybody's going to agree. And that's fine.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Maybe be a voice and chat if you strongly disagree. But I kind of feel like Minecraft.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
I don't say Minecraft's dead. I'm not saying Minecraft's dead. But Minecraft peaked.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
Like Minecraft is not where it was a couple of years ago before Fortnite.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
You know, Five Nights at Freddy, you know, with all the stuff that they sell at Target and all those stores.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
You know, again, I kind of think the fever pitch of that kind of peaked a little while ago.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
I might come back with the movie or if, you know, the guy decides to release a new game or I do want to see a movie.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
I don't really care for the series, but a movie. I think a movie would be awesome.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah, I would love to see that. But anyway, and then Bobby Blackall says it was Minecraft before Fortnite.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
And then what? What before Minecraft? I can't even remember that far back. Maybe.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
I don't know. I don't know if there was a game that especially talking about, you know, what the variety article gets into with growing.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
Who is playing games? Because Minecraft was really big at attracting Warcraft audience or Warcraft.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
Maybe are like every quest is. I don't even know the MMO MMOs in general.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Maybe I might go with that anyway. Let's see.

22:32.000 --> 22:39.000
Quest Buster with another great comment saying Microsoft may have missed on their initial messaging for the Xbox one,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
but they weren't wrong about where the living room was headed digitally.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
And he has a very smart comment because it's absolutely right.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
Like for all the crap that Microsoft got with the Xbox ones launch,

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
they weren't wrong on some of the things they were predicting. They really, really were not wrong.

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
But it's a couple key decisions and ultimately messaging that really tanked that whole thing for them.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
You know, again, I really think and I'm sure many of you view it the same way, and I'm not talking bad about the Xbox one.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
It's a fine system. But I think in many ways, we're in kind of like a flip flop of where we were last gen,

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
where PlayStation three really missed the mark on the messaging and then kind of had to play catch up.

23:20.000 --> 23:29.000
And eventually they caught up. And I kind of feel like Microsoft's kind of been in the flip side of that ever since that all went down a couple of years ago when it was first announced.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
Well, it's going to be, I would think, a pretty even playing field, though, when we come to the next generation of consoles,

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
because I don't know, I don't have a ton of goodwill for Sony right now.

23:40.000 --> 23:47.000
I mean, it's just the way they're treating their customers and all the mod support and backwards compatibility and that kind of stuff.

23:47.000 --> 23:54.000
It kind of sucks because like like I was even, well, I guess I'll get into it later in my gaming week.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
And so I actually dug out my PlayStation two to try to mess with that.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
But like it'd be much easier if we had that backwards compatibility support on a PlayStation four.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
I guess my PlayStation three could do it because I have an original PlayStation three, but it's still pain in the ass.

24:12.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. One other comment I want to address here before we start to get into some of the other stories tonight in our gaming weeks.

24:19.000 --> 24:28.000
Black Mamba 1977 in chat at Vogue Network on Twitch says cable is getting less and less views because everything is going digital, too.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
That's I think that's a huge point as well. Like I was randomly watching. And this is a funny thing now.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Do you know where I watch cable more than anything now? I don't watch it on my TV.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
I'm watching it now on my second monitor because they do the whole streaming, even like stream cable now, basically.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
And then I'm playing a game on my first monitor. But I was watching a cable network. I was watching Pop, I think.

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
And they were showing reruns of House. And it looks like garbage because, you know, there's only so many HD cable networks and the other ones are standard def.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
And they look terrible because it's like standard def. But with the black bars, because the original was in HD.

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
So it's like and it's all like here's the best part, like, you know, because I have Comcast and Comcast charges you more money.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
If you want HD channels, you have to pay for an HD tuner, which costs fourteen ninety nine a month.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
So I say fuck you. And I just stream all your shit through the other apps. And guess what?

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
It's in fucking HD and I'm not paying you any additional money and I get to watch it all when I want.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
You showed them. All right. But anyway, my point is, is that but there's so much digital.

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
And now you see some of these networks going digital like CBS, you know, CBS with their all access.

25:40.000 --> 25:48.000
As much as people really hate that because they feel like, oh, I'm paying to play or excuse me, I'm paying to just watch Star Trek.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
And there's not a lot of other offerings. You know, they don't compete with Netflix right now, even though the new Star Trek is great, just saying.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
But do you have to pay for all access, even if you have like you can't link it to your cable subscription to like watch that?

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
No, it's it's a premium like that. I know. I know. But again, that's what piracy is for.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
They they looped in like the big brother feeds and all that. There's other stuff besides Star Trek.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
I guess a good fight. And, you know, they're trying. There's the the Twilight Zone reboot.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
But anyway, my point is, oh, those have doesn't have like Neil Patrick Harris or someone or who Jordan Peele is to reveal.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
Oh, starring in it. He's like producing it. I'd watch them get out.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah, I'm very interested in that, too. But anyway, this is a TV show.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
But here's the other thing about the CBS all access thing is that when you have it and you're, you know, paying for the Star Trek and everything,

26:34.000 --> 26:42.000
you can also tune in to through the app, your local CBS station or like CBS's subsidiary.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Like they have a sports channel, a weather channel, those types of things. Maybe it's entertainment. I don't know.

26:46.000 --> 26:54.000
But anyway, my point is, it's kind of going around Comcast in a way. CBS is selling that direct to you through their all access.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
And I wonder if Comcast, the reason why they're nickel and diming all these other places, because they're in.

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
And you notice, like a company like Comcast really is trying to sell the phone line, the home security there.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
They're not focused so much anymore. They really need to cut off the phone line. No one fucking wants landline.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
You know, there is if people are buying it, they're going to try to keep selling.

27:16.000 --> 27:25.000
But the point is, they're doing that stuff because they can see what's happening is that the future of TV might be these providers that are going around.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
Traditional television. Anyway, I'm sorry. We got a little off the topic about video games, but I think at the end of the day, honestly,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I mean, as much as you might kind of roll your eyes and say, I thought it was a gaming show.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
I kind of think it does all tie together because you're going back to the story, you know, because of the growth of the gaming industry,

27:41.000 --> 27:48.000
because gaming is one of those things that's taking away from the traditional television viewership and what we know about cable and things like that.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
It is all having an impact on one another and everybody's kind of having to innovate.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
And that's kind of the fascinating thing about where the entertainment industry is at right now.

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
Anyway, going to our chat over at Twitch TV Vogue Network, Tiger class says,

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I think it's pointless to subscribe to all access if the only show you watch is Discovery.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
All the other shows are crappy and paid for old people.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
I you know, I've watched a little bit of it, but I pay for it, whatever.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
Well, I'm actually thinking about adding Hulu, too, because I want to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but they only have season six in the app now, the NBC app.

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
So honestly, if I were to pay for Netflix, Hulu and CBS and probably one other two,

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
it would still be less than what I pay for cable. Yeah. Right.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
So I don't know. And that's the reality a lot of people are facing right now. Let's see.

28:39.000 --> 28:46.000
Going to other comments here, Bobby Blackall says, I really wish Comcast would give me unlimited bandwidth because I have digital preferred cable TV.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
They cap they cap my data because of people getting just Internet to cut the cord to go around them.

28:51.000 --> 29:00.000
So, yeah, I guess, you know, the data cap of. Well, it's a good thing that the FCC is, you know, in the pocket of these cable industry folks.

29:00.000 --> 29:08.000
So, you know, once we get that overthrown, then maybe we can get somebody to say, hey, bandwidth caps are fucking illegal.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
And you can't do it. Well, we'll see. I don't know. It's probably not the current guy, the FCC, but things might change.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
Who knows? Anyway. But to tie it again together back to gaming, because and as somebody mentioned earlier,

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
Microsoft was probably in many ways ahead of its time with the Xbox one.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
I think a lot of this stuff we've been talking about as much as, you know, it might not be directly related games.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
I think when we talk PlayStation five and we talk the next Xbox and whatever else,

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
the soldier boy console, ha ha, whatever else in seriousness is out there in the future,

29:37.000 --> 29:45.000
we might be looking at things that are more integrated with the other types of entertainment beyond just it plays Blu-rays.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
It has a Netflix app. There might be some more like real integration there.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
And you kind of see Sony, I think, in some ways dipping their toe in the water with their whole like they don't call it PlayStation cable,

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
but that's what it is. PlayStation TV view, whatever calm place. It's yeah, PlayStation view.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I actually had subscribed to that's going to be more integrated.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
I tried it for like a month or two and it was all right.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
But then they lost Comedy Central. I think they lost some big networks.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
And I was just like, no, I don't want it anymore because I was kind of all I was tuning in for.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
But there was a lot of channels I just didn't want on there.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
But it wasn't bad. It was just they need more content.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
And they lost their losing content and getting content that I just didn't give a shit about. Gotcha.

30:33.000 --> 30:39.000
So. All right. Well, anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some things that are a little more directly related to video gaming.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
So how was your gaming week? Loki, if you want to cover two weeks, I guess since you weren't here.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
I wish being two weeks that I played a lot more things. I did not.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
It was mainly just trying to you were at Disneyland. I was at Disneyland. Yes.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
I tried to I was mostly trying to get the DDR cabinet stuff to work.

31:01.000 --> 31:12.000
So I had I'd mentioned I think before I left that I had bought some memory card slots for my DDR cabinet because I wanted to get those.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
And I found them for a pretty good price. So I picked some up.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
And so I got those in finally and I had to wire everything up because I didn't know how it was supposed to go.

31:22.000 --> 31:31.000
And thankfully, I I figured it out. So I wired those up and then I had my memory cards and they just weren't reading in there first.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And so I was like, oh, crap. You know, so what the hell?

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
Finally figured out what it was. It's just the memory card slots are so old that the pins inside there are kind of bent out.

31:40.000 --> 31:47.000
So you can even I even my PlayStation 2 is kind of the same way. You have to not quite insert the card all the way.

31:47.000 --> 31:53.000
And I want to say, like when I was playing DDR and stuff in arcades, the card slots are kind of like that, too.

31:53.000 --> 32:00.000
You have to kind of be just push it until you feel like some friction on there and then you just let don't touch it and then it will read just fine.

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
So I did all that and got it working. I loaded the edits I had on my memory cards.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
I had only two or three that no two cards that had edits on there.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
And some that I used to play are just gone. I don't have backups for them anymore.

32:18.000 --> 32:24.000
But the rest, though, I did end up finding and this was really challenging.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
I ended up going online to try to find the sites I used to use for finding edits.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
And I did find some of those, but a lot of them are no longer there anymore.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
And I had to go back through the wayback machine to find stuff.

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
But I did find there is a current edit database out there that people actually do upload stuff for, but it's for DDRX.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
But you can still use those saves if you convert it and stuff to actually work in the cabinet.

32:48.000 --> 32:55.000
So I downloaded pretty much the entire library, just everything that they had, and downloaded everything.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
And then I loaded them onto memory cards. I have about eight cards worth of memory of edits on there.

33:02.000 --> 33:10.000
And so I slowly converted them over. I bought the old PlayStation 3 memory card adapter they have for PlayStation 1 stuff.

33:10.000 --> 33:19.000
So I had to take that. I made an HD loader boot disk thing because I found out once I got my PlayStation 2 back from my sister,

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
the disk drive doesn't work anymore. So I had to get that thing.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Why do we loan anything, however?

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
It's just old. It's an old-ass system. It just doesn't work anymore.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
I didn't technically use the disk drive anyways. It was mainly just used to run the disk for HD loader.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
But now it just runs off of a memory card. So, eh, who cares if the disk drive's not working.

33:38.000 --> 33:49.000
So I managed to transfer everything onto a USB drive, transfer all of those onto memory cards, transfer all of that onto the arcade cabinet.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
So now I have like 150 plus edits on my arcade cabinet.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
It's funny enough, though, it's like some of them are mine, but I don't remember which ones are mine until I actually play them.

33:58.000 --> 34:04.000
Some of them I recognize. I'm like, I think that one's mine. And then I play it and I'm like, yeah, that was mine.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Man, I was really mean when I made that edit.

34:07.000 --> 34:17.000
I found, and as you probably would have seen in the last two streams, if you watch my Twitch streams at twitch slash logy o-l-r.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
You should go follow logy.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Yes, go follow me.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
They, people that make edits for doubles like to use the entire pad.

34:25.000 --> 34:32.000
And usually both, you know, one side and the other side, very often you're stretching quite a bit.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
And, oh, I can still do that, but it, ow.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
It will, it is very hard on my feet.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
So, but I had a lot of fun playing some of those and not all of them are bullshit.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
There was actually some that were pretty fun.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
So it was mainly this week is just playing DDR stuff and just getting all of that working.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
Because it was kind of a hassle to get, figuring out what was wrong with the memory cards.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
And then finally figured out it was just, they're just finicky.

34:58.000 --> 35:04.000
And then what else? I downloaded Goat Simulator for the Switch.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Because my kids want to play that.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
And they played a little bit of that.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
And then just Pokemon Go pretty much.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
I tried getting Pokemon Go, I mean, because I was playing it in Disneyland.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Because there's just PokeSops everywhere.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Of course, I'm sure.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
The problem though was like my gotcha was being stupid.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
And so I had to, I ended up having to reboot my phone a couple times.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
But like it was just like, it would, it would stop working after a while.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I think it's just, there's so much going on at Disneyland.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Because I remember, I haven't done it in Pokemon Go because I haven't been to Disneyland.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Well, no, I'm not a, I think I've gone, I haven't gone to Disneyland.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I think I went when Pokemon Go was first out.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
But I haven't gone since it started tracking the gyms and all that.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Like I think it was kind of a different game then.

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
But I remember with Ingress, with all the portals that were there.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
They're like Downtown Disney and everything because I was there once for BlizzCon.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I think I had just started playing Ingress at the time.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
And I got one of my like unique portals.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Oh damn, I should have played Ingress.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Oh!

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Yeah, you missed opportunity.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Yeah, lots and lots of uniques there.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
You barely play, you barely play that anymore.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I don't. Yeah, I don't play that at all.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
But I did get a lot of walking though.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Like 15 miles in a day is ridiculous.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
But you've been a more fit lifestyle guy lately.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So that walking is probably a really good thing.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
Yeah, so, yeah, I mean that's pretty much it.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I didn't really, like I said, play too much this week.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It was just pretty much that.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
I almost picked up and I still kind of, I know we have to pick up Smash by the end of this month.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
In order to get the free Piranha Plant thing.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I don't know if that's gonna happen though.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
I'm not sure.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
I don't know if I would like buy the whole game right away just because you want Piranha Plant.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Like you could always just buy it later.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Yes, it's more money, but if you're not ready, don't take the plunge.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Although I think it's a great game, you should take the plunge.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
I should, but like I just, the problem is I can't get the switch enough times.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
And it sucks because my wife's been really just hammering Animal Crossing.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
So I've had the PlayStation available on the TV.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
It's been practically available to me for the whole month.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
And I've just, I've booted up the PlayStation 4 so many times and just sat there going,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I don't even know what the hell I want to play on this.

37:16.000 --> 37:22.000
Like, I just, I wanted to like, I was like, maybe we should jump in the Just Cause 4 or something.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
But I'm like, I don't want to buy another game because I'm just gonna buy another game.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
And it's just gonna sit there and I'm not gonna finish it.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
Just like Red Dead 2 and whatever the hell else I was playing before that.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I've got so many started games that it's just gamer ADD.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
I understand. All right. Well, my gaming week, probably not as varied.

37:38.000 --> 37:46.000
I played a little, I played a little bit Diablo 3 because on that event for the Diablo 1 in Diablo 3,

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
although it's not really Diablo 1, it's just like some maps that kind of look like Diablo 1 in a filter.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
The Darkening of Tristram, that's what they call it.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
I finally like needed to get around to playing that event and unlocking all the achievements.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
So I did that because there's one achievement where like you have to start a brand new character

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
and go straight there and like clear it the whole way through to level 20.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Which is actually kind of challenging because you don't get as many loot drops as you'd hope for in that.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
But I did it. And so I played that whole thing, got the achievements.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
That was my big Diablo 3 accomplishment of the week.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Now I'm just waiting to get power level the rest of the way of 70.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
Or maybe I need to do it all again on the Switch to get the achievement there too because I'm sick

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
and I own Diablo on multiple platforms, but I might do it. I don't know.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
I've been playing some World of Warcraft still. My main warlock, I got up to item level 370 today

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
thanks to all the bumps in the last patch.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
And my resto shaman I've been working on as well is up to about a level I think 111.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
But I did play something new this week. I did want to try to do some new games for my game week 2.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
So I finally downloaded and I've been meaning to just pick up this game for like 6 weeks.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
But I'm always like, it's like 30 bucks. I need to hold off because I don't know what's happening

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
with my husband's job situation and all this stuff. I need to just hold off.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
Well finally this week I dropped the money and picked up Beat Saber already.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
Which I had already played before because Bobby Blackwolf brought it to Dragon Con and he has the Vive version.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
So I was familiar with it already. So the game, I kind of knew what I was expecting.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
But it was nice to be able to play it on Playstation VR in my living room.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
And it took me a minute man. Did you know like to get the move controllers synced

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
You can't use just any USB cable. You have to get a specific one that will do

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
Like I guess some of them will only charge but they won't actually communicate and do the syncing.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
So I was like, no it happened. It wouldn't work through one cable.

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
But then when I was like, Alan! I need every cable in the house to try them.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And the third one I tried worked.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Unless they have like pins that are connected.

39:42.000 --> 39:48.000
They will be finicky sometimes but what you have to do is you have to push the reset button in them.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
So you have to get like a paperclip out and push the reset button.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
And that will occasionally happen even when you have them synced already.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
Like I did that the last time I was playing the Playstation VR.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
I had to push the reset button to do that.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
Oh! No I did play a game. I forgot. I played Accounting Plus.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
I fucking love that game. It's so inappropriate but I love that game.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
So I played Accounting Plus.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
But yeah so the last time I played Playstation VR I had to do that.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
So they do that every now and then.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
But if you run into problems like that just try pushing the reset button.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
Well I got it eventually by digging up. I was like, Alan I need every cable that's a match.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
And one of his phone charger cables did it. So whatever. It's fine.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
I got it to work and I got to play the game but it just took me a minute to get it up and running.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
But if you haven't played Beat Saber it's a music game.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
And I know we have a lot of music game people that listen to OLR because that used to be our bread and butter.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
So I know for those of you that enjoy music games you probably already know about Beat Saber.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
But I got to tell you it's a lot of fun because you really do kind of have to get the motion.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
You get a higher score if, and I think the technical thing is that,

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
if your controller ends at such and such an angle from when you slice through the notes.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
So basically instead of sitting there going ee ee ee to like slice the notes.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Just like with your hands. Just little motions.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
If you do these big flourishes and you know just extra.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
If you play the game you get rewarded for being extra and over the top in Beat Saber.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And I think that's what's kind of really cool about it.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
I've been having some minor problems like getting the aim right.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
Because you can calibrate where the floor is but I can't get the right setting.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And I think it's just because my camera is too low.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
I have a camera below my TV because trying to get it on top of the TV like you know it's hard to balance.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
TV's are so thin it's hard to balance.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
Yeah the floor thing. I really don't like the floor calibration thing.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
There is one game. I think it may have been Accounting Plus.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
It was one of them but most of them have it.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
Okay it's like okay lower the floor raise the floor until it looks right to you.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Well that's hard to figure out.

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
So the one though I had it calibrated is it gave me the floor raising and lowering.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
But it also said what height it was.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
So you just set it to your height and boom done.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
But like in Beat Saber you can kind of change the height but you can't.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Like it just kind of measures to where you're at. It's weird.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
But anyway whatever I figured it out eventually.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
I got it playable and that's the most important thing so whatever.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
And the calibration stuff aside once I got in there and played it I had a lot of fun.

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
It was a decent workout like doing all those like playing all the Beat Saber and flinging around so it was good.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
I hope they expand it with more songs later.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I mean not that the songs are bad they're really good.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
But you know everybody on PC is modding everything you can think of under the sun into that game.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
So it would be cool if maybe the Playstation gets some expansion packs and DLC soundtrack stuff.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
So I would pay for more of the same stuff.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Some of those like chiptune dancy songs are really good.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
So I like Beat Saber.

42:45.000 --> 42:51.000
I highly recommend if you're a VR owner or a music game fan or you know both especially.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I picked that game up if you haven't already.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
So I don't have a whole lot of housekeeping to get into.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I don't foresee any shows off we have planned.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
I do know Jamie is returning to the show and I already forgot the date.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
But she got her work schedule rearranged when they start their new schedules.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
It's either the last show in February or the first show in March.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
So she'll be back with us in studios.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
That means we're probably going to look a little different.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
Because I'm going to move this whole thing over there where the Playstation 3 is now.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And then the camera will kind of be up and over at us.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
And he'll catch Jamie over the shoulder so she can be Dr. Claw.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
Or Ms. Claw as the case may be.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
So it'll be fun.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Anyway.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Alright.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Let's get into some other gaming news.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
So Loki has some stuff to start us off tonight.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
So for all those people waiting for Metroid Prime 4.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You're going to have to wait a little longer.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Because guess what?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
It's under a new studio now.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
So I don't remember who it was that was developing it originally.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
But now it's Retro Studios which is great because Retro Studios makes great games.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
But they had to reboot the whole development process.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
So unfortunately they did this really short video.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
Shinya Takahashi who is Nintendo's development head.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Basically made this kind of apology video saying,

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
Hey you know we are rebooting the development on this.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
And it's going to take some more time to get it done.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
So probably not going to see that.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
So he said without saying.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
In my own words.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
He said,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
The game ain't good y'all.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
So we're going to bring in the folks that kind of did this before to start over.

44:28.000 --> 44:36.000
But if you thought or assumed or had your podcast speculating that Metroid Prime 4 would be out this year.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Yeah.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I'm going to need you to hold off those expectations.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
Because we're looking like maybe 2021 or 2022 at this point.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
Is that an accurate summary of what he said?

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
I don't know about 2021 but maybe like end of 2020.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
I don't know.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
That's not what I was getting from that.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I think if they're starting over Loki.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
I mean they might be able to reuse some of the art assets maybe some of the ideas.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
But I think 2021 is a little more realistic.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Not so much.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
I think you know if they're coming out with an announcement like this.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
They mean like it's it's bumped back.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
You know but I appreciate at least Nintendo being transparent.

45:14.000 --> 45:21.000
You know I think we all know that this happened with like Final Fantasy 15 right when it went from versus 13 to Final Fantasy 15.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
And the game we got doesn't look anything like that.

45:24.000 --> 45:30.000
Well I mean maybe a little bit but like it's very different from that early footage like this happens in the gaming industry sometimes.

45:30.000 --> 45:40.000
But maybe it says something about this Internet culture and you know the way we interact with folks immediately on Twitter and setting those expectations and things.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
Where maybe Nintendo felt like maybe we announced this too early.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
We announced this early to get you excited about the switch.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And now we wish we hadn't done that.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
Maybe we padded out our E3 announcements too much.

45:54.000 --> 46:08.000
So interest isn't that interesting isn't that a damned if you do damned if you don't sort of thing because people want game studios to announce this stuff so well then I can they do it's like oh but the reality is well I guess that means we have more room for remasters.

46:08.000 --> 46:15.000
So hey let's get a Mario maker remaster or Metroid Prime trilogy. I'd be down for that. Heck yeah portable.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
And they already took out the Wii controls because they did they sold it on the Wii U.

46:20.000 --> 46:30.000
It doesn't the 1 2 because 1 and 2 were GameCube 3 was a Wii game and they repackaged it it was either like I think it was like a Wii download on the Wii U but they that you could do it without motion controls essentially.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
So I feel like the hardest stuff has already been taken care of in Metroid.

46:34.000 --> 46:40.000
It would be great if they had a few resources to maybe bump up some of the textures but you know what whatever.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
Obviously anything they do for that would take away from Prime 4 maybe.

46:44.000 --> 46:51.000
So I don't know it would be it would be very cool though if they would re-release the trilogy to maybe wet our appetite a little more for Metroid Prime 4.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
That would be cool.

46:52.000 --> 47:03.000
But don't I mean don't get me wrong with this delay you know and I think one maybe refreshing thing about what I'm seeing on Twitter is instead of angry people going like oh fuck Nintendo I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
I didn't really see that it was more like alright I mean that's disappointing but totally understandable.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
Like don't release a crappy game and call it Metroid Prime 4.

47:13.000 --> 47:22.000
Exactly sometimes it's better to you know delay your game and restart development rather than hold a beta that looks kind of eh and then release your game a month from now.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Would you be talking about the next story in our showroom potentially?

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Is that maybe what you're referring to?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
No I'm not referring to that one but.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Oh the one that happened this weekend.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
The one that happened this weekend.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Oh okay we'll get into that later but I mean I think I think there might be another good example.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Yes.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
As well right?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Yes that would also be a good example of that.

47:43.000 --> 47:54.000
Now BobbyBlackWolf over in our Twitch chat says the only people upset are probably investors and shareholders because they know a crappy Metroid Prime 4 would still be a million seller.

47:54.000 --> 48:02.000
Yeah but as a Metroid fan I really appreciate they didn't release a crappy Metroid Prime 4 because I don't want the series to die because Metroid Prime 4 is crap.

48:02.000 --> 48:12.000
And exactly and if you start releasing crappy games then you're going to lose all of that reputation that Nintendo has of being a company that releases quality games.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
You don't want to be another EA or Activision come on folks.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
Let's see SG100Matt says I completely forgot about Prime 4 being announced so I'm obviously okay it's delayed.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Really? Because I talk about it a lot on this show.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
How excited I was for it.

48:26.000 --> 48:33.000
But again I'm in the camper I'm like aw damn I was looking forward to that but again very happy they're not going to murder Metroid by releasing a half ass game.

48:33.000 --> 48:41.000
Or slapping the Metroid name on another game that luckily I think everybody's forgotten about at this point.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Did y'all forget?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
No I have not forgotten.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
They did release kind of a snoozer Metroid game but.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Oh no I remember.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I knew it wasn't a Metroid game.

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
I'm talking about the 3DS multiplayer thing Prime was not Prime Hunters no that one was actually rad.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
The other I don't even know what it was called.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
That tells you how great that game was.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Let's see.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Prime piece of shit.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Federation Force thank you Bobby that was it.

49:07.000 --> 49:14.000
No they had the other one was like Metroid going Doom multiplayer that game that was like the demo thing on the 3DS that was cool.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I wish that that should have caught more.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
They should bring that out on Switch.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I'd be down for that you guys.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Oh my gosh.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Why not?

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
I don't know.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
I don't know maybe I don't know.

49:25.000 --> 49:32.000
Pie in the sky you know again I want him to work on Metroid Prime 4 so maybe I should just shut my mouth with all these other side projects.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
Let's see Tigerclaw says Nintendo should look at Metroid Samus Returns on how to do a proper Metroid game.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
I know the Prime series is 3D but I don't like it always being first person all the time.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah I'm kind of with you.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.000
I've always preferred the 2D Metroids to the 3Ds but like I don't hate the 3D Metroid games.

49:49.000 --> 50:00.000
So like you know if and it has been a while since we did get Samus Returns I feel like okay it's the time is right for them to try a 3D game again.

50:00.000 --> 50:12.000
Now with the technology of the Switch you know and the technology has come a long way from the GameCube even to the Wii where Metroid Prime 3 was to you know the Wii U's happened since then and now we're on the Switch.

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
That can run Doom reboot which is a pretty you know graphically intense sort of shooter.

50:18.000 --> 50:28.000
I'm kind of excited to see what Metroid might look like in first person or third person because maybe now with the technology and the chips that are in those guys maybe you'll be able to switch.

50:28.000 --> 50:37.000
Which ironically which would you know be kind of cool right just like you can in Skyrim right and the Switch runs Skyrim and you can do first person third person whatever you want to do right.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Sure.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
So maybe we'll see.

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
Let's see Spyro 557 John in our chat says I actually have Federation Force but never played it lol.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Well I think that's probably a good thing not to do that.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Anyway.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
All right.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Let's move on to our next story Logie.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Oh no I'm sorry it's me I'm sorry I'm getting backwards here.

50:58.000 --> 51:05.000
We need to because I kind of shaded this a little bit already so I thought I talked about it has to do with rumors about Fallout 76.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
There were some rumors going around the Internet as they sometimes do that.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
Fallout 76 crashed and burned so bad y'all that it's going free to play.

51:13.000 --> 51:23.000
Well usually companies don't come out you know usually the companies will say we don't comment on rumors or speculation but Bethesda came out and said no this is BS basically basically.

51:23.000 --> 51:31.000
So anyway I've never seen ever just you know the rumor was founded because EB games in Australia apparently pulled copies from store shelves.

51:31.000 --> 51:41.000
So that's that's where the rumor came from is that oh my God y'all they're pulling it from store shelves because this game tanked you know like that you know how the Internet and Twitter runs they all run their mouths with that right.

51:41.000 --> 51:51.000
So anyway a message on Twitter where Bethesda and the actual Bethesda accounts we don't know who said it but they said there is no truth to this rumor.

51:51.000 --> 52:03.000
So yeah they are not going free to play with Fallout 76 or tinfoil hat if they are they just don't want to tell you right now.

52:03.000 --> 52:16.000
But anyway now I don't I don't you know I think the game I think the logical step is for the game to get drastically reduced in price like 20 bucks then go free to play.

52:16.000 --> 52:28.000
I don't think it's going to go straight from $60 price to Black Friday sales and some of the you know minor 10 15 20 percent cuts you saw around that time to free free to play.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I think they would try to sell it for 20 bucks first.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
What does it even mean sold for now.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
I mean let's see aren't they still trying to get the 64 or am I wrong on that.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Maybe I don't think it's 60 anymore.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Loki's looking it up right now.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
If you guys are trying to beat him to the punch.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Thank you for scrolling down the page.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Why do you do that.

52:47.000 --> 52:56.000
So he's busy searching a popular retailer on his laptop there to see what they're currently charging for it and even see it listed on here.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
Other than that there's a bundle there's a bundle and a bunch of shirts.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
Do they not have the game.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Oh here we go.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Here we go.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Thirty nine ninety nine down to 40.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
All right.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
Well speaking of thirty nine ninety nine.

53:13.000 --> 53:20.000
Well your deep discounts I saw but I checked online I didn't see the price points but I might pick it up for this kind.

53:20.000 --> 53:29.000
I saw that there was someone had taken a photo of a Wal-Mart that was clearing out PlayStation classics for twenty five dollars.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
I was like for that price.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Yes I would pick that up.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I wanted to find like a retail.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
All I could see was that picture on Facebook.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
It was a Wal-Mart.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Yeah.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Boston.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
I was like Wal-Mart picture on Facebook.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
That's kind of shaky ground right.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Somebody could have photoshopped that.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
OK.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
I was looking for a retail listing so I went to Wal-Mart site to see there.

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
And that's not what they were charging on Wal-Mart charging that reduced fifty nine I think or what.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Yeah.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
The cheapest thing online right now is like fifty four ninety nine.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.000
But I was going to tweet it to Bobby and say is this close enough because he said something on his show about when it comes down to twenty bucks.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
I'll finally pick one up.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I was going to tweet him the twenty five dollars.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah yeah.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
And be like close enough.

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
Twenty five I think would be all right because that's that's you know that's worth it for like Bobby.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Bobby's clarifying in chat.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Still too much.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Twenty is my line.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
He drives a hard bargain.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
All right.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Let's see.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Frodo Swagan says that the only good thing about that game.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
I think Fallout 76 here was the power armor helmet with the ultimate edition.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
But some comments on the rumors.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Quest Buster simply saying this rumor was absolutely dumb.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Well at least it wasn't like somebody completely making it up.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
They had some sort of.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
But I agree it was a little bit of a jump to conclusion sort of thing.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
Bobby Blackwell says fans were probably trying to shame Bethesda into going free to play.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
As if it works like that.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
But I get the comment.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Some people think it does work like that.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
So I get it.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
And that's why that follow up about the PlayStation being twenty five bucks.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
I want.

55:00.000 --> 55:09.000
That's why I'm kind of questioning and I didn't link it to Bobby because I was like I wonder if somebody is trying to like get that rumor going to see if competitors buy it.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
If retailers like Amazon really will cut the price that low because you know right.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Yeah I gotcha.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
We live in a crazy world.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Who knows.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
All right.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Now we can go on to the next story Loki.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Sorry.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
All right.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
So let's talk about Deep Mind.

55:25.000 --> 55:35.000
So Deep Mind is this wonderful A.I. system that they were using the plays like some different games before they had go.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
And I want to say was it chess not Pokemon go but the ancient game go.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Yeah.

55:41.000 --> 55:48.000
So now of course you know we're stepping it up instead of you know those simple games that we're going to take on Starcraft 2.

55:48.000 --> 56:05.000
And so they actually took Deep Mind they trained it against or to play Starcraft 2 basically cramming I was 200 years worth of gameplay into two weeks because they sped up the games and had basically sped up the simulations.

56:05.000 --> 56:13.000
So then they they basically pit them against some of the best Starcraft 2 players.

56:13.000 --> 56:26.000
And apparently I did win because some of the it's sort of unfair I guess in the way that it operates because they can see the whole map it basically doesn't have to zoom in to different spots.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
So the fog of war.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Well the fog of war is still there for them.

56:31.000 --> 56:37.000
But I would say it doesn't have to like study things or be like what's that because the computer kind of it already knows.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
But in and of course it played very unconventionally.

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
So you know it was hard for the competitors to basically counter some of this stuff.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Interesting though because A.I. is programmed by humans.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
But this one though this one though it basically learned to play the game and it played itself.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
And so it didn't really pick up any like their strategies I think.

56:57.000 --> 57:03.000
So very cool. I would love to see like some video of this but just be careful.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
This is how Cylons were made.

57:05.000 --> 57:14.000
But I don't know man should we be threatened that the fact that you know that it's able to play Starcraft 2 so well I mean what's next.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
No because Starcraft isn't real life yet.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
What about Overwatch or like Fortnite or something like that.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
A.I. is going to just take over everything.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
As long as there's a plug to unplug it.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.000
S2-100 Matt with the mandatory Skynet comment in our chat at VOG Network.

57:33.000 --> 57:41.000
So kind of interesting. I mean it's interesting as an exhibition sort of thing but obviously computers winning game tournaments.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
I don't know if it's that. I mean I don't know.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
But then again during awesome games done quick don't they do like the assisted speed runs.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
Well those are the tool assisted ones. Those are basically kind of like recording.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
It's like recording a demo type thing.

57:57.000 --> 58:06.000
But I don't know. Those are still all human input stuff but it's just that you're recording it so you can make it frame perfect.

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
DJ Rama asks in chat asks how is this any different from Deep Blue beating Kasparov at chess.

58:12.000 --> 58:19.000
I guess on face value it's not. But there's the complexities of what Starcraft 2 is compared to chess.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
I'm not saying chess isn't a complex game. Of course it is.

58:22.000 --> 58:29.000
But the rule set for chess all things considered is very simple and doesn't have a lot of variables per se.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
The only variable is responding to the moves of your opponent right.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Right.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
But in Starcraft 2 your maps could be different.

58:36.000 --> 58:43.000
Your positioning of things could go from what 64 squares on a board to millions of pixels.

58:43.000 --> 58:51.000
So I think it's more like that level of complexity that goes with the Starcraft 2 game versus a chess game that makes this you know.

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
But you're right. Is this a repeat of what we've heard years ago with A.I. beats human at chess.

58:58.000 --> 59:05.000
I'm curious. So if they're doing ink you know it's nonstandard strategies or something.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.000
Can can we learn from this to basically play Starcraft 2 better.

59:10.000 --> 59:16.000
Yes. Can can Deep Blue come up with a solution to end the government shutdown.

59:16.000 --> 59:21.000
I think that's pretty good. That's pretty easy way to keep that cans of worms locked.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I had I had to make the joke I had to.

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about something going from a joke to a bit of a mess.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
Maybe another different type of joke and that is the anthem demo this weekend.

59:32.000 --> 59:39.000
Look I y'all know I've been a little I've been a little bit skeptical a little salty about anthem here on this show.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
And that's just because I haven't agreed with the the way that EA has been running things and making a lot of decisions.

59:45.000 --> 59:52.000
And one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week but I tried to play the anthem demo by and talk about it because I feel like I didn't really play it.

59:52.000 --> 59:58.000
Here's what happened. I was given a code to the VIP demo or the preorder demo.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
But I guess a preorder got to invite one or two or three other people out of depending on maybe what level they preordered.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I don't know. Regardless I got an invite from a friend so I was like all right well might as well check this thing out because maybe who knows.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Maybe I'll stop being such a hater. Maybe the single blow me away and I'll change my mind.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
So I downloaded the multi gig thing on origin set that all up.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So yes I tried to do it on PC because that's where I would prefer to play because I play a lot of games on PC.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I load up the demo. Now I didn't play it till Saturday because in my mind I was like when the doors open right away it's going to be a clusterfuck.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Sure enough what happened on Friday. Total clusterfuck right. Servers can't handle all the people and all that stuff fine.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So I knew in my head I was like it ain't going to really work till like Saturday or so they'll figure out the issues.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
How do the servers like they know how many keys they gave out right.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Why servers just weren't prepared for the number of people. It's like so it's interesting.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:02.000
So so Bobby actually addresses that perspective a little bit tonight on his show and what you're saying isn't really different from the way a lot of people on the Internet would say things and basically like you know how many people are going in.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You should have the servers infrastructure for that. But I suppose it basically comes down to this and I don't necessarily disagree with this.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I don't hate it for this reason. I hate it for other reasons. It's not that like they didn't necessarily have the server set up ready to go and all that.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
But it's that some things you just do not know how it's going to work until you unleash it to the masses.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Right. I guess take our move to twitch for example some things we tested we thought would work.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
We thought would go great. And then poof one week Skype breaks our soundboard that didn't occur in the testing. Who knew. Right.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Well I didn't know until we were there. Right. It's typical that Microsoft sub breaks everything.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But that's that's the gist. I'm kind of simplifying what's a more complicated issue. But that's the gist. Yeah. OK. So fine.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But here's the I go into the demo. I'm able to get past that log in screen. I'm playing for a little bit and then I get to a loading screen and the loading screens just loading and loading.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And I get to the loading screen after being asked like 17 times are you sure you don't want to play with other people.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Anthem is best experience when you play with other people. Push this button right now to join an experience with other people.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And I'm just like OK look I know how trash fires on the Internet are if I don't already know how to play this game.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
By the time I join a group with people they're just going to talk smack even beta or not. It doesn't even matter.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So I want to just play a little single player so I can like how do how do I move.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.000
How do babby crawl. Like I just want to play single player to figure all that out. Right.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
But then I'm on the loading screen loading your load as you lose. And it's just I'm sitting on the loading screen for five minutes.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And this is after like for some reason I can't play on my main monitor.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I have to play on my side monitor because yes this is a 4K monitor and I can't play 4K gaming with my current setup.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But I had it downscaled to 1080p resolution but it still wouldn't play on my 4K monitor but like frame skip like.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
So I had to play it over here which is weird. So I was already frustrated and I'm stuck on the loading screen.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And finally after five minutes of sitting on the loading screen I was like you know what.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Reclaiming my time. Reclaiming my time. I'm not. This is it's broken.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I don't I don't. Whatever. What was I thinking. What was I thinking. And I just I stopped.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And that's why I didn't talk about it during my gaming week and I didn't want to come out here and just be like.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Anthem sucks. I didn't play it because it wasn't really ready to be played this weekend.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Now I said to some extent I understand all these engineering things and that some things you're just not going to figure out until you go.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Here's where I have a problem. Here's why I think EA continues to screw with BioWare and their releases.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And why they're setting Anthem up to potentially and I might be wrong because some of the people that did get in and are playing it seem to enjoy it.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So maybe it'll do just fine. EA sold this as like a VIP sneak peek.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Who is in that preview this weekend. People that paid extra money or at least committed to.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I realize all the preorder systems are different but people who said they were going to spend extra money and preorder this more advanced edition of Anthem.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And that's who this was for. Their open demo for the public and for everybody is next weekend.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Now I'm not a big fan of paying more money to access games early as it is.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
But that's just kind of the day and age we live in now.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Why didn't EA if they didn't truly know what they were going to be facing and if they knew they were basically going to be testing multiplayer with this whole thing.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Because they want you to go multiplayer very very badly through all the in-game prompts.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Why did they not do the open let's have everybody in it test first and market it as stress test.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.000
This test will offer you experience of Anthem levels but you will probably experience frequent issues.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:00.000
If they had sold it as what it was as opposed to the VIP very special people access edition.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'd hate this whole thing a lot less. But that's the problem is that EA was tempting people with extra money and spend this extra stuff to get in this thing early.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
They ain't even going to fucking work. But you see you're paying money to be our testers.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So you see if I were if it wasn't called a VIP test then where would be my sense of pride and accomplishment with EA.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I wouldn't feel as special. I wouldn't feel like this special snowflake that I was that I dropped money to play and that I'm just showing EA look at me.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I'm ready to give you money for no thing because it still would have been you could have been the little snowflake all you wanted because they would have marketed as a very special one level preview capped at level 10 to stress to stress test the servers.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Like sold it for what it was sold it for what it was as opposed to what it ended up being.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
That's where I get into issues with EA.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And you know what this whole thing I'm complaining about has nothing to do with the hardworking people that made the game has nothing to do with the artist the engineers that are trying to fix the servers as fast as they're identifying the problem.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
My issue if you think about it has nothing to do with that.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It's how it was marketed and sold by EA which when I got ticked off about a lot of things with Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Guess what it was about decisions that EA made about how they were going to preview the game in advance when it wasn't really finished and all this other stuff.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Well here's my question. We only have like a month away. Do you think it's going to be ready in time.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Well then I heard another thing and I don't know if this is true or not but I heard another thing that the demo people were playing was apparently like a six month old demo.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I don't know if that's true or not. Take it with a grain of salt. But that just made me even go more like why would that be what you're putting out there for VIP people two weeks before the game launches.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Because I bet you there are people with those preorders that played that thing this weekend and canceled their preorder just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda when all of that started coming out.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Don't believe me. I know some of the person that gave me the key was thinking about doing it. I don't know if they did it but there are people that are going to cancel the preorder based off of what happened whether it's rational or not.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This is just what happened and then you know what else is going to happen because EA likes giving you that early access if you pay them the extra money because people are going to get that early access and see how much of a clusterfuck it is and then people are going to cancel more preorders that way to

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Quest Buster in the VOG Network Twitch chat says that's kind of true. The blog statement by BioWare said that the demo was an older build. Well speaking of which this is it wasn't just my opportunity to rant about anthem but I actually did have a whole little thing here where BioWare has talked about what's going on basically this weekend.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So Chad Roberts with BioWare said in a BioWare blog post we've been testing the entire game and platform for several months but there were a few things we missed real world play frequently leads to unexpected issues.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I want to dispel one comment we've seen that we under plan for server capacity to ensure stability. We intend to manage our servers to match the player population as it grew.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Overall we had excess capacity to prepare for population increases and continue to do so. That said what's important is that all parts of the game work is designed to meet players needs and that did not happen in the opening hours.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:33.000
So why did you sell it like something that was going to be different then. Like that's the problem EA stop lying to us. Like stop thinking we're all stupid just so you can take our money.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Like tell us what it really is and maybe these things won't happen.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
That makes too much sense.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
We can't do that honestly.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
That's not nice warm fuzzy marketing.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Anyway some of the issues that have been cited rubber banding connection issues blocked entitlements blah blah blah blah blah.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I guess investigations are ongoing stuff is going to be fixed before the next demo.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Another comment from the same guy. I want to be upfront that this is a difficult one and something we may not resolve during this weekend.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Many players are not seeing this issue and the last thing we want to do is destabilize the experience for everyone.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You know what this is. You know what this is. I got the perfect analogy because this is what everybody's talking about all over again because of some documentaries that hit Netflix and Hulu this week.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:35.000
This is gaming's version of the Fyre Festival a very elite VIP experience for those of you that spent a little extra money.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I got to watch that experience this special event.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Thanks EA for putting on the Fyre Festival demo this weekend.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Maybe I'm over maybe I'm being a little over dramatic here on this program but I think there's some merit to the comparison I'm making there.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
All right. Let's move on. I don't I don't want to live in a negative space.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
You know what. For those of you that are looking forward to Anthem.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I hope it's all I hope they've learned what happened this weekend.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I hope the game comes out. I hope it's wonderful. I hope you all have a happy time gaming.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Who knows maybe I'll come around on it.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Maybe I'll have to eat my words and be like I was wrong.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
But right now I ain't spending 60 bucks on it. I got other stuff I can play like Kingdom Hearts 3 is out on Tuesday.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So yes that will probably keep me busy for like six weeks with the slowest I am on games.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So anyway let's move on to another story.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Loki so e-sports is definitely changing.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:40.000
So one game company giant software is actually getting into the e-sports game and they're doing that with none other than farming simulator.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That's right. The first season of the farming simulator league is going to be starting soon.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It's going to consist of 10 tournaments that are going to take place in Europe.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.000
They're going to have a chance to win up to two hundred eighty thousand dollars in prize money put up by the developer.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Now for those that are listening on the podcast you're going to hear like low motor noises because we're actually looking at footage of farmer simulator 19.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Because I'm I'm I have to be honest like I was like I don't like what what do you do in farming simulator like I far.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I know this has been like a game people talk about things for a long time.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
But what what exactly what where's the competitive head to head and it's going to be with this.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And right now on the stream we're watching this guy with a tool chop a tree into smaller bits.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Now granted I probably did. I just picked a random like two minutes of gameplay here.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Maybe not pick the most exciting stuff in the world but a lot of the gameplay looks fun.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Maybe. Yeah no I'm not I'm not like dog in the game at all.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Like if this is like the type of thing you're into like people play flight simulators right.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Like you know we have I know we have a caller. He hasn't called in a long time but used to talk about flight simulators and stuff.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And that's cool. Like if you are into farming you're a 4-H person or whatever.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And the graphics do look really good. I'll say that then maybe this is going to be a game that's like right up your alley.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
But like I don't really understand like what's what's the competitive side of this.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Even a slow dry game something like civilization or something.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
You know I kind of I get that at least there's like a competitive edge or something like that.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
No but they're going to do something.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:22.000
But anyways they're saying they're going to hold 10 different events that says each event will allow teams and players to earn circuit points and win prizes.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And they said once the season has concluded the teams with the most points are earn will gather at Farm Con 2020.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Apparently they have Farm Con and to crown the farming simulator champion.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The winner will take home one hundred and ten thousand dollars in prizes.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Apparently they're going to time these events around major gaming events like Gamescom and Paris Game Week.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I guess they've sort of kind of dipped their toes in the water with this.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000
They've done some competitive farming simulator stuff with the farming simulator championship series.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
But I'm trying to see what they what the actual events are.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Let me let me while you're looking at that let me get some comments in our chat over at VOG Network on Twitch.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Questbuster says I saw a good response to the same question on a forum that the actual management of things in the game actually requires quite a bit of skill to handle well.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
To keep your farm successful. It's like Starcraft but with farms I guess.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I mean I'm just saying the footage didn't convey that but OK.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I mean no I mean there's there's management to it that you know it's probably interesting for folks that are like super into that.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
So cool.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
And Act F says very plainly I don't get World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 either.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I'm going for my jugular but I get it.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Those games aren't for everybody either but it's something that entertains people right.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
This game might not be fun for me but it might be fun for you so you should go have a blast with it.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yeah. So I'm not really sure what else they've got there.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It says they have a you know operate the competitive events and different agriculture related events.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
They really say like I don't know if they like doing specific what the challenges are.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh shit they have like an actual like yeah like a whole whole controller.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yeah that's like a awesome controller.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It looks like like the that mech game that you'll be telling less steel with telling them more like a lot of stuff.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I don't know. Anyway.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Looks like the Microsoft racing controller there.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Frodo swaggin's in our chat says this game is way too buggy to be an e-sports game.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
A lot of the simulator games sometimes it doesn't plan for what needs to be simulated I guess.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I don't know. I check it out.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Bond's double assist at six acts asks again.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
So the contest purse is how much. It was one hundred thousand dollars.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Well yeah they said two different amounts here so they apparently they're going to do this.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.000
This tournament that's going to have 10 different tournaments across Europe and that has up to two hundred eighty thousand dollars in prize money.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And then there is this thing that they're going to have this farmer farming simulator champion that's going to take one hundred ten thousand dollars in prizes.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:07.000
So I'm guessing that throughout the whole tournament they're going to have you know various prizes in the grand prize at the end is one hundred ten thousand dollars.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000
So throughout the rest of it you have one hundred seventy thousand that you can earn with all the other minor tournaments.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I guess.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And how much can I win from playing a DDR tournament.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I don't know.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Eighty percent of the pot and a free pizza.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Sadly I don't think we're at that same level just yet just yet.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Yeah I think there was just a world championships they probably did offer a slightly bigger prize.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Well funny to me this is being the only sport we ever like super got into this is being put up by the developer the publisher so Konami.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Where's where's the money.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Something about like they had to do like a thing across the street from the actual event to actually get like more people to participate or something like I don't.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It just sounds like Konami.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Yeah.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Konami is a mess.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
What else is new.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Anyway maybe I shouldn't you go play all of your you know your cabinets out there and maybe save some of that money for prize pools.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
All right well moving on to another game that people are talking or game series I should say that people are talking about this week Resident Evil.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Lots of people talking about the Resident Evil 2 remaster because I know that just recently came out so I think some folks have been playing it.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I passed on it because I like the old Resident Evil games but I don't I don't know if I really want it because they're with the V.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I don't know this new one support VR.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I know seven had the VR and I was like nope.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
It was too much too scary too scary.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I can't.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Anyway but I know Resident Evil isn't only a successful game franchise but it's a successful movie franchise although the movie franchise like kind of wrapped up right.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
They said they made the last one but we all know there's going to be a reboot in the future or things like that.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:53.000
But there may also be something else as well because Deadline another one of those industry magazines reported this week Resident Evil TV series is in the works at Netflix.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Because Netflix is making so many shows these days.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Why not.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
They've had some success from video game based things like Castlevania.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
We know they're doing a thing on Witcher.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So although Witcher technically a book too but anyway.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
No no reason why Resident Evil doesn't head to Netflix.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
So that's the report coming out this week wasn't.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I can't.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
No that was a rumor.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
The Zelda thing was a rumor.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The thing was a rumor.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
We never really got anything as ingress anime.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
That's a game.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
That's that's Netflix.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Netflix paid for rights for that which by the way it's still not out.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
It's supposed to be out last year.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
But Netflix just bought like distribution rights to that anyway.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Who's making the Resident Evil Netflix show German production and distribution company.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Konstantin film.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
They were behind the Resident Evil movies that were kind of based on the games.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
They had some characters in common.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
They had zombies.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
They did.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
It was zombies.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And there was characters the same names.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And that's about it.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:59.000
No show runner yet but the deadline report says that they think the plan is for the series to expand the Resident Evil universe and deepen the existing mythology.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
The series will keep the basic premise which served as a setup for the movie franchise.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000
The drama series will explore the darker inner workings of Umbrella Corporation and what happens when the T virus breaks out.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
It's in early stages.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Apparently there's action sequences Easter eggs all being planned.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
We don't know when but give us some of that walking dead money.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Not too surprised.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I mean the Resident Evil films are kind of you know I know a lot of horror movie buffs because the stuff I work with with the cult movies the Rocky Horror and everything.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I know people that and Resident Evil like that whole series is kind of like a cult thing.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Like some people here locally made like a whole fan film about Resident Evil that I always see promoted around here.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So it's just you know it has its fans and I'm sure people will be very excited about a Netflix series.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
You know going back to the ingress anime.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Oh boy.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
All right.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I would love if the ingress anime was actually about people playing ingress sitting in your car.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
What are you doing.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
That little 70 year old girl.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
My portal right now.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I'll show her.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I'm Logan.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
All right.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Anyway let's see.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Metal mayhem in chat says the Resident Evil movies weren't good movies based on video games.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Good action movies.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Maybe.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Let's see.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
S.J. 100 Matt says it's five years too late for the walking dead money.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Well maybe they want something to come take its place.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I don't know.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
There's always going to be zombie fans.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Zombie movies have been around forever.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
You know in horror movies gore movies people are just always into that.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
That's the thing.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
So I wouldn't say that just because The Walking Dead is kind of less like people seem to care about it less now.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Like it kind of peaked a while ago.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Like I wouldn't say that that means that Resident Evil can't be successful.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I'm sure if it's a good show it's a good show.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Netflix had a lot of good shows like everybody.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I still haven't watched it myself but everybody's talking about that haunting of Hill House.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
It's like a phenomenal series.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
It was a movie in the 90s that was kind of a right.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
That was House on Haunted Hill.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
No they did they did they did that and they did the haunting which was the same thing.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
They came out like the same year.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
There were two movies except one had Jeffrey Rush the other had Liam Neeson.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I'm telling you there were two haunting move to haunted house movies and the one with Liam Neeson is the one that's being adapted in this TV series.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Because the one that I remember from the 90s was the one it was the remake of the old Vincent Price movie.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Yes that was the Jeffrey Rush one.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Oh yeah that was going to.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Yeah anyway but they're both kind of.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
But anyway the point is that Netflix series is apparently very good.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Sabrina the Teenage Witch cheesy ABC TV comedy show and Melissa Joan Hart although I did love it.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I really did love the Sabrina series but you know totally different direction Riverdale style direction for Netflix and apparently it's really good too.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Like Netflix has had a lot of like really good shows.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
So anyway.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
All right.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I think I think we should maybe focus a little less on the now and maybe go back to some classics with the classic game of the week.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And so we take a look behind the door that says do not open and we find a journey through space and time where we're joined by the one and only dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Hi Jamie.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Hi we have a loading screen when you open my door.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Is it a blue screen of death or an orange screen of death if you will.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
No it's a loading screen that shows someone going up a ladder.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I see.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000
All right well you're actually joining us I know on a work break tonight and joining us with not a whole lot of time to spare.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
But the show just wouldn't be the same without your presence.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Excited to have you back in a month.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Well thank you for having me.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well let's get to it.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
The classic game of the week.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
So I know you picked something a little timely this week.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So tell us about it.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
The classic game of the week.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Well I picked Resident Evil 2 for our classic game of the week.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Well you can't do that.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
That just came out.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
No I'm picking the original silly beans.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Oh OK.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
That works.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Yeah.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000
The original original original version came out actually in North America before it came out in Japan.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Of course over there it was biohazard 2.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000
It came out January 21st 1998.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
So almost a full anniversary.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Which the funny thing is that of course I think that was also the release date for no.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
But yesterday was the release date so it was a little bit later than that then.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But at any rate it was produced by Capcom.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And it's survival horror.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And you play as Leon or Claire who are trying to escape Braxton City after all the zombies have taken over.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
The big thing with this one that made it different over the original.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:51.000
The first game is that while it does focus on exploration and puzzles and combat.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
It has different branching paths for each player character.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Different obstacles.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
So it's a different story for each play through.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
There was now this one was kind of the interesting one.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
There is a and I've seen the full beta watch actually a full play through.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Is that there was what was called Resident Evil 1.5.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:20.000
And it had a lot of stuff in common but instead of Claire it had another another lady in it.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And gosh now I.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Most of the time remember her name I don't remember her right now.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
But it started with NC.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I'll have to look her up again.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
But at any rate she eventually became Claire.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Although in the new game right now her outfit is one of the unlockable outfits for Claire.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
So it's pretty funny.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I'm sure everybody in the chat room is yelling out the name right now.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
But it doesn't work when we walk through the door.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I'm sorry guys.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And I'm at work right now and I kind of don't care.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I don't care to look it up.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.000
At any rate it has been on so many different systems.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
We had the PlayStation.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:15.000
We had a second version which was the DualShock version that came out later in the same year.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
It had a Windows version.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
It had a Nintendo 64 version.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Nintendo was a Dreamcast version.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And a GameCube version.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So it is considered.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I mean it goes back and forth.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Some people consider this better than the original.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Than the first game.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And then some people say the first game was better.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It has had better voice acting.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I'll give you that.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
But at any rate it has had so many other ports.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
There was even a modified 2.5D version for the Gamecom.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And guess who had that version?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
That would be me.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Nerd.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Well I don't know if I still have it.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
It's somewhere in there.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And of course there was the sequel, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Which was, as I call it, the Jill game.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And of course we just got the remaster which is pretty freaking amazing.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But moving forward, since it is a survival horror game.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
You basically have to solve puzzles.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You get guns with ammo.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
So you have to be very strategic with how you use it.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You can also have your life that you can check on.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
And you can smoke the green herb to refill your life.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I'm sorry, eat it.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Or what Dan and I do is that there's the one where he mixes certain colors with brown things.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
We call it the brown pile.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Wow.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And you get first aid sprays and stuff.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah, we call it the brown pile.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And so you have, you know, your health reflects in the posture and movement speed of your character.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
So if they're wounded they'll hold their stomach and limp a little bit.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
But if they're near death they're just going to drag.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
So they also have a limited number of items that you can store in different places.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
You can, I think it was only Claire before that got the hit pack.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
But now you can actually, well at least as far as we've found so far, you can get two hit packs in the current game.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
So that's pretty good.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
You also save your game using a typewriter.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000
But in the original one you had ink ribbons that you had to collect to be able to save your game.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Whereas this one is just save, save, save as much as you want, thank God.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Because it's hard.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Even in the easy version it's actually kind of hard.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:53.000
But anyway, the game had real time models that, you know, your characters would move around.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
But the backgrounds were all pre-rendered.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And it used kind of like a tank control, so meaning you used one to move and another one to rotate.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And then you had the zapping system.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000
So where you have the two different puzzles and storylines for the characters.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:21.000
And if you finish scenario A with one protagonist, the B scenario has different things unlocked.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000
So like if one person did one thing in scenario A, then scenario B has to pick up from it or do two different things.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
The original version of Resident Evil 2 had two scandal and mini-games.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000
One called The Fourth Survivor, where you play as an Umbrella Agent called Hunk.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Who also ended up being like a character in, was it Outbreak I think it was?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Like with his Delta Team and everything.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
It was pretty neat.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:57.000
And then you have the Tofu Survivor, where you play as a giant box tofu with a hat and a knife.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And the more damage he gets, the redder he gets.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And I think he can't heal either.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:10.000
The Nintendo 64 version, actually no, all of the other versions except the Nintendo 64 version had a mini-game called Extreme Battle.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Which had four playable characters in three stages.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
So it was pretty neat too.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Now, as far as I understand, the Fourth Survivor and the Tofu Survivor have made it into the new game.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:33.000
So, the thing about the Tofu Survivor is that it was actually a placeholder character for working on the collision detection.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And they left it in as a playable.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I'm reminded of the killer Tofu song all of a sudden.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Well, at any rate, two months after, basically this game is set two months after the original Resident Evil 2.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Which is really great because the remake is also still set in the 90s.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
So, and I'm not going to go into the story because if you don't know it by now, then whatever.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
But let's go back into a little bit more though of the development.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000
So, Resident Evil 1.5 was basically, it was Elza, Elza is the name of the character.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Anyway, so this game was all laid out, it was mostly done.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000
You had different, you know, different characters in this one.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I like to consider it a gore if I like pre-release beta.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
That some of the characters evolved into other people.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And then basically though, after certain things happened in the real world.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:45.000
And you know, there were certain things that just did not mesh well with, not just the development team.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.000
But with the powers that be at Capcom, they axed it and started all over.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So basically, that's how we get the current version that we see.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:09.000
All the music was composed by Ueda Masami, Uchiyama Shisaku and Mishigaki Eshin.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And one track composed by Nusita Nalshi.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:21.000
But it was all meant to be like mood music, you know, all kinds of horror themes, you know.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
In the new game, by the way, if you get the deluxe edition, you can play with the original soundtrack, which is pretty cool.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.000
But the music basically went between like the ambient music to kind of industrial music.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
And you know, certain places were orchestral.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
It just really was inspired by like real movies.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.000
They actually did an orchestra album that was recorded by the New Japan Philharmonic.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So it's pretty cool.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
There's also a remix album called Biohazard 2 Remix Metamorphosis.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
But yeah, as I said earlier, there were all these different versions.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:04.000
The PC port was a Windows 9x base, you know, so nothing really awesome.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Of course, Nusita 64 was going to have some pretty big limitations because the full motion video had to be super compressed.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
And its port cost about a million to do.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:28.000
They also added some different in-game information called the X-Files, like EX.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
But they'll capital E, lowercase x.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
They had different documents and different lore associated in the game.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And its resolution was of course different.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
It did support the extension pack, which put it at 640x480.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Ooh.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
It's just like Windows 3.1 back in the day.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
They did spin a port for the Sega Saturn.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I actually do have the original Biohazard on Sega Saturn.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
It got cancelled due to some weirdness.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Parking on the Saturn says the Saturn is kind of weird.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And then the games.com one only had Leon's story and removed a whole bunch of elements.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:13.000
There was also, and this is the one I was talking about, there's an unfinished build of Resident Evil 1.5 that got leaked onto the internet.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And someone actually made it playable.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
So there's full playthroughs now on the internet.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And then the game though in Italy was banned temporarily due to criticism from the civil rights movement over there.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Which re-looked at the depiction of a violent.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:46.000
And also La Guardia di Sinangla, which is I guess a law enforcement agency in that part of Italy, seized 5500 unsold copies.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And then they lifted the ban after Sony requested a re-examination.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
This was all a lot going on during multiple violence and video games.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
You know, big stink that was being posed a lot of stuff.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Just being posed all over the place.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And you know, a lot of people found the story of course far-fetched but very compelling.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
And a lot of people really liked that adapting system.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And of course its graphics at the time were pretty awesome for its day.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:29.000
The only one that, you know, basically the subsequent versions that came out after the PlayStation except for the Nintendo 64 port didn't get rated as well as the original.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:37.000
But now the Dreamcast one though was really, really lauded for its better sound development.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:47.000
At any rate, you know, the game sold, gosh the advertising alone was $5 million in 1988.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And it broke like, gosh, like some records right at the start.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:05.000
But the pre-orders itself in Italy were over $100,000 which came to about $6.6 million.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And it was the fastest selling video game in North America.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:15.000
It sold in the weekend right after its release, it sold 380,000 copies and grossed $19 million.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:24.000
And it surpassed the revenue of all but one Hollywood movie at the time and broke the sale record set by Final Fantasy 7 and Super Mario 64.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I wonder if the remake is going to get banned in Italy too.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Probably not.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Alright. Well I'm running out of footage so we've got to wrap up.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Okay.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
But there it is.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:43.000
At any rate, there were tie-in stories, there was an evil uprising and then the Dark Knight Chronicles and then one of the, I think, gun survivor games.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
So there you go.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Alright, your classic game of the week but it's new all over again thanks to the remaster.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Resident Evil 2.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Hey, Jamie, we've got to get back to the show.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
It's amazing.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
But before we get back to the show, quickly, your thoughts on the remaster because I doubt Loki's played it.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I haven't played it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So what are your thoughts on the remaster because I know you've been playing that this week.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:10.000
We started off with the Claire scenario and honestly I find the voice acting is amazing.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And you know how picky I am on voice acting.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.000
The voice acting is very good instead of, you know, having space between one person and saying something, it actually sounds like a real conversation.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Some people were talking about the face models.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I thought the face models were excellent.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And one thing that I, you know, I've kind of looked at this after the whole sync with Mouse Effect Andromeda is I've been looking at the characters eyes.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And the eyes have fantastic reflections.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
They meet their tone.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And there's even, well, I'm going to spoil it because, you know, there's that character, Marvin, who was the cop that you meet up in the thing.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000
They actually showed his skin getting ashier and ashier as the game progresses, as he's, you know, dying.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
They show like a realistic look of somebody bleeding out.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
The head explosions and the people getting torn apart.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Okay, I know this is gross, but it's anatomically right.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Well, I'm serious. Like, Dan magnums somebody in the back of the head because we're taking turns with it.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
And you can actually see the ocular cavity in their skull. It was pretty amazing.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
No, thanks. I'll be passing on that. But hey, for you gore fans.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Girl, it's not that bad. It's not that bad.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
You only have a few sections.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:34.000
But one of the little tiny, tiny things is that they put nods back to the old game, like they had misspelled welcome, like with two L's for Leon's welcome thing.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.000
So there's a big banner hanging over this. Has it spelled right that there's a gap between the L and the C, and you can find an extra L on the ground.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And then they have references to characters from other games like Rita, What's-Her-Face from Outbreak.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000
It's actually really well done, and her Easter eggs tie in the lore so amazingly well.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
All right.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
You even have tied zombies.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
All right. Well, we're running long. We got to get back to the live show.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000
But any final thoughts from you, DarkSakura, before we bid you adieu for this week?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I can't wait to have my Sundays off again, really.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:22.000
We can't wait to have her back. So there's DarkSakura joining us earlier today with the classic game of the week.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
We're back here live in our studio with episode number 761 of our show already in progress.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And I guess I guess now I'm figuring out why there's less and less people, I guess, tuning in tonight.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I guess there's a big wrestling thing going on right now.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Oh, yeah. Royal Rumble.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Yeah, because Bobby was looking at the he likes to kind of see like, oh, how are we doing on Twitch right now with the against like other channels and stuff?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And he said, oh, there's a bunch of people, I guess, that will like watch wrestling and comment on it, like the kind of like watch parties or whatever.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
They're not showing it. They're just like it's like come here and we'll kind of watch together sort of thing.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
So kind of kind of interesting, I guess.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.000
We'll talk a little bit more about that Twitch community feeling in an upcoming story a little bit later on.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Some quick, quick housekeeping with VOG Network before we get back into some news, including some rapid fire news.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
But I did want to point out here, there's some big changes with VOG.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Some of the like old stuff into some of the new stuff.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And I mentioned earlier the radio feed is going to be sunsetting.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
It's no longer going to be there, probably by the time a lot of you guys hear this in our podcast feed.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
But obviously we had many wonderful years there via shoutcast.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000
So thanks to all of you that supported through the radio and will continue to do so through the video and Twitch TV.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
And of course, the podcast that have always been there.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
So many of our shows have been around a long, long time.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And so available through the podcast feeds.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Also, one other thing that's going to be going away very soon.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000
This could be the last week where you can actually check in to Orange Lounge Radio and participate with the gamification with VOG Network dot com.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
The reality of the situation is more people were kind of into it in 2012.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
It's kind of a newer thing.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:58.000
And, you know, when four square was bigger and more people were using that, it was kind of like a little bit about where the idea was kind of inspired by of sorts.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
But just less and less people doing that now.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000
We just kind of want to focus our resources on getting more eyeballs on Twitch and what we're doing over here and all that fun stuff.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:15.000
So unfortunately, the gamification is going to be going away a little bit, which hopefully will, you know, just kind of allow the resources to go to recruit more help here to get some more original VOG programming and things of that sort.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
So. All right. Let's move on.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Let's get in to get into some more gaming news, including some rapid fire news.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Loki. Yes. So, um, Minecraft is getting an update soon and they're adding composting.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So you actually be able to take some of your unwanted crops now and be able to turn it back into bone meal to help build crops.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Although from what I read so far that while it's nice that they have those there, it doesn't seem to be a very good source of getting bone meal.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It's almost easier just to wait for, you know, skeletons to just die.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:00.000
But it is an option. And also people are using them to kind of look they look a little bit like beehives.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000
So, you know, people have set them up to look like mock beehives, I guess, for their farms.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.000
But yeah, it is something that they're working on right now. So that should be coming soon.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000
One of my friends started those Minecraft realm servers and I keep meaning to like get in there.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.000
But I I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do it. He said he invited me and I went to Minecraft.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I don't see it. So I have to figure it out. I don't know. Yeah.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
We'll have to figure that out for us, too. Yeah. Or even just running.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Maybe just ran the PC version again. But now the console version will be better.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
We'll do that. I like the Windows 10 version. That's what I play mostly. Yeah.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Yeah. And then, of course, you know, even though the movie's not yet out and I have high hopes for it,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Detective Pikachu is already going to be getting a sequel. So that's pretty awesome.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Apparently, they said they have hired, I guess with Oren Ziel,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.000
who has written for such movies as 22 Jump Street, The Clover Paradise.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Let's not talk about Cloverfield anymore. The Cloverfield Paradox. OK, so he has one good movie attached to it.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And he's also writing for the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie and the upcoming moral comic.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.000
They're doing another moral comic film. Yeah, supposed to be doing like a reboot.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Well, 22 Jump Street is good, I guess. But he's going to be right. It's not 21 Jump Street.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000
It's 22 Jump Street. The second one was funny. Both of the movies were great, actually.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And I'm disappointed that they were supposed to be doing a crossover between 21 Jump Street and Men in Black.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:50.000
That would have been fucking hilarious. But they didn't do it because they don't have the balls to pull something that awesome off.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.000
So we'll get Men in Black International instead and whatever. I want to see this Detective Pikachu.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I got to admit, I like good. I like the take they're taking with putting Pokemon in the real world instead of it being super cartoony.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I'm curious. I'm down to see the movie. I think a lot of that curiosity is why they're already greenlighting a sequel.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I think they see what the buzz is and that there's a lot of people that are approaching these trailers with cautious optimism

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.000
and are probably, you know, re sharing re sharing the trailers and stuff. You're laughing. No, no, no, no, no.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I'm not laughing about this. OK. I'm just thinking to myself, I really want the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I need that trailer. I need to see what we're dealing with here. And I'm you love to carry.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I love Jim Carrey. And if Sonic is like. Twitter Sonic.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
We may be in for a good. Yeah, a good movie, but I will see it anyways, no matter how it up.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.000
And I just referenced it in our chat. There was a meetup between the the Twitter Sonic people and the movie Sonic people like met up.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:59.000
But that means they didn't write the movie. Just just to be clear, I did go see Glass this week, which it was all right.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Yeah, I had watched like all the spoiler reviews and stuff like that beforehand and not a lot of people liked it.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000
And I see with their points, it was OK, but.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000
It's kind of like it's it's not the M. Night Shyamalan that made split and unbreakable.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:26.000
It's M. Night Shyamalan that made the Happening and all of the other movies, but not as so not as terrible as that.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
But it's just like. That's not really the way they are.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
All right, well, Detective Pikachu looks great.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Looks like it might already be happening based on some of that positive spin. So let's see. Anyway, moving on to more rapid fire news.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Remember, I talked earlier about how the game's got to get the price cut before it goes free.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Yeah, ironically, Overwatch is getting a price cut this week.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Overwatch on PC is down to twenty dollars. So if you want to get the standard edition of Overwatch for PC, it's down to twenty dollars.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
The original price was forty dollars, which I think was even probably a discount from there.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
The legendary edition, if you want some more character skins and the crossover stuff is now forty dollars.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
It was previously sixty dollars. So I'm not saying that like Overwatch is going free to play.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
This is a very different story. Overwatch been out for like two years. It might.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I know that's a lot of buzz that always seems to come up is that, oh, Overwatch might go free to play, but it doesn't seem to be yet.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.000
It seems to be they're still continuing to take the price down. I imagine the console versions will follow pretty shortly if they're not already there.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I think this is going to encourage more people to pick it up on a second system.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I think there's a lot of that happening because remember, Overwatch is not cross-play, nor do they seem interested in making it cross-play.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I think Blizzard kind of wants to keep the keyboard mouse people separate from the controller people.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I'm fine with that.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.000
It would be nice if they would put the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 people together, but they just don't seem motivated to do it.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Well, they could do the Xbox One and PC people together because they would have, you know, the keyboard mouse support, you know.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Or just separate, you know, cross-play.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
They're not going to do it. You're fanfic-ing. They're not going to do it. That's the reality.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I don't even care.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
But it's only $20 if you want to get a different version of it.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
But, you know, the console version's not changing, at least not yet.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
But we don't know what the future might hold.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
We do know what the future holds for the Epic Games stores and their free games giveaway.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
They're giving away Jackbox Games, the very first one right now.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Oh yeah, I should have picked that up.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
You can get that on PC. It's free.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
The next game they're going to be giving out starting February 7th, Axiom Verge.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
That's a pretty good title to be giving away for free.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
That is a Super Metroid-esque kind of clone.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Obviously, they did some things different with different types of power-ups and things, but obviously very heavily inspired by Super Metroid.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Axiom Verge. Great soundtrack.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
All done by one dude.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
One dude did, like, the whole thing.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
So it's a very, very great production.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:54.000
So yeah, I mean, I already own it on PlayStation 4, but I'll probably pick it up again for PC. Why not?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
It's free.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Exactly.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I think I have that on PC, actually.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
You should double-check and check that out.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I don't know. I have a vast library of stuff I don't play.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Metal Mayhem asks, where is the Jackbox giveaway again?

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
It's in the Epic Games store, so I don't have a link because I'm trying to do a show.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Just go to the Epic Games store.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Epic Games dot com, and once you install the store, it'll be there.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
And then, let's see, Dekeman says, just grab that on Switch. Great game.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I'm assuming that's Axiom Verge, not the Jackbox thing.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
But they're both great, in my opinion.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Actually, both of them are on there, too, I think.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Both are on Switch, you're absolutely right.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
So, yeah, Axiom Verge is cool.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
If you are a Super Metroid fan, like I am, I think you'll get a big kick out of Axiom Verge.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I thought it was great.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
And what's coming to a store near you?

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I think I know the big one, right?

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Well, let's start it off with Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this week.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
We have a game called Penguin Wars that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
The Sinks and the Cursed Mummy on Nintendo Switch.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Dragon Marked for Death on Nintendo Switch.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Robotics Notes Dash and Robotics Notes Elite HD on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown on PC.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And Wargroove on PC, Switch, and Xbox One.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Alright, traveling over to Japan.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Not coming out this week, Kingdom Hearts 3, because it's already out.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Came out on Friday. I actually have a buddy that imported it and has been playing it this weekend.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So, yeah, I guess it really happened, you guys.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 really is releasing after all this time. It's pretty exciting.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
But that already released in Japan, so that's why it's absent from the releases this week.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
But what you do have on the release dates, you have Nelke and the Legendary Alchemist,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Ateliers of the New World, that's coming in a regular anniversary and premium box.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000
So there's a lot of different editions of that coming out from Koei Tecmo on the PlayStation 4.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Conception Plus, Oreno Kodomo Wu Undukure comes out this week from Spike Chunsoft.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And a collector's edition of Stardew Valley goes to retail for the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Also, Dragon Ball FighterZ Deluxe Edition is available on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Traveling over in Japan real quick to take a look at the Switch.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
It looks like that same Nelke and the Legendary Alchemist is also available on the Switch.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
As well as Robotics Notes Dash is available on the Switch as well.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Dragon's Marked for Death, Fate Xtella Link, that same Stardew Valley collector's edition.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And Opus Collection, which includes The Day We Found Earth and Rocket of Whispers.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
That is all out. Oh, another duo edition on the Switch.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Child of Light Ultimate Edition with Valiant Hearts The Great War double pack.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
So, busy week on both platforms.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I guess now that the Kingdom Hearts 3 release happened, everybody else can come to the party.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Filling in for the year updates, Loki, while Dark Soccer is still out.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I will do my best, because apparently certain sites don't know how to sort by date.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Yeah, she was really thrown by that last week, too. She was not happy.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
So, we'll have to find a new...

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Alright, so...

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Where are you guys in Europe getting your release dates? Because we might need to follow suit.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
So, anyways...

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.000
So, Ace Combat 7, Sky's Unknown collector's edition out on PC this week.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
We've got... let's see...

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Jesus Christ.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Christ Sings in the Cursed Mummy. That's on the Switch.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000
We've also got Child of Light and a Valiant Heart double pack that's coming out on the Switch.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And Crash Dummy on the Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Dragon's Dawn of the New Riders on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And Song of Memories on PlayStation 4 and 8-Bit Hoards on PlayStation 4 as well.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And I think that may be it.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Alright.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Yeah, that is it.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Close enough. Alright.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Well, we're going to move on to the mailbag.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
You guys email us over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
and we read your emails here live on air.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
So, I really appreciate you guys who take the time out to email us during the week.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Let's get to the emails.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
First email tonight from Tom who emails us saying,

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Hey all, congratulations on making the jump to Twitch.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
All said, it looks to have been pretty successful.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I've been listening since the live 365 days and you've never failed to make me smile.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I've been wanting to give back in some way, so here's my OLR archive.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.000
A super ugly, super simple webpage that lists every OLR MP3 I could find.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And I guess I'm okay to give out the link here because it's in our email.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:53.000
https://olarchive.samurailink3.com

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I've pulled all the episodes I could possibly find on the website,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Misty's archive, and a couple others.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
If I'm missing anything, let me know. I'll get it added.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
This does auto-update every week, so there's no maintenance to it.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Feel free to mirror, advertise, or link.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Very cool.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
That's awesome.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I don't know where it's pulling those MP3s from.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Is it pulling from our own server?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
If it's pulling from the SkyDrive archive that was up there previously,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
or what all that pulls from.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I didn't look that deep into it, but that's still really cool.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
This does remind me, though, to warn you guys.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
This was something I really was supposed to take care of about six weeks ago,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.000
but OLR is going to actually be switching hosts behind the scenes.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
This should be a seamless thing.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
You guys shouldn't notice.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
It's just that the lovely space we've been donated for so long

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
can only sustain to be donated for so much longer.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
So we're going to be moving it to a different space.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Probably something a little more like,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I'm not going to say it's going to be one of the big podcast hosts,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
but likely one of the ones you're a little more familiar with,

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
which the good news is that's going to open it up to get it really easy

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
for us to get on things like Spotify and stuff like that.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But the downside is that because it will not be donated

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
and the space will not be limitless,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000
a lot of the old episodes are going to disappear.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
So if you are linking to anything at orangeontrader.com right now

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.000
that is an old episode, I would urge you to grab it and save it elsewhere

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
because they will be going away in a few weeks.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Now, again, going to be seamless.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
If you're just interested in the last ten episodes, the last five episodes,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000
you'll be fine because we'll copy those over when we go to the new solution.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
But the vast archive that we have already on orangeontrader.com

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
will be going away.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
So this email is actually very timely so I can kind of warn you about that.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Of course I would have still given you some warning,

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
but I do want to let you guys know it's coming.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I've referenced it a little bit on the show before.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Again, if you're listening to the pod, it's seamless.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
My big thing is that I don't want to lose the people already subscribed

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
because that's a big deal.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000
We've been on iTunes a very long time since the day they launched podcasting.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
So I don't want to lose the people we already have subscribed.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
So we'll make sure that that all gets done seamlessly for you guys.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Anyhow, dgramaS says, Rob, tell that person to contact me.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I have a few hundred episodes.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:14.000
So there you go, some OLR listeners networking together to listen to old OLR.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000
But I really do want to warn you, old OLR is very different from new OLR.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
We've evolved a lot in 17 years.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
So please do not judge the current state of Orange Launch Radio

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
based off of episode three.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Very different.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Anyway, Bobby says, oh, he's hosting each MP3 himself.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Wow, that's pretty cool.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Because I was going to say, there's actually more,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
and Bobby might be interested in this too.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:47.000
For other super nerd programmers like myself, Bobby, here's the API endpoint.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000
It will give you a JSON array of all episodes.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
JSON, JSON, JSON array of all episodes.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:03.000
So, https://api.olarchive.samurailink3.com.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.000
So that same link, but with API dot in the front.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
So have a ball with that.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Anyway, if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or hate mail, let me know.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
We now return you to your regularly scheduled RuPaul coverage.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
And that is from Tom.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I think it's awesome.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Well, we don't, because we have an email.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
We are not covering Drag Race right now.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
That's right. We have an email, so no Drag Race coverage this week,

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
which is a bummer, because there's a lot I could talk about.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
But you'll just have to listen to Reading is Fundamental

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
with my buddies from gamebuoy.org and video game realness doing that.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
So, anyway, thanks.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
That's cool.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Yeah, I endorse it.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Why not?

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Again, the footnote.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Old OLR is for you hardcore nerdy fans of the show,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
which I love you and I appreciate you.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
It's for you guys only.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I don't want new people to like, hmm, what's this Orange Launch Radio show about?

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
I've always heard of this, so they go and they don't download episode four.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Like, what the hell is this?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
It's old.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
It's very different. Very different.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Let's talk about an email from YYR.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Hello, LR. I wanted to take a moment to clarify something

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
about the impending closure of the We Shop channel.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Tuesday, January 29th is the last day that you can purchase content

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
from the We Shop channel using Wii points you already possess.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So, time is running out. You better get on that.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
You got until Tuesday.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Beginning Wednesday, you will no longer be able to buy

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Virtual Console or WiiWare titles,

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
and any remaining Wii points you have will be forfeited.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
It will be reinvested by Nintendo to make more money.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000
However, according to Nintendo's website, you will still be able to download,

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000
re-download previously purchased software even after January 29th.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
You will also still be able to use the Wii to Wii U transfer tool.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
These services will be discontinued at a future date,

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
but that date has not yet been announced.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000
So, that's interesting because all the websites are kind of running with something else.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
So, sorry.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
So, interesting about that.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
But, yeah.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I guess, though, I'm still okay with all the hysteria being out there about the closure

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000
because I think a lot of people probably haven't checked their Wiis in some time,

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
but this sets them up for that.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
You know, this sets them up to make sure you spend your points

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000
so Nintendo doesn't just take your money for free

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
and make sure that, you know, you've bought everything.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
And if you know the re-downloading ability is going away at some point,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000
you might as well just kind of have all that in order,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
even if we don't know the exact day yet.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
And I still think because it is scheduled to go away,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000
everything we said last week about the reality of digital and all that other stuff,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I think it still all holds.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
And there are, I think, tools to still be able to download that stuff.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I think people have a lot of that backed up,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
and you can still download it even if you don't.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
But, you know, you should.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And why do you still have Wii points? Seriously.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I mean, like...

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Spend them.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I don't even think they've sold those.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I need to just double check on my Wii U because I transferred it all.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I need to double check just to make sure.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I feel like I have, like, a 100-point balance.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I have one of those balances where I can't buy anything

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
because nothing is under 500 points, you know what I mean?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Yeah.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's where I'm at.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
They got me.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
They did the whole, like, what is it, 10 hot dogs in a pack but 12 buns?

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
That whole thing? They got me.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Anyway.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Yeah.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Moving on.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Oh, YYR finished up.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
So don't worry yet about losing access to those NES games you bought 13 years ago.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Life goes on.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Well, I'm worried.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Anyway.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
FrodoSwagons with our last email of the week saying,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
So, I've heard a lot of hype about the new Kingdom Hearts game.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I have to admit, I have never played any of the games.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
That being said, I don't really know a lot about them.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Can you explain what the games are all about?

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I kind of need something new to play and I'm hoping this may potentially interest me.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
And that's from FrodoSwagons.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Alright, y'all. Pull up a chair. We got a six-hour show tonight.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
We're going to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I honestly think that there used to be a YouTube channel that would do these wrap-ups of plot.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I don't know if they actually launched it or if I'm spoiling something.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
I really hope I'm not.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:20.000
But I know Captain Spike over at Game Buoy was supposed to be doing a Kingdom Hearts show at some point

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
that was going to kind of wrap it all up.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
So, I mean, obviously I want to endorse the content that my friends are making.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
So there is that.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
But here's the thing. Look, obviously we're kind of joking.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:38.000
We cannot possibly sum up the plot in even five minutes, let alone five hours.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:46.000
I see that Eurogamer has a plot synopsis of the games that you need to know before you play Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
So you could try that.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I know there's other more entertaining channels that will do a plot summary of stuff.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Just do a quick YouTube search and you'll find several videos talking about the story.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Here's the thing. Let me actually approach the question a lot more simply

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000
because he didn't say explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
He said, can you tell me what these games are all about?

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Why are people getting excited about them? Here's the reason.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:17.000
So when the Kingdom Hearts franchise first launched, it was Square Enix getting access to the Disney property.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
The Disney games that we had until then, I mean, you'd have a couple good ones like DuckTales, right?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
The epic game. Mickey Mousecapade was pretty cool on the NES as well.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
So you'd get some kind of hit and miss when it came to Disney games.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
But the thing that was special about Square Enix partnering up with Disney

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:39.000
is that you had a Square Enix RPG type of game but featuring Disney characters.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Now that's basically what Kingdom Hearts is.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Now it's not an RPG like Final Fantasy, although some elements are in that.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.000
It's a little more real-time action-y. It's more of an action RPG.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:57.000
It wasn't so much like Final Fantasy before, but now it's pretty similar to some of the Final Fantasy games

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
because those games are now real-time.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I would say mix it a little more with the gameplay of a game like Zelda.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:06.000
You know how Zelda is more action-y and in the moment and has RPG elements?

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:11.000
That's kind of like mix Zelda with Final Fantasy and that's kind of like how Kingdom Hearts kind of plays.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.000
And I encourage you to go there. Believe me, everybody under the sun is going to be streaming Kingdom Hearts 3 this week

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
because everybody's going to be like, I'm the first to stream Kingdom Hearts.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Everybody's going to be streaming Kingdom Hearts 3 on Tuesday.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I say everybody, but I can already see some people are going to be like, not me, not me.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That's fine. But when I say everybody, I mean a lot of your favorite streamers are going to be looking at it or checking it out.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
So go check out some of the folks that are streaming it. It will give you a better sense.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.000
But I think people get really excited about Kingdom Hearts because it is original Final Fantasy creators.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:50.000
The main, excuse me, characters. The main characters in the game were like created by Square Enix kind of like for Disney.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000
So like Sora, Riku, those characters were made by Square Enix but kind of like for Disney specifically for this game.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:03.000
But those characters basically travel to different worlds based on Disney franchises.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Which if I remember right, in the very first game, the very first place you go, once you get past like the town where they're all from

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.000
and you get to the central hub, the Traverse Town. I think the first one is Alice in Wonderland, if I remember right.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
So you go to a whole world based on Alice in Wonderland.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:24.000
And so you team up with, you don't team up with the Queen of Hearts, but you team up with either the White Rabbit or like one of the guards.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.000
It's been a long time since I played you guys. But like those guys will actually join like a party and will play with you.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.000
And like what you're trying to help bring order these different worlds and so forth and push back against the Heartless.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
And now I'm getting into the story that could go on for hours and hours.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:44.000
But this is why people love Kingdom Hearts because people really like Square Enix games, like Final Fantasy.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
And by the way, the Final Fantasy characters show up in these games too.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:56.000
So like when you go to this Traverse Town, like Aerith is there, Sephiroth is there, who is voiced by Lance Bass in the original Kingdom Hearts game.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
That is a true statement.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Sora was voiced by Haley Joel Osment, who I think is still voicing him even for the third game, even though he's like full on adult now.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
But when the first game came out, he was still kind of that kid that was in the sixth sense. You know what I mean?

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.000
So it's kind of interesting. But anyway, so it's like Final Fantasy worlds collide with Disney worlds.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
And that's what get people very excited about it because there's a lot of Disney fans out there too.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I mean, look at the opening moments of tonight's show.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
We geeked out for 10 minutes about Disneyland and Loki's trip there.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000
How much Kingdom Hearts content did you see at Disneyland?

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
None.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Isn't that unfortunate?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Well, I didn't look either. We spent very little time in shops.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I'm sure there was something, but I didn't go seeking it.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I didn't see any Tron stuff either. So, you know.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Yeah, that's unfortunate. Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is giving some input on this email as well.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:55.000
There was an interesting video from I think GameSpot that actually talks about the history and how Nomura wanted to make a game like Super Mario 64.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Square said the only way you could get that over is if you had something recognizable like Disney characters.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Then it went into the stuff about how they pitched it to Disney and how Disney pushed back.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000
And Nomura was like, no, we'd make the game my way or we don't make it at all.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And Bobby says Sora is still Haley Joel Osment in a higher voice.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Dinkman says Leon, or Squall, is voiced by David Boreanaz, Angel.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
If y'all are Buffy fans.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Let's see.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000
DarkTichyas says wasn't Kingdom Hearts the original elevator pitch since they were in the same office building?

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Oh yeah, I think I've heard that story too.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Dinkman says they have a Kingdom Hearts version of Donald and Goofy they pull out on special occasions in different Disney parks.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.000
One time I saw something Kingdom Hearts related at Disneyland. It was actually California Adventure.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
And I'm still sad to this day. I couldn't afford that statue.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I would love a Kingdom Hearts movie series.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
That would be just such a badass movie.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
We know Disney will do crossover because that new Wreck-It Ralph movie had that scene with all the princesses.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
It would be so fucking amazing.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I am so down for this.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Oh my god, a Netflix Kingdom Hearts show.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Except it would be on Netflix because Disney is launching their own Netflix.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000
So on the Disney service, Disney Go? Is that what they're called? I forget.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
But anyway, that would be great.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Oh, Bobby Lockl says there was supposed to be a Kingdom Hearts TV show on Disney XD. It got tabled.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Well, bring it back for this new Disney Netflix competitor.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
As if we need another thing to subscribe to.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Anyway.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Alright, let's move on. That was a good email.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Sometimes we gotta go back to the basics.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
We have to remember too, I think it's very important to recognize that first Kingdom Hearts game was what, like 2001?

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Like, some of our listeners, this is so weird to say, some of our listeners were probably like 5 years old when that first game came out.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
And they're like 20 now.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
And they're like, what was the big deal, you guys?

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I think this is a big reason why in the past few years, Square Enix kind of did those HD re-releases of Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Which kind of get people familiar with those again.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
So, anyway.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Alright, let's move on. We do have some more stories to get out for you guys before we get to your calls via Discord.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.000
If you're not already aware, last week we said goodbye to Skype and we said hello to Discord.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So if you want to call into the show tonight, you will have to be on our Discord at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I'll detail how that all works again in a little while.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Or you can refer to the pinned message in the OLR channel once you get there.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
In the meantime, some more news stories for us. Loki.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Alright, so the GDC put out a survey to game developers.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And we got some interesting information.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000
So 4,000 game developers filled out the survey.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:37.000
And it basically goes over different things, including working conditions, and uni-

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Uni-

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Uni-

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Hi, I can't speak today.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Unionization.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
So, let's go ahead and kind of run down some of the trends that we saw here.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:54.000
So, first off, the survey came back with about 50% of the game developers actually wanting to unionize.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Which is pretty cool.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:04.000
18% of the people that they had surveyed had also said that they were developing a game for a next gen console.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:10.000
And that Steam is the dominant PC and Mac download platform.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:17.000
But 59% of the people that they had responded to it, just like the 30% rev share.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Which makes sense.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Some other fun figures.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Nearly half of the game makers work over 40 hours a week.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Including, they said, 44% spent over 40 hours with about 3% averaging 60 hours a week.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.000
The driving factor of that is mostly self pressure.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
And wanting to work overtime just to get some of that stuff done.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
And, let's see, other fun things.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Aside from Steam, some of the other storefronts that are high on the list here.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
So Steam was the top with 47%.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Basically selling directly, so via your own websites, was 26%.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Followed by publisher owned Humble Store itch.io.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
17, 18%.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Last being Discord and Cartridge. I've never heard of Cartridge.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
That's something new.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Switch. Switch Cartridges.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:26.000
No, Cartridge is a website with K. Not necessarily Switch Cartridge.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:33.000
And, of course, they want, of course, a better portion of their profits.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:38.000
As far as unionization, they think that 47% believe that they should unionize.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000
26% maybe. 16% no.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Whether they think that workers will actually unionize, 39% or maybe.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
21% yes. 24% no.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Interesting. And this is all from GDC related organizations.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
And GDC is coming up in March.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
So I wonder if you'll be hearing more talks on this sort of thing.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.000
And maybe there'll be unions there trying to tempt people to unionize.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Just something like that. Could be very interesting.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:12.000
They're saying that the majority of the split right now in the game industry as far as developers is about 80-20 men to women.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.000
They're saying that most of the devs are coming from Europe and North America.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:23.000
That most of the people that responded have been making games for less than a decade.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:26.000
So definitely I can see that with a lot of the trends.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.000
A lot of those tools have become available more recently for free even.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Makes sense.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
It makes it a lot easier to get into it now.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Let's see. What else?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000
As far as the company size that they're working for.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
We'll just kind of go over this real quick.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
So larger companies over 500. About 20 percent.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Also tied with that though is myself only.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
So 20 percent working for themselves.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
2-5. 15 percent.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000
And then kind of around that 100 person range. About 10 percent.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
So, pretty neat.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Yeah. And the results are all what Loki's reading from is all available online if you want to check that out yourself.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Yeah. You can go to I think the GDC's website actually had the survey.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
You can check out. They have like a brief little summary there.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Let's see. Yeah. It was at reg.gdcconf.com.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
And then it's GDC's.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
That's their registration site.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Yeah. So it's their red site.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Interesting. I'll be. I'm very curious to see where this talk about the unionization and everything kind of leads in the future.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:36.000
You know that's not the first time that folks have talked about kind of coming together to unionize for you know some of these working conditions to be improved and so forth.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000
So I guess the only way it gets better is if everybody threatens to walk out if it doesn't.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000
But then there's a whole other flip side of that. Well we can replace you with somebody younger.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000
And so it's going to be an interesting battle to see what ends up happening there.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:56.000
So I think I think in a way what's really happening is that I think especially as you talk about with those numbers with how big the studios are.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I think you have a lot of people that are just like I'm out. I can make my I must start my own studio with my buddies and they'll be four of us and we'll get the Marvel license and make a new card game.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Right. I think that's kind of in some ways.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I feel like that is where the why they're not going to unionize is going to happen.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:22.000
It may be the case because you have a lot of people just get fed up quit go do their own thing and then they're perfectly happy doing it because the tools are out there to succeed as an independent person.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Look at look at Axiom Verge which we brought up earlier in the show. I was one dude.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:43.000
You know another one last interesting thing so that half of the devs that responded said that the switch was the most interesting platform and of those went out for have had their game sell the best on the switch as a platform.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:53.000
So that's pretty interesting. Yeah. All right. Well let's move on. I want to talk about something it's kind of a follow up to something we talked about last week because this is more late breaking news during our show last week.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:11:05.000
And I don't know if you heard it all about this Loki but there was a twitch stream that was going on that was trying to raise some money for a gender dysphoria charity which is transgender issues.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Mermaids is the UK charity that was raising this money and what's and I still don't understand the how and maybe somebody in chat kind of knows how this happened.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:25.000
But apparently what happened is that Congresswoman Alexia Ocasio excuse me Alexandria Ocasio Cortez AOC as people are calling her now ended up calling into this stream.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:37.000
And then that kind of had the streamers like sort of floored and she was able to talk about you know why transgender rights are important and how we're still fighting for you know those those qualities and so forth but also kind of talking about

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:47.000
like her own political platforms and you know some things because she's very recently in Congress and you know I realize she's a very polarizing person and I'm not here to get into our politics right or not.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:59.000
I'm just getting into isn't it fascinating that this is how she's communicating with people and I think is in a way and I must admit part of kind of what draws me to her is almost almost like she understands memes.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:04.000
She knows to go on Twitch like I think very often times we feel very disconnected.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I think for Washington is like oh it's just a bunch of old fuddy duddies that don't know what they're like there are a lot of old funny there are still there's lots I mean like you watch just like you watch any of these like different congressional hearings that they have about like Facebook and stuff and where they're asking just like grandpa questions about stuff like you don't know how to fucking computer work stuff.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Well well it's like it's just it's embarrassing you're embarrassing yourself.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:42.000
So I think when we talk about like you know where the Gen X and the millennials kind of feel a little distance from the boomers it's like it's to see that representation more I guess millennial in AOC's case representation.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:56.000
You know in Congress is pretty exciting for a lot of people just because you know you hear she is going on Twitch streams to promote you know her politics and the things she's talking about and I I kind of look at that and again regardless of whether you agree with her politics or not.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:04.000
It's kind of one of those things where it's like wow like we feel a connection to Washington D.C. in the gaming community.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Anyway Bobby Blackwell in our chat room says the way I understood it is that she tweeted about it someone working the stream and not on the air reached out to her and worked out how she could call in.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:19.000
So it was a match made on Twitter. What another frickin like how many people in Washington would you see connecting via Twitter.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Maybe the president has done a lot of business dealing on Twitter.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:34.000
It's hard to see these connecting with people. Let's see anyway. Deep man says she made a joke earlier about setting up a smash tournament in Congress. She's hip. Yes. How do you do fellow kids.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Anyway and then fifth dream says she made an all your base joke. And today she did the why not both thing. So she she's the meme Congress woman basically.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Anyway all that aside again I don't want to make this an AOC segment but my point is isn't that fascinating where like politics came to twitch and that's where we were kind of talking about last week.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:01.000
We kind of got into the conversation where it's like dude if you all thought twitch was an underground thing that people didn't know about before.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Like it's getting bigger and bigger and this is you know going back to the very beginnings of the show talking about you know where television going is the future of broadcasting.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.000
We're looking at it and what's kind of developing here very homegrown it's very very fascinating.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Anyway there was a very interesting article written over at Ars Technica that talked about the new online town square.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:35.000
And so I'm kind of citing that Web site in their article specifically because I thought it was a very interesting perspective on why everybody was kind of talking about this whole thing.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000
And you know also I'm talking about you talked about how like a game like World of Warcraft is sometimes like an interactive chat room.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.000
The simplistic gameplay is something to keep you occupied. But while you talk with friends you know that's how some people view it.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:54.000
And then you know now Fortnite a lot of people view that as less of a game and more of a social network.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000
You know as you know more and more personalities are coming up around Fortnite and things like that.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:12.000
So anyway they say in an excerpt from the article here a quote perhaps more than any other artistic medium games provide a handy latch point for that kind of casual secondary social interaction.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:19.000
And so they go on to talk about you know Twitch and so forth where the game itself is secondary to the people that are playing it.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:24.000
And then so lastly the article kind of sums up here.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.000
When people ask me what Twitch is my default answer is that it's a place to watch people playing video games.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
But that's really an incomplete answer.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:46.000
These days Twitch is often just a place is just as often a place where watching video games serves as a convenient excuse to gather with like minded streamers and viewers in the closest thing we have to a live digital town square.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:51.000
And I thought so shout out to Ars Technica and I believe that was Kyle Orland who wrote that article.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
I thought that was a really neat perspective on the whole situation and very accurate.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
You know we've talked about how like Orange Lounge Radio for you.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I don't want to be like we started the trend but you know I've tried to say it here at Orange Lounge Radio for years.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:15.000
We've all said like oh this show started because it was like it was us all gathering at the dinner table after playing DDR we were at the diner talking about you know DDR the music games and other games we enjoyed and just sitting around.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Talking about video games and that's kind of what we wanted to bring to the Internet.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Well it turns out that's a lot of people are bringing to Twitch is this very virtual space to have these conversations and kind of kind of what we're doing now.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I'm pretty sure everything you guys are seeing here on the side with the headlines that are coming up and everything you guys probably are already somewhat in tune with this.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Maybe not everybody.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.000
I know there's a few listeners out there that maybe follow games a little more casually so they hear about some things for the first time on here.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000
But I think there's plenty of you that already damn well know the gaming news.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:55.000
You're here for the discussion and I think that's super awesome and why we want to be able to participate with our listeners so it's not just Loki barking you and me barking you and all that stuff.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:04.000
It's you know us having a conversation and I think that's really cool and just so interesting about where the future of broadcasting and so forth might be headed.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
So what do you did you did you hear about that.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
The politician on Twitch and all that.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Yeah I remember reading a little bit about that I just didn't follow too closely but that's cool.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I mean I hope that helped out their stream with getting more coverage and maybe more donations.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Oh yeah sure.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I think the goal was like five hundred dollars and they ended up making like three hundred thousand.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Don't quote me on those numbers but it was like yeah the awareness because it wasn't just AOC that came on the stream.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:34.000
They got like Jim Sterling a lot of like you know personalities and people to call into that too.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000
So whoever the PR person was that did that.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I mean that's that's a person that ought to be hired like an EA or something to manage the communication there because whoever like managed that charity stream that was you know only aiming for you know a minor amount.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:03.000
All these I mean five hundred dollars is nothing to I'd love to raise that kind of money for an awesome charity but I mean just when that was the goal and they just shattered through the roof like that's that took some talent.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000
So props to the organizers quite frankly.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I'm looking at our chat over at Twitch at our own little town hall at a twitch TV slash vog network.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Fifth dream today is gives the tongue in cheek answer saying you go to my free cams and do the same thing with naked ladies.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Hey you know what.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
We all worship at some kind of temple I suppose.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Anyway bonds double six says filthy casual here.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Hey there's nothing wrong with that.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:38.000
That's why that's why I really don't like I don't like to talk down to the audience ever and I'm not perfect and I'm going to have my moments where I should have said something better.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:48.000
But I really do try to approach things where it's like I want to assume that like we're not just like like we're not the first person to break this news to you but at the same time if you haven't heard before.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Here's kind of like our take on what's going on it's kind of like a interesting fine line you have to walk sometimes right.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Yeah so anyway let's see guys you know says the twitch thing is cool but at the same time you don't want outsiders knowing about our secret places.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Once they see the twitch models dancing on their streams they're going to say it's a porn site and try to attack it.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:19.000
But I think that's just again that's like one small part that's like saying somebody met somebody on World of Warcraft and took them across the state line and killed them like that doesn't happen to everybody.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:27.000
It's it's horrible and it shouldn't happen to anybody but just you know unfortunately these types of crappy incidents happen in place.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000
I guess I just compared porn to murder sorry see what I mean about choosing my words better.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:38.000
But I mean you know what I mean like that is one small part that the the porny thing you know obviously you can't have full on porn on twitch.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:45.000
But the you know the the boys and girls that are you know using a little more appeal to sell you know their stuff.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I think that's really one small part of what twitch is offering.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:56.000
So anyway let's see other comments here.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Bobby Blackwell says I'd love to raise five hundred dollars for my favorite charity vog network LLC.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Hey we appreciate all the subscriptions and the bitty donations we really do.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:13.000
We've been very very pleased with how many of you guys are actually subscribing to visit the video archives or just support the network financially with your.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:19.000
You know a lot of you guys just using your twitch prime that you get anyway once a month on vog network and that's awesome.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Thank you thank you thank you.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:26.000
We you know we appreciate it and we we promise to spend your money wisely and really appreciate you guys kicking that in.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
But it's not mandatory it's never been mandatory and it's never going to be mandatory.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Fifth dream today also making the comparison that's like read it.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Some of it is a toxic hellhole but some of it can teach you some shit.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
That's true that's true. All right anyway let's move on.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Let's go to another story here and we're going to hear from you guys and open it up to the town hall of discord a little later on.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:21:00.000
But first Loki I sort of got you know what is this 2019 and still we have game developers setting up their games to have the physics run based on the frame rate.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Why why are we still doing this in 2019.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Apparently that's the situation though with Fortnite so Fortnite on the switch runs at 30 frames per second.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:22.000
And apparently with that you know apparently your guns fire a little bit slower at 30 frames per second versus like the 60 frames per second that you get on PC.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:30.000
So for example they took one of the guns and at 30 frames per second it took twenty seven point five two seconds to unload the whole clip.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:37.000
But at 60 frames per second they got it to unload the clip in twenty six point zero eight seconds.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:44.000
And of course you can actually increase that amount too with a higher frame rate if you have it unlocked.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:55.000
So is that very bad when we've got this cross platform thing going on. It is bad but it's also it's so like you know I I'm assuming it's pretty much similar to other game engines.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:02.000
But like I know with like Unity and stuff they have the time delta time stuff and I think that's part of just most programming languages.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:12.000
And that allows you to you know have all of your physics or all of your timing run at a consistent frame rate or a consistent rate based regardless of frame rate.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Why you lock it to stupid frame rate is beyond me. I mean other than I don't know the reason why you would do that but.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Here we are you know still doing that crap. So I don't know if they're going to fix this stuff but at the.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Well I'm sure now that it's been pointed out very much.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Yeah they said that they're aware and they're working on fix but they haven't gone in taking details of what that's going to be.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:44.000
But I don't know why they should even be pointed out in the first place it's done. But like you follow 76 to the same shit and even worse.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
So just mentioned by a chatter 53 today in our chair.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:56.000
So I mean along with that there is some good news though Fortnite is going to be changing the way that they do their loot boxes with this Fortnite save the world.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000
So what they're going to be doing now is instead of the loot boxes or loot llamas.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Basically they're going to players will be able to buy them and then open them to find out what they've received.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Apparently though the update the v bucks llamas are becoming x ray llamas.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:23.000
And before buying these new x ray llamas you'll be able to see exactly what they're going to receive in the players don't like anything in the llama.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:27.000
They can wait until the next day when the contents inside the llama will change.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.000
That's a pretty clever way to get people to calm down about this a little bit. I kind of like that idea.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000
X ray llama x ray llama. Yeah I like that.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:45.000
And then they're saying you know. So I guess I mean that's a neat idea I guess it's still going to be kind of random but you'll be able to see what you're getting.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000
But you know what random thing you're getting. Yeah you can save your v bucks or something. Yeah.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Adept in chat says isn't it still the same though it's random. Yes but it's very different when you know what random assortment you're getting up front.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:02.000
So your purchase isn't random. That makes sense. Yeah. What's your what you ultimately the transaction does not end up being random.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:09.000
There's no gambling involved. I mean you know what it is you're going to get. It's just what's generated that's random.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Right. And you can only it'll be different each day I guess. I don't know if you can purchase like more than one of these something and then it'll be different each time you'll have to play more for a night to find out.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:31.000
I'm not spending money on this. I did. I don't think I talked about it in my game because I think it was a couple of weeks ago at this point but I know it was like last week I went into Fortnite just to like fuck around in there and I was actually playing like the little like level editor and build your own thing.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:40.000
So it's kind of something I was doing messing around with on Fortnite trying to trying to get a little more of the creative mode as opposed to like shooting people in alpha because I'm not good.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:51.000
I'm not good at that part. But anyway. All right. Let's see a deep man says it's also great for data mining exactly what the player base is looking for.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Very interesting. They can kind of weigh like what selling and what's not interesting because you can't do that with a traditional blue box.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Frodo swaggin says I wish Rocket League could do that. Well you know if it does very well for Fortnite I'm sure other studios are going to look at that and go I want to do an x ray loot box.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:20.000
So we'll see. Anyway meanwhile hey remember PUBG. That was the game everybody was talking about before Fortnite and there's still there's still a lot of people playing player unknown battlegrounds.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:30.000
I'm being a little silly but I think it's really cool like what PUBG is actually doing. So there's an Xbox one event going on with snow sunglasses and it's a scavenger hunt basically.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:39.000
So I guess it's a new snow map in player unknown battle. Yeah. So if you are an Xbox one player playing on this map you're doing a scavenger hunt.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:49.000
So like they're posting a picture like here. And if you respond with a picture of found the spot here it is you go here then the first person upload that screenshot gets a bonus item.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:26:04.000
But you can only get that once the same person and get it every time. And there's actually some real life things you can win to a picnic mat a PUBG logo eco bag and a winner winner chicken leg dinner bag charm whatever that is neat.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Yeah I think it's I think it's cute. I like that. So I like when they kind of like blend the real world with games and have those kind of like I know they're not offering any of those grease proof controllers or anything anymore.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Not that I've seen but stay tuned. All right. All right. It's so nice to hear Rob at this from Bobby in our chat.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:33.000
It's so nice to actually hear Rob say PUBG since he said a year ago that he'd never be able to say it and would always say PUBG.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I still think the name PUBG is cuter and if it was a game involving pugs would be like super duper cute.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Somebody posted on my Facebook wall and I think I feel like we talked about this game before but some like shooty game where the cat was the weapon and you would pet the cat to reload.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:27:04.000
It's adorable. I didn't see that. Do you see that like post. So he posted on my Facebook wall. I just assume though the game where a modern cat and the cat reloaded I assumed it was that postal probably with the cat silencer.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Probably. Hopefully they give away some pugs and the x x ray. I don't see the Xbox pinata the x ray pinata. All right. Anyway let's move on.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:22.000
We got I think one or two more stories and then we're going to get to discord. So you might want to start lining up in our discord room over in the green room.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:33.000
I got to say though if like they had ran you know how they have all those blind bags and stuff at the stores if they offered them in pinata form that might be a little bit more appealing because at least you get to beat the crap out of it first to get you know the

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:45.000
stuff out. It would be fun. All right. So let's talk about sales numbers. So the 2018 MPD numbers are out and they have some more information to share about that.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:54.000
So they saw I guess we saw three point four billion dollars spent on games hardware and accessories and game cards.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:12.000
And apparently there was a overall growth of 13 percent over 2017. And then so for hardware Nintendo Switch sold the most in December and generating the highest dollar sales in the month.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:32.000
And then of course along with that let's see video games hardware sales overall is up eight percent to five point one billion dollars and then software wise seven point one billion dollars across all platforms seven percent growth over the year as well.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And apparently the highest annual amount since 2012 the top games for 2018 Red Dead Redemption 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and NBA 2K 19.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Let's see software charts. So for December we had Smash Brothers Ultimate number one Red Dead Redemption 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 4 Battlefield 5.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Those are top four there that Mario Kart 8 at number six. Still that is a lot Mario Kart 8 at number six Super Mario Party Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Spider-Man.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Overall of course I mentioned the top three that we had Madden Smash Brothers Ultimate number five for the entire year after one month after one month.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Spider-Man Far Cry 5 God of War Monster Hunter World and Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:40.000
That's pretty good for Monster Hunter being the number nine best selling game all year when I think for a long time they kind of thought the U.S. didn't get it so to speak.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I think we're going to see more Monster Hunter games in the future.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:30:00.000
In talking a little bit more about Smash so Smash Brothers Ultimate was sold so well that it set a new release month dollar sales record for an exclusive game beating the last previous record holder which was Halo Reach in 2010.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Well it sounds like Nintendo had a great year but it sounds like a lot of games did very well this year so you know that kind of ties in.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I think this is a lot of the same report that was in the very first story we talked about tonight.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:17.000
It was a huge year for gaming period. You know that doesn't really touch on the mobile end of things but still a very very good year.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:27.000
FertileSwagons in our chat before we get to our last story here says I think Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is going to die. They're not releasing enough content at a good pace.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Red Dead Redemption 2 is going to have a problem just because with Grand Theft Auto Online there's so much you can do with it like you can just go out and then they've done a lot of that where it's just like wacky shit with it.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:51.000
They've got like a battle royale mode they have a mode now that's sort of like oh what the hell was it we just talked about it sort of like Rocket League.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:31:03.000
They've got you know all sorts of different modes and like racing and stuff you can do in it but you can't really do that with Red Dead Redemption you're kind of limited to what exactly you can put in the game.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Like you can't be too weird I think with it and I just don't think we're seeing the appeal that they have with Grand Theft Auto Online. I don't think they're going to get as much of a return on investment they would hopefully get.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:22.000
I know I'm not really interested in it. I haven't even finished a single player campaign yet.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Better get to it. Yeah. All right. Well one more story for you guys tonight and this has to do of course. Of course we had to talk about this. I saved it for last but there was a brand new dance dance revolution game announced this week.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:44.000
So there was a solid gold cabinet. That's right. Solid gold cabinet. It's called DDR Ace 2 0 or a 20 if you want to be very American about it.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:58.000
A 20. But I guess it's actually pronounced ace 2 0 because last year was ace. So I guess this is ace 2.0 something like that. Anyway lots of people photoshopping the logo to say for 20 because if you look at the logo like you said make one minor little change.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:08.000
It was like it says DDR for 20 which would be a green cabinet not a gold cabinet. And then I did a really funny tweet. I thought I was being funny or I I photoshopped as bad Photoshop.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:22.000
I took out I actually used like the Apple drawing thing on the phone and I took out the two. And so it just says 40. So I said you think I remember what I I tweeted something like bitch I'm too old for DDR.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:31.000
I am dance dance revolution 40. So is this you know like one of those like it's hard for me to get excited about new DDR games anymore when I'm out of breath after I play Beat Saber.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Anyway it's not like we have a song list or anything like that it's just that hey the next DDR is a special 20th anniversary edition a shiny gold cabinet cabinet coming soon Japan of course.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:54.000
You know we'll wait. And it is a different cabinet they have. It's like it's based off of like almost like a dance rush cabinets that they have. So very slim. The arrows are kind of different too.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:18.000
So instead of the arrows being colored they're all gold and the LED lights underneath are red and blue. And I know that kind of playing that I guess the way they play is a little bit different too because I know that kind of affected some of the perfect attack competition that they're doing that some of the Japanese players are able to adapt to them faster than the U.S. players.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:30.000
But that was not the only game though that they announced. They have other games too. They have mobile games coming which is kind of neat. So they've got mobile games for sound voltex for BeatMania 2DX and for Dance Dance Revolution.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And these aren't just like you know the mobile phone games you may be thinking of. They're actual like it's like you plug in your phone or tablet into a TV and they have wireless dance.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:34:00.000
So they're going to be selling brand new soft pads and and for all of those who were growing up with DDR and saw way back in the day when they had on the PlayStation 2 the the arcade style controllers the ones where they're a thousand dollars that you could never touch because you couldn't buy them.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:10.000
You can only buy them through Konami style or something like that. Well they're going to be selling some of those too. Oh wow. And so they're going to be available for I assume this mobile version as well.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:23.000
They're also they have Bluetooth controllers as well for the 2DX and I think sound voltex as well. Very I would be so excited if I could play 2DX at home again.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:32.000
He's so good. But yeah it looks it looks very cool. I saw like some gameplay of 2DX and stuff and you can use a touch screen on there you can also use the wireless controller.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:42.000
So I'm curious to see how much all that's going to cost. But like here's a here's a picture like of the the actual arcade style controller. You can't say that when I can't show it. Sorry. We're looking at a picture but you can't see it.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:57.000
But it looks like it's fine. It looks like it looks like a DDR stage like a metal state. It looks like a solo a solo pad sort of with the it looks just like the old arcade style controllers that they had for the PlayStation 2.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:10.000
It's a metal pad with arcade arcade accurate everything. Although this one doesn't have like on the arcade they actually have like light strips around the whole thing on the bottom which is kind of cool.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:22.000
But very much like the old PlayStation controllers. But it looks really nice. I have a cabinet so I don't really need this crap anymore. Well we'll see. We'll see what develops to that. I'm excited about that.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:31.000
You know even if I joke that I am getting old for DDR maybe I just need to play more regularly again and then I could you know get get fit again playing some DDR. That would be very cool.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:44.000
All right. We are now going to open up the discord channels for your calls. If you missed last week's show and you don't know how the calls work now we said goodbye to Skype and we now open up our discord server for calls.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:55.000
So here's how it works. And I'm going to explain this a few more weeks and I probably will explain it less and less and refer you guys all to the pin post. But if you want to call into the show you just have to be a member of our discord.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:05.000
It's it's totally free. You just go to vog network dot com slash discord and you join it just like any other discord server like where your Pokemon people are rating or how you're playing an MMO online or whatever.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:14.000
And then if you do want to call into the show tonight you go to a channel called the green room and you can sit with some other all our listeners and chat amongst yourselves or test your audio if you want.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:25.000
But please be nice to and respectful to each other. You can sit in there while you wait for us to pull you in just again due to time due to resources due to me usually preferring people that haven't been on the show before.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:33.000
I may not get to everybody. Please do not be butthurt if you are not selected for all I try to get a good sampling if you want to increase your chances of getting on.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Tell us a little bit about what you want to call in about over on our orange lounge radio channel so that I know you're prepared.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:47.000
All right. Anyhow I think that all being said we're ready to get to some calls and look you didn't get to experience this last time right. This is your first time on discord.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I haven't been able to experience the wonder that is the wonders. I think the auto quality is a little better. I don't know. We'll see. Anyway let's get to it. We are getting to our first caller tonight.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Yeah. This is Bellamy. How are you. Hi. Good. Welcome back to all our what's on your mind tonight.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Well as you can see my one message on discord as I call in about games seemingly being dumbed down.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.000
No gradually over the past decade or so. No I mean.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Tell us a little more about that. Like yeah obviously the podcast listeners couldn't see your pitch there in the orange on radio channel but yeah I was I was kind of curious what your perspective is on this.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:36.000
You feel that games in general have been dumbed down in the past few years. Tell me tell me more about that.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Yeah. All right. Case in point you know most of us have grown up with stuff like this original Nintendo or Super Nintendo stuff like that.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000
And those games generally speaking have been brutally hard.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Those games never held your hand. They just gave you a flimsy you know instruction manual.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:14.000
We said good luck. You know kind of assumed that you're intelligent enough to figure out how to beat the game. I mean you know case in point.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Sure. Like the old school Mega Man games were very like you really had to memorize patterns to get through those games. It's like I go back and I play them today and they're quite difficult to play those games today.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Exactly. Now and to cite an example Resident Evil series at least once on the PlayStation 1.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:50.000
This may not be a great example but it's a little bit more recent.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:39:03.000
In order to save your game you have to use the ink ribbons. Those ink ribbons were in limited supply. So you can spit and the CAs every 30 seconds.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:12.000
You know now if every point five seconds if you want to. Yeah. Safety heart's desire.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.000
To be fair though wasn't the ink ribbon thing kind of fucking annoying. Like I kind of thought it was annoying even when I was younger and that was first out.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:32.000
But I mean I get I get it like I get what you're overall trying to say like it feels like you know games were like really really hard and now you know there's a lot of like easy modes and but there's folks in our chat room you know that that kind of like the easy modes.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Bobby Black Wolf you know he's a fan there. Gally in our chat room over at Twitch TV VOG Network says I play games to relax. So give me easy mode.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Let's see. Act Def says that's probably why I didn't like Mega Man back in the day. Here's the thing. I mean it seems like I don't know a lot of games that just went like full on easy mode.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:57.000
I mean maybe they've re approached some of the design things like the ink ribbon concept you gave. But I even think of like let's say OK the old Mega Man games are really hard.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:06.000
The newer Mega Man games just have a sliding difficulty level. So if you want to play like a really easy level you can do that and you can get through the game and experience the story and all that stuff.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:12.000
But if you're the type that wants to bang your head on the wall and only have a certain amount of lies we're going to go all the way back to the beginning a level and so forth.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:21.000
You can kind of do that. So I mean I think that's kind of like where the games right now is that there's a little bit more of a sliding scale and I think I think Metal Mayhem were a lot of that.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:30.000
A lot of that I think probably has to do with accessibility in some ways. And you know we talked about how gaming was a very and this goes back to the very beginning of the show.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:39.000
We started at you know 6 o'clock Pacific talking about how you know the gaming industry has grown it's grown and grown and it's a multi-billion dollar industry.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And now we have politicians going on Twitch feeds to talk about Donkey Kong 64 and these sorts of things that were unheard of several years ago.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:54.000
And I think part of that is because more and more people can understand games and can play games easily.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Because for some people Rage Nator and I know for like hardcore gamers like you and me this is sometimes a tough concept to grasp.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:10.000
But like with an Xbox controller if I were to hand I'm pretty sure I did this when I like was showing my mom you know when she was still with us different video games.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:17.000
She'd be like there's too many buttons on this thing how do you remember what button this is there's so many buttons on this thinking thing right.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:29.000
That's how a lot of people kind of react to controllers right now you can play so many different types of cell phone games just with your finger just touch doing very intuitive sorts of things.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:39.000
And I think I kind of think that accessibility and the easiness part I think also opens up games to more people.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Because there's a lot of video games out there that are very narrative based let's take a game like Mass Effect for example.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:51.000
That you know what some people don't necessarily want to do pew pew shooty shooty they just want to experience the story well guess what EA wants that money too.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:42:00.000
So there's an easier mode in the game but for those that like the combat and that stuff you do have that more sliding scale level of difficulty I feel like you were going to say something.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Yeah I was going to say that you know I do I was kind of on on the same side with how you know I feel that a lot of games they had dumbed down but not necessarily done.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:27.000
I think it's now that they've added a lot more accessibility this stuff I know with my kids you know trying to get in the games they wouldn't have the patience to play a harder game like that if they kept losing at a game they're just not going to want to play it anymore because you know 5,000 games.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Well it's just like everybody kind of has like ADD when it comes to like just entertainment in general if you're going to get if something is going to bring you frustration because it's so hard then you're just not gonna play it whereas remember when we started playing games you know a long time ago.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Arcade games were kind of the thing that was popular and you were used to games being hard because they would eat your quarters and that was the point of the game was to make money for the arcade.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:58.000
And then you take the home game and it's slightly easier because hey guess what I don't want to keep paying money to play this game.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Yeah it's insanely hard still and that could be just because they're porting stuff over from the arcade and they didn't change anything or that's just you know the attitude that they had.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:20.000
They didn't need to you know dumb things down so much but and also controls are a lot more simpler than I think now like with all the accessibility options they have like with some of the Mario games stuff that add this like a little bit easier mode into it.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:29.000
I think it does help people you know keeps kids and stuff entertained in the game without getting overly frustrated with it.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:37.000
And I noticed in our chat room also some folks talking about Celeste. Bobby Blackwolf points out I also like how Celeste handled the assist mode.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:44.000
They never degraded you for it. They just said here it is. We'd love for you to try to play first without it but we understand that may not be the case. We hope you enjoy our game.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Here's something else to think about. I'm sorry Metal Mayhem I keep talking and don't let you speak but I'll let you speak out of this.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Here's something else to think about. Like you know if you take more of the concept of a game anybody can get out there and pick up a basketball and try to throw it in the hoop.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Anybody can do that. But sometimes the rules get changed a little bit depending on the crowd right. If you have kids playing maybe you won't mind so much if they hold on to the ball and don't constantly dribble it if they do a little bit of traveling.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:23.000
But you know what. I mean if you want to get elitist about basketball or you know the fact that you know well it takes a long time to get really good at basketball. Yeah it does.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:34.000
But the mere concept of basketball ball in hoop that's very accessible for everybody but it takes a lot a lot of time a lot a lot of practice to get really really good at basketball.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:43.000
So you can do those that shit where you fly through the air and do the dunks and all that stuff and get paid millions of dollars to do it in front of an auditorium of screaming fans.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:59.000
But at the end of the day basketball and pretty much put any physical sport in there is really only limited by the cost to buy a ball to buy the stuff needed to play the game which even then I think some people improvise.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:08.000
We're going to play basketball but we're going to just do it with this bouncy ball that I just kind of had available. Anyway your thoughts your thoughts on our response middleman.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Well accessibility is all well and good but you know some sometimes things have been at least in my experience been done for accessibility.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Yeah. Okay. Take you know you know you know to a large degree like for example you know in some of the Metal Gear Solid games you know you know something in the outside you know you get a bid bid dialogue.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:51.000
You know the colonel may say ah I see you found this item to use this item. You think push the click button.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:46:01.000
That's just kind of that's also kind of like the game just kind of like giving you a tutorial without that's like a you know a game a game maker and a storyteller can kind of choose.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Do they want to just have a little pop up menu that comes up and says here's how to control your character use the stick to this.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Some games do it that way but some games kind of choose to do it in a very like tongue in cheek way where they have the characters explain it to you.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:21.000
And that's just that's just kind of like a narrative choice on the part of the developers. Anyway Metal Mayhem great topic and great question.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:31.000
I am going to let you go so we can get some more calls tonight. But thank you very much. I thought that was a good discussion if nothing else on accessibility and games and the difficulty and all that and kind of where we come.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Here for next night. Yeah you too. Take care buddy.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:44.000
All right. Again if you would like to call into Orange Lawns Radio join our discord and you sit there in the green room channel which is only one person in there now.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:53.000
There's about to be zero and you can give us a call. It really does help to to tell us a little bit about what you want to talk about tonight down in our Orange Lawns Radio channel on discord.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.000
But for now let's get to another call. Hi you are on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Hey what's going on. It's Ron. Hey Ron. It's always good to hear from you. What's on your mind tonight.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Oh some stuff besides the fact that I rebuilt my computer in two hours today. That was kind of fun. Hey I was seeing you chat about some of that earlier in the chat room.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Congrats on that. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. It was like it happened Thursday night. I'm like go out buy a new power supply to get it working.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Didn't work. Talk to one of my staffers and we got my rebuild going showed up yesterday. I came home from my trip put it together.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:38.000
I'm more happy about the fact that I did not have to reinstall windows or any other application but that's not why I call.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Some people speed run video games you speed run computer building and that's fine. All right. No. In all seriousness what's on your mind tonight.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:48:06.000
In response to earlier talking about cable and and digital streaming services. I pay one hundred and thirty five dollars a month for files and that's for their near extreme package that I've been grandfathered in and a one hundred one hundred megabit connection.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:22.000
And sometimes I look at the stuff that I DVR and I'm like do I really need half these channels. But then I realize if I change those channels I'll lose my HBO and my Showtime that I will watch maybe four or five times out of the year.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:45.000
And it's like I kind of want to cut that down because we're kind of getting to the point where cable providers just need to offer you the base package with some base programming and your choice of like four different streaming services you can add to your bill for like a hundred bucks a month. You know it's crazy.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I'm also typing with our multitask typing with our twitch room. But yeah. No. No. I was worried about the echo factor. I'm just like I just rebuilt this machine. We can't happen. No no no. We hear you fine. You're you're you're totally good.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Sweet. Yeah. You it's I mean even like HBO. I mean HBO is kind of selling their own online service too right. Yeah. But here's the thing.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:30.000
You can get all of HBO's content and I believe access to the state channels for like 17 bucks a month or you could probably pay a few dollars less a month and get through your cable provider and just add the app because the app is so different from the streaming service.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:42.000
It's the same thing. And sometimes if you're lucky providers will tell you like for like 20 bucks a month pick three premium movie packages and it's like you can't go wrong with that. You know.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Yeah. I do want to warn you buddy. The echo is back a little bit. You know we are hearing ourselves that go through. So you're going to have some more troubleshooting to do maybe and some testing. Sorry buddy.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:50:06.000
I'll have to try another USB port on my machine. My apologies. No it's fine. It happens. That's what that's what happens anyway. But I am going to let you go for now. Everybody I hope we'll check out anime jam session on Tuesday nights here at Vogue Network.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. Take care buddy. Bye bye. All right. And that is that's everybody that wanted to call in so far. I'll give it a couple more minutes to see if anybody else calls in. But do you have any last minute stories of the things you want to get to right now.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Real quick. Yeah there is over 500 games on backwards compatibility for Xbox One now. Nice nice milestone that they've hit and they're saying that 538 titles and holy moly.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Yes. They said currently only 33 original Xbox games are backwards compatible. Hey better than zero. This is true.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I was trying to see if they had like a count of four of the most popular games on there but I don't see it. That's too bad. Oh yeah. That'd be cool to know like which games are being backwards compatible played the most. I bet like the original Red Dead Redemption is way up there.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Probably oblivion. Oh here we go. Here's a breakdown. Let's see. They actually have some numbers. Yes. The top most requested. Oh this is the most requested titles by votes. Black Ops 2 Red Dead Redemption Elder Scrolls Skyrim mostly Call of Duty so Modern Warfare 2 Modern Warfare Modern Warfare 3 World of War Mass Effect 3 Fallout New Vegas.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I thought the trilogy was the whole trilogy was playable on backwards compatibility. These are the most requested tiles by 2015. Oh that's old numbers franchises fully playable on Xbox One backwards compatibility just cause mass effect.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Bioshock. Let's see here. Saints bro. Hey you know you got to get Microsoft credit. That's and as Bobby points out in chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network. Do you have to rebuy all any of them if you own the original discs. No you do not. Yeah it's pretty awesome. Yeah very awesome.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:18.000
I hope if Microsoft can kind of keep that messaging going into their next console they're going to win a lot of fans. We'll see. Yep. It would be great if Microsoft could be like hey because of trademark law and patents the time on the original PlayStation hardware has run out.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:36.000
So the new Xbox will let you play PlayStation 1 games. I'm totally fan faking. It's not serious. But why don't they sell those we blame now. They sell those like fakie Nintendo Super Nintendo 5 or they sell those like fries and you know pretty soon people are going to be able to do that with original PlayStation.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:51.000
So it'd be hilarious if Xbox are we getting. Are we going to have a soldier boy Microsoft collab here. Is that what we're doing. Let's hope not. All right. I'm so sorry I even suggested it. Anything else for last minute stories.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:53:04.000
There was it looks like a mod that's being worked on that's trying to put legends all that into doom. Yeah I kind of saw it reminded me of when somebody tried to go the V.R. route with you. Yeah it's like three.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:16.000
And I was like some things just don't need to be done. No it it does look cool though. But if I remember right. Didn't the guy like he started it but he's not able to finish it. So he's kind of like here's everything I've got. Hope somebody else will pick it up and finish it.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Yeah. So he's released it. It's a Zelda slash Doom mod that's on mod DB. You can go check it out if you want to look at it or finish it or whatever. All right. Well it doesn't look like we're getting any other callers in tonight.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:43.000
So I think we will go ahead and kind of wrap up here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight. So I do want to really thank you guys for listening to the show tonight whether you're watching us live over on our twitch TV vogue network channel or if you were downloading the podcast and listening to this.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:54.000
And if you've just found the show tonight randomly on Twitch remember we have a whole back library of episodes available in all your favorite podcast places like iTunes and Google Play probably being the two big ones.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:59.000
So if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio we certainly appreciate all the follows and the biddies and all that good stuff.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:04.000
But we really appreciate if you tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:18.000
But we can only have those voices. So many of them heard unless we get more people here. So you could tell a friend and that goes a nice long way a little a tweet or a five star recommendation on a place like iTunes goes a very very long way.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Loki great to have you back this week. We missed you this week. But hey everybody needs a Disneyland vacation once in a while or some type of vacation. It's been a long time it's been like eight years.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Yes sir. You know more than eight nine years actually. So do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight. My final thought is I'm going to try to stream more this week. I know I've been kind of slacking on it but it's been it's been like a combination between just I just don't want to do it at this time or fighting with hardware because like it seems like every time I go to streams like something else is broken.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:55:11.000
What is it going to be today. I haven't streamed in like two weeks. Most of my energy and time has been going into this. I have my I've been neglecting my personal stream so I really want to get back. But then then Bobby and I are chatting off the side and it's like what if we did this new thing and that new thing and I'm like it's going to be a long time before I get back to my personal channel.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:33.000
But really exciting stuff on the horizon. It's not a bad thing. Still trying to get affiliate. Haven't quite hit that yet. What are you missing the followers. I'm probably missing everything. I don't know. Just keep keep at it. You'll get there. I don't know. But yeah it's just still not quite there. I definitely don't have the followers yet. I'm just trying to see if I can even see where I'm at here.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:55.000
I think if you go to the either act stream summary I think is where it see stream summary and analyze that's where you can see on the right side. There should be a section that says path to affiliate. You guys probably scroll down. You're not going to see it yet. Let's see. Maybe not. I know. I know it's somewhere here. Maybe in the very channel here. Oh here we go. Analytics channel.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Anyway we don't want to bore the listeners. We've got to wrap up. Not there yet. So you'll get you'll get there. Just keep at it. Keep at it. You your setup is great as more people discover you. I think you'll you'll have more of a base watch in the DDR stuff especially because it's classic stuff. Anyway my final thought tonight is I'm going to play some more Beat Saber and clear some more songs because I had a lot of fun doing that. That was my way of getting some exercise this week. I also still need to come cameo at your house and on your stream. That's still a thing we need to set up. Yeah we do need to talk about that. So maybe we'll try to make that happen.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:41.000
This week or next. So anyway thanks again for listening to or watching orange entree or whatever the case may be. We'll be back in seven days to do all over again. I know next week is Super Bowl Sunday so a lot of you are going to be preoccupied but we will be here because I don't really have a say in football.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:52.000
I don't even know who's doing the halftime show this year. Sometimes I get excited about the concert. I don't even know who's playing this year and the commercials they're all posted the day before at this point. So I'm kind of like whatever on Super Bowl.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:57:05.000
So we'll be here and Loki I know you're not really a football watcher so you will you'll be here too. So I'm so yeah I need I'm at 40 followers. I don't have I need 10 more followers to do that.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:17.000
And then an average of three viewers in the last three days I'm averaging two and then any more chatters. So we're almost get there. I don't care. Whatever it's fine.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:29.000
You'll get there. All right. Oh they say in chat Maroon 5. Oh I didn't realize. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever they do will be all right anyway. Sorry to the Maroon 5 fans out there anyway. We'll be here Sunday Bobby will not be here.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:43.000
He does a big like gathering. It's a big day for him and his friends which is the case for a lot of you will still be here producing a new show if you can't be here. We hope you will be here live. But if you can't be here live of course check the podcast feed next week or for those of you that subscribe to our twitch channels.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:59.000
You can access all the video on demand whenever you want. But the audio as always will always be free over on our iTunes listing or Google Play wherever you find the show. That's it. We're going to wrap up. We'll see you next time in seven days. We'll do this all over again. Have a great week everybody and good night.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:27.000
At 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or Vogue Network. But you know they were all still true.
