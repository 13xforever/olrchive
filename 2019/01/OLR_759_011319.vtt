Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, Nintendo sees the return of mainline Final Fantasy games soon to be available on the Switch, starting with a few with X in their name.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
There's plenty of news about ports, revivals, and growing pains in this week's news, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 759 for this January the 13th of 2019.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello, I'm here in studio.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
You are here in studio. How have things been for you this past week?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I've played a few more games than I've played last week.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Good, good. So we'll get into that in our gaming week in just a little bit.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
But we have some other exciting stuff to get to at the top of the show.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Just checking in on the Broccoli Saga. Do the kids know yet where they're going?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
No.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Still don't know?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Still don't know.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
And when is the big trip?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
It's on Friday.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, so it's the reason why you're not here for the next show?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yes.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Okay, this is going to be interesting.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
All right, well I look forward to it.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
All right, anyway, let's see.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I guess let's get right into our kickoff topic tonight, right?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Not here tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers?

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
You guys joining us, of course, at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
For more information, you can visit VOGNetwork.com

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
where there's lots of great indie shows to check out.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And for those that are watching the video live tonight,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
you'll notice we started in that tiny little box.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I don't know what the heck happened there.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I think something, when we took the Skype call,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
changed the setting back on the camera

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
because it's not as sharp as it was earlier.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
So this is where that whole Skype thing is getting in the way of the show.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
So yeah, we're learning a lot of stuff as we're going here.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't know.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
No, I guess it is set on high.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I don't know.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I can't figure these things out.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Technology is hard, Loki.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It looked really good earlier.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It was nice and sharp, but now that we're broadcasting,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I don't know, it's kind of...

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't know.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I don't know.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I guess maybe as long as you guys like it, then we're good.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
That's all we're good.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Of course, you can join us in our chat room

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
over at Twitch.tv slash VOGNetwork,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
and we do get some comments there.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
PixelPaka is commenting on my Golden Girls t-shirt.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Yes, we do own a few to go with the Golden Girls calendar behind Loki

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
that he picked up for me.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
And bonds006 says,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Hello there, got my girlfriend to watch,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
so tell a friend to tell a friend.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, hello, girlfriend,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
and thanks for watching Orange Laundry tonight.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I appreciate that.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So let's get into something I know folks have been waiting for,

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
the big time capsule.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
And I know folks are going,

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
time capsule?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And this time you can see it on Twitch.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Time capsule?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
How far back does this go?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Like, is it from the 1970s, the 1980s?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
No, it's from one year ago.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
It's one year ago that we filled this up

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
with our gaming predictions and sass and memories from 2018.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Well, technically, some of those are from two years ago

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
because I just put the old ones back in there.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
What? You mixed them up when I wasn't looking?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yes, I did.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
This should be a good time.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Because nothing ever changes.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah, all right.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Well, anyway, this time we'll empty it out

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
when we're done tonight.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But just on a personal note,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
just think about,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
and the joke is, too,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
is that when we talk about one year back,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
how long of a memory span do a lot of gamers have?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Like a week?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
In general, yeah, right?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Forgiving game companies for the mistakes they made,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
games that get delayed and so forth.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
It's sometimes hard to go back and remember

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
where our heads were at a year ago,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
which is part of the reason why I think going back

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
and listening to really old episodes of OLR is difficult.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Because if you listen to,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
and we've been on the air over 15 years,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
you go back and listen to stuff from, I don't know, 2006,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
when the Wii was first coming out,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
and the stuff we were saying about the Wii's successor,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
it's just ridiculous stuff.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
It's just funny how much things change.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
So a lot can change in a year.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And we moved to Twitch in a year.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
That was a big change, right?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
So now we're doing a video thing as well as an audio thing,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
although, of course, the podcast is still the same.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We're coming to you in video form as well.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
And big thanks to all you guys out there,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
because with your support,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
we did hit affiliate status on Twitch.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
VOG Network did last week.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
And now you can actually subscribe to VOG Network

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
using your Twitch Prime subs,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
or if you're feeling so generous with a regular sub,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
tier one, tier two, tier three, tier four,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
tier one, or what have you as well,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
we can take bitty donations.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So I just want to thank you guys so much in advance.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Since we are taping a podcast, I do just want to address,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I know a lot of your favorite Twitch channels

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
like to read the bits.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I know I do when I'm broadcasting on a personal channel.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I'll say, thank you so much for the bitties,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
VG Realness, I appreciate it.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Or thanks, Act Deaf, for that subscription

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
three months in a row, you know, like as I'm playing.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
But since the goal here is to tape the podcast

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
and keep our podcast moving,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm not going to be interrupting every few minutes

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
to address the very kind, generous things.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
But we will hope you will appreciate

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
a little scroll along on the bottom

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
so you'll get a little shout out

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
at the bottom of the screen live on Twitch.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And then at the very end, when our recording is done,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'll go back and give y'all special shout outs

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
and thank yous.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And just in general, like if the chatters can help me

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
just thank folks as they see them

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
because I know it pops up in chat as well,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I would like super appreciate that.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
So thank you.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
So that way we don't have to keep interrupting our podcast

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
because that'd be really weird

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
for people listening in the car right now

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
and like, you know, they can't see the video and all that.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
So, all right, enough of that.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Let's get into

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
the time capsule.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Let's do it.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Let's do it.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Let's see what's in Darth Vader's head.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
All right, I'm going to put,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
there's a million pieces of paper in here.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Okay, first thing from some year at sea,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
this is a monkey.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, that's me.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Nintendo will stop 3DS or 2DS production.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, that didn't happen.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
In fact, there are new 2DSs doubling down.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
You bought your kids 2DSs this year.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Well, that ended up being wrong.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
All right, let's see.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Next.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
This looks like a Jamie.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Games Jamie is looking forward to in 2018.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
We're looking forward to that.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Dragon Ball FighterZ.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So I know she's been talking about that a lot,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
so she did appreciate that.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Well, that didn't come out.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, we got the Nintendo-ish one.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
The concept type of thing.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
The prequel-y thing.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
The 8-bit version.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
That was pretty cool.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
And this is the funny part.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Final Fantasy, you can't even,

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I don't know why I'm flipping it over.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
You can't read it.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Final Fantasy VII Remake.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah, that ain't fair enough.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Kingdom Hearts III is coming first.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
All right, next up.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I think this is me.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, it's me.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Did I enjoy 2018?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Overall, I think so.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Actually, I will say, okay,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
so you guys have to remember personally

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
my mindset at the end of 2017.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I had a terrible year in 2017, personally.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You guys all that have been listening a while know

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
it was just a big year of ups and downs, mostly downs,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
except marrying my husband was a big up

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
since he just walked into the room next door.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
All right.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But did I enjoy 2018?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Overall, yes, I did.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
And then I put Metroid Prime 4,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Mother 3,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Secret of Mana remaster.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
That was okay,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
but I think because they kind of like

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
built it from the ground up,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
it ended up having some bugs,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
and it kind of didn't end up hitting

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
as well as I think a lot of people were hoping.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
So that one ended up being okay, I guess.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
So, all right, let's see.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I'm trying to look in chat.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
S2 100 mad degrees.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
2018 was okay, a lot better than 2017 for sure.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Oh, this one's a big one.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Okay, who wrote on two sides?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, because that one's 2017.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
No, because you wrote 2017 here.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
This is the 2018 side.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Top games, 2017 Skyrim, South Park,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
my game, 2018 Burnout Paradise remake,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Red Dead Redemption 2, Borderlands 3.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, they didn't get Borderlands 3.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I would have looked forward to it though.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Okay, and you also wrote on here,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Ready Player One didn't suck.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
And it didn't.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
That was pretty good.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I watched that in theater to Black Wolf,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
and it was a decent movie.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
All right, let's see.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
We got another big one here.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
This is fun.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Time Capsulin.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Okay, oh, this was the chat room.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Oh, we're reading.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
You guys, you ready?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I wonder how many of you are here tonight.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Here we go.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Chat predictions.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
VidPower in chat says,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
U.S. will never get Mother 3.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Hold out hope.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Hold out hope.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Let us have this one thing.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
If they can keep putting Lucas in Smash Brothers,

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
maybe there's a way.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Maybe there's a way.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
All right.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Chat predictions.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Dungeon Buster.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
EA announces Anthem mix details

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
and are not as bad as people think.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Well, that one's kind of a mixed bag

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
because of all the fuckery they did with Mass Effect.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Some of us have a sour taste in our mouth.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Well, they did announce the details.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
They did announce details,

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
and then they delayed it.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
So there was that.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
JD and ActDeft said,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Pokemon main series game on Switch.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I mean, you got the Let's Go, right?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I mean, we know the real main game

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
that a lot of people are looking forward to, obviously,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
is next year,

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
but we know the Let's Go didn't turn out so bad, right?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't know.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
All right.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Anyway, let's see.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
TigerCloth.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
VR games will be playable by non-VR users.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Well, in some cases that works,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
but I would say like the VR game that every...

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
What would you say would be like the big VR games

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
that everybody's talking about from this year?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Tetris Effect.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
So that's true.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
What TigerCloth said would be true

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
when it comes to Tetris Effect,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
but not Beat Saber.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
No.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
And Beat Saber is kind of a must-have.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
So I think there's still a lot of

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
what does the developer want to do with that going on, right?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Anyway, we're reading your predictions,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
ours and yours,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
from the time capsule that we did a year ago.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Fifth Dream says PlayStation 5 announced.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Womp womp.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Got that one wrong.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Sorry, buddy.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Rocket League cross-play on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Ding, ding, ding.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Kaijuto got that one.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
And that kind of ended up being a big fucking deal too

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
when it came to cross-play.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
And who could have predicted Sony's kind of stubbornness

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
in that whole thing going on there?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
So score one for Kaijuto.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't always agree with what the man says,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
but he called that one and called that out specifically

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
and kind of that ended up being a big headline

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
earlier in the year with the whole cross-play thing.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
All right.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Well, so far, Kaijuto scoring better than any of us.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
All right.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Let's see.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Let's look at another one here.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm pulling these out.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
All right.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Next one.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Jamie's secret wish.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Drumpf impeached.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, I didn't.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Sorry, but sorry, lady.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
And I get my own YouTube channel.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Well, you could do that.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
She streamed on Twitch a few times.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
But sadly, I don't think she could have predicted

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
that her day job, but I mean,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
she had a lot of good news at her day job,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
which is why she's not able to be here on Sunday nights

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
with us in studio.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So, I mean, I don't know if anybody

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
could have predicted that.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
All right.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Let's see.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Next one.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
We've got a lot of ones that are like tied up in others.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh, this is you, Logie.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
The AAA gaming industry will continue to fuck up games

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
using even more predatory loot box tactics.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Ding, ding, ding.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Okay, how would you say that was a win?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I didn't say it was a win.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I just said it was accurate.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah, but like what have they done?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I would say the loot box thing's been scaled back a little bit,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
but what have they done?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
There's laws against some of the loot boxes

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
because it's basically gambling and they've decided,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
hey, guess what?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Instead of following the laws,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
we're just going to not follow the laws

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
and do it anyways.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Or the whole fact that, you know,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
loot boxes ruined a ton of games that came out.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Well, actually not so much in...

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I mean, there's still some...

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
No, actually, no, still quite a bit.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
So like, for example, Call of Duty Black Ops 4,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
they reintroduced loot box...

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
They're starting to get smart about it.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
So the game got reviewed and then they put in the loot boxes.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Okay, so that's more predatory in a way.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
So skirting around reviews by putting in the loot boxes after the fact,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
because I don't think that's the only game where that's happened.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
No, it's not the only game that's happened.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
Well, Modern Warfare Remastered, also Activision, did that.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
You have games like Fallout 76 where the game is in a shitty condition

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
and then they're still trying to throw in the loot boxes on top of that.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
So yes, it's still true.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
All right, let's go to the next one.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm seeing if chat is agreeing with you or not.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Akdeft in chat says, laws against loot boxes because gambling.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, we haven't seen anything really, really move on the laws front,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
but is anyone surprised when it comes to law and how slow all that moves?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't know about that.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Another Loki one here.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
New second gen VR headsets.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I mean, this is kind of a safe one.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
We got the Oculus, like the redone Oculus thing.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
They showed some more stuff off it, because this week was also...

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Consumer Electronics Show.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, so they did have some stuff they're showing there,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
but it wasn't like, woo, this is amazing, or anything like that.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
So this is a really safe pick from Loki, but all right.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Let's see, I'm looking at chat.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Questbuster points out EA moved ahead and disclosed the odds

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
for their team packs in FIFA, so there was that.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
So some companies are coming around on it.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Let's see, and Bobby Blackwell says they removed them from FH4

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
before it came out and are going to be removing them from FM7.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
And Bobby Blackwell also points out the Vive Pro came out in 2018.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
But no new PSVR headset, which I would have thought.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, they did kind of re...

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
No, they just have the breakout box now passes through HDR.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
No Final Fantasy 7 and no Kingdom Hearts 3 from Loki.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Technically Loki in 2018.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
That is accurate.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
It is accurate.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
So we'll score one for Loki, but he obviously would be a fool

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
to make that prediction again.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
All right.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Well, right, if it's coming out in a couple of weeks, well...

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
He made the first half, though.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
OK, this is me.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Did Rob finally rage quit Ingress?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
No, he didn't.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
I've scaled back quite a bit, though, and Ingress Prime finally came out,

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
which obviously, big mobile game from Niantic, the makers of Pokémon Go.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
All the Pokéstops and gyms come from a game called Ingress that is still going,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
and they relaunched with Ingress Prime.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I think there's actually probably more to talk about in Ingress.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
But do I play as much as I used to?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Not really.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
No.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
No.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
In fact, the Blues threw a big field over us this evening,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
and if I was playing more often, I probably would have stopped it

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
because I was even thinking of going to the park today that they threw right through.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Anyway, oh, another one for me.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Did Anthem flop?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Hashtag justice for Mass Effect.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Well, when we did these, we must not have known about the delay.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
So, TBD, Rob Roberts.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Next one.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
From Loki.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Xbox One X and PS4 Plus didn't sell well.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I don't know if you got this one.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I would say...

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't know.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
We don't really know what the numbers are because they don't really break it down that way.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
They don't.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
And I think there could be something to say that the classic systems outsold them in some months,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
and the Nintendo Switch has continued to overperform,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
but does that mean these guys underperformed?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't think so.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I think it was more like par.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
I don't remember seeing a headline about Sony sales disappoint or anything like that.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I think we're par.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Right.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I think they did a pat on the back job well done,

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
and that's about where we're at with that, right?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
All right.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Let's see.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
So, Act F says, I don't think Loki got this one.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Kaijuna says it's not better, but it's not the same.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
All right.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Moving on.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Well, they did sell a little bit better because I did buy a PlayStation 4 Pro.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
So, you know.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
We filled this.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Oh, there's that too.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
We filled this thing up last year.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
All right.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Predictions from Dark Sakura.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
She put all hers on one.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Number one.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
More third-party Switch support.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
In parentheses, SNK.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I mean, that kick-ass SNK collection came out.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
So, ding, ding, ding on that.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Konami.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
Konami ain't doing much of anything right now, but I mean,

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I think in the general sense of third-party support on Switch,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I think it's been very strong, honestly.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I think we're starting to see, you know,

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
even companies that weren't supporting the Switch historically

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
are kind of coming around a little bit.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
So, I'd give her that one.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Number two.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Konami learns from Capcom and listens to fans.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
No.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
Well, I mean, I guess they're listening in the sense that they're still making games,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
but the games aren't very good that they're making.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I mean, Melger Survive.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah, that's listening to fans.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
No.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Number three.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
I will continue to be very disappointed by the gaming industry as a whole.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Well, I can't ask her about that because she's not here.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
She's disappointed by a lot of things.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
We'll say yes.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
We'll say yes.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
I don't know.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
She really enjoyed Awesome Games Done Quick, though.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Her and I were talking about that earlier.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah, it's hard to be disappointed.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
But that's not really the industry.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
That's the fans.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This one's for me.

17:41.000 --> 17:50.000
Will Microsoft, jealous of Nintendo sales this holiday, jack the Switch concept, but for PC?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Nvidia Shield already halfway there.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Oh, I know where I was going with this, but I was totally fucking wrong.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
But, I mean, stay tuned for 2019.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Well, that's what the surface is for, I guess.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Interesting.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
So, that could still be a thing, but not in 2018.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
So, this is that.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Let's see.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Moving on.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Let's see.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Go ahead and chat.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
VidPower has an interesting counterpoint to the Konami thing.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
Does Castlevania characters being in Smash count as Konami stuff in 2018?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Sort of.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I mean, I'll give you that.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
I'll give you that.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, the best of 2018 from me.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Number one, Super Mario Odyssey.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Number two, Breath of the Wild.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Number three, Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Why did we put our 2018 basket?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Yes, that's correct.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Those were my three favorite games.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
I think it's just so we can reflect on...

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Oh, to reflect on these games.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Oh, well, Mario is still going.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Obviously, they had the Mario Wii U game just came out again.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I bought it, but I haven't played it yet this week.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I was hoping to do a stream of it, but I'll probably get to that later.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I have to admit, I've kind of cooled down on Breath of the Wild.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
I haven't really played it as much, but I do think Nintendo will kind of take that engine

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
and do another Zelda game.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
Kind of think akin to Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
were like the same kind of engine on Nintendo 64.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I mean, obviously, they were different Zelda games.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
But that's what I mean.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I don't expect a copy of Breath of the Wild.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
I expect something in that same engine, that same sort of open world design.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I think we'll see another one of those next week.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
Just without the destructible weapons, because their weapon durability.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Because that was shit.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And then Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood. I'm still playing.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I went to Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
I don't think I could have predicted that I would have been playing a lot of WoW at this time.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Final Fantasy XIV is kind of in a lull for me since they're in that pre-expansion kind of blues part.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Literally, because there's a blue mage coming next week.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
But yeah, I've been playing a lot of WoW, which is kind of weird.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
But fun.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
This might be the last one. Yep, this is the last one.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Another one from Jamie.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Top three games last year.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Didn't they finally shut that down? Or they're gonna shut that down?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I don't know.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Was that a thing, chat? Correct me if I'm wrong.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
No, I don't think they're shutting it down.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
I think the player base is really tanked on that.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
And I think even she's cooled on that a lot.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
I think ever since they announced Animal Crossing 2019, you know, Animal Crossing Switch,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
that's where her energy is going at this point.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
Act Def does say Pocket Camp is still going strong, so I stand corrected.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
But I mean, Nintendo does cancel mobile phone games once in a while, right?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Am I right? All right.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Miitomo shut down. Yeah, I remember that one.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
And then number two, she put Danganronpa V3.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Because she's a big fan of the Danganronpa series.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And I'm sure she would have continued to support that one.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I'd be curious to hear her thoughts on what she wrote as number three from last year.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Mass Effect Andromeda.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
After kind of all that, shaped out, and they didn't really continue to expand on that and so forth.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
So we'll have to ask her at a later time.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
But there it is. We got everything in the time.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
How did we do, Loki?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I think we did good.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
I think all the save predictions went really well.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Again, Kaijuto kind of probably got the best prediction.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I think that ended up coming true in there, I got to say.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So props to you guys.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
So there we go.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Wait, since we're on video now.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh shit, I'm going to have to pick all that up later.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
All right. Anyhow.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
All right.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
No, I didn't do that either. Were we supposed to do that?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Should we do Games We're Looking Forward To?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Because I think I had one of those in there.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I guess I could do that.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
All right. Well, in the meantime, let's do our predictions for 2019 and fill this up here.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
I guess Kaijuto just tuned in.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Because Kaijuto says, what was it? What did I say?

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
You called the cross-play thing with Rocket League.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
And the fact that it would be PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
And the reason why I kind of give you bonus points for that is because that ended up being like a headline last year.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
And I don't think we would have known that at the beginning of the year.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
So kudos.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
All right.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
Bobby Blackpool says, don't worry, Loki will pick it all up and put them all back in the capsule.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
You got it.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
All right. First prediction I'm going to put in for next year.

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
Did Sony do a PSX event in the fall because of no E3?

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
I find Sony's lack of participation in E3 this year very interesting.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I forgot that they're doing that.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Well, apparently that's going to not happen.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
You might want, you can quickly change your answer, Loki.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
So I would say the fact that they didn't do a PSX either.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
Maybe they're looking at doing some type of like joint thing in the fall that's going to be their big PlayStation 5 announcement.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
Because I know we've lived in a world historically where consoles come out right before the holidays.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
But I think Nintendo Switch showed the calendar is flexible.

22:54.000 --> 23:02.000
And if Sony wanted to do an event in the fall to hype a March or April PlayStation 5 release, that could be a legit thing.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I don't think we'll have a PlayStation 5 for holiday next year.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
That is not to say we won't have a PlayStation 5 in 2020.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
So that's my thought.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
That's where I was going with that.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
While I tear this up and put it in the capsule, Loki, why don't you do the first of your predictions?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
You're not going to like this.

23:18.000 --> 23:29.000
EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA's shittiness, i.e. loot boxes and other forced changes to the game.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Because you know they do that.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
They fuck everything over and then they blame the developer.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
And EA has a track record of shutting good companies down.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
I don't know if that'll happen in the course of a year, but it's possible.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
I'm not as mad at you about that answer.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I'm going to be curious to see what happens.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
My next one.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Next Xbox announced, but no PlayStation 5?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Game Pass console to hold us over.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Which is funny because I think I kind of conflicted myself with my first prediction.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
But leave me alone.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
If I write, yes PS5 on one and no PS5 on the other, I'll get at least half of them right.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
But where I was really going with this is really more of a Microsoft prediction is the Game Pass console.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
I think they might tease the next Xbox, but I don't think it's going to be released.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I think I was thinking more E3 in my head with this one.

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
And I think there will be a little console that is dedicated to the streaming games and that whole thing to kind of hold us over.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
That's my thought with that.

24:31.000 --> 24:38.000
And then I picked the oh so safe Nintendo 64 classic release holiday 2019.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Because, you know, they could pretty much just run it on the same hardware they have now.

24:43.000 --> 24:51.000
But do you think, I was at Fry's earlier this week and I saw shelves upon shelves upon shelves of the PlayStation classic.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Yeah.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Marked down to $60.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Do you think that may give Nintendo cold feet?

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I know it's a weird question because Nintendo's done very well.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
But do you think Nintendo's going to evaluate is the market done with these retro consoles?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
No, they're not done with retro consoles.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
They're done with shit that, you know, they half assed and put out into the marketplace.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
You know, on emulators that are open source that aren't optimized to run the games that they're running.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I mean, and they knew the quality of what it was when they put it out there.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
They just said, ah, fuck it, who cares?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
You know, we're just going to make a quick buck.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
You know, people will buy that because people are buying all these things.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Well, people didn't buy it because they won't just buy anything.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt wants to know, will Jamie add her predictions next week?

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Yes, we'll reopen the capsule so she can do that next week.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Next one for me.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
Did they finally get online right with Animal Crossing since they plan to charge for it?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
So, online in Animal Crossing has always been kind of weird.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
You have to kind of go, all right, I'm going to go open my gate, trot, trot, trot, open your gate, wait for somebody to show up.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
And there's a lot of like, kind of like planning that has to go into a visit.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Whereas I think there's a lot of us, I don't know, I would like to see it this way, maybe you guys would too.

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
A little more persistent world where I can leave my town open all the time and you can come visit and shake the trees and stuff.

26:10.000 --> 26:18.000
So, I would like to know, is online going to be like a more fleshed out full thing since we are paying for Nintendo Online after all?

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
And I think we probably all know how that's going to go, but we'll see. We'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

26:25.000 --> 26:35.000
All right. I had that there will be a new AR gaming console by somebody, not necessarily Microsoft or Sony.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Tell me a little more about that.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
So like, you know, let's just take the whole Oculus Go thing and just take it one step further where it's all AR stuff.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
So you're playing out there in the wild because, hey, Pokemon Go is going to be still popular.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
And of course, when Harry Potter Go comes out, everyone's going to be back into that shit again.

26:54.000 --> 27:00.000
And people are going to jump on that bandwagon and release a dedicated console and stuff like that.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
All right. I got one more. I put a fourth one. You ready?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
The Sonic movie was a bad idea, right?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Yes.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
Oh, wait. Well, that'll be the last. No, no, no. Then then then I got one.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
Then if that's all right. All right. So one more from Loki and then we'll do it.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
We'll add the game list after the break. So we have a little time to work on that.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
So I want to move on with the show about 30 minutes in the night.

27:24.000 --> 27:33.000
So what's the last one? The last one to go along with that is the Detective Pikachu movie did not suck.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
OK, fair enough. I'm looking forward to that.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
I'm I'm hopeful based on the trailer. So we'll see what happens with that.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
We do need to do some chat predictions. I agree. Let's get some chat predictions, you guys.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I'll try to write these down quickly. So let's do some.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
So if you have predictions, shout them out on our Twitch channel over at VOG Network.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Can you read some of those Loki so I can write them down quick?

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Yes. OK. So chat predictions. Let's see.

27:59.000 --> 28:07.000
We have She Hulk 10 say new portable Xbox coming in 2019.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
Let's see. I thought I saw something from Tiger Claw.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
I don't know if it was. Let me scroll.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
Oh, he referenced the movies as well. He said Detective Pikachu and Sonic will be well received and do well.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
The box office and the studio green light sequels. Well, we already kind of addressed the movies in there,

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
so we'll let that be. Yeah.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
Oh, act deaf to saying a Pokemon eighth gen delay.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
I think that's a ballsy prediction because I don't think that'll happen, but I'll write it down.

28:38.000 --> 28:46.000
My Bobby's Microsoft never makes another game that supports Dolby Atmos audio.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
I don't think we'll see anything about the mad box console next year.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
It's way too early. And sadly, I don't think it's going to go anywhere.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
I just new console launches are just especially right.

29:01.000 --> 29:08.000
Companies that don't have now the one, though, that I am interested in is the whole.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
And television console, which isn't that 20, 20, 20.

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
They already said the date for that was like something 10, 10, 20, 20 or something like that was the date for that.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
OK. Yeah. So, yeah, 20, 20 for that. But maybe we'll get some more details on it.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
But at least I trust that a little bit more than other.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
You know, the mad box thing is mad. Just coming out of the gate with like no sort of specs or anything saying,

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
oh, our console is going to be the best in the world. Yeah.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
I just I just have a hard time trusting that.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
Maybe we'll see we get to get to come out.

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
It's going to be amazing. Sorry for a little quiet here because I'm trying to write some of these things down as you guys are saying them.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
See it to be reset a new Mario spin off. So that's pretty safe prediction, but I'll go with it.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
Probably culture saying they want it. He wants a Dreamcast classic.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Oh, I like that one. I would like that, too. I just don't think it's going to happen.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
I mean, I hope it would happen, but I don't think it's going to happen.

30:11.000 --> 30:21.000
Can we get like any of some more arcade stuff to like I would take, you know, an autonomous wave classic or CPS to.

30:21.000 --> 30:28.000
Well, I guess we have a ton of the CPS to stuff with all the arcade things that they have out there.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Oh, oh, I'm going to I want to write that one down from victory.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
You guys have a lot of great answers here, but I'm running out of space.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
I'm going to write this last one here from a fifth dream.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
Final Fantasy seven remake canceled. I think.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
I think there is a sliver of potentialness in that.

30:48.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, I know that's a really in a sense that it's canceled because it's going to be Final Fantasy 16 or is it that it's costing him too much money.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
There's no no amount of money that's too much for Final Fantasy seven remake.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
I personally don't think it will happen, but I don't think it's completely fucking impossible.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
I guess.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
Sorry for the hedgehog. The movie, the game is going to be the best selling game with twenty nineteen.

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
All right. We're adding in the chat predictions. Sorry to those that we did not get an ad in there because you guys had a lot of great predictions.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
But hey, if you want to be like Dark Sakura and make it your goal to start your own YouTube channel next year.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
One thing that you could do, make a video, create some content with your own predictions and then go back and laugh at yourself in a year, just like we did tonight.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
I think that would be a fun thing to do, especially for those you guys that already do like twitch streams and stuff like that.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
V.G. realness, you hear me? All you out there, code man, you out there.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah, you guys, Bobby, you guys can do some some stuff with your prediction.

31:50.000 --> 31:58.000
And then when you do it, some random company can come in, you know, copyright claim you because the system is so jacked up that anybody can do that.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
Apparently, that's the business I need to get into is copyright claiming people for things.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
We need lots of money that way. We got a story on that a little later, so we'll talk a little more about that.

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
But for now, let's get into, as we like to do towards the top of every show, talk about our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about how is your gaming week.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
So, Loki, you mentioned you got around to playing some games this week. How did I play?

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
I played more Dance Dance Revolution Extreme because I reloaded that back on there.

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
In fact, funny enough, along with that, even though I am going to be converting the cabinet over the set, meaning at some point I have memory card slots coming.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
So I may be putting those on the machine. You know what that means? Breaking out the edits again.

32:36.000 --> 32:46.000
So I'll be doing that. And then I did play Tetris Effect a little bit this week, unlock some of the stuff in the journey mode there.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
I always forget that they have the Saturday events. I need to set a reminder on my phone because I haven't participated in one in like a month.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
Because I just forget that the Saturday, I wonder if they've even been meeting them.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
I don't know, have any of you guys out there been playing Tetris Effect regularly and seeing if they have been meeting their weekly events? Because I'd be really curious about that.

33:02.000 --> 33:17.000
What else? Then I also played Pokemon Go a little bit. And then I did play some other PC games. I'm trying to think, what was it?

33:17.000 --> 33:25.000
I don't remember. It was that impactful. I did play Mario Kart 8 and part of our stream here to get affiliate status.

33:25.000 --> 33:39.000
I unfortunately found out why I was sucking so bad throughout the race. So because my kids play on our console, my Switch, they had the stupid auto-accelerate and auto-steer on.

33:39.000 --> 33:49.000
So what that means is my boosts, I was wondering why it wasn't falling off the track, but at the same time it also is like dragging an anchor behind you when you try to actually race in the game.

33:49.000 --> 33:56.000
So I could never catch up because the stupid auto-break and auto-accelerate was on. Because I was trying to take shortcuts in my cards.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
You have to look for those little icons. Because that happened when I was at a gathering. There was like four of us playing Mario Kart.

34:02.000 --> 34:09.000
And the same thing was happening is that our one friend is not controlling it the way they think. And it's because we saw the little icon. Oh, the assists were on.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
And I think a lot of those turn on by default. So you have to really remember to take those off.

34:13.000 --> 34:20.000
So I had to, after I got done, I was like, okay, I took them off and everything was fine. But it was just annoying.

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
Because I was like, why can't I catch up to anybody? I'm like, is it the character? Because I don't really play Mario Kart 8 at all.

34:26.000 --> 34:33.000
But I'm like, I know I'm better than this. It's like I can't catch up no matter how many boosts I'm using.

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
And then finally I was like, oh, that's why. Because my kids play it and they don't want to fall off the track.

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
And then I played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 yesterday just to play through some of the DLC.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
The game's kind of messed up on my Playstation 4 now. All the DLC doesn't appear. Only the latest one.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
I was trying to like 100% it. And then I just got frustrated because the driving physics in the game are just absolute crap.

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
And yet they force you to do races that involve the driving physics. So I did this race like four or five times.

35:05.000 --> 35:13.000
Which is just a really simple drive checkpoint. But the car's handles so terribly. It just was frustrating.

35:13.000 --> 35:21.000
I just said, fuck it. I am not playing this anymore. I don't know. But I've had the opportunity to play the Playstation 4 all week.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
But every time I go to sit down and play it, I'm like, I don't know what I want to play.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
I just don't want to get into Red Dead Redemption 2. I don't know if I'm just gonna be tired of that game.

35:31.000 --> 35:41.000
I think that game is too much sim for me. Like I like Grand Theft Auto 5 where you can do the missions and everything and you can just kind of fuck around and do whatever.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
But this is more like you have to get food, you have to eat, you have to sleep, you have to groom yourself and groom your horse.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
That's too much fucking work. I don't want to do that. I just want to be able to like fuck around in the game.

35:51.000 --> 35:57.000
So that's kind of what's pulling me away from that. I almost went back to Skyrim again. I was almost gonna do that.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
And I actually am thinking about streaming Skyrim again.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Oh, you should. That would be fun.

36:01.000 --> 36:08.000
It would be fun. It's just, it's the talking and like waking everybody up or disturbing everybody. That type of stuff.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
So like I thought about doing like a series just like totally ordinary version of blah blah blah.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
And just have it like fucking modded to the point where you can't recognize it anymore.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
And then it's an ironic name.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
Exactly. So it would be something like that. And they could do Saints Row or something like that too.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Okay. That it for your gaming week?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
That's it for my gaming week.

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
My gaming week. So I played a little Pokemon Go. I know y'all are sick of hearing me talk about mobile games, right?

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
But the big Pokemon Go community day was this weekend. So I actually went down and I played at the state capital.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
And now that we have this whole Twitch thing, I can actually show a little bit of what that looks like.

36:44.000 --> 36:50.000
Because you know Pokemon Go is a dead game, right? Even though there's like people dressing up and stuff as they're playing Pokemon Go out at the capital.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
And the feature Pokemon Go was Totodile this time.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
I got one shiny.

36:55.000 --> 37:02.000
I took it really easy. I got six shinies, but I was really kind of like half-assing my adventures out of the capital this time.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
I actually I used my Bluetooth device to do a lot of the catching down at the capital.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
And you know that that caught plenty of the Pokemon that way.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
And I was catching a little bit.

37:16.000 --> 37:24.000
What I found is that as I was doing like walking, like lots and lots of walking, is that the various Pokemon were hatching.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
The eggs were like continuously hatching over and over again.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And it kind of like kept interrupting me.

37:29.000 --> 37:36.000
So there came a point where I was like, all right, I'm going to just Bluetooth catch things, walk a lap around the park to hatch all of my eggs.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Because the hatch time was cut like way down.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
So I can like reset everything and then load them all up at the same time.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
So that the hatching doesn't get in the way.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
But then, of course, you're like right in the midst of things.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
And it's like I'm trying to roll with a group of people.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
And then all of a sudden, oh, I got nine eggs hatching all at once with the animation.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And so that got to be a little bit annoying.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
But I was cool with the six shinies because honestly, like there's so many shinies now.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
And if Shane is still in chat, he's going to totally disagree with me.

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, all right, once I have like the three, the set to have one, I'm kind of over it.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Like I'm done. I'm ready to go.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
But I was happy out of the six.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I caught two of them were the highest appraisal.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
So I actually which is funny.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
So I got like a feral gator.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
I evolved it up to get the hierarchy cannon and actually like used it in a raid today.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
And it was a shiny.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
So I was it's kind of neat.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
I'm always neat.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
But get this. And I'm sure if he is in chat, he's going to say Shane caught.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Get this. Twenty five shinies.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
He got twenty five shiny.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
You know what his trick is?

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
He does.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
Well, first off, he doesn't go for the social stuff you saw in the video there on Twitch.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
You saw it.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Let me roll it one more time.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
I got the same B roll.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
You see, look, everybody's hanging out with their friends.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
They're talking.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
They're casually walking, doing their thing, dressing up, having a good time.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Right.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
That's what they're doing.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
That's not what Shane does when he's like, man on a mission.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Right.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
He does the fast catching as he's going and checking the shiny.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
And he's doing the fast catching over and over.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
And then if he sees a shiny, he might spend a little more time to catch it.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
But he's walking fast, going everywhere.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
And he's in the zone.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
And that's how he did.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
He got twenty four total dials and one Bulbasaur because the event was that capital.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Well, where we went, we went to Capitol Park, which happened to be a Bulbasaur nest during the event.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
So, yeah, he got twenty five shinies.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And I was like, what?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
What are you going to do with that many shinies?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
They're shiny.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
The typical response.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Right.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
All right.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
Oh, and Shane is in chat under Shad Leland saying, no, I don't do the social stuff.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
This is a mission every community day.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
By the way, while he's here and while I know he's in chat, can all you chatters give a big congratulations?

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
Congratulations to Shane in chat because he got married at the beginning of the month.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
So I think that's worthy of a congratulations.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
So congratulations to Shane and husband on the marriage.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
So everybody yay in chat for me, please.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
And now they're asking about Phoebus Day in chat.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
So did you know that this is a thing coming up next week?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
They're going to Phoebus Day.

39:53.000 --> 40:01.000
It's not a community day, but it's like a quest period where all the quests will reward Phoebus and some of them will be shiny.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
It's kind of a new thing.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
But I don't like Phoebus.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
It's a stupid fish.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah, it's lame.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I don't like it either, but the shiny ones are cute.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
So I don't want it.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
All right. Other games that I play because I don't just play mobile phone games all the time, believe it or not.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Even though I started another mobile one called Turf Wars.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
It's stupid. It reminds me.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
Do you remember when we used to play like the sorority or you never play this with the sorority?

40:23.000 --> 40:29.000
I think now know the sorority wars on Facebook, which is like you're building your mob of friends and attacking.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
It's so ridiculous.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
But it does incorporate real life stuff into it.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So I was intrigued.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
All this makes me think about is the bad lip reading song, Gang Fight.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Yes.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
It's just...

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
All right. Anyway.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Let's see. So other stuff I played.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I played Soul Calibur 6 finally.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
So I had bought that on sale.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I did a little stream of Soul Calibur 6.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
I was really pleased with how robust the features are in Soul Calibur 6.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Because you have like a story mode that you go through with your own created character.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
Each individual person has their own story that you can go through and everything's like on a timeline.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
You can do the arcade mode.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
You can do online.

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
So I was very pleased with how much there is kind of to do for a fighting game in Soul Calibur 6.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
I was playing on PC, so it runs pretty well.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
It's a pretty smooth fighting game.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
You have these very over the top extra sort of moves that I come to love from Soul Calibur.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
And the narrations didn't disappoint.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Because you know that's my favorite part of a Soul Calibur game.

41:32.000 --> 41:39.000
Two souls intertwined enter the battle arena where one will emerge victorious.

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
Who shall be victorious on this day of judgment when the sword comes to life.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
The narration is so crazy and over the top.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
That's my favorite part.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
So the narration in Soul Calibur 6 didn't disappoint.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
So yeah, I give a thumbs up to Soul Calibur 6.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
It's still a pricey game.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
So you gotta really love your fighting games and your Soul Calibur.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
But I'm into it.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
So I was liking it.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
And I played some of the Mario Kart 8 online as well.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And continuing to play Switch stuff online.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
A little Smash Brothers just a little bit.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
And PC stuff, World of Warcraft still.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
Final Fantasy XIV did get a big patch this past week.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
So I played the part one story of 4.5 that they released.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Which was really good. I really enjoyed the story.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
And there's a new dungeon to go with it.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
And I thought they did a good job with that as well.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
And I'm interested to see what Bloom Age ends up being next week.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Because you know they did some really controversial things with the job, right?

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
Where it's a limited job and you can't really use it in normal end game content.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
And in fact they capped the level lower than what the level cap really is in the game.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
So people like can't overpower or whatever end game rates.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
So I'm curious to see if I like it.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
Or if it just ends up being a really fleshed out mini game.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Which one other thing on Final Fantasy XIV speaking of fleshed out mini games.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Something people aren't really talking about.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
Because it's not really as prevalent in American culture.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
But Final Fantasy XIV added full on mahjong in the gold saucer.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
And it's not half assed.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
It's a full play mahjong with other players or robots.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
And you get gold saucer point rewards for it.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
And it's the full rules of the game and everything.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
And I was like dang this is kind of impressive.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
So there's some people that happen to know how to play mahjong.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
That are like this is what they're doing in the patch now.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
It's like I'm paying $12.95 a month or however much Final Fantasy XIV costs.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
To play mahjong online all day.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
No more tetra master?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
No that was the Final Fantasy XI thing.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
No that was never in Final Fantasy XI that was like a separate thing.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
So I guess they figured why have it a separate thing when you just build it into the main game.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
Get everybody to pay the subscription for the main game to play the feature over here.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
But I will say Final Fantasy XIV doesn't disappoint.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
I mean over the years when it comes to like the side stuff.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Because they have the chocobo racing is all in there as well.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
There's the mini games and I'm missing another big one.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
That there is in the gold saucer.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
I feel like another big event.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Well the costume thing that's a little silly.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
But I'm pretty impressed with how much side stuff they've done.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
And I'm sure that will only continue in the next expansion.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
We'll see.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Alright.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
So SH2100Matt over in our VoG network chat at twitch.tv slash VoG network says,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
Old ladies are playing mahjong all day.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
Yeah it's very prevalent especially in Asian countries and culture.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
I know that's kind of like poker might be a thing in the States.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
Mahjong is something that people really get into in other places.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
And considering that Final Fantasy XIV is very big in Japan.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
They don't have World of Warcraft in Japan remember.

44:40.000 --> 44:49.000
So yeah it makes sense that they're doing some things that are culturally appropriate for places that aren't just the US, Canada and so forth.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
So kind of neat.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
And it teaches if you don't know how to play.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I don't know how to play mahjong but the game has a tutorial in it.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Oh I remember the other thing they had in there.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
The Lords of Verminion.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Which was like the Lords of Verminion but they did it with the minions.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I forgot that was the other thing.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I was like I knew there was something else in Gold Saucer they spent.

45:06.000 --> 45:13.000
But like nobody plays it Loki and it's sad because it's like a full fleshed out pet battle thing that's more intricate than what World of Warcraft has.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
But you know it is what it is.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Alright anyway.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Let's move on.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
That's really it for my gaming week.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
As far as housekeeping goes.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Next week Dark Soccer will be here.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Although Loki won't.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
But we hope you'll tune in.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Yeah I'll be at the broccoli farm.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
That's right.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Well that's going to be a fun trip though.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
It will be a fun trip.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
You know while you're there.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Since we have this whole Twitch thing now you should shoot some video at the arcades.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
If you see some Wreck-It Ralph or something we ought to see.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Any Tron references.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
I want video.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Okay.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I doubt there will be anything.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
But just in case. You never know.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I will look for Tron stuff.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Sounds good.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I'm trying to.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I don't know if I'm going to get a chance to.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
But I did scout out before we go.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
I scouted out where the nearest round one is.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
So I want to go to round one.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
It's only like I think like.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
But Irvine ought to have one right?

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
No Anaheim has one.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Oh cool.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
And so they have one.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
It looks about like five ten minutes away from where we're staying.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
So I may go there depending on the time we have.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
And if I can get away just for like an hour or two.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I may try to do that.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Alright.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Sounds like fun.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Alright well let's get into some gaming news.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
We got a lot of news to cover this week.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Things.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
The holidays are done.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
And things are ramping up again in the gaming world right?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Yes.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
2019 is starting off pretty interesting.

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
So we have the announcement that Bungie is going to be splitting up with Activision.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
So basically they're ending their partnership with Activision.

46:40.000 --> 46:47.000
And with that they're actually going to be continuing to I guess work on Destiny.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
Destiny will be retained by Bungie as their property.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
So it's not going to be something that you know we're going to have to look forward to.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Destiny games from Activision without Bungie.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
So basically you know they said you know we've enjoyed a successful eight year run.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
And we'd like to thank Activision for their partnership on Destiny.

47:05.000 --> 47:12.000
Looking ahead we're excited to announce plans for Activision to transfer publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
And with our remarkable Destiny community we are ready to publish on our own.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
While Activision will increase their focus on owned IP projects.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
So more Call of Duty.

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
And to clear up like the number one like misconception I think that's out there.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Activision never owned Bungie.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
Because there's a lot of people like the gut reaction I'm seeing.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
Maybe it's just the people I follow on Twitter because of my history with the shows I've co-hosted previously.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Horde House being one of them.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
So obviously I talk to a lot of Blizzard people right?

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
And so like the number one thing I'm seeing is oh Blizzard ought to do the same thing.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
But it's different.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Activision owns Blizzard right?

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Technically that company is Activision Blizzard right?

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
So Activision owns Blizzard.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Activision never owned Bungie.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
They never owned Bungie.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
This was like a publishing agreement.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
This was an agreement between the two companies.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
A very intricate agreement.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
But there was never really the ownership.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
And as being pointed out in our chat room.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Tigerclaw points out this is the second time Bungie splits from a publisher.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
They used to be with Microsoft previously.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Of course right?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Because Bungie made the Halo games.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Right.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
And so they also have.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
So it was a big deal.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
When they split and they were owned by Microsoft.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
If I remember right.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
It was a studio.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
So that was.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
When they first partnered with Activision.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
That was a big deal.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Because it was.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Oh shit.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Destiny is going to be on PlayStation.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
As well as you know the Microsoft console.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
And Sony sure as shit milked that for a while too.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Because they had some exclusives.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
On the original Destiny at least.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
And I think with the second one too.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
You know kind of coming out the gate.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
So.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Yeah.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Kind of a different you know.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
But still a very big news.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
Well plus they also have a new game in development as well.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Though they're working on with NetEase.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
So there's that whenever we see that announcement.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Which is ironic.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
Because NetEase is also the people behind Diablo Immortal.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Which if you do want to compare things to Blizzard.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
That whole controversy and how they announce that.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Again.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
My personal feeling is that Diablo Immortal and going that direction.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Was never a bad idea.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
But this just goes to show.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
They should teach this.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Video game public relations 101.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
This is a lesson to be learned.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
College thesis should be written on this.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Is all in the messaging.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
It is all in the messaging for that.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
2018 will be a good year for that as well.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Because if you look at it you've got that.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
You've got the whole Fallout 76 thing.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Which is still ongoing.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Just all of the messaging around that.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
And PR responses.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
It's just not great.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
So looking forward to what's going to be coming.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
I'm curious to see.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Because Destiny I feel like a lot of the monetization in that kind of hurt the game.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
Especially a lot of it where they were focusing on monetization instead of fixing bug problems.

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
And I'm wondering how much of that is Activision and how much of it was Bungie.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
So now that they're away from Activision.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
We're going to see how much of that was Activision and how much of it is Bungie.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I think there were good things though too.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I mean believe it or not I'm going to say some good things.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
I think the inclusion of Destiny 2 in the Battle.net launcher was huge.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Is that still going to be a thing now?

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
They're not saying.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
I don't know.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I don't know how that works and the publishing agreements and all that.

50:20.000 --> 50:25.000
I think if it does exit the launcher it will be very quietly done.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
You can count on that.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
And I don't think anything will happen in the immediate future.

50:29.000 --> 50:34.000
Because doesn't Activision still stand to make money off Destiny 2 if it sells?

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Probably.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
So if Activision is still making money off the sales of Destiny 2.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Which is funny because they gave it away at one point.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
But the expansions and all that still coming into play.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
I don't think Activision is just going to scrape it off the launcher.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
I think it will still be there for a good long time.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
Maybe they're talking more like Destiny 3 or a new Destiny game or something.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Destiny 2 Switch when?

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Because you know that's the tweet all over town right?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Going to chat.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
Kaijuto in chat says never like the name Activision.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Activision is a really old gaming company.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
And Tigerclaw kind of shed some light on this.

51:10.000 --> 51:16.000
Activision was originally created so that the game developers get credit for the games they created on the Atari 2600.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Absolutely.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
David Crane's Pitfall.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Remember?

51:20.000 --> 51:26.000
A lot of developers went over to Activision because Activision, believe it or not, at that time was like the good guys.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
That's where you went to get the full credit for the games.

51:31.000 --> 51:38.000
Activision made some very strong titles on the Atari 2600 and other platforms around that time.

51:38.000 --> 51:50.000
But some of the biggest Atari 2600 games, things like Kaboom, things like the Dragster, Drag Racing game, Freeway, Pitfall, those were all Activision titles.

51:50.000 --> 52:00.000
And that's why those flashback consoles, the newer ones like this, maybe seven, but I know eight and nine for sure, they include Activision titles.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
And that's what makes those some of the better ones that are available.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
So Activision wasn't always like the bad kid in the neighborhood.

52:07.000 --> 52:17.000
And it's really interesting how this crown of shame, or the shame bell if you will, kind of floats around to different developers year after year.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
One year, EA's the bad guy. Worst company in America, right? Then Activision's the bad guy.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
They're all bad for different reasons. They have their own flavors of bad.

52:27.000 --> 52:36.000
Microsoft probably wore that crown at one point, but I would say at this point, I don't think, I mean, there's always going to be some Microsoft haters when it comes to like the operating system wars and all that.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
But I would say in the gaming sense, I don't think people are ganging up on Microsoft right now.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
No.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
There's a lot of people that are actually kind of like, oh, we hope you catch up, you know, oh, crackdown three.

52:45.000 --> 52:57.000
You know, I think there's a lot of, you know, but it just goes to show, taking it all the way back to something I mentioned almost an hour ago at the top of the show, kind of that gaming attention span where one year it was one way.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
We should have wrote down on the paper, who do we hate now?

53:01.000 --> 53:09.000
Here's the companies we hate the most going into 2019. What does it look like at the end of, you know, 2019 going into 2020?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I think that would be an interesting thing to look at.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I don't know.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
So let's see.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
Bobby Black Wolf shouting out Oink, which is also a great Atari 2600 game.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
One of my favorites is a multiplayer.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
One person could be the wolf and the other could be the pigs.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Anyway, let's see.

53:24.000 --> 53:33.000
Tiger Claw says the reality is they split from Activision because they've been breathing down their necks and wanting such and such in their games.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
And Tiger Claw says now Activision doing it.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
So Bungie being better on their own.

53:37.000 --> 53:44.000
So, you know, a lot of people were calling out the changes in stock and what's happened with the stock prices since this happened.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
And the stock has kind of come down a little bit.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
I would say certainly this is probably a part of it.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
But I feel like Activision has been in the news for a lot of weird things lately.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
Right. Like they just had what was it their CFO or somebody went over to Netflix.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
That was a headline I don't think we got to last week because of the power outage.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
Then we had the mobile game. The Diablo disaster was a blizzard.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
That is still something Blizzard's kind of taken licks on.

54:09.000 --> 54:19.000
And then a little more recently after that, everything Heroes of the Storm is going through with that league kind of getting, you know, basically pushed away into a deep, dark closet somewhere.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
And then basically saying we're not going to do major updates on the game anymore.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
I mean, there's been a lot of kind of not so great news coming out of Activision Blizzard.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
This is just kind of the what next?

54:30.000 --> 54:40.000
I'm not sure how the Black Ops 4 sales were either because I don't think a lot of these games that have been putting out each year are doing better than last year.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
I don't know where things are as far as sales go with those.

54:43.000 --> 54:49.000
I know they always really have a high expectation for the fourth quarter sales on those Call of Duty games.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
But I don't think anything's matched up to like, I don't even know what the last big one have been.

54:53.000 --> 55:00.000
Black Ops 3 maybe? I mean, I haven't been interested in them in a long time, which is unfortunate, especially this one.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
This one actually looked interesting, but then they didn't put a single player campaign.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
So I have no interest in it now.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Great chat comment from vidpower573.

55:09.000 --> 55:18.000
Can you think of a time, and I'm sure you can think of a time, but think of the general population, not just you, that Nintendo was the bad guys.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Nintendo was absolutely the bad guys.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
Because usually Nintendo, we like Nintendo, we stick up for Nintendo, right?

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
We get mad at Nintendo because we want them to do better, right?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
But do you remember a time when Nintendo was the bad guys?

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Um...

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
Alright, let me get to vidpower's comment.

55:35.000 --> 55:41.000
Back in the NES day, Nintendo's iron grip on NES publishing made them the bad guys.

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
The Nintendo's seal of quality and all that, and their fights with Tengen and what happened with Tetris and, you know, that whole thing.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
That, in some ways, made them the bad guys.

55:51.000 --> 56:00.000
Why you have Ultra games that put out the Ninja Turtles game and the original Metal Gear and all this was because Konami hit their three game a year limit or whatever.

56:00.000 --> 56:06.000
I don't remember if it was three games a season or three games a year, but they wanted to do more, so they created a secondary company to be able to do that.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
And then, of course, I thought of another one. Nintendo was kind of the bad guys when it came to the YouTube and all that stuff.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
But you could also kind of blame YouTube for a lot of that.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
I'm not out here to make a We Hate Nintendo show because we don't.

56:19.000 --> 56:26.000
But it just goes to show everybody at some point makes the mistake that makes them the ire of the gaming industry for a little bit, right?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
So, there is that.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Anyway, I guess we'll move on, right?

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
So let's continue with Nintendo.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I think this is a pretty neat move from Nintendo.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
It's interesting and I'm curious to see how it goes.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
That is a new partnership with The Humble Store.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
That's right, the home of The Humble Bundle.

56:42.000 --> 56:48.000
They also have a store, you may or may not have known, and when you buy games on there, you can donate a portion of it to charity.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Not all of it, obviously, because there are a lot of new games on there.

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
But The Humble Store announced this week on their website that they are now selling Nintendo games.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I did a little bit of browsing on there and you can buy.

56:59.000 --> 57:05.000
It doesn't seem like the whole catalog of indie titles is mostly first-party Nintendo stuff.

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
You can buy Smash, you can buy the new Mario game, you can buy Splatoon, you can buy Zelda.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
You can buy pretty much the big Nintendo first-party titles on The Humble Store.

57:14.000 --> 57:23.000
But that's kind of neat because, you know, I don't know about you, but I've always kind of thought of Nintendo as the company that they don't want to partner up with other stores.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Well, that's not necessarily true.

57:25.000 --> 57:31.000
They do that with GameStop. They sell their digital codes through there. They also sell digital codes through Amazon.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Fair enough.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
I think a lot of other store friends do it.

57:34.000 --> 57:42.000
What I like about The Humble Store, though, I think with Humble Monthly you get some cashback or credit or something like that that you can use with things.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
So, it's neat that they have that. It's just another option to be able to purchase things.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
I hope that means that we're going to see another Nintendo bundle because, you know, now that my kids have 2DSs and stuff,

57:52.000 --> 57:58.000
I still have some 3DS keys sitting in my library that I was like, hey, you know, I could give you some more games if you guys want, you know?

57:58.000 --> 58:04.000
Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah, so I would love to see, you know, Humble Bumble, I don't think we're going to get first-party Nintendo titles.

58:04.000 --> 58:11.000
Well, never say never. I mean, something, is there any title that kind of disappeared on the ARMS?

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
I'm sorry, no. All the ARMS fans are going to come at me now.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
All one of them.

58:17.000 --> 58:25.000
With their two arms. No, I don't know. Is there any, like, completely underperforming Nintendo title that they're just not going to probably focus on anymore on the Switch?

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
I don't know. So, maybe something like that might show up in a bundle, but I kind of doubt it.

58:29.000 --> 58:40.000
Nintendo really, Nintendo doesn't even tend to put their shit on sale, but I think, Loki, you're a little more on it where it's like, well, they partner up with these other stores and do digital codes, especially in a storefront on the receipt, so why not team up with Humble?

58:40.000 --> 58:45.000
I wouldn't necessarily think we're going to see a deep discount on digital codes. There usually isn't.

58:45.000 --> 58:52.000
In unison, Act F, DSG, 100, Matt, 1, 2, Switch. Brilliant. Brilliant idea, right? The hell with that game, man.

58:52.000 --> 58:57.000
It wasn't. He's trying to capture that Wii Sports magic. Never going to fucking happen again.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
God, 1, 2, Switch is fucking terrible.

59:01.000 --> 59:13.000
Anyway, so I kind of think this is interesting, especially, you know, 2019 in some ways is going to be the real year of the store evolution, I think, in some ways, right?

59:13.000 --> 59:32.000
We already know GameStop, they know their time is limited, and you walk into a GameStop this day and age, you see, sure, of course you still see physical games, they still buy the games, but you notice less of the store is focusing on that than it was a few years ago, and now it's more like what BoxLunch and the other, like the nerd stuff. Nerd store.

59:32.000 --> 59:54.000
Oh, right, because they own the thing geeked, so they have all that stuff in there, and also you have to figure, and this was kind of the situation that, you know, our company was going through when we were kind of at the tail end before they closed everything, is because game margins aren't very big, and you can't really run your company on selling just new games. You're not going to be able to make a profit enough to...

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
But those little shitty Funko Pop dolls, no, I shouldn't say that, they are fun, but you know...

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
They're just not shitty.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.000
No, and the only reason I hate on those things, just to be clear, the only reason I hate on those things, they're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're like...

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Yeah.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But, including in this house, yes, I see you looking over there...

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Well, and like arcade games, and like, you know, and amiibo, I mean...

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I'm shooting myself in the foot, clearly.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So like, yeah, they make a lot of money, because the collectible stuff makes a lot of money, and I honestly like, I enjoy looking at, you know, especially like...

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Nowadays, I know what's coming out, like, I don't need to like, go and browse the shelves, and every time I browse the shelves, it's like...

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What do I want in here? Like, what's on the discount that I would pick out? I'm like, none of this, because I'm not going to play any of this.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
But I do look at all of like, the toys and stuff, and board games, and I'm like, oh hey!

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And then our store nearby has like, Gundam models. I was like, oh...

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Oh, you've come calling to me again! I literally, I had a huge collection of Gundam models, and I threw them all away.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But, and honestly, the GameStop thing is not the only thing I'm talking about when I talk about the year of the store changing, but of course, obviously we have this...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Steam versus Epic Store versus Humble Store versus GOG, you know, versus Discord, all of this kind of starting to really get interesting with what, you know...

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And this has been an ongoing conversation with the price slashing for what, you know, the cut that the publishers get and all that.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
This is really heating up, and I think it's going to be a big year for that.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:32.000
So isn't this interesting, where Humble's approach now for how can we get head, how can we, is why are we limiting ourselves to selling PC games?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Why not have a storefront to go buy Nintendo PC, and I bet before too long if they can get agreements on the dotted line, Microsoft seems like an obvious, you know, next branch for that.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Maybe even Sony at some point, although Sony, you know, probably wants to sell movies too, as they kind of like their place, but nothing's impossible, right?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So we'll see.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Yeah, so, I mean, if anything, you know, at the very least, it makes browsing those titles easier on the Humble Store because it sure as hell aren't easy to browse on the eShop, so...

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I mean, really, I don't understand with the eShop too, that really doesn't make any sense why it couldn't be better, because I mean, look at like what the eShop was or the Wii Store, whatever the hell it was called on the Wii, I mean, it was better on the Wii.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And we're now on like several generations of systems later, and you can't do at least as good as you did before, I don't understand why that can't be possible.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Alright, well, let's move on to our next story, because actually, looking at Twitch and the headlines, I can actually see that we're gonna address this store war issue again coming up real soon, so maybe I should just bite my tongue until then and move on to the next story.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:03:01.000
So yeah, so I'll try to like figure out what's going on here. So we've got basically some back and forth lawsuits with Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, and I guess a former Gearbox attorney Wade Callender.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Looks like Callender. I'm gonna say Callender.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
We have the signature of one of those guys right here, that a listener got us, did you know that?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah, you probably didn't come through on Twitch, it may be if I'd gotten that sharpness on the camera to stick tonight, but interesting.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah, Randy Pitchford, not the most, yeah, I don't know. Anyways, so let's try to follow some of this, because it's just kind of scandalous stuff that probably not necessarily refer, you know, it's just drama.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's just drama, so basically.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It's ugly. It's ugly.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Yeah, it's ugly. So first there's, let's see, there's like a case that was against Callender, which I guess, then there was a complaint filed also, they were saying that Callender then sued Randy Pitchford and Gearbox in December of last year, basically in retaliation.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And said that that lawsuit was in regards to Randy Pitchford allegedly taking a $12 million bonus from Take Two Interactive in 2016 that he funneled into Pitchford Entertainment Media Magic LLC.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And then of course, there's another part of this which has to do with alleging that Randy Pitchford accidentally forgot a USB drive at a Dallas area Medieval Times restaurant in 2014, and the USB drive contained both highly sensitive business documents and underage pornography.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Okay. Gross. Yes.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And then of course the whole original, I guess, lawsuit. So apparently the lawsuit against Callender from November was for misusing company funds.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It said that he borrowed money from the company for a home loan and tuition that wasn't fully paid back.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And then also, I guess, as using credit cards for personal expenses, such as family vacations, gun club memberships, firearm accessories, and trying to get six pack.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So this is, this is, it's, it's beyond ugly. I mean, when we talk about very, very, very serious things like pornography of underage folks, which is horrific, monstrous.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I mean, you know, every, every negative word I can think of just inserted here, it's disgusting. Right. And it's unforgivable and heaven forbid, but at the same time, you know, it's, it's not been proven in a court of law yet.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So, you know, despite the way social media works, sometimes we want to, you know, innocent until proven guilty, but that's a fucking monster of a claim to me.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Well, I hope to, I hope to hell it's not true.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:57.000
From what I, because I kind of like heard a few people tell the story. So from what I heard, it was, I think Randy Pitchford had gone on some podcasts and talked about like his, like, I don't know, his like taste in like pornography or something like that.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And like talked about like cam girls and things. I don't remember exactly how that came up, but it's something along the lines of that. And so it was apparently related to that in some way. I don't know.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Just, just for the record, game developers out there interested in coming on Orange Lawns Radio, I, we ask a lot of crazy questions. I'll never ask about your porno habits. That's your business. Okay. What the hell?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I don't even know where it came up from, but like, but of course, Gearbox also, they put out a statement basically saying Gearbox will be filing a grievance with the State Bar of Texas against our former general counsel, Wade, for disciplinary proceedings for filing a lawsuit that includes accusations that he knows to be untrue.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Lawyers, legal clap back basically. Yeah.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Look, here's the thing. I, I really hope and pray it's not true because the, the problem, obviously the problem besides the crime, which is a big fucking problem, but it's going to taint everything this guy's touched. You know what I mean?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And all these other, you know, and I pointed at this, this poster that one of our listeners kindly got us a lot of the signatures. The problem is if this guy made a monster fuck up of that kind of proportion and he's the CEO of that company, then this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, and this guy, they all pay for it.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And that's, that's just the ugly side of this and the true, what was the big O that you just let out over there? I'm a little worried now.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So apparently, so the Ars Technica, I guess, had found, um, they said Gearbox CEO says he left USB stick of porn at medieval times. So I guess he was on this podcast that, and he stated that he did that.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Okay, but porn, porn is one thing, you know, porn is underage porn is a whole other thing. You know what I mean?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Yeah. Yeah. So Loki, I don't think we know. I don't think the game blogs know. I think this is some of those things is that one of those things is going to have to be settled in a court of law. And it just sucks that this is as ugly as it is.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Because like I said, you know, him being the CEO of the company and with as much anticipation as there is about like a Borderlands three, a story of that magnitude in this type of trouble, if, if proven to be true, uh, is going to affect everyone.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So I don't know if it's necessarily underage porn, but basically, so it says, um, he was on the December 22nd episode of the piff pod and he says a pitch.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:36.000
He talked at length about porn that he enjoys, including cam girl pornography in which the host exposes themselves to a live feed and takes requests and financial tips for consumers or whatever.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Says he explains that he was a consumer of this content. He then confirmed that he copied a specific video to this memory stick as he describes it to work out a method of how the cam girl hosts fake the act of female ejaculation.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Uh, he says, I realized this is not a sex worker. This is a fucking magician for those under and he says, uh, he had a vested interest in the field of magicians and owns a magic focus.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Janai magazine. So he says that he claims, he says, this was before I learned I should have password protected memory sticks. And before a meeting, they left the USB flash drive at the medieval times.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I just don't want to hear it. I don't, I don't want to hear the story. Okay. Just, just enough. Okay. As Bobby, Bobby puts in our chat room, Bobby says, uh, he said she was barely 18.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:38.000
He was on a magic podcast, uh, like, uh, pen and teller style magic. And it came up because what the cam girl did was magical, but he lost the USB stick immediately. Okay. Look, this has nothing to do with games at this point, honestly.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Um, just work it out in court. And I hope to God, you know, it's, it's people like what they like, but it needs to be legal done. Don't ruin the legacy of your game that so many people enjoy and love by doing something so fucking ridiculous and trying to be a bad ass on a podcast, which I realized is really ironic coming from us.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:16.000
But, um, I, we, we've said a lot of weird shit on the, that, that, that's even out somewhere. I host the rock, your picture show. And that's weird. All I gotta say, man, is those special attacks in Borderlands three are going to be some serious magical shit.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Right. Bobby and chat says, this is why I didn't cover it. Wait a minute though. Cause you spent that time enhancing a story that you'd done last week. Right. It was, it was on your short list. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I, we just, for the love of God, let's move on to a different story. All right. Uh, let's talk about what's going on with the division two, because this was a bombshell announcement this week. The division two, not going to be on steam initially is the word being used, which is an interesting word.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Uh, and we'll actually launch on the Epic game store on March 15th. This, according to a report from gamesindustry.biz, uh, as we know, the Epic game store has the 12% share whereas steam takes a 30% share.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:09.000
So is that coming into this? Probably. Could there be a little bit of extra payment or extra incentive that's not documented that Epic's making to score this kind of land? Probably. Uh, but that's not out there.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So anyway, um, game industry also elaborated on their report that Ubisoft will be working with Epic on additional select titles throughout 2019. So come on, just dance 2019 exclusive to Epic store. Okay. But all that stuff aside, obviously they have a PC version of that.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:35.000
That would surprise me considering they support literally every other platform that they wouldn't have a PC version of just dance that has to chatter. Is there, is just a stance exist on PC? I don't know.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Anyway, uh, something that a lot of people pointed out right off the bat is that you're still going to have that you play thing no matter what. And a lot of people don't really care. I don't care anymore. Honestly, it feels a little bloaty to me.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That's what I don't like about it. It just feels like it's collecting, but I do like the fact that you can earn a chance in one game and like buy things in another game. Like I'll give you play that, but that little shell is still going to exist. Either way you slice it. Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So, uh, what do you think though about this announcement? I mean, this is good. It's good for competition. I'm glad to see that there's competition for steam because steam needs kind of a kick in the pants just to fix it. Shit.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So more power to competition. Yeah. Uh, Tiger call on chat says you play, used to give you free games back in the day. Um, and maybe, maybe they will on PC. Who knows? But it's just, it kind of just also, it's like another thing I've got to put on my PC, but you play was always kind of like embedded in the game.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Yeah. Like this extra thing. I mean, maybe the extra thing does exist, but I just don't notice it maybe because I play more on console, the Ubisoft stuff. I don't know, but I do know the division to a lot of people looking forward to that. Right.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Because it's kind of like, it's like the division, obviously the sequel of the division, but the division is like kind of like an MMO type of gun game. Yeah. Right. That has a lot of like, it's kind of like their version of destiny sorta, but like with the Tom Clancy spin, I guess sorta is one way to put it.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I know it's very multiplayer heavy and you know, very much co-op squad type of thing. It looks interesting. I kind of wish I was more into those type of games. I'd probably give it a go, but not at $60, but maybe when the sequel comes out, they'll kind of like give the first one away.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And I'd be interested in like checking that out. Maybe talking about you playing free games and all that. Any of you guys in chat, really looking forward to the division too. I'm curious about you guys since Loki and I are kind of sitting here admitting.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I mean, we know it's a big game. We know a lot of people are looking forward to it. It's not exactly the type of thing that Loki and I are going to jump out and get day one. So I'm curious about you guys. Is there anybody that's going to be getting the division right off the bat?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:42.000
What do you think of this news? Uh, the fact that it's going to the Epic store, do you think it's a big deal or what? So yeah, it's a big deal. Just not my game.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:55.000
While I wait for the delay and the answers to come in, I will say as far as the Epic store goes, you know, they're still giving away those free games every two weeks. So I just picked up and I really, if you guys do have the Epic store on your computer, which if you have Fortnite on your PC, then you probably do.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:09.000
What Remains of Edith Finch is the game they're giving away right now. And I, that was one of my favorite games when it came out on the PlayStation four. It's a, you know, one of those more exploration based narratives, not a lot of skill needed.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Um, but, um, I, I really enjoyed that game and I highly recommend it. And the fact that they're giving it away for free, uh, you don't have an excuse unless you don't have a PC that'll run it. You really don't want another store on your PC. I'm sure you can think of excuses, but there, there's very few of them.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Exploration games. So I finally got my son to play, um, the Stanley parable. Oh yeah. So he's been playing through that. Um, but he's like, I finished it. I'm like, no, you haven't. You haven't finished it yet. You had to play through it multiple times.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Um, some comments on, uh, the division at deaf says, I remember the demonstration they gave at E3 with the gamer talk. Yeah, the relief. Oh God, can we stop with the gamer talk? But that isn't, that shouldn't be a reflection on the actual game. Uh, questmaster says, uh, the division is the third person shooter in post apocalyptic, uh, plague, uh, NYC. I love it. They really turned it around. Can't wait for the division to, although, uh, SG 100 map points out division two takes place in DC, not NYC.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:23.000
So, um, and the SG 100 mass suggests in game DC looks like if this shutdown drags on much longer, little government shutdown joke there in the chat room over it, Twitch TV slash vog network. We're making history. Yeah, we sure.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:49.000
The wrong kind of history, but we're making it anyway. Why don't we move on to, uh, another company making history that isn't the greatest kind, right? Yes. So formula one, um, apparently is cracking down on people playing sim racing games. So, uh, there's been, I don't know if anybody's paid any attention to YouTube drama and I won't even say necessarily drama.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It's just like YouTube bullshit, uh, where people get copyright claims for dumb shit. Like for example, there was one I saw this week that a guy was testing his microphone and was going like test one, two test one, two, like just checking levels and stuff.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Why would you do a YouTube video of that? Well, he was just checking to see how it came through or whatever. It was a live stream and it, Oh, okay. It was like a live stream. So he was testing Bs Twitch and it went and it went, it was a private video and then it got copyright claimed by a music company saying that this was a song that he saw.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:49.000
He's like, what the fuck? You know, like this, none of this made sense, but like it's this type of stuff that happens and people will blame the algorithm and stuff. So for example, in this case, uh, they're playing sim racing games and it's, some of them happen to be like Gran Turismo sport for example, and it's not necessarily they're playing with formula one cars, but they're on some tracks that, you know, formula formula one racing races on.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And so they said that some of the videos, I guess resemble formula and footage, and they're being removed, um, by YouTube or, you know, being copyright claimed by formula one management for a clip, you know, of someone live streaming sim gameplay, which is stupid because.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It's not, it's not, it's not their footage has no right to that footage, but it's a, if I'm not mistaken from what I'm reading about this, it sounds like it's like one of those bots, right? The bots that scan things out of control.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And here's the, here's the mess up part about YouTube to kind of remind people. So the way the copyright claim system works is so like, say, um, someone claims one of my videos and I say, well, no, I, you, your claim is wrong.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:44.000
You know, this is actually fair use, whatever. It's up to them. The people that claimed your video to decide, I think I'm right. And then they'll say, no, no, you're wrong.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And you get copyright strike. And then your only chance to fight the copyright strike is to take them to court. And so it's basically, you know, anybody can, you know, go on to someone's video and say, oh yeah, I'm going to claim this.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And then they say no. And then, um, you know, they counter claim or whatever, and then they can wait the 30 days and just like release it at that point. But they've already taken the revenue from you for those 30 days.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And it's basically like free money because there's enough YouTube isn't stopping them. So I was like, I would delete my YouTube channel and go somewhere else. But I realized that's easier said than done. Some of these people have been making a little money off of YouTube.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I think the art of being a professional YouTuber, much like a professional Twitch streamer, mind you, it's a volatile ground and not that. And this is my personal opinion. Okay. This is why I always stick with it as a hobbyist, because it could be gone one day here, one day gone tomorrow. You know what I mean? And it's shit like this that kind of proves that.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Or there's another YouTuber James Key, who I watch, and he does a lot of game streams and stuff. He does like weird like TikTok videos and stuff. And he was making fun of a video he saw on TikTok.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And apparently, the girl on there, or well, it was her management company saw this video. And so what did they do? They did a copyright claims on like a ton of copyright claims all at one time.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:18.000
And it's not necessarily that they're trying to say that this content, like the whole video is theirs. They're just doing it to get back at this person. And because they know that four or five copyright claims are at three, and you're out.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So three in your channel is deleted from YouTube. And so they just do that all at once. They'll say, Oh, yeah. And there was actually a game company. Several developers have tried this too, where someone will say something bad about their game, and they'll go and copyright claim all of their videos.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:47.000
The robot shit should not be legal. I don't know. I don't know another way to put it. Like, you might think I'm just being like, well, it's not a robot. So it's manual claims to the people go and do that. But another thing, but it's manual claims.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Where's the three strikes against the people? There is nothing. And they can't. That's a fucking YouTube problem. Why are people not going to these YouTube conventions and screaming the door?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:13.000
They can't because it's DMCA because YouTube has to be separate from this issue in order for them to be kind of like a safe harbor type thing. They can't put their, you know, horse in the race because if they put any sort of like, no, this is not legit.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:25.000
You know, the person looks at, then they're like starting to evaluate. Well, this country needs to re-examine copyright, trademark, IP reform, but we can't even run a fucking government right now. So I'm not going to hold my fucking breath. Yeah.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:40.000
This is just ridiculous and sad. This all kind of goes with the Tumblr bots too, right? That's been a big controversial thing, right? The bots on Tumblr that scan for pornography and like it gets some of it, but I don't get all of it. And it gets a lot of false stuff too.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:59.000
We still have algorithms, right? The algorithms aren't good enough to do their job correctly and that, and to bring it all back to the algorithm. So in a Formula One F1 spokesperson, they said that there was a temporary issue with some settings with inadvertently served claims against some user's content.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Well, all righty then, huh? And it was immediately noticed and quickly rectified. I don't think so, but sure, whatever.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:22.000
All right. Well, I need to de-stress after all this news. So maybe one game I could play to de-stress would be a brand new title that's coming out to the Switch in spring of 2019. It's called Panty Party.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:42.000
All right. Are you ready? Are y'all ready for a Panty Party? And you know, of course I have B-roll of this. So check this out. Panty Party coming out for the Switch. You literally play as a pair of panties and the developers go out of their way. This is not a hentai game. This is not a sexy girls wearing panties game.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:54.000
This is, this is, you are panties with your frilly flowery panties, striped panties going around, waving swords, firing, but why? I don't know.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Cause that's awesome.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's a Panty Fighter basically. So Panty Party coming out for the Nintendo Switch in spring of 2019. And yeah, that's really all I can say about that. Yeah. Are you going to play Panty Party?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Oh yeah. Day one.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I love this. From the, from the press release or what have you. Feel emotions of foolishness and excitement with Panty Party. Energetic dancing music. It is the melody of panties. Every color imaginable. It is the color of panties.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:45.000
This is a product that people will probably buy and yet they won't make president cat. They won't bring mother three to America.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Japan is getting an extra game on the Switch online service this week that we're not getting, but yet Panty Party. No hentai. Just, just the panties.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:09.000
You know, we could just make the US equivalent of it and just have like, you know, tighty whitey party or something like that. Boxers versus briefs.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Finally, we're going to put an end to this once and for all. Boxers versus briefs. That'll be the, the sequel. I don't know. Anyway, uh, let's see. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says stream that on your personal channel, not the vog channel.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:36.000
What's the problem? It's just cotton. It's just, it's nothing. There's no panties. There's no nudity. There's sentient underwear. Wait, wait, wait. Did Bobby say I'm not allowed to play something on the vlog channel? Is that something I heard?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:50.000
All right. I better, I better stop before he pulls the plug on it. It's new. Hey, it's news. We have to report it. It's a, it's happening in the industry. Gotta talk about it. I'm sorry to say.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Uh, Metal Mayhem suggests more like Call of Panty, modern panties. Uh, sure. Pod Culture suggests the spinoff Panty Racers. All right, enough. Done. Cancel this segment. Move on. Let's move on to the, uh, ooh, I didn't even advance it. I got so excited about the Panty party. I forgot to advance the thing, but let's move on to the classic game of the week.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:21.000
It's funny that somebody brought up racing games because I think we need to get to the classic game of the week and maybe hear about another one.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And so we took a step into the gaming vault and we dig up our old photo and put it next to our new photo while we visit the classic game of the week. And joining us here in studio, not on Skype tonight, say hello to Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Why hello there.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Hello. We've missed you.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
What'd you throw?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Uh, well, my aim's improving. I'm throwing classic NES carts, actually.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Oh, ow.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
But don't worry. They're just copies of Clu Clu Land. Nobody will miss them.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Freaking Clu Clu Land.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Anyway, you actually haven't done that as a classic game of the week, huh?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Um, I have.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Maybe. I don't know. I, there, there's a large, you know, you've done over 500 classic games. Well, maybe not you yourself because you have a lot of help sometimes, but, uh.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I've done most of them.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
You've done most of them. You really have. So, uh.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Hold on. I'm actually seeing if I've done Clu Clu Land.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
All right. Well, uh, in order.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I have not.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Okay. Well, maybe.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
The fuck?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Maybe a future, uh, game in the making. But anyway, uh, I know it's not what you picked tonight, but you went into the gaming vault and found a game that was at least 10 years old.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I think tonight's a little bit older. More like 20.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
More like 20.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And, uh, you found a game for people to check out. What is the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Crash Team Racing.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Everybody's Crash Team Racing. I don't know. I got nothing.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
By the way, of course, we all know that Awesome Games Done Quick is going on.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Well, not by the time this airs. They're wrapping up, uh.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Super Metroid is the finale.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Of course. Good. I'm glad to see it back.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Um, but, um, I had to watch, uh, Sanic Ball.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Oh, yeah. Bobby was telling me about that.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
That was pretty funny.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Good times.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Okay. Anyway, um, Crash Team Racing, also shown as CTR colon Crash Team Racing.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Because acronyms are cool. You're listening to OLR talking about CTR.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
We need CPR when this is done.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
With a CG OTW.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's a kart racing game. It was produced by Naughty Dog.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And it was published, uh, by Sony for the Playstation.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000
It is actually considered the fourth of the Crash Bandicoot games.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And it focuses on a team of racing characters who have to race against Nitrous Oxide to save their planet.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
So you can be one of fifteen different Crash Bandicoot characters.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Though only eight are available at first. So you do have to do some unlocking.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Um, you also have different offensive and speed boosts that will give you an advantage.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And, uh, the game was pretty much, you know, looked at with approval for its gameplay and graphics.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Although it had some kind of questionable audio.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Um, and then there was an indirect sequel called Crash Nitro Kart in 2003.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
The Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Playstation 2, Xbox, and N-Gage.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Thinking here about the taco on this one.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Wow.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And then there was a remaster titled, uh, Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Which was announced at the Game Awards 2018.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
And will be released on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on June 1st, 2019.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
So a lot of people have been thinking about this lately.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
That trailer for the new one did look really sweet.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000
So at any rate, um, you can, you know, you're driving along.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
You use the analog stick and buttons to go.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And you also have different crates that are through the whole area.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
With the question mark they have power-ups and weapons.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Um, if you have a weapon or power-up it will show in a box on the top of the screen.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And then you can activate them.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Then you get fruit crates with Wumpa Fruit that gives you more speed.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And strengthen your weapons and power-ups.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
So not to say it's a copy of Mario Kart, but.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
It's a copy of Mario Kart.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Imagine Mario Kart with Crash and friends.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
You also have the power slide.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Ooh.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Ooh, is that like the cha-cha slide?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I don't know.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
So when you slide you also have a turbo boost meter that will let you fill it up.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And then you also will burn up your gas.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
So it's different stuff.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the Kart Racer series.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But I did want to bring this up.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Because what do we have coming out?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Like I just said.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The remaster.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Sure.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
So you have different modes in the game.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
There's five different modes.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
You get adventure.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Time trial.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Can I say too, before you detail all the modes.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I think this one too, like even if you're not super into the Kart Racers.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I think, and you know we joke, it's a Mario Kart clone.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
There's been a lot of Mario Kart clones over the years, right?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
We had a pretty good Final Fantasy one.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
That really was my favorite of the clones.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
The Final Fantasy Chocobo racing.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
But there's been like Hello Kitty clones.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
There's been Sonic.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
There's been, you know, like everybody has kind of tried their own.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Everybody's Super Sonic racing.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Well, I mean the Mario Kart series is huge, right?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And you know, some of them have brought some new things.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
But anyway, Crash is really one of the better ones.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Especially, you know, in an area where you didn't really have a lot of crossover, right?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
PlayStation games were PlayStation.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Nintendo games were Nintendo.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Super Nintendo were Nintendo 64 around this era.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
You know, Dreamcast games were Dreamcast.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
You maybe had the rare third-party game that kind of crossed over.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
But for the most part, things really kind of stayed on this as they were on.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000
So like if your house didn't have Nintendo 64, like my college dorm room,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
but you had a PlayStation and a Super Nintendo,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.000
you kind of got Crash Team Racing because you didn't have something to play Mario Kart 64 on.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
You know what I mean?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
There's another power-up I forgot.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
But when you get air time, you actually build up a speed boost until you land.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
And then the longer you're in the air, the bigger the speed boost you get.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Nice.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
So anyway, your modes, you have Adventure, Time Trial, Arcade, Versus, and Battle.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
So you pick any of the characters.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And sorry, I just got texted telling me that the Mario Odyssey run was wild.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Oh, fun.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Thanks, Dan.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
That means they're almost done.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I think Super Metroid is all that's left.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Super Metroid, yeah.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Well, that and the blood-stained incentive.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Oh, right. Okay.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Yeah.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
So anyway, you can use the multi-tap for PlayStation to do a three- or four-player game.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So Adventure mode is one player where you have to race through all the tracks for trophies and stuff

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
and get all the things.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And that's, you know, your story mode.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000
So you also, of course, the other levels, you know, Time Trial, Arcade, Versus, and Battle,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000
they sound, you know, they basically explain themselves.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
As far as, let's see.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:54.000
So with the characters in this, you get Crash, you have Dr. Neo Cortex, you get Coco Bandicoot,

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:04.000
you get Dr. N. Gin, you get Pura and Polar, you get Tiny Tiger, and Dingodile.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
So you get Crash, the main villain, and B-Listers.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Yeah, and his stupid friends.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Yes.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And then you also get some other boss characters.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You get Ripper Roo, which is a street jack wearing kangaroo.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Didn't they steal that from Tank Girl?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Maybe.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, and Pinstripe Potoroo.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I have no idea what a potoroo is, now I have to look at this.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
It's a kangaroo-like marsupial, because of course, if it's anything from Australia,

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
it's either a marsupial or deadly.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:45.000
You also get the witch doctors Aku Aku and Uka Uka as your tutorial.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But you do not get the Uma Uma Nuka Nuka Appu Waha, the official state fish of Hawaii.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Right.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Yes.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Anyway, the game started development as a bunch of just block-headed characters,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
no Crash, nothing else with it.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Naughty Dog was showing it to Sony, and they had interest in the game to make it Crash-themed,

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
and Sony's like, okay, cool.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:17.000
So they made a deal with Universal, and they already had a plan for original characters in case it can go through.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
But production began after Crash Bandicoot 2,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:28.000
and it was made actually right about the same time that Crash Bandicoot Warped was being produced,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
so it was finished by then.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And so it basically, like, now this was funny because I actually watched a beta build of this.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
They used a replica of Crescent Island from Diddy Kong Racing to test the tracks.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And some of its data is still in the game.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:59.000
So they wanted to basically just use that to see how it would render and see how much better it would go.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
So they actually were able to get a lot of the game to run.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And it's really, believe it or not, fairly low-res.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Just they did some kind of marvel to make it work right.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.000
So it did get some pretty good reviews, generally favorable.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Famitsu gave it a 33 out of 40.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
EGM gave it a 9.3 out of 10.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
GameSpot gave it an 8.4 out of 10.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Quite respectable showing.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
The controls were really what was most praised about it.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And the graphics, they really thought that the graphics were great, that they weren't too complex.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But with the cartoony style and the use of how they used the textures and colors to keep the polys down,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
then they thought it was a really good use of it.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And some people really liked the background music, and some people said it was annoying as shit.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Or actually really boring in some cases. Nothing cute, clever, or memorable.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So yeah, we have the remaster coming out, which is Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So it's going to be out on June 21st, 2019.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
And we'll see what it looks like.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
But the thing about the new one is it's being recreated from the ground up.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Completely new assets, online play, cart customization, including all the carts from Crash Nitro Cart.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And they are actually adding in yet another boss as an unlockable character.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Fun.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
So there you go.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Crash Team Racing.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Woo hoo.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
CTR on OLR.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
On the CG OTW.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Anyway, we gotta get back to the main show, but one thing we're going to be talking about tonight, Dark Sakura, I know,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
because I can see the future, is the predictions.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Remember we did the time capsule last year?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
So we're going to go through that tonight.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And I'm curious, you know, I don't want to put you too much on the spot.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Maybe we'll get some more official predictions for you next week when I know you're here live during the show on January 20th.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000
But do you have any maybe like early predictions for maybe things you want to see in game?

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Maybe not so much an actual prediction, but just something you want to happen in 2019.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So much Animal Crossing.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You're eagerly awaiting the Animal Crossing, huh?

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yes. I actually have preordered.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Already?

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Yeah, I preordered when I bought.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
But Jamie, was it really a preorder or was it an order?

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
It was an order.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You knew I had to.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I know it's colloquialism, but it's a stupid one.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Yes. All right.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Dan's like, are you preheating the oven?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
No, I'm heating it.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
For all the delicious cookies.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I'm heating it now in preparation. I'm prep-heating the oven.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Anyway.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Yeah.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
All right. That's it. Let's get back to the live show.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Because you can't. It's like, how do you heat something before you heat it?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I don't know. Anyway.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Any last words for us, Dark Sakura?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Bronchitis sucks. Don't get it.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:14.000
All right. And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 759 for this January the 13th of 2019.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
With our show already in progress. Thank you guys so much for being here.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I noticed looking at the number of people watching on Twitch right now, we have over 50 people watching so much for checking out the show.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I really appreciate it. I see we've had some subscribers and stuff so far.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Thank you guys so much. Really appreciate it.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:37.000
For those who don't know, we've been doing our podcast on shoutcast for over 15 years in various forms, like through five and so forth.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Our first show you might have seen on the bottom bar go by was in June 2002.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So we've been doing this for a while and we just did the Twitch move in mid-December and it's been great.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
It's been 16 and a half years now.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Yeah, I know. It's been a long time. So the video thing is still a little weird and I've got a lot to learn and still managing more things than I was doing with audio.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
But having a lot of fun and getting to expose the show to new people on Twitch is always great.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And we really enjoy having you guys here to be able to participate with the show, getting to read what you guys have to say live in chat.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Hopefully getting some of your calls later on in the show as well.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:16.000
And yeah, it's been a real feel-good time, except for last week when the power went out. That was a feel-bad time.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.000
But crap happens. We managed about an hour show out of that anyway.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Yeah, and it was a nightmare coming home from that because people don't know how to drive when there's a power outage.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And you're supposed to stop at intersections, treat it like a four-way stop. People treat it like there's no stop, just keep on going.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
And yeah, it was a nightmare.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Alright, so I totally forgot to do this during the break, but I think you did it. So you're going to have to start us off while I try to hastily write here.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
But we're talking about now for the time capsule that we did earlier in the show.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.000
We wanted to put in there the things, the most anticipated games for 2019, right?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
So we can open it up in a year and be all, how did these games turn out?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Kind of like we had the Secret of Mana remaster in there from last year.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And it was kind of like, oh yeah, that kind of came and went, didn't it?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So let's take a look at the big stuff for next year. So, Loki, what are you going to put in there to reflect on in a year's time?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I'd be curious for you guys in chat as well, what are the things you're massively hyped about in 2019 over at twitch.tv slash vog network?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000
So I put down Crackdown 3 because I am somewhat hyped about that. I love me some Crackdown games.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I put Animal Crossing Switch because, I mean, I'll like that. My wife will probably be more hyped about that than I will, I guess.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I'm holding out for Borderlands 3, but in the case that that doesn't come out, well actually I don't know when this is coming out either,

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:45.000
but The Outer Worlds, because that looks awesome, that would be a good Borderlands type game and it's kind of Fallout-ish and I would be down.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I don't know if that's coming out in 2019, that might be a 2020 game, but it looked fucking awesome when we saw it, so I'm hoping to check that out.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
I may actually check out Rage 2 a little bit. It looked okay.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:06.000
And then also the new Fallout game, or not Fallout, Far Cry game that's coming out in February, the kind of post-apocalyptic thing,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.000
which reminds me, I think go back and play Fallout, or it keeps saying Fallout, Far Cry 5.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I was actually going to start Fallout 4 again because that was one of the games I was looking at last night to play.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000
It's been a while. I don't remember what happened when I last played it.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000
All I know is they patched out all my fun exploits and so that, you know, I gotta have mods now.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:37.000
There wasn't mods when I, they tell you how long ago it was that I played Fallout 4.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000
It was before they had mod support in Fallout 4. It's been that long.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
W04 in our chat says, broccoli farmer simulator. Those jokes are good.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I wanna, we should write down, is the broccoli thing still a joke?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Can you put that on a visa? Is the broccoli thing still a joke?

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I threw in a haberist, so I guess we can't.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Alright, okay, so I notice I agree with the wandering apparatus on one of these, so my anticipated games,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I hadn't even put Kingdom Hearts 3. I told, I feel like, I'm still convinced somehow that game's not coming out, ever.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Yes, I know it's only two weeks away, but like, I'm-

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
I don't even know what happens in the Kingdom Hearts games, I'm so lost.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
It just doesn't matter.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
It does matter, it's a story.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.000
It's Disney and Donald Won't Heal You. Alright, anticipated games, number one, Animal Crossing, of course, come on.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Number two, Metroid Prime 4, so I'm with a lot of you guys on that one, I'm really excited about that.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Number three, Harry Potter Wizards Unite, because you know I'm a sucker for the location-based games,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:40.000
so I am really curious to see how the Harry Potter game goes over and I really hope it's not garbage.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I'd be so sad. And then I added a fourth game deal with it, because I had to put Pokemon Gen 8 on it,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
because somebody else said Pokemon Gen 8 in chat, and I was like, oh, fuck yeah, I have to put that on there.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
So there you go. Those are my anticipated games for 20 months.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Honestly, my most anticipated games are gonna be the ones we don't even know about yet,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000
because that's kind of what it ends up being, is that there's like, there's so many games that are coming out,

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
like, I don't even know, like, think about this year, aside from, like, Animal Crossing, which will be fun for a while,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
but it's fucking Animal Crossing, it's gonna be the same goddamn game again,

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
and you're gonna play it for a while and you're gonna get bored with it. Whatever.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Um, great comments in chat, Miltonious Games, uh, Miltonous Games, sorry if I said your name wrong,

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Dragon Quest XI for Switch, because that's gonna be a thing in Japan, I don't know if we'll get it here, but hopefully.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Um, let's see, uh, Act Def says Goose Game, that's right, wasn't that called, like, Asshole Duck or something?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
No, it was Untitled Goose Game.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Okay, but it's awesome, everybody was calling it, like, Asshole Goose or something like that,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
which obviously they're not gonna call it.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000
No, that one looks awesome, there was, um, there's a Raccoon Game, too, that's like that, that looks awesome,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I wanted to check that out, um, all these devs I follow on Twitter, um,

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
there's some skateboarding game that they have coming out that looks pretty awesome, too,

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
that looks like Skate, but it's not Skate, I don't remember what it's called now.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So, anyway, you guys in chat have some great answers, and I really encourage you, like, you have to have some little thing like this,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
I don't even know where the hell, this is like a bank or something, it's, I don't think it comes through on the camera very well,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.000
this little picture of Darth Vader, appropriate, I suppose, uh, and, uh, find something in your house like that,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000
and fill it up with your own predictions, and so when we come back and do this again in a year's time,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
you can see how your predictions went, I think it's, I think it's fun, I think it's fun.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Uh, Wandering Apparatus in chat says, uh, I'm gonna Hufflepuff the Muggle out of that AR game when it comes out, who's with me?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I'm there, except I'll be, uh, Snake Emoji Slytherin, so, assuming we get to pick a house, we'll see.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:34.000
My kids are totally into Harry Potter right now, I mean, uh, I bought my youngest son a Harry Potter t-shirt,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
and they both got Harry Potter wands for Christmas, and so they're just like, they're digging Harry Potter,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
they're gonna be disappointed we're not going to Harry Potterland this year, but, maybe next year, they'll deal.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Maybe next year you can go to, uh, you know, where they make, uh, I don't know, the Frozen Peas Factory.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Frozen Peas Factory.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Alright.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000
You can't do that twice, they're gonna, they know better.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.000
They already suspect that they're not going to a broccoli farm, because they're like, well, what are we gonna do, you know, at a broccoli farm and stuff.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:15.000
So, like, they're like, that's, they're all, we know, they're all, we're not going to a broccoli farm, like, Mike, well, you don't know where you're going, so, just wait and see.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Alright, alright, let's move on, we gotta, uh, check out some rapid fire news, so we got some quick stories to cover, right, Logie?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Yep. Final Fantasy X and X-2 will be coming to the Switch and Xbox One on April 16th.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And then, of course, they're gonna be doing the Final Fantasy XII remaster will be coming out on both of those platforms on April 30th, so it's gonna be Final Fantasy April.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yeah, it's kind of interesting, there's not a lot of breathing room between those two titles.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I would have thought they'd try to spread it out a little bit, but, eh, whatever, alright.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:55.000
And then, um, you may remember those arcade one-up cabinets that you can go buy at your local Walmart or wherever.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Well, there's gonna be more cabinets coming out soon, so they've got Final Fight, which is gonna have Final Fight, 1944, Ghosts and Goblins, and Strider, that's coming out in February.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
That's a good, that's a good pack.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Uh, the Space Invaders cabinet, which is gonna be Space Invaders in both color and black and white, that's in February as well.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:21.000
If you're, you know, I remember this game in arcades, but, Golden Tea, that's gonna be coming out as well.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Golden Tea Classic, Golden Tea 2K, and Golden Tea 99 and 98.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000
It might seem like a weird pick, but that's that game that's like that random game they have in a bar.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Or at the Walmart arcade, you remember how like Walmart's got Deer Hunter and Golden Tea.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
So, like, it's, it's...

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Where's Big Buck Hunter?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Wait for 2020. It's an interesting choice, but it's not like completely out of random.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Oh my god.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:54.000
In fact, I could see where maybe they're trying to sell these to go in, well, legally, I wonder if they could, but maybe something to go in bars and places like, I don't know.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
You know what I want?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Well, I'm gonna get to what I want after we're done here, but.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Okay.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:05.000
So they have the Mortal Kombat cabinet, which is coming out on, in September, that's Mortal Kombat 2, or 1, 2, and 3.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And then the karate champ cabinet, that's Karate Champ, Bad Dudes, Burger Time, and Caveman Ninja.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And that's in September, as well.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Those are each at $300.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Bobby kind of echoes in chat that, remember the Golden Tea was, for many years, the highest grossing arcade game in America, for years.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Yeah, because it's the one game that would show up the places that arcade games don't show up.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So I know that right now, the reason that they don't have these light gun games and stuff, because they don't really have a way to do light gun stuff on LCD or LED screens and stuff like that.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Well, until now, I mean, they're gonna be working on something, but.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Oh yeah, I thought we had a story on that.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Up until now, it's been not possible.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:55.000
But, I would totally love for a Namco gun collection.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Point blank.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yes.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Point blank and time crisis?

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Yes.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Yes, please.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Oh my god.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Point blank is like one of those series, like, it's up there with the guardian legend for series I most want to make a big return.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I would even be fine with, you know, they did it before, like with the move controller, or even like the switch controller or something like that.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I would be fine with just another point blank remaster collection or something like that. Bring it back. Point blank was awesome.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Let's see, in chat, Tiger Claw suggests that arcade 1UP will need to lower the price on the cabinets, because I still see a bunch of them at Walmart.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:42.000
You know what's interesting? This whole retro thing, like, you know, I mentioned I was at Fry's over the weekend, and I saw, you know, the stacks of PlayStation classics, but I didn't realize how much of those, because they have like, like an entire aisle.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Like you got one aisle for like PlayStation games, one aisle for Xbox games, they have like an entire aisle for like retro consoles.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Because everybody's trying to get in on this now, for like, you know, the entire flashbacks and like, just random like the, there's like a Pac-Man, Namco thing, a Mega Man 2.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:09.000
They also do these like, loot box things. It's kind of like, you know how you have, you know, the, well, the actual loot box service, where you get like a box full of like, tchotchkes and t-shirts and stuff like that for certain things.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:25.000
They sell those in these retail stores for like different things, like the PlayStation or the Nintendo or Zelda loot box things, where it has like a bunch of, you know, socks or pins, who knows what.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:31.000
But I'm sure as the technology, you know, to like build those machines comes down and down, they figure out how to build them cheaper.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I bet the price will start to come down as well. And mentioning in chat, already starting to see them for like $249, which you know, I think it depends, you know, it's all about supply and demand.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And I think people are really seeing like, oh, these people are willing to pay for these emulators, they've been playing for free for years.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:48:02.000
If I had the space, I mean, those, I'm wondering what kind of mods you can do on those things, because it would be cool just to hook up like, because I, I can't see buying, you know, granted, yeah, you're supporting somebody that maybe, maybe somehow the money's trickling down to my data.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But like, it'd be interesting to see like, being able to add more games to an existing cabinet, like I wish they would do just like a service like that where you buy the shell cabinet, and then you pay for the licensing for the different games and just download them virtual console style.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I mean, that would be amazing.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Yeah. Anyway, I'm moving on to some other rapid fire news. This is sad news has to do with civilization five game still there. But unfortunately, the narrator of the game and the voice you hear in the game did pass away.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Over the weekend, William Morgan Shepard was the actor's name passed away. You might know him from civilization five. That's his tie to gaming. But he's had a lot of appearances, a lot of sci fi stuff. He was in Doctor Who episodes.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Star Trek was also in the Medal of Honor games. I know William Morgan Shepard from the Elvira movie. He was the antagonist in the Elvira movie. He was like the uncle that was trying to Yeah, anyway, that's what I remember William Morgan Shepard from so and I had no idea that he was the voice in civilization five so rest in peace.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000
And thank you for those contributions to pop culture, gaming culture and all those awesome things.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Moving on, we got to say something about awesome games done quick. I guess we already we talked about a little bit, I think, on our call with much of that this week. Yeah, I talked about this on the Bobby call.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I won't repeat myself too much. But Shane brought to my attention that Mega Man DOS was going on. I had to watch that because I actually remember that game.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And yeah, I watched some of the other stuff. I saw a little bit of the whole the guy that said he was going to do the flossing during the cutscene in Splatoon two and all that stuff.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:43.000
So yeah, I kind of watched it here and there. So it's always a good time. They do. They do a good really, really good charity event there. You get to see a lot of different games.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:54.000
It's a good like informational game period because what I like about it. Here's what I like about the thing is that I don't necessarily like the speed run is kind of like, all right, cool.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And it is a great way to feature a lot of games in a very short amount of time. But what I like hearing is the speed runner telling stories about the game and why they enjoy the game and how they got turned on to the game and about the game like history.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:17.000
The lady that was streaming the Mega Man DOS thing. She was bringing up like points about like it was developed by one person and like things I was not aware of.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:26.000
So I thought that was really cool. That's what I love most about that event is like hearing from kids. You all know, I love passion about games and stuff and that kind of positivity.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:35.000
That's that's what I love most about the speed runs is just hearing people be fucking enthusiastic about video games as opposed to like a lot of the doom and gloom we see sometimes in gaming culture. Exactly.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So, yeah. Anyway, but they did raise over two million. I don't do like two point three, two point four million. This article, I don't think has a final number there. I think it's just two point four million, I think.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:55.000
OK, just so and probably still going as because they keep it open for a little bit after. Right. So the Prevent Cancer Foundation is what they're raising money for.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Great cause. Great, great charity event. So congratulations to everybody involved with that. Next event is Summer Games. Is that the one that's in Orlando or is it next year's games done quick?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I know Bobby was talking a little bit about that on his show tonight there. So, yeah, very cool. Bobby is actually trying to audition for a host announcer position. I hope he gets it. That'd be great.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:28.000
So Summer Games is in Minnesota. Next Awesome Games is in Orlando. And that makes sense because Awesome Games is the winner one. So you want to choose a place that's going to be a little calmer in the winter.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And then Minnesota. Summer is a good time to go to Minnesota. So it makes a lot of sense. Well, congrats to the folks at Awesome Games done quick.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:42.000
All right. Now we're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases in our release date segment. Loki.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Yes. So we do have a couple of things coming out this week, starting off with Yakuza 4. That's coming out on PlayStation 4. And we have a game.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I don't know if this is a YEEC. Postmodern RPG. It's Y-I-I-K. I don't know if that's supposed to be some acronym or something, but yeah, a postmodern RPG. And that's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:15.000
We've got Ace Combat 7, Skies Unknown. That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. I know it supports the PlayStation VR, so you may have to check that out. Hopefully they have a demo.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:23.000
And last but not least, we have Travis Strikes Again, No More Heroes on Nintendo Switch. That's it.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I'm surprised you're not all about that game, maybe.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:36.000
I'm a big fan of No More Heroes, but I'm not sure if this is going to be a traditional No More Heroes game. It's a little bit different, so I may check it out.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Okay. That's fair. All right. Let's travel over and check out some Japanese release dates. Believe it or not, Player Unknown Battlegrounds on the PlayStation 4 in Japan is a game to look forward to this week, as well as Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet, the complete edition.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Ace Combat 7, Skies Unknown also gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 4. And a remaster of Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu wo Sugomono is a remastered game that's coming out from Sega this week in Japan.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Checking out the Nintendo Switch real quick to see if they get anything this week. Actually, it doesn't look like it. It looks like it's a quiet week in Japan this week, at least as far as retail releases go.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I'm sure they still have some digital stuff going on this week, so that is what you have in Japan this week.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Loki, can you cover Europe for us while we're still missing a Dark Soccer here?

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Oh yes, I can do that. So we've got Ace Combat 7 coming out there as well on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:41.000
And then also Senran Kugura Burst Renewal, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 as well.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:55.000
And then Raven Remastered on the Switch. And I think that's it. It's hard to tell because game.co.uk has all their release dates out of order, even though you tell it to sort by date.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
So thank you for being stupid.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Alright, let's see, moving on. Quest Buster talks about that Yik game saying, I tried out the Yik demo, it's like a weird mix between Shadow Hearts and Earthbound set in the 90s.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:19.000
So that's what Yik is. Act Def says Ace Combat 7 is going to be awesome. And Frodo Swagons wants to know if that's a Pikachu creeping behind Loki. Yes it is.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Well, you've got your bag in front of it too. So Pikachu's holding the bag for you. But on the cam there is a Pikachu. And actually this is a brand new addition to the studio this week.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.000
On said Fry's Trip, check that out. That's a little pillow, which I know doesn't do you guys on the podcast good.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:40.000
But imagine a little tiny body pillow, but like a small one, not like a big one. But it's like a Famicom controller.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And that's what I kind of like about it is that instead of being a Nintendo controller, it's a Famicom controller. And I think that's kind of cool.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:52.000
So that's up there as well in our set, which you can check out over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Since we are an affiliate now, unfortunately if you do want to watch the video, you have to be here live on Sunday night or be a subscriber.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:04.000
But you can use your Twitch Prime subscription if you have that to subscribe to VOG Network and be able to see the videos as well.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000
But folks do make clips of Orange Launch Radio. You get those little short 30 second clips. Those are free.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:15.000
So if you want to check out what the studio looks like, hopefully somebody made a clip of a little piece of this week's show at some point.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
So you can always check that out over on VOG Network.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And Bobby kind of also dropping a hint that we might start looking at doing reruns now that we can do a little more video on demand.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Because we're talking about expanding stuff here at VOG Network, not just the Chusos on Sunday night.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
But of course Anime Jam Session is going to be starting in hopefully later this month.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I hope because I think the radio feeds going away this month. So hopefully they're starting this month.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
And some other stuff as well we're talking about that I'm not ready to disclose yet.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Oh that makes sense. So Black Mamba 1977 says Yik stands for Y2K.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Oh that makes sense.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
That makes more sense.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Why do they get Y? Alright.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Y Roman numeral K.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Yeah. Alright that's dumb.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Oh Bobby Blackwell says Anime Jam Session is starting this Tuesday. So they're coming back from their hiatus onto Twitch. That's great.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I hope we'll all be here to support them. So that'll be Tuesday night. So check that out.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Alright. Let's move on. We've got some more gaming news to cover. Starting off. Oh no we're going to go to the mailbag next.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Yes. Starting off with the mailbag.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I can't even read my own damn schedule. Alright let's go to the mailbag next. I'm used to Dark Soccer doing this segment.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Alright we have a few emails to get to tonight because we kind of had a cut short show last week.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000
So let's get to our first email tonight from Hydro Thunder.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I love that game.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I know. Good name.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
That's another cabinet that I wish they'd bring a home version to. But you know.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Might be a little bit.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
That's a little bit. Oh my God. San Francisco Rush even.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
There you go. There you go. Alright anyway.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Hydro Thunder says Hey Loki, Sky, and Dark Soccer.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I've been thinking about purchasing a Switch and I'm trying to decide whether I should go all in on digital downloads or physical games.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Here's what I'm thinking. For a digital, most cartridges require a download and some games could have large patches.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000
So I think it makes sense not to have to deal with cartridges if you need to use SD cards anyway.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Also, digital downloads open the door to backwards compatibility on future consoles like 360 games on Xbox One if Nintendo decides to do that someday.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:17.000
However, having cartridges would allow me to share games with friends where digital would not and it allows for second hand sales.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I believe you touched on this in the past, but I'm curious to see if your thoughts have changed after almost two years since the Switch release.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I've been a long time podcast listener ever since I found the To Go edition on my PSP when they added podcasting way back when.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Thanks Hydro Thunder. Well thank you for being a fan of the show for so long all the way back to To Go on OLRPSP.com which no longer works.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
But yeah, that's awesome.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Sold the files for it. That was something I dug up too.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I never realized how many folks that PSP thing brought to OLR.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I think I really under, because I think a lot of you weren't talking to us then.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
You were just kind of listening on the PSP. But yeah, I feel like we get emails every other week.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Oh yeah, I found you guys through PSP. That's pretty cool. Good job Loki on that.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Hooray!

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Well anyway, Hydro Thunder did a great job making the case for and against all by themselves.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000
So I don't know what to add to that. You really have to just kind of make the decision on what works best for you.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.000
For me, like it depends on like stuff that I, am I going to resell it or not?

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I tend to buy stuff digitally, but I have a 128 gig card that goes with my Switch.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And I do purchase a lot of games physically because I end up getting them for my kids as gifts.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
And so you can't open up a digital thing.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
But I also purchase things off the eShop if it's on sale.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Like some of the older LEGO games.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Like we had, what did I buy for them that was off, that's digital?

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:47.000
I know I, oh, LEGO Worlds for example, which is kind of like the Minecraft type game.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I purchased that when it was like 10 bucks.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
There's been other digital games that I've purchased as well from there.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Like, I don't know. So a lot of those, I'll pick it up wherever it's convenient.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
If it's like a digital only game, then obviously it's going to be digital.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:09.000
If it's an older game, I may end up picking that up used if I can find it cheap enough.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:17.000
But a lot of the times, especially if you're looking for games retail, they don't drop in price very much because of Nintendo.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
But, and same with, I mean, I guess the same could be said for digital.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
So it's wherever I can find it cheapest.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Yeah, for me, I still have to kind of weigh the pros and cons versus, you know, if there's a sale,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000
if I can get it pretty cheap for digital, then I'll opt for digital.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Or if it's like a game where it's like, I know I'm never going to take this game out of my console.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I want it everywhere. And I started doing this with 3DS games like Animal Crossing, for example.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Yeah, Pokemon Let's Go. Like I knew I was going to get that day one.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
So I was like, I'm just going to download it. And I bought it that way.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Here's the one big drawback I think Hydro Thunder left out of the email that I think is important to consider is that digital stores and that stuff, they're not always there forever.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Case in point, the Wii, right? The Wii eShop, you can't buy stuff on that anymore.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:06.000
And I believe if they haven't already, they're going to pull the plug where like, if you don't download it, you're never going to be able to.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
That store is going to be poof, gone. So that's the problem.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:18.000
The one problem with digital stuff is that there may come a point where if you didn't download it digitally, you will never be able to download it digitally again.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000
P.T. would be another great example, right? That one got ripped from the store completely.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:29.000
That's obviously, there's a lot of different stuff going in there. I don't want to necessarily equate it completely, but I do think it is something to consider.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:41.000
So, you know, if you buy a game for 60 bucks and it's retail and it's in a cartridge, you know that if you want to sell that back or loan it out or whatever, it does have value that you can sell back.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:55.000
But if you buy a game on sale where it's a $60 game getting for 20 bucks, but it's going to be digital, then I think you start to kind of weigh this, well, I'm getting it really cheap, I can't sell it back, but I got it cheap, so the money I lost, I'm getting, you know what I mean?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And the other thing too, I think it's the same for physical, is the Nintendo points that you earn as well.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:14.000
So, when you purchase a game, you can redeem the points on the store, and I know digitally you get almost 10% back in points, which turns in the money.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:23.000
So, for example, if I buy a $60 game, I get $6 back that I can then use it for another digital game later on, and that ends up paying for things as well.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
And that drops the price for certain games.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Metal Mayhem in our chat says, physical games, especially collector's editions, often have physical extras.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Yeah, some digital games do have extras, but some people prefer the physical stuff. Oh, absolutely.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Sometimes the physical stuff is out of control, right? But even now, even the physical stuff is getting controversial, right?

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Fallout 76, the bag, right? There's some interesting stuff going on, but that's an exception.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Anyway, the Wandering Apparatus in chat says, I was impressed with the Pokeball. Way more functionality than I had previously thought, speaking of physical things.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And the Pokeball, and that whole functionality, that's not something necessarily you get digitally.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
My favorite function of the Pokeball Plus is how fast it can collect dirt on it.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Is that so? I didn't know that.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
It is dirty as fuck, and I can't clean that shit for it all. And it's not my kids' fault at all, it's in my pocket.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:24.000
So it just rubs up against my black wallet that I have, and so it just scuffs the crap out of it. I don't know why.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Alright, well let's get to another email tonight from, this next one is from Robert M.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I do see that currently, alongside the $13 Smash Brothers Amiibos, I'm seeing Mabel from Animal Crossing for $5, due to the glut of these figures.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I don't know what that figure did in New Leaf Welcome Amiibo, so what do you expect Mabel to do in the upcoming Switch games?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Store and transport designs, perhaps? Also, with the 20th anniversary of the Japanese release of N64 Smash Brothers coming up, will there be special events?

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Total guess fanfic speculation. I think the Amiibo thing in the new Animal Crossing game will be a hotel.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:12.000
And if you use the Amiibo, then certain people will show up and stay at the hotel, and possibly give you things, items, each one may have a random item that comes with it.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I think that's what they'll do. Because I don't think they'll maybe have the character on the Amiibo move to your town permanently.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:25.000
But I think you could force them to visit by using the Amiibo in a hotel-type feature. That's my guess. My wild guess.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Yeah, I actually bought this week the Amiibos, because my kids have 2DSs, and so they don't have the Amiibo functionality built in.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.000
So I bought the Amiibo scanner thing for the 2DS or the older 3DS systems.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:48.000
And so, so far we haven't figured out what will work with it. I have a Villager, but apparently that's too epic to scan with the ghost thing.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
I know you can use it, it is compatible with the game, but you have to use it for something else, I think, to get furniture.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I don't know, I haven't played that game. I'll let my son and my wife figure that shit out.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I was gonna get one of those spoofers. I'm gonna spoof that shit, because they're fucking expensive.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Akdeft in chat points out, Animal Crossing Amiibo are dirt cheap right now. So dirt cheap. For New Leaf, you can score some of the Amiibo and have special residents.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Where are those then? Where are they selling them at that they're so cheap?

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:29.000
There's probably the dollar store, honestly. A lot of overstock, I bet. I think with the Amiibo, they kind of put out a bunch of series that the masses didn't really want.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Animal Crossing didn't really work out so well because there wasn't really a console game.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Yeah, I beat down them for the Animal Crossing ones.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:46.000
They put out too many of those Kirby. Sorry, Akdeft, you're gonna hate me for that. But I think most people weren't looking for getting Waddle Dee and some of the real deep cut Kirby characters.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I think they put out too many of those. Like Kirby, Dedede, Meta Knight, some of the big ones, especially the ones in Smash, that makes sense.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:59.000
But I think there's too many of them they really started putting out. I think Nintendo kind of broke the formula there.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:05.000
But they're still putting out what? They're putting out Ice Climbers, King K. Rool, like the other Smash characters and so forth.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
So it's not like Amiibo are going away anytime soon.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Anyway. Alright, one more email tonight. And if you want to email us at some point, participate at orangelandraday.com. It's the place to do it.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
You can see that written over there in the text for those of you watching on Twitch.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000
For those of you listening on the podcast, write it down real fast. Participate at orangelandraday.com.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
This email from Frodo Swaggins.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Thought somebody may hate or get a kick out of this. I was at my friend Randy's house and he randomly shows me this and I instantly thought of Rob.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Apparently it's a custom made Bowsette Amiibo.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I was pretty surprised by the quality. LOL. Feel free to show it on stream if you want.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Well unfortunately I can't show it on stream because I have to load that stuff in advance and I forgot to do that tonight.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000
But I did look at the pictures earlier and it is a well done.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:00.000
You know it's like they took the original backing and made a custom one and they took like a peach figure and just basically made it Bowsette.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000
It was well done even though we didn't get to cover it last week and I was really excited to talk about it.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
But Nintendo has confirmed Bowsette is not canon.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Nintendo even tried to say Luigi was the one that tried to wear the hat. I don't know. Anyway.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:19.000
And this is how you make Luigi. This is how you make Luigi Nintendo.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:26.000
People hate me because I'm so anti Bowsette. I'm not really. I just think like y'all went crazy with the Bowsette thing.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.000
I'm just slow down internet. Slow down with that stuff. That's my only thing.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:37.000
But I do think the custom amiibo for what it's worth is really well done. So props to your friend Frodo Swagons.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I'm sorry I can't show that on stream right now. But for those listening on the podcast that need a little bit of a visual as well.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Just imagine a peach doll but it's been done up like Bowsette and actually put back in the plastic with the custom backing and everything else.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:56.000
It was well done. I've seen things like that. I'm pretty sure I saw like a Waluigi one that was done in a similar way at some point.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:02.000
So anyway let's move on. We do have some more stories for you guys. We're going to try to get to the Skype line.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:09.000
We are going to be working on a move to Discord very soon for our calls. Not tonight. We have no time to switch that over that fast tonight.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:15.000
But I would say sooner rather than later like next week if I'm able to get all the testing done before then.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:22.000
We will be moving to start taking calls on Discord. And so you'll want to be on our VOG Network Discord in order to do that.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000
And to join our VOG Network Discord you just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
And that will generate the invite for you and everything you need to get into Discord.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Because later we will be taking calls on Discord in later weeks.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Tonight we'll still try Skype but with the new setup over here and everything it's going to be so much easier when we go to Discord.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:45.000
So I'm looking forward to that part. But for now we do have some more news stories for you guys before we get to one of the last Skype segments.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
A story on Fortnite right Loki? Sort of?

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Yeah so this is in regards to Epic Games not receiving a very good score through the Better Business Bureau.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:02.000
And this is in regards to unanswered. They have 247 unanswered customer complaints.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I know one problem with Epic Games especially the Epic Games Store is they don't really have a centralized forum or community pages for any of their games.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:19.000
And I know we had a story a few weeks ago when they were talking about the whole Epic Games Store that people were having issues with games.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000
They were going to the Steam forums to talk about stuff because there wasn't anything kind of built into.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.000
It's almost as if this game this company made got bigger than any of them could have ever anticipated.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Well I don't think it's necessarily. I mean yeah there's that too but I think it's just they don't really have a way to take complaints.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Or to take.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
They need a complaint department.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:49.000
So yeah so apparently it says many of the complaints center around unauthorized credit card charges or account hacking.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Yeah unauthorized charges my child.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:06.000
So you know apparently Epic said that they're aware of instances where users accounts have been compromised and they're working using well known hacking techniques.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
It says they're working resolve these issues directly.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I don't know but then again you get to the whole Better Business Bureau part of that. It's a scam anyway so you know.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
It is what it is.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
So why.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
They will try to do better.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Do you think Epic's actually going to take this seriously and try to fix this.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I think they'll try to do better but it's a better.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
You know the Better Business Bureau isn't like an actual like government thing anyway.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
For one it's still like Yelp.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000
For one it's still open.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
You're right it's that's actually exactly what it's old school Yelp.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Because that's the thing too is I think they have like I've heard stories where people will they'll say you know contact the businesses say hey you want to get a better rating you know pay us some money and we'll make sure they get a D instead of an F.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
They're going to try to raise that grade to a D plus.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Yep.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
All right.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Moving on let's talk about Final Fantasy and a new digital card trading game.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:09.000
This was first kind of suspect speculated suspected when some Japanese trademarks went in because Square Enix earlier in the week trademarked a Final Fantasy digital card game in Japan.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
And you know Final Fantasy actually does have a trading card game on if you've ever seen it.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I've always been very curious if this is any good to any of our listeners play it.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I'd be so curious if the Final Fantasy trading card game is worth my time because it looks interesting.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I know they sell like booster decks with different different like a Final Fantasy 13 deck a seven deck you know and all that type of stuff.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
So I'm super curious about it.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.000
So anyway Bandai Namco actually filed a series of trademarks for Japan.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
They do a lot of stuff Square Enix in Japan.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Anyway long story short then they announced the actual game for PC and smartphones.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:50.000
So Square Enix did announce this but get this it's going to be on the Yahoo Japan because Yahoo is still a big thing in Japan whereas here it's kind of I don't think as many people use it as in the early days the Internet.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:57.000
But Yahoo Japan game plus platform in 2019 is when this will be coming out but it's on Yahoo Japan.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.000
So that means as far as like an America version coming out I don't I wouldn't hold my breath.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I don't know. We'll see. You never know.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Could be the smartphone versions I guess could make their way over here.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
There will be a beta test that I think starts next week January 18th through the 25th.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
But this is in Japan.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Only 10,000 users will be accepted and it is going to be a card based turn battle game.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:25.000
But it doesn't necessarily look like it is the same game that is like the table top trading card game looking at the pictures.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
This looks very different to me.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
It doesn't look like the same game.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:34.000
But anyway you will be able to develop characters and beat your rivals and make an original deck.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
There's a Web site you can read all about it.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:44.000
JP dot Square Enix dot com slash FFDCG for Final Fantasy digital card game.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
So cool.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Anyway looking at chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Bonds 006 says I use Yahoo every day and AOL and Outlook.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Hey some habits are hard to break.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:02.000
I just don't like I just don't know if Yahoo is like the forefront of people's Internet surfing like it used to be back in the day.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Wandering Apparatus apparently has played it saying it's a pretty fun game not as complicated as Magic the Gathering.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
So no killing your friends and looking up rulings every game.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000
There you go.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:19.000
SSJ 100 Matt throwing it back to the worst people right in the comments section on Yahoo News articles.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Rule is never read the comments.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Do you remember when O.L.R. was a network on life 365.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
This would be before VOG.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Yes.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Before all games.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
This is when Orange Orange Radio was a network on life 365.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
OK.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
I had a show like I did it.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I don't.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Was it Vanilla Sky.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Was that what I called it at the time.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Yeah.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000
There was one of those.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.000
But then there was the outside the box some other I just like little pet project shows right because I've done spin off shows once in a while.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Anyway there was a segment we did on one of those shows that was always guess the lie when it comes to Yahoo comments.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
I remember what we called it.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:04.000
But it was basically like we would read three legitimate Yahoo comments and then one that we made up and it was hard to tell which one was fake because there's so much crazy shit on Yahoo comment news articles.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.000
So anyway hopefully in Japan they treat each other a little more with respect.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
And that'll be true with the trading card game as well.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
So anyway.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
All right.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Let's see.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Bobby Blackwell says Rob doing other projects.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
This is completely unexpected news.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
I know.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I know.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Black Mamba says wife says no DT you have too many cards in regards to dark Tetsuya saying I wanted to get into the trading card games there.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Milton is games.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
I'm so sorry if I'm butchering your name says I miss Hoard House.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I miss it too especially now that I play Wow again.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
But you will be.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
I still talk to everybody from the Hoard House days.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
A really quick where are they now.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Grandpa still does starboard power coupling.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
So if you're not listening to that podcast you should.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
He just got back from the Star Trek cruise and convinced me to go next year.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.000
So I'm going on a Star Trek cruise next year thanks to Grandpa from the Hoard House days.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Extefer ended up moving.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
He lives in North Carolina now.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
So he lives on the East Coast.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000
But he is going to Dragon Con with me this year.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000
So not only am I going to Dragon Con and Bobby Blackwell and who knows us.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Extefer is making his Dragon Con debut this year.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
So look forward to that in 2019.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
And then Shane.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Well we mentioned that earlier in the show.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000
He just got married.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Which is a pretty big life development there and is playing some Wow with me these days.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
So that's a little where are they now for Hoard House.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
So there you go.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
They still do their side projects as well.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Extefer does streaming.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Shane isn't really podcasting right now because he's had a lot of transition stuff going on.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
But maybe he'll get back into it.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
I don't know.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
But they're all on Twitter.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Go follow them.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Alright.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
That's enough about old podcasts that folded a while ago.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Let's move on to other stories.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Loki.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Yes.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Let's talk about the Xbox Game Pass Quest.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
And so this is a new thing that they're going to be adding.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.000
That basically it's different things you can do.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Earning achievements earns you different points.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.000
And these reward points can be used to trade in for different things like money.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:12.000
So for example in the month of January they've got several different things you can do.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
So for example they have one that's called Extraction Expert.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000
You complete two specific extraction achievements in Tom Clancy's The Division.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And you get 200 points.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
So you get to finish it by the end of January.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000
So these are different from Gamerscore.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Yeah.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
They're different from Gamerscore.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.000
It's kind of like if you've used some of the Microsoft services they have different Microsoft

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:37.000
points you can get for using Bing or for like answering surveys and bullshit like that.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:44.000
And you can trade them in for like Microsoft points or Microsoft Game Store money and stuff like that.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.000
So it's similar to that but it's basically just playing different games and getting achievements.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.000
And then you earn up credit to get different things.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.000
So one of the things that you can get of course is like money.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.000
So they have a $1.25 Xbox gift card which is $1.25.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.000
It's a 2100 points or 1700 points.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Yeah so you can earn 2100 points in January and 1700 points gets you a $1.25 Xbox gift card.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Or if you want a free month of Xbox Game Pass it'll cost you 7000 points.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
This is like what the hell is that website.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
And I'm not this is not a paid advertisement.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I'm not endorsing this site because I don't even know if it's still around.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000
What is that site that Amazon runs.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.000
And you do these dumb little tasks like fill out surveys.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Oh and you get like five cents like Amazon Turing project.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.000
It was somebody in chattel know what I'm talking about.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
But it's a website.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:46.000
And like if you were to do that website full time you would be making less than minimum wage basically.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000
And you get little Amazon gift cards for like 10 cents.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
It's like that.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Thank you.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Mechanical Turk.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
M. Turkey.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Yeah.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Thank you.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Thanks Chad.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Chad to the rescue.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000
So there you go.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
I don't know why but I'm reminded of that.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.000
But with like video games.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000
But it's it's neat though it's just like maybe and it's all stuff that's on Game Pass.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
So all these are Game Pass titles.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I think it's fine because you know what.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000
It's not like it's costing you any additional money if you already have Game Pass.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000
And all it is is encouraging you to play different games.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
And I think that's fine.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000
And you can do it and you get free money.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Rama says what I said about the minimum wage is not true.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Granted it was from something I read a couple years ago when I think I made my first dollar on that website.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
And probably my only dollar I made on that website.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
So things may have changed to be fair.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
So sorry if I misspoke.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000
So but yeah I you know.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I guess if you're bored and you're just sitting there with you know you're watching television.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Like why not do a little task and make some money while you watch Bird Box or whatever on Netflix right now.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000
So yeah.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
So yeah.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.000
So this is something that they're going to be switching out these different quests every month.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
So hey that's cool.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:09.000
I mean it's something to I don't know if I'd necessarily like try to get all of these.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
But you know it's it's neat that they have it available.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Yeah.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
It doesn't cost you anything more than Game Pass.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
So I'll tell you what it's better than doing nothing.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
At least it's an attempt to do something kind of cool.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Better than nothing.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Yeah.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
All right.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Well speaking of nothing that's how many Super Nintendo games we currently have playable on the Nintendo Switch.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
But who knows.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.000
There are some indications that things may be changing because good old data mining.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:41.000
So the latest version of the Switch Online NES app was data mined and apparently 22 different Super Nintendo games are mentioned.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Now not that this should mean anything.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.000
After all the PlayStation Classic was data mined and they found all these games that didn't really end up on the PlayStation Classic.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
So this could be testing.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.000
This could be just a load of crap.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
It could be anything.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000
But anyway I'll read this list real quick because if nothing else it's a great trip down memory lane of Super Nintendo stuff.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Super Mario Kart.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Super Soccer.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Zelda Link to the Past.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Demon's Crest.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Yoshi's Island.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Stunt Race FX.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Kirby's Dream Course.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Pop and Twinbee.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Star Fox.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Contra 3.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Kirby Super Star.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Kirby Dream Land 3.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Super Metroid.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Super Mario World.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Pilot Wings.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
F-Zero.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Star Fox 2.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Super Punch Out.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Super Mario All Stars.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
And Breath of Fire 2.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:33.000
If nothing else that's a really solid like good mix of like mainstream games we all think of when it comes to Super Nintendo.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
And some somewhat deep cuts like the Stunt Race.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Stunt Race FX.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I don't remember that game playing very well.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And it sounds to me though with the whole Star Fox 2 and stuff it sounds like these are just the same titles that were in the SNES Classic.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
They're not though.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Because the SNES Classic had 24 games in it.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
But there's different regions.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.000
And I don't believe it had Stunt Race and it didn't have Breath of Fire 2 I'm pretty sure.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
It didn't have a Stunt Race but.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
So there's a, but you're right there is a lot of crossover for sure.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
But with the Classic NES and the Switch Online NES library there's a lot of overlap as well but not 100%.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I'm surprised they're putting Star Fox 2 in there.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Yeah.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000
So be interesting.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Be very interesting.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:24.000
It would definitely would be nice to get some additional games on top of just the two a month.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I honestly I don't play really anything in that collection.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000
I know Blaster Master just got added this month and I was like.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Not yet. It's next week actually.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:35.000
They just announced it for this month.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.000
I'm just like eh. I don't know.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Bobby Blackwell says they are discontinuing the SNES Classic so maybe this is why Star Fox 2 will live on.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000
That is true.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
That would make sense.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Jeff says is this rumored edition really worth paying for the service considering the Switch Online service still has a lot to be done.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I will remember Switch Online is online play.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.000
If you want to play Splatoon, Smash.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Mario Kart.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Mario Kart. You gotta pay for the service anyway.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
So you're already paying for it.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:10.000
If you're playing these games online you're paying for it anyway so you might as well get these free NES games.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
NESflix as we call it.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:17.000
So if they do SNESflix then cool. I just hope they don't try to charge much more money for it.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I really wish though they would have just did this with the SNES Classic.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Just have a virtual console system that you can download that stuff to.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Or just enhance it yourself.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Sure you can just do it for free.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Come on Loki.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I've already done it.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Not that that should be endorsed but the reality is that's what a lot of people are going to do.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:50.000
The general populace doesn't care if you can't get the Guardian Legend for the NES Classic because of licensing issues or licensing problems.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Here's a better example.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Super Star Wars on the SNES.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
A lot of people love and remember that game.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:03.000
If they want to play that game they're just going to hack their thing and put it on there.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:15.000
But you know what? They would probably take the much easier step of pressing a button and paying 500 WooHoo Nintendo bucks to get that on their console for free.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:23.000
And to be fair Super Star Wars I do believe they sold this like a separate thing on PlayStation as part of like a collection there anyway.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:30.000
But you know my point is still is that when it's easy to press a button and pay money for it people will usually do that as opposed to piracy.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Look at iTunes and Spotify and the impact that it had on the underground Napster, LimeWire, and all this.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Not to say it got rid of piracy. I'm not saying that.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000
But it sure put a lot of legitimate stuff out there too.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Because a lot of people like me for example will pick up stuff on a deal like as an impulse buy and then you end up with a library of like 400 games in your PlayStation account and 700 on your Steam account that you don't end up playing but you paid money for and that person got paid.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:05.000
So it's just I don't understand why they don't do that. I mean it's...

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:10.000
So Bobby's bringing up the counterpoint. We hated the Virtual Console when it came out because they made us pay $5 per ROM.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:15.000
We all wanted a Netflix. Now we have a Netflix and we want to go back to paying $5 per ROM.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Here's the thing though. Netflix is putting out new shit every week.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:29.000
And look I understand because of rights issues and everything there's only so many ROMs that Nintendo can put out and all that but it's moving too fucking slow.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:35.000
That's a big part of the problem I think for me is that 30 games is not that impressive of a library.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:38.000
100 games? That's an impressive library.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.000
And there's thousands of people. You can't tell me Nintendo can't get the licenses for 100 games.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:49.000
And it's a lot of their first party titles. I don't see how you can't put your own titles onto the console.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I also don't hate the Netflix thing like other people do. I'm happy it's there. I'm glad they're doing something.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:04.000
I do wish there was more to it but we'll see where it's at in another year or so. I'm just glad it exists.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000
And if they're going to do these Super Nintendo games that's even better.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:14.000
That's going to practically double the size, not really, but double the size almost of the library.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And that's a huge step forward and really starts to make it feel more like a Netflix type of thing as opposed to a very limited type of box.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Right, because there's more I think Super Nintendo games that I'd play versus Nintendo games. I don't know.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.000
And some folks in chat are saying, I like it. Sj100Matt, The Wandering Apparatus, I like it. I like it.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Or Nintendo 64. Let's put Nintendo 64 games on there too.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I also kind of like, it's just a very little thing, but I think it's kind of neat that they do these random official save states that they put out.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Where it's like, explore the last Gradius level. Or here's Zelda with all the rubies already.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I just wish there was Game Genie supporting all these games.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Well, that's kind of what they're doing. It's interesting, especially from a setting up a speed run of a game type of perspective.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.000
It's interesting how these little save states kind of change things a little bit.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.000
They should do that, like have speed running games.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I'm sure, if you can imagine it, it's being done somewhere on the internet.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Anyway, a few more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:17.000
So, at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. At least we're going to try.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I hope it's going to work tonight. We'll do our best.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.000
In the meantime though, Loki has another story for us.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:31.000
In this episode of Battle Royale All The Things, Battle Royale-y is a new mod that's come to Stardew Valley.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:38.000
And it allows 100 players to duke it out in Stardew Valley.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
So you can do all sorts of fun stuff in there.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I think it even has, yeah, up to 100 farmers will battle it out.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:55.000
And apparently you have to have, of course, the mod running along with Smappy, which is the API that they have for Stardew Valley.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:03.000
And also there's, I guess, an online server browser that you can find different servers to play against.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000
But that's pretty funny that you can play the game.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I don't know if they have guns or stuff, but I see there's horses and buildings.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:18.000
So it's got all the things. But neat. I would definitely check this out.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Are you a fan of Battle Royale coming to everything, Loki?

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:30.000
I think it's funny sometimes, yes. Especially things that don't really need it to come to it. But it's funny.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000
The Wandering Apparatus suggests Broccoli Royale mode.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Miltonius Games says, but does it have romance? The people need to know. Can you romance all those 99 people?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
That would be a lot of work.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.000
That would be a lot of work. But, you know, some people might be into that. I don't know.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:55.000
All right. Let's get to one more story for you guys, and it has to do with a pretty cool little tribute coming to World of Warcraft.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:01.000
It's a Stan Lee tribute, because of course we all know Stan Lee of Marvel Comics passed away in November.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.000
And World of Warcraft does these pretty cool little tributes sometimes.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.000
They've done it for some of their fans and long-time players.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I know they've done it for, you know, people like big celebrities and stuff too, like Stan Lee.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:20.000
A recent public test server patch went live, 8.1.5. So it's not in the live game yet, but it's on the public test realm.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.000
And apparently there is a new character around Stormwind Keep whose name is Stan Lee.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And if you actually look at him, he's not Stan Lee, but Stan Lee.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:37.000
But if you actually look at him, it's very much like you look at, he's got a very unique model with the glasses and the stash.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
We all know damn well what he is.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Of course, he also will greet you by shouting Excelsior, as if the rest of that wasn't a giveaway.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But I love that. I love those like tributes and MMOs and things like that.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:53.000
You know, heaven forbid, if anything ever were to happen to me, I would be tickled pink if I was remembered with an MMO type of tribute.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I would want to be a slutty lala in Final Fantasy XIV named Robbing Roberts.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
And I would steal a gill every time you walked by. No, I don't know.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:06.000
But you know, it would be, or I'd never shut up. I just keep talking. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:09.000
That would be fun. How would you be immortalized in an MMO, Loki?

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
This is dark, but you know.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
How would I be immortalized?

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
How would you be immortalized in an MMO?

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Oh, they just wouldn't release the MMO like my game.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.000
It'd just be a piece of missing texture. Coming soon, Loki.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000
All right.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Coming up right now, we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
And we're getting ready to take your calls here.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Bobby Blackwell says he'd rant about everything.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
That might be the thing you would do. I don't know.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
We are eagerly awaiting your calls.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Meanwhile, while we wait to see if anything comes in, do we have any last minute stories we want to cover, Loki?

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I know we had to cut a few things from the show world tonight.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Uh, yeah. There was, I was going to say we didn't talk about the light gun thing that they have.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:08.000
So there's a new technology now, apparently, to be able to do light gun games on, like, LCD-type panels and stuff.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:17.000
And so it's a new thing that they're going to be releasing to support, I want to say, I think it was NES games, maybe?

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Yeah.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:27.000
So that's pretty cool. I'm kind of curious to see how that works, but I'm down for more light games.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.000
All right, I think we have a call on the line, so hopefully you're there.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Okay, we don't hear you, and I think that's a fault on my end. Sorry about that.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:46.000
So let me just play with the controls over here, and give me a moment, caller, and we'll try to get you on the line here.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:52.000
ASAP, which is probably the fault of this thing, one way or another.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Try again. Caller, are you there?

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Hey, this is Metal Mayhem. I used to go by regionator.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Well, welcome to your final form, Metal Mayhem.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Anyway, you were talking about arcade cabinets sold by various stores during your rapid-fire segment.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Sure, like the Golden Tee and that stuff.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Yeah, well, I would imagine they're not exactly like the machines that you can see in arcades.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:48.000
But with that being said, assuming that you had the budget for it, and you can find ones that are worth...

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Uh-oh, he froze up.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Uh, regionator, if you can still hear me, go ahead and finish your question. His video froze, too.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Uh, do we have you back, regionator? Can you finish that question again?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Shit, did we lose him? Oh, I like to hear little bits and pieces coming through, and it's not on our end because we're still broadcasting. See how he's frozen?

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Poor network connection.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Poor network connection! Oh, wait, he's moving again.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Regionator!

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:17.000
That was weird. Alright, I think we're back now.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Okay, I don't know what the fuck happened there, but somehow that locking up on the phone sent, like, something to the mixing board that, like, completely knocked it out.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Skype is trying to attack our mixing board.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:39.000
That was crazy. Anyway, I'm sorry, Metal Mayhem, I don't know what the heck that was about. That was crazy.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:42.000
That's something I'll have to fix in post. Sorry about that.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Did you see that? Like, the light, the only way I knew was because the light on the mixing board, like, suddenly went out.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Huh.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.000
How does that even work? And so I just unplugged it and plugged it back in. Isn't that weird?

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Weird.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Anyway, whew! Yeah, we'll be moving to Discord real soon.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Um, and yeah, Damon's, um, I think the question he was trying to ask was, if we were to switch, or if we were to build one of these arcade machines, budget's not an issue and so forth, what would the arcade machine that you would sell look like?

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Uh, the one I would sell, I would do, um, I would do, like, some of the, I don't know if it's all Midway stuff, but, like, let's do, uh, Gauntlet Legends, and, uh, we'll do some of the Ninja Turtle arcade games, and, what is this, all Konami, the Simpsons arcade game.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:50.000
That's a really good one. I, I, I love that idea. I would go, like, Ninja Turtles and Simpsons arcade game, like, the old, like, Konami hardware from there. I would definitely go with that, but, um, you know, I'm a big fan of BurgerTime as well. I think that might actually be a thing that's out there as well, though.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
That's one of the ones that's coming out.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Is it really? I want that one.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
That's, uh, the karate champ one.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I might have to get that one, for sure. So.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Demons. Gremlins and demons. Don't know what's going on. Shorts.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I seriously think something might have shorted in that mixing board, and that's leading to the buzz that we have now. This is crazy.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I don't know what the heck is going on. That's crazy. Anyway. Um. Wow. I'm, I'm at a loss for words for the first time in forever. So. Crazy, crazy. Alright. Is the buzz still there?

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:46.000
I unplugged the phone. I completely unplugged that connection. Completely.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Wow. If it's not one thing, this is the brand new mixing board, you guys. It's the brand new one. So, yeah, and they still hear the buzzing in the background.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:05.000
And I'm really worried. I can see a little bit. Yeah, you can see it is slowly getting louder and louder. Oh, my God. This is awful.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:13.000
How did a short kill the soundboard that fast? I don't think a short did kill the soundboard. What do you think's wrong, Logie? I don't know.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Yeah, is it? It's not a is it a grounded? Um, it's not grounded. Is it like they don't have a grounded like I used to get like can see it flicker. Wait, let me try. I'm gonna try a different plug. Hold on, guys. Okay.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Because you can. I used to have a problem on my old USB stuff. Yeah, I still hear it very faintly. I think I don't know how the hell this thing shorted when we've only been like four episodes in.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:50.000
It's probably under warranty. So frustrating. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. All right. Yeah. And I I plugged it into another thing.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Some folks thinking the power outage could have shorted it. I don't know. But that is crazy. We have to wrap up before the bus comes back.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:13.000
God, if it's not one thing, it's another. At least we got a full two plus hours in tonight. Yeah. That is ridiculous. All right. Because you see you see it start to flicker over there and then it goes out. But why? Why now?

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Why did we go like two and a half hours of show and then all of a sudden that comes in? It didn't like Skype. I don't get it. All right. Real quick, let's wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts. Logie, your final thoughts tonight?

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:38.000
My final thought is vacation. My final thought is thanks for being here and putting up with all this weird stuff going on. I don't even know what to think. Have a good night, everybody.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Thank you so much for listening to the show and downloading. Tell a friend or two. We'll work on the soundboard for next week. It's all we can do. Good night, everybody. Thanks.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:36:03.000
