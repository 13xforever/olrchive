7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	Are you ready for competitive farming? Well then, let's get ready to tractor!
21000	27000	We're mowing through this and more in the week's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 761 of our show for this January the 27th of 2019.
46000	52000	My name is Rob Robertson joining me here in studio. Techmaster Loki's back. Hey, I'm back. Hey, good to have you back.
52000	59000	Yes, it's good to be back. So what I know a lot of people want to know about is the kind of conclusion to the broccoli farm saga.
59000	66000	Because you told the kids, for those that are new to Orange Lounge Radio, you had talked a few weeks ago about how you planned this trip to Disneyland a couple months ago.
66000	76000	But you told the kids you were going to be taking them to the broccoli farm. You didn't tell them Christmas Day, you didn't tell them on Hanukkah, you didn't even tell them on the car ride down, did you?
76000	83000	No, well we told them that they weren't going to a broccoli farm, but we just didn't. This is all why Loki wasn't here last week.
83000	90000	So if you watched last week's show, you saw Alan was here, Dar Sager was in the studio, but you weren't because you were finally taking the big broccoli farm trip.
90000	97000	Yes, so we didn't tell them where they're going. In fact, we actually got to the place we were going to the place we were staying.
97000	104000	We didn't tell them, and they went upstairs and they put their stuff away, and then finally we had them come downstairs and there was,
104000	115000	it was like a, not an envelope, but there was like a picture, like they had set up something for my son's birthday, you know, basically saying,
115000	124000	you know, hey, I hope you guys have fun, stuff like that, happy birthday. And so we were asking them like, so where is it that you think you're going?
124000	136000	You know, we're not going to a broccoli farm, so where is it that we're going? And they're like, I don't know, my wife's like, well look around the room,
136000	143000	look around, what do you see, you know, where do you think that you are right now? And so they saw like some of the Disneyland stuff.
143000	144000	Knott's Berry Farm?
144000	147000	They don't know what Knott's Berry Farm is, come on.
147000	148000	Nobody does.
149000	157000	Um, so we're going to Disneyland, so they, you know, they got pretty excited about, actually mildly excited, I don't know if they were like super excited,
157000	160000	like, you know, we have it recorded.
160000	163000	Yeah, I was just, your wife posted a video, I didn't want to share the video because that's your personal business.
163000	164000	Oh, I don't care, yeah.
164000	173000	But, um, so, uh, but what I, I, I was watching the video and, um, I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted because Smoosh just walked into the studio.
173000	177000	I don't know what he's doing tonight, he's probably, he's looking for the plug, he's probably going to unplug it, oh boy.
177000	184000	Alright, well anyway, um, so I saw the video and my favorite part of the video was that, yeah, you know, the boys are like, you know, they're kind of excited for a minute,
184000	189000	and then your oldest kind of goes, yeah, but what about the toilet? And then it cuts off.
189000	193000	Because I guess, I don't know if there was something with the bathroom or what the deal was.
193000	197000	Because he had used the bathroom and the toilet was still running for some reason.
198000	202000	It was just one of those, like, the, the, the water, something you don't push the handle all the way.
202000	209000	It, it's just like, it just, yeah, it, it stuck running a lot, um, but that was apparently very distracting for him.
209000	218000	But no, they, they had, they had fun, and it was funny because, like, we were trying to get them ready for bed and then they started launching fireworks for their nightly show,
218000	222000	and so, you know, they got to see that the first day, which was pretty cool, yeah.
222000	230000	Great. So the family have, I know we are a video game podcast, I promise we're gonna get to games, but, you know, this is, this is the conclusion of a weeks-long saga here.
230000	231000	Did the kids have a good time at Disneyland?
231000	233000	Yeah, they had a great time at Disneyland. Um, my, uh,
233000	234000	What a dumb question, right?
234000	240000	Yeah, uh, Josh went on, like, all of the roller coasters and stuff. My youngest son, Danny, was a little bit more cautious.
240000	248000	He went on Thunder Mountain once, and then we took him on it again the second time at night, and it's harder to see the turns at night, so he didn't like it.
248000	252000	So Danny got your feelings on roller coasters.
252000	256000	Yeah, I, I got over my fear of roller coasters pretty quick after,
256000	257000	Was there anything you wanted to ride?
257000	267000	I, I went on Thunder Mountain a few times, um, and I got to do Star Tours. See, the first time I went on Star Tours, or the only time I went on Star Tours was, like, back when the original Star Tours opened,
267000	273000	and so, that made me, that made me pretty motion sick, you know, the first time.
273000	278000	But the new Star Tours is pretty awesome. You don't get motion sick in that, and it's, it's awesome.
278000	284000	So that was, uh, my youngest son's favorite ride was going on that, so we went on Star Tours, like, five or six times.
284000	289000	Did you go, I would say the craziest ride there is California, oh wait, um, Incredible Coaster, or whatever?
289000	290000	Incredible Coaster, yeah.
290000	291000	Did you go on that?
291000	292000	My wife went on that. I didn't go on that.
292000	293000	Okay.
293000	294000	Uh,
294000	295000	We'll give her her.
296000	298000	You saw the loop? You saw the loop?
298000	305000	Not the loop, it's just how fast it goes. I, I, like, I probably could do it, but I just don't want to.
305000	308000	Did you do the, um, Radiator Springs, the cars?
308000	313000	Oh yeah, see, see, we tricked our, our youngest son, cause he didn't want to, he's like, is this as fast as, uh, Thunder Mountain?
313000	319000	I'm like, no, no, it's not as fast, and I'm looking at it, and it just goes by, I'm like, this is much faster.
319000	321000	You're tricking the child and yourself.
321000	329000	This is much faster. No, I was like, I thought it would be fine, but like, it went pretty fast, so like, I, I was trying to tell him, like, yeah, it'll be fine.
329000	330000	He's like, is it going to go fast now?
330000	332000	You were driving faster down the freeway.
332000	344000	Exactly, we were driving faster down the freeway, but, uh, no, and, and there was a bit of drama, so like, we had three days, and, and we were coming home, and he gets car sick, and so he throws up in the car, so that was fun.
345000	356000	Um, yeah, um, it was just because he was doing, like, his tablet and stuff while he was in the car, so, which is weird, though, cause he did it all the way down, but, I don't know, for some reason, something was bothering him.
356000	365000	Um, but, yeah, we had a lot of fun, we, um, ate at the, they had food trucks down in downtown Disney a few times, so we ate the dumpling food truck a few times.
365000	369000	Oh, yeah, cause probably the food truck's probably cheaper than most of the stuff that's in the parks.
369000	370000	Yeah, a lot of it.
370000	371000	Thank you.
372000	373000	All right.
373000	374000	It's way too damn expensive.
374000	376000	Look, we could do a full Disney podcast, but it is a video game podcast.
376000	379000	Let me ask this real quick, though, before we get into the kickoff topic for tonight.
379000	383000	Um, did you, um, get to, uh, do any gaming at Disney?
383000	384000	No, I, I didn't.
384000	388000	I, Stark, the, uh, was it a Starkade, or whatever they call it?
388000	393000	It closes at 4.30, so anytime I got over to Tomorrowland, it was already closed.
393000	395000	Wow, I wonder why so early?
395000	397000	I don't know, but it, it closes, I think, at 4.30.
397000	399000	Every time I got there, the doors were closed.
399000	401000	The neon sign's still there, but the doors are closed.
401000	402000	Yeah, the neon sign's kind of iconic, yeah.
402000	405000	Yeah, so I don't know if it was open earlier in the morning.
405000	408000	I didn't notice it, but I didn't get a chance to actually go there and do that.
408000	410000	And they also have, like, some VR.
410000	417000	It was not really, like, it's VR, but it's VR with, like, wireless, uh, backpacks and everything.
417000	424000	It's almost, like, not, sort of like laser tag, but not, you're just playing, I guess, against the computer or something like that.
424000	429000	But you're basically free to move around, like, a whole arena type thing.
429000	433000	So they have that with, like, Star Wars and something else.
433000	435000	I wanted to try that, but I didn't get a chance to do that.
435000	442000	And I also didn't get a chance to, because we were just getting back too late each night, to go down to round one to play anything, so.
442000	443000	Oh, bummer.
443000	445000	Um, yeah, I just, I couldn't do it.
445000	448000	Family was more important, so I'm glad you guys had a good trip.
448000	458000	Alright, real quick, it got brought up in our chat room, because we do tape live at Twitch TV every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blockwolf show at the VOG Network Twitch channel.
458000	460000	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
460000	463000	And by the way, guys, pour one out for the radio feed.
463000	468000	It's, uh, it's, uh, if it's not gone as of now, it's going to be gone tomorrow.
468000	477000	The official cancellation went through, so, uh, just, uh, yeah, it's all, it's all about, uh, Twitch and the continued distribution of our, our other shows that we network with, um, through their, uh, various podcasts.
478000	480000	But, uh, pour one out for the radio feed tonight, guys.
480000	487000	Um, but, uh, we are, of course, it's all about Twitch now, uh, for the live stuff, which is over at our Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
487000	489000	VOG Network, the voice of geeks network.
489000	490000	Yeah.
490000	492000	So, uh, big question we're getting in the chat.
492000	493000	Space Mountain.
493000	494000	Did you brave that one?
494000	495000	Can't see that one.
495000	497000	Um, I didn't go on Space Mountain.
497000	501000	Um, my, my oldest son and my wife did, though.
501000	504000	Um, I've been on Space Mountain before, so that was fine.
504000	508000	Um, I just, because my youngest son wouldn't go on anything, I was stuck going on there.
508000	516000	And my wife's like, well, you sure you want, you know, I could, you can go on with, you know, Josh or I can, but she likes roller coasters more than I do.
516000	521000	So I'm like, you, you just go, I'll just stay here with him and I'll go on whatever he wants to go on.
521000	529000	So, um, like, you know, Winnie the Pooh and, uh, we went on Star Tours like a bunch of times, but like, and that was fine.
529000	535000	Um, but yeah, I mean, they went, she went on Matterhorn and it's like, I mean, they give you an idea how long it's been.
535000	541000	Like when I went on Matterhorn last time, it was like, you had to pretty much sit in each other's laps as you go in there.
541000	543000	Now it's all completely different.
543000	544000	They made it single rider.
544000	545000	Yeah, so it's, um.
545000	547000	We're going down the Disneyland path again.
547000	548000	Sorry.
548000	552000	It's all right. I can talk about Disneyland for three hours too, but we do want to get into, uh, some gaming tonight.
552000	555000	We'll switch to the food then because Dole Whip, fucking awesome.
555000	557000	You know, love Dole Whips.
557000	558000	Yeah.
558000	561000	And then, um, did you get the bacon one that's limited time?
561000	568000	No, they didn't have that there, but they also had, uh, the food is a lot better there from what I remember.
568000	571000	Cause before it used to be like the same shit in every single like spot.
571000	574000	They always have just like burgers and whatever, but now it's actually pretty good.
574000	576000	Um, and then the ice cream place.
576000	580000	All right. Well, since you're talking about entertainment, it does kind of tie into our kickoff topic tonight.
580000	587000	I got to admit it's, I feel like overall, it's been a little bit of a slower news week, so I don't have something that's like a deep dive on an actual like gaming topic.
587000	591000	But I mean, well it is, but it's not like about a game, a specific game or an event or something.
591000	595000	It's more kind of about where the industry is at, a kind of a state of the industry sort of thing.
595000	600000	Because, um, there's an article that went out this last week, uh, that actually came from Variety.
600000	603000	Variety is a little bit more of a magazine that focuses.
603000	607000	Well, it's what is newspaper magazine on? It's like a weekly publication.
607000	609000	Of course they have the online presence as well.
609000	611000	And I'm sure Bobby's already talking in chat.
611000	613000	He was quoted or he was, he was identified.
613000	615000	And yeah, he wants, he has an article there.
615000	620000	But, uh, all that aside, um, they're usually more focused on like the movie industry.
620000	622000	You talk about like that end of the entertainment industry.
622000	625000	I'm sure they're talking about what's going on on TV and things like that.
625000	628000	With the, that being the Oscars season, they talk a lot about that.
628000	638000	A lot of the movie studios that actually want to run those four-year consideration campaigns on why a star is born should win Best Picture or Glenn Close should win Best Actress or whatever.
638000	640000	I'm barely following it this year.
640000	647000	But, um, those ads run in Variety because a lot of trade people, uh, from the entertainment industry that do that magazine.
647000	652000	So the whole reason I'm setting that up is because Variety ran a pretty big piece on gaming this week.
652000	654000	And the state of the gaming industry.
654000	657000	So they, um, ran an article with the line, uh, headline.
657000	663000	Americans spent more than 43 billion, with a B, on video games in 2018.
663000	667000	Now this all ties into now that we're getting towards the end of January.
667000	672000	We're getting our couple weeks delayed numbers from December from the MPD group and all that, right?
672000	676000	And I think we have a story later on about some of those specific sales.
676000	679000	But we can kind of talk in general about what, you know, those results are saying.
679000	683000	Is that the gaming industry, if you didn't already know, is a pretty big deal.
683000	685000	Wow, 43 billion dollars.
685000	688000	So I guess we don't need to do any more loot boxes or anything, right?
688000	691000	Because they've made enough money, right?
691000	693000	Some of that might have come from loot boxes.
693000	698000	Anyway, it is a record-breaking 43.4 billion in revenue that they made in 2018.
698000	702000	That is through the Entertainment Software Association and the MPD group.
702000	708000	That is a 18% growth from 36.9 billion in 2017.
708000	710000	So put those two numbers side by side.
710000	713000	I mean, I know you joke about loot boxes, but love them or hate them.
713000	715000	That's probably part of it.
715000	717000	Well, and it's only going to get worse, and here's why.
717000	720000	Because, you know, this type of growth is not sustainable.
720000	726000	And so this is where you get, you know, the next year, we're going to have layoffs,
726000	730000	and you're going to see more of this bullshit that they're going to try to monetize things,
730000	736000	like every which way, because they're trying to sustain that growth, which is just not sustainable.
736000	742000	Well, let's see. Let's continue on some of the places that these numbers come from.
742000	745000	Hardware revenue was up 15%, so there's that.
745000	749000	I mean, you could attribute some of that to Nintendo Switch and the success there and so forth.
749000	755000	Software sales, physical and digital, in-game purchases, subscriptions, 18% growth.
755000	760000	A comment from President and CEO Stanley Pierre Lewis, the ESA.
760000	765000	The impressive economic growth of the industry announced today parallels the growth of the industry
765000	767000	in mainstream American culture.
767000	770000	Across the nation, we count people of all backgrounds and stages of life
770000	773000	among our most passionate video game players and fans.
773000	777000	Interactive entertainment stands today as the most influential form of entertainment in America.
777000	780000	So with that quote, kind of attributing a lot of that growth to,
780000	785000	hey, it's not just a teenage boys in their basement type of thing anymore.
785000	787000	It never really was. I know we all know that.
787000	794000	But now it's, you know, much more mainstream with men, women, young, older, everything.
794000	799000	And yes, Gen X2, there's all those articles about millennials versus baby boomers.
799000	802000	But yes, Gen X2 is playing video games as well.
802000	805000	So everybody's playing video games is really a big part of that.
805000	808000	So of course 2018, record setting year.
808000	813000	There was another quote here I want to make sure we talk about too, which is mobile games.
813000	818000	The number of mobile game players in North America, an increase of 5% over the prior year.
818000	822000	This is the number they report.
822000	830000	Of the 283.1 million mobile users in the U.S. and Canada, 210.9 million are gamers.
831000	836000	Another quote from games industry analyst with the MPD group, Matt Piscatella.
836000	839000	Mobile gaming reviews have continued to grow in the U.S. and Canada,
839000	842000	and it now represents the largest segment within the gaming marketplace.
842000	849000	60% of Americans and Canadians play mobile games because of the rich library of content available.
849000	854000	Mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans.
854000	856000	I almost said cache of clans, but that...
856000	857000	That would still be accurate.
858000	862000	Pokemon Go, which obviously we talked a little bit about that game here on the show before.
862000	866000	Roblox. I always forget what a big game Roblox is.
866000	867000	It is a huge game.
867000	869000	He has a huge game. Tons of kids.
869000	871000	Like tweens, I guess maybe.
871000	875000	Like in that kind of like, maybe just a little older from where your kids are at,
875000	877000	but younger than like 18 too.
877000	879000	I think Roblox is like really big with that set.
879000	880000	This is what I've heard.
880000	883000	I have friends that are like, yeah, my kids play it.
883000	884000	Yeah, my kids play it.
884000	885000	Do they play Roblox?
885000	887000	Well, my oldest son plays it.
887000	890000	Okay, so then right about in that area.
890000	895000	Fortnite, of course, and that's probably a big one to attribute to a lot of people.
895000	900000	I swear to God, when we do get him on the show eventually, and it's gonna happen again,
900000	905000	the dude, he is fucking flossing all of the goddamn time.
905000	906000	And not his teeth.
906000	907000	All of the time.
907000	913000	Just flossing like all, just like randomly just, I'm bored, I'm gonna start flossing.
913000	916000	This is all of the time.
916000	918000	And no, I'm not doing it again.
918000	921000	And I have pictures too, like we took pictures.
921000	923000	Save those for the yearbook when he's 18.
923000	929000	We took a picture, I should have taken a video, but we took a picture when we were waiting for my wife to go on the Incredicoaster.
929000	931000	They had, you know, Mr. Incredible there.
931000	933000	And so, you know, they took pictures with him.
933000	934000	And what's he start doing?
934000	936000	He starts flossing.
936000	937000	Again.
937000	938000	I'm like, why are you doing that?
938000	939000	He's like, I don't know.
939000	941000	Maybe the kid's gonna be a dancer.
941000	942000	I don't know.
942000	946000	Anyway, so Slottomania, the other one, I don't even know what the hell that is.
946000	952000	But anyway, among many others are examples of the breadth and depth of engaging experiences available on mobile platforms.
952000	957000	So it is interesting to note that they didn't talk about loot boxes there.
957000	958000	Of course not.
958000	963000	It seems like in here, what I'm kind of getting from this article is that, and maybe your interpretation is different,
963000	970000	but what I'm kind of getting from that is that they are attributing a lot of this growth to the fact that more people are playing games at the end of the day.
970000	980000	More people that own mobile phones are playing games because you've got these mobile games that are just getting bigger and bigger between Pokémon Go and Fortnite, Roblox, everything I just named there and more.
980000	982000	It's really causing that industry to grow.
982000	983000	Right.
983000	984000	Yeah.
984000	993000	So, I mean, so the gaming industry is, you know, it's interesting because you and I remember in our lifetimes when the gaming industry was a very like niche thing.
993000	994000	People didn't talk about games.
994000	1001000	People past a certain age usually didn't understand what video gaming was all about unless they were like in the industry that made them.
1001000	1007000	Now, we're talking about an industry that is getting very competitive with, if not exceeding in some ways, the movie industry.
1007000	1009000	I don't know how much the movie industry made it last year.
1009000	1011000	I'm pretty sure it has exceeded the movie industry.
1011000	1018000	I think it has in some metrics, maybe not in others, but I mean that's, I'll let Variety magazine hammer out those specifics.
1018000	1027000	The reality is as an art form, gaming is on a level certainly with movies and, you know, everybody knows what a movie is.
1027000	1029000	Everybody knows what a TV show is.
1029000	1038000	Heck, you know, I notice that our numbers for people watching on Twitch tonight probably a little bit lower and that's because, that's fine, but that's probably because of like TV stuff because you've got the,
1038000	1048000	and don't go switching the channel, but you've got the rent live thing going on which, you know, well traditional TV in some ways is super hurting.
1048000	1059000	Not to get too much on a tangent, but traditional TV networks like your ABC, CBS, NBC and all that stuff is hurting a lot because of gaming, right?
1059000	1062000	Because more people are turning to gaming for their entertainment, right?
1062000	1064000	That's part of the Fortnite, things like that.
1064000	1068000	And certainly cable, there's so many cable networks.
1068000	1074000	There's that kind of in between, things like Twitch and what you're doing right now by participating with our show.
1074000	1085000	You're opting instead to watch Twitch and us, thank you for that by the way, as opposed to watching Rent Live or the SAG Awards I think are tonight or I think there's a big baseball game going on.
1085000	1086000	There's a variety of those.
1086000	1093000	Those award shows, honestly, folks, I mean, just wait for the next day when they clip all the good stuff out and you have your list of winners.
1093000	1095000	Do you really need to watch the whole thing live?
1095000	1101000	That's how I feel, but then when it comes to things like sports, like even though I don't watch sports, I totally understand why other people want to be their life.
1101000	1110000	But my point was is that a lot of like the old school networks are really making their, like where they're going now to kind of compete with streaming and that other stuff.
1110000	1114000	You get this huge focus on live stuff.
1114000	1118000	I think that's why you're seeing more musicals that are being done in prime time.
1118000	1123000	Like, you know, you've got the rent thing going on tonight, although plot twist, I hear it's not actually live.
1123000	1125000	They ended up running a tape.
1125000	1130000	They they ran the dress rehearsal as if it's live because one of the lead actors like rolled his ankle earlier today.
1130000	1133000	No, make him do it with the rolling.
1133000	1135000	Yeah, we're doing it live.
1135000	1136000	It's going to be live.
1136000	1139000	That's why I thought you had understudies, but that's a whole nother fight.
1139000	1142000	Fine. They're running the dress rehearsal instead.
1142000	1144000	So there's all that.
1144000	1156000	But then like things like, you know, like the celebrity big brother and those that, you know, that's more live stuff and sports like it's very hard to compete with sports because sports is, you know, also like a live presentation and all that.
1156000	1159000	And many people get very excited about the sports stuff still.
1159000	1171000	So, yeah, it's just I know it's just it's just interesting to see like these things growing while these other industries that probably thought they were going to be around forever are like having to adapt or die.
1171000	1175000	I think there's a very distinct possibility within our lifetimes.
1175000	1181000	The next, you know, before we're like too old, but I would say before Medicare, before we're 65, I would say there's a really good chance.
1181000	1191000	NBC, CBS, ABC or Fox, one of them goes under or complete or I should say completely transforms from what we know it as today.
1191000	1194000	Like maybe goes completely online and there's no more broadcast TV.
1194000	1196000	I don't know, but that's maybe that's a whole nother thing.
1196000	1208000	I mean, ABC knows could be anything. So and I guess, you know, one of the things it should be worth saying, one other thing that I think these or these networks do pretty decently is local coverage.
1208000	1215000	Like, you know, you know, even though our show is based in Sacramento, we're not really like we're not like focused on that.
1215000	1221000	We're a worldwide gaming show. So we talk about gaming everywhere so that we can get listeners from all all different parts of the globe.
1221000	1225000	But that's not maybe the same outlook that TV networks have on it.
1225000	1228000	Also, I don't pay attention enough to what's going on in our area anyways.
1228000	1232000	Actually, the thing about that the other day, I was like driving by a golf land.
1232000	1235000	I was like, what if there's any other arcades out here?
1235000	1242000	You know, because I remember before, like we used to go try to scout arcades like, oh, which one has like this mix of DDR, you know, the play and stuff.
1242000	1248000	And now it's like, I don't even know. I know where there is an arcade.
1248000	1252000	I couldn't tell you which ones have DDR in them.
1252000	1255000	Well, I I could tell you off air. I don't get it. I want to get a local.
1255000	1261000	Right. I am the same for ninety nine point nine percent of listeners. They don't care where the DDR machines are right in your garage.
1261000	1265000	That's the one you need to know about going to our chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network.
1265000	1271000	Quest Buster in chat says even Netflix admitted that one of their biggest competitors was Fortnite.
1271000	1274000	And, you know, but the bubble is going to burst on Fortnite someday.
1274000	1281000	You know, there's always that kind of like game darling that seems to like be all what the mainstream is all about and obsessed with.
1281000	1284000	And then eventually it just kind of fades to the next big thing.
1284000	1287000	Like I kind of feel like not everybody's going to agree. And that's fine.
1287000	1291000	Maybe be a voice and chat if you strongly disagree. But I kind of feel like Minecraft.
1291000	1296000	I don't say Minecraft's dead. I'm not saying Minecraft's dead. But Minecraft peaked.
1296000	1301000	Like Minecraft is not where it was a couple of years ago before Fortnite.
1301000	1306000	You know, Five Nights at Freddy, you know, with all the stuff that they sell at Target and all those stores.
1306000	1311000	You know, again, I kind of think the fever pitch of that kind of peaked a little while ago.
1311000	1316000	I might come back with the movie or if, you know, the guy decides to release a new game or I do want to see a movie.
1316000	1319000	I don't really care for the series, but a movie. I think a movie would be awesome.
1319000	1325000	Yeah, I would love to see that. But anyway, and then Bobby Blackall says it was Minecraft before Fortnite.
1325000	1329000	And then what? What before Minecraft? I can't even remember that far back. Maybe.
1329000	1335000	I don't know. I don't know if there was a game that especially talking about, you know, what the variety article gets into with growing.
1335000	1341000	Who is playing games? Because Minecraft was really big at attracting Warcraft audience or Warcraft.
1341000	1347000	Maybe are like every quest is. I don't even know the MMO MMOs in general.
1347000	1352000	Maybe I might go with that anyway. Let's see.
1352000	1359000	Quest Buster with another great comment saying Microsoft may have missed on their initial messaging for the Xbox one,
1359000	1363000	but they weren't wrong about where the living room was headed digitally.
1363000	1367000	And he has a very smart comment because it's absolutely right.
1367000	1372000	Like for all the crap that Microsoft got with the Xbox ones launch,
1372000	1377000	they weren't wrong on some of the things they were predicting. They really, really were not wrong.
1377000	1385000	But it's a couple key decisions and ultimately messaging that really tanked that whole thing for them.
1385000	1390000	You know, again, I really think and I'm sure many of you view it the same way, and I'm not talking bad about the Xbox one.
1390000	1395000	It's a fine system. But I think in many ways, we're in kind of like a flip flop of where we were last gen,
1395000	1400000	where PlayStation three really missed the mark on the messaging and then kind of had to play catch up.
1400000	1409000	And eventually they caught up. And I kind of feel like Microsoft's kind of been in the flip side of that ever since that all went down a couple of years ago when it was first announced.
1409000	1415000	Well, it's going to be, I would think, a pretty even playing field, though, when we come to the next generation of consoles,
1415000	1420000	because I don't know, I don't have a ton of goodwill for Sony right now.
1420000	1427000	I mean, it's just the way they're treating their customers and all the mod support and backwards compatibility and that kind of stuff.
1427000	1434000	It kind of sucks because like like I was even, well, I guess I'll get into it later in my gaming week.
1434000	1439000	And so I actually dug out my PlayStation two to try to mess with that.
1439000	1446000	But like it'd be much easier if we had that backwards compatibility support on a PlayStation four.
1446000	1452000	I guess my PlayStation three could do it because I have an original PlayStation three, but it's still pain in the ass.
1452000	1459000	Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. One other comment I want to address here before we start to get into some of the other stories tonight in our gaming weeks.
1459000	1468000	Black Mamba 1977 in chat at Vogue Network on Twitch says cable is getting less and less views because everything is going digital, too.
1468000	1474000	That's I think that's a huge point as well. Like I was randomly watching. And this is a funny thing now.
1474000	1479000	Do you know where I watch cable more than anything now? I don't watch it on my TV.
1479000	1486000	I'm watching it now on my second monitor because they do the whole streaming, even like stream cable now, basically.
1486000	1492000	And then I'm playing a game on my first monitor. But I was watching a cable network. I was watching Pop, I think.
1492000	1500000	And they were showing reruns of House. And it looks like garbage because, you know, there's only so many HD cable networks and the other ones are standard def.
1500000	1506000	And they look terrible because it's like standard def. But with the black bars, because the original was in HD.
1506000	1513000	So it's like and it's all like here's the best part, like, you know, because I have Comcast and Comcast charges you more money.
1513000	1518000	If you want HD channels, you have to pay for an HD tuner, which costs fourteen ninety nine a month.
1518000	1523000	So I say fuck you. And I just stream all your shit through the other apps. And guess what?
1523000	1529000	It's in fucking HD and I'm not paying you any additional money and I get to watch it all when I want.
1529000	1533000	You showed them. All right. But anyway, my point is, is that but there's so much digital.
1533000	1540000	And now you see some of these networks going digital like CBS, you know, CBS with their all access.
1540000	1548000	As much as people really hate that because they feel like, oh, I'm paying to play or excuse me, I'm paying to just watch Star Trek.
1548000	1553000	And there's not a lot of other offerings. You know, they don't compete with Netflix right now, even though the new Star Trek is great, just saying.
1553000	1559000	But do you have to pay for all access, even if you have like you can't link it to your cable subscription to like watch that?
1559000	1565000	No, it's it's a premium like that. I know. I know. But again, that's what piracy is for.
1565000	1571000	They they looped in like the big brother feeds and all that. There's other stuff besides Star Trek.
1571000	1575000	I guess a good fight. And, you know, they're trying. There's the the Twilight Zone reboot.
1575000	1581000	But anyway, my point is, oh, those have doesn't have like Neil Patrick Harris or someone or who Jordan Peele is to reveal.
1581000	1585000	Oh, starring in it. He's like producing it. I'd watch them get out.
1585000	1588000	Yeah, I'm very interested in that, too. But anyway, this is a TV show.
1588000	1594000	But here's the other thing about the CBS all access thing is that when you have it and you're, you know, paying for the Star Trek and everything,
1594000	1602000	you can also tune in to through the app, your local CBS station or like CBS's subsidiary.
1602000	1606000	Like they have a sports channel, a weather channel, those types of things. Maybe it's entertainment. I don't know.
1606000	1614000	But anyway, my point is, it's kind of going around Comcast in a way. CBS is selling that direct to you through their all access.
1614000	1619000	And I wonder if Comcast, the reason why they're nickel and diming all these other places, because they're in.
1619000	1626000	And you notice, like a company like Comcast really is trying to sell the phone line, the home security there.
1626000	1633000	They're not focused so much anymore. They really need to cut off the phone line. No one fucking wants landline.
1633000	1636000	You know, there is if people are buying it, they're going to try to keep selling.
1636000	1645000	But the point is, they're doing that stuff because they can see what's happening is that the future of TV might be these providers that are going around.
1646000	1651000	Traditional television. Anyway, I'm sorry. We got a little off the topic about video games, but I think at the end of the day, honestly,
1651000	1654000	I mean, as much as you might kind of roll your eyes and say, I thought it was a gaming show.
1654000	1661000	I kind of think it does all tie together because you're going back to the story, you know, because of the growth of the gaming industry,
1661000	1668000	because gaming is one of those things that's taking away from the traditional television viewership and what we know about cable and things like that.
1668000	1672000	It is all having an impact on one another and everybody's kind of having to innovate.
1672000	1676000	And that's kind of the fascinating thing about where the entertainment industry is at right now.
1676000	1682000	Anyway, going to our chat over at Twitch TV Vogue Network, Tiger class says,
1682000	1686000	I think it's pointless to subscribe to all access if the only show you watch is Discovery.
1686000	1691000	All the other shows are crappy and paid for old people.
1691000	1695000	I you know, I've watched a little bit of it, but I pay for it, whatever.
1695000	1702000	Well, I'm actually thinking about adding Hulu, too, because I want to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but they only have season six in the app now, the NBC app.
1702000	1709000	So honestly, if I were to pay for Netflix, Hulu and CBS and probably one other two,
1709000	1714000	it would still be less than what I pay for cable. Yeah. Right.
1714000	1719000	So I don't know. And that's the reality a lot of people are facing right now. Let's see.
1719000	1726000	Going to other comments here, Bobby Blackall says, I really wish Comcast would give me unlimited bandwidth because I have digital preferred cable TV.
1726000	1731000	They cap they cap my data because of people getting just Internet to cut the cord to go around them.
1731000	1740000	So, yeah, I guess, you know, the data cap of. Well, it's a good thing that the FCC is, you know, in the pocket of these cable industry folks.
1740000	1748000	So, you know, once we get that overthrown, then maybe we can get somebody to say, hey, bandwidth caps are fucking illegal.
1748000	1754000	And you can't do it. Well, we'll see. I don't know. It's probably not the current guy, the FCC, but things might change.
1754000	1759000	Who knows? Anyway. But to tie it again together back to gaming, because and as somebody mentioned earlier,
1759000	1763000	Microsoft was probably in many ways ahead of its time with the Xbox one.
1763000	1767000	I think a lot of this stuff we've been talking about as much as, you know, it might not be directly related games.
1767000	1772000	I think when we talk PlayStation five and we talk the next Xbox and whatever else,
1772000	1777000	the soldier boy console, ha ha, whatever else in seriousness is out there in the future,
1777000	1785000	we might be looking at things that are more integrated with the other types of entertainment beyond just it plays Blu-rays.
1785000	1790000	It has a Netflix app. There might be some more like real integration there.
1790000	1796000	And you kind of see Sony, I think, in some ways dipping their toe in the water with their whole like they don't call it PlayStation cable,
1796000	1801000	but that's what it is. PlayStation TV view, whatever calm place. It's yeah, PlayStation view.
1801000	1804000	I actually had subscribed to that's going to be more integrated.
1804000	1809000	I tried it for like a month or two and it was all right.
1809000	1813000	But then they lost Comedy Central. I think they lost some big networks.
1813000	1819000	And I was just like, no, I don't want it anymore because I was kind of all I was tuning in for.
1819000	1822000	But there was a lot of channels I just didn't want on there.
1822000	1827000	But it wasn't bad. It was just they need more content.
1827000	1833000	And they lost their losing content and getting content that I just didn't give a shit about. Gotcha.
1833000	1839000	So. All right. Well, anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some things that are a little more directly related to video gaming.
1839000	1842000	Our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1842000	1847000	So how was your gaming week? Loki, if you want to cover two weeks, I guess since you weren't here.
1847000	1852000	I wish being two weeks that I played a lot more things. I did not.
1852000	1857000	It was mainly just trying to you were at Disneyland. I was at Disneyland. Yes.
1857000	1861000	I tried to I was mostly trying to get the DDR cabinet stuff to work.
1861000	1872000	So I had I'd mentioned I think before I left that I had bought some memory card slots for my DDR cabinet because I wanted to get those.
1872000	1876000	And I found them for a pretty good price. So I picked some up.
1876000	1882000	And so I got those in finally and I had to wire everything up because I didn't know how it was supposed to go.
1882000	1891000	And thankfully, I I figured it out. So I wired those up and then I had my memory cards and they just weren't reading in there first.
1891000	1893000	And so I was like, oh, crap. You know, so what the hell?
1893000	1900000	Finally figured out what it was. It's just the memory card slots are so old that the pins inside there are kind of bent out.
1900000	1907000	So you can even I even my PlayStation 2 is kind of the same way. You have to not quite insert the card all the way.
1907000	1913000	And I want to say, like when I was playing DDR and stuff in arcades, the card slots are kind of like that, too.
1913000	1920000	You have to kind of be just push it until you feel like some friction on there and then you just let don't touch it and then it will read just fine.
1920000	1926000	So I did all that and got it working. I loaded the edits I had on my memory cards.
1926000	1932000	I had only two or three that no two cards that had edits on there.
1932000	1938000	And some that I used to play are just gone. I don't have backups for them anymore.
1938000	1944000	But the rest, though, I did end up finding and this was really challenging.
1944000	1950000	I ended up going online to try to find the sites I used to use for finding edits.
1950000	1953000	And I did find some of those, but a lot of them are no longer there anymore.
1953000	1956000	And I had to go back through the wayback machine to find stuff.
1956000	1962000	But I did find there is a current edit database out there that people actually do upload stuff for, but it's for DDRX.
1962000	1968000	But you can still use those saves if you convert it and stuff to actually work in the cabinet.
1968000	1975000	So I downloaded pretty much the entire library, just everything that they had, and downloaded everything.
1975000	1982000	And then I loaded them onto memory cards. I have about eight cards worth of memory of edits on there.
1982000	1990000	And so I slowly converted them over. I bought the old PlayStation 3 memory card adapter they have for PlayStation 1 stuff.
1990000	1999000	So I had to take that. I made an HD loader boot disk thing because I found out once I got my PlayStation 2 back from my sister,
1999000	2003000	the disk drive doesn't work anymore. So I had to get that thing.
2003000	2005000	Why do we loan anything, however?
2005000	2008000	It's just old. It's an old-ass system. It just doesn't work anymore.
2008000	2013000	I didn't technically use the disk drive anyways. It was mainly just used to run the disk for HD loader.
2013000	2018000	But now it just runs off of a memory card. So, eh, who cares if the disk drive's not working.
2018000	2029000	So I managed to transfer everything onto a USB drive, transfer all of those onto memory cards, transfer all of that onto the arcade cabinet.
2029000	2033000	So now I have like 150 plus edits on my arcade cabinet.
2033000	2038000	It's funny enough, though, it's like some of them are mine, but I don't remember which ones are mine until I actually play them.
2038000	2044000	Some of them I recognize. I'm like, I think that one's mine. And then I play it and I'm like, yeah, that was mine.
2044000	2047000	Man, I was really mean when I made that edit.
2047000	2057000	I found, and as you probably would have seen in the last two streams, if you watch my Twitch streams at twitch slash logy o-l-r.
2057000	2058000	You should go follow logy.
2058000	2060000	Yes, go follow me.
2060000	2065000	They, people that make edits for doubles like to use the entire pad.
2065000	2072000	And usually both, you know, one side and the other side, very often you're stretching quite a bit.
2072000	2076000	And, oh, I can still do that, but it, ow.
2076000	2080000	It will, it is very hard on my feet.
2080000	2084000	So, but I had a lot of fun playing some of those and not all of them are bullshit.
2084000	2086000	There was actually some that were pretty fun.
2086000	2091000	So it was mainly this week is just playing DDR stuff and just getting all of that working.
2091000	2095000	Because it was kind of a hassle to get, figuring out what was wrong with the memory cards.
2095000	2098000	And then finally figured out it was just, they're just finicky.
2098000	2104000	And then what else? I downloaded Goat Simulator for the Switch.
2104000	2106000	Because my kids want to play that.
2106000	2109000	And they played a little bit of that.
2109000	2112000	And then just Pokemon Go pretty much.
2112000	2116000	I tried getting Pokemon Go, I mean, because I was playing it in Disneyland.
2116000	2118000	Because there's just PokeSops everywhere.
2118000	2120000	Of course, I'm sure.
2120000	2124000	The problem though was like my gotcha was being stupid.
2124000	2128000	And so I had to, I ended up having to reboot my phone a couple times.
2128000	2132000	But like it was just like, it would, it would stop working after a while.
2132000	2135000	I think it's just, there's so much going on at Disneyland.
2135000	2137000	Because I remember, I haven't done it in Pokemon Go because I haven't been to Disneyland.
2137000	2140000	Well, no, I'm not a, I think I've gone, I haven't gone to Disneyland.
2140000	2142000	I think I went when Pokemon Go was first out.
2142000	2145000	But I haven't gone since it started tracking the gyms and all that.
2145000	2147000	Like I think it was kind of a different game then.
2147000	2152000	But I remember with Ingress, with all the portals that were there.
2152000	2155000	They're like Downtown Disney and everything because I was there once for BlizzCon.
2155000	2157000	I think I had just started playing Ingress at the time.
2157000	2160000	And I got one of my like unique portals.
2160000	2162000	Oh damn, I should have played Ingress.
2162000	2163000	Oh!
2163000	2165000	Yeah, you missed opportunity.
2165000	2167000	Yeah, lots and lots of uniques there.
2167000	2169000	You barely play, you barely play that anymore.
2169000	2171000	I don't. Yeah, I don't play that at all.
2171000	2174000	But I did get a lot of walking though.
2174000	2177000	Like 15 miles in a day is ridiculous.
2177000	2181000	But you've been a more fit lifestyle guy lately.
2181000	2183000	So that walking is probably a really good thing.
2183000	2187000	Yeah, so, yeah, I mean that's pretty much it.
2187000	2190000	I didn't really, like I said, play too much this week.
2190000	2192000	It was just pretty much that.
2192000	2197000	I almost picked up and I still kind of, I know we have to pick up Smash by the end of this month.
2197000	2200000	In order to get the free Piranha Plant thing.
2200000	2202000	I don't know if that's gonna happen though.
2202000	2203000	I'm not sure.
2203000	2207000	I don't know if I would like buy the whole game right away just because you want Piranha Plant.
2207000	2208000	Like you could always just buy it later.
2208000	2211000	Yes, it's more money, but if you're not ready, don't take the plunge.
2211000	2213000	Although I think it's a great game, you should take the plunge.
2213000	2218000	I should, but like I just, the problem is I can't get the switch enough times.
2218000	2223000	And it sucks because my wife's been really just hammering Animal Crossing.
2223000	2226000	So I've had the PlayStation available on the TV.
2226000	2229000	It's been practically available to me for the whole month.
2229000	2234000	And I've just, I've booted up the PlayStation 4 so many times and just sat there going,
2234000	2236000	I don't even know what the hell I want to play on this.
2236000	2242000	Like, I just, I wanted to like, I was like, maybe we should jump in the Just Cause 4 or something.
2242000	2245000	But I'm like, I don't want to buy another game because I'm just gonna buy another game.
2245000	2246000	And it's just gonna sit there and I'm not gonna finish it.
2246000	2250000	Just like Red Dead 2 and whatever the hell else I was playing before that.
2250000	2253000	I've got so many started games that it's just gamer ADD.
2253000	2258000	I understand. All right. Well, my gaming week, probably not as varied.
2258000	2266000	I played a little, I played a little bit Diablo 3 because on that event for the Diablo 1 in Diablo 3,
2266000	2270000	although it's not really Diablo 1, it's just like some maps that kind of look like Diablo 1 in a filter.
2270000	2272000	The Darkening of Tristram, that's what they call it.
2272000	2276000	I finally like needed to get around to playing that event and unlocking all the achievements.
2276000	2279000	So I did that because there's one achievement where like you have to start a brand new character
2279000	2283000	and go straight there and like clear it the whole way through to level 20.
2283000	2287000	Which is actually kind of challenging because you don't get as many loot drops as you'd hope for in that.
2287000	2290000	But I did it. And so I played that whole thing, got the achievements.
2290000	2292000	That was my big Diablo 3 accomplishment of the week.
2292000	2295000	Now I'm just waiting to get power level the rest of the way of 70.
2295000	2300000	Or maybe I need to do it all again on the Switch to get the achievement there too because I'm sick
2300000	2305000	and I own Diablo on multiple platforms, but I might do it. I don't know.
2305000	2311000	I've been playing some World of Warcraft still. My main warlock, I got up to item level 370 today
2311000	2313000	thanks to all the bumps in the last patch.
2313000	2318000	And my resto shaman I've been working on as well is up to about a level I think 111.
2318000	2322000	But I did play something new this week. I did want to try to do some new games for my game week 2.
2322000	2327000	So I finally downloaded and I've been meaning to just pick up this game for like 6 weeks.
2327000	2332000	But I'm always like, it's like 30 bucks. I need to hold off because I don't know what's happening
2332000	2335000	with my husband's job situation and all this stuff. I need to just hold off.
2335000	2339000	Well finally this week I dropped the money and picked up Beat Saber already.
2339000	2345000	Which I had already played before because Bobby Blackwolf brought it to Dragon Con and he has the Vive version.
2345000	2349000	So I was familiar with it already. So the game, I kind of knew what I was expecting.
2349000	2353000	But it was nice to be able to play it on Playstation VR in my living room.
2353000	2358000	And it took me a minute man. Did you know like to get the move controllers synced
2358000	2363000	You can't use just any USB cable. You have to get a specific one that will do
2363000	2368000	Like I guess some of them will only charge but they won't actually communicate and do the syncing.
2368000	2372000	So I was like, no it happened. It wouldn't work through one cable.
2372000	2377000	But then when I was like, Alan! I need every cable in the house to try them.
2377000	2379000	And the third one I tried worked.
2379000	2382000	Unless they have like pins that are connected.
2382000	2388000	They will be finicky sometimes but what you have to do is you have to push the reset button in them.
2388000	2391000	So you have to get like a paperclip out and push the reset button.
2391000	2395000	And that will occasionally happen even when you have them synced already.
2395000	2399000	Like I did that the last time I was playing the Playstation VR.
2399000	2402000	I had to push the reset button to do that.
2402000	2407000	Oh! No I did play a game. I forgot. I played Accounting Plus.
2407000	2411000	I fucking love that game. It's so inappropriate but I love that game.
2411000	2413000	So I played Accounting Plus.
2413000	2418000	But yeah so the last time I played Playstation VR I had to do that.
2418000	2420000	So they do that every now and then.
2420000	2423000	But if you run into problems like that just try pushing the reset button.
2423000	2428000	Well I got it eventually by digging up. I was like, Alan I need every cable that's a match.
2428000	2431000	And one of his phone charger cables did it. So whatever. It's fine.
2431000	2434000	I got it to work and I got to play the game but it just took me a minute to get it up and running.
2434000	2437000	But if you haven't played Beat Saber it's a music game.
2437000	2442000	And I know we have a lot of music game people that listen to OLR because that used to be our bread and butter.
2442000	2446000	So I know for those of you that enjoy music games you probably already know about Beat Saber.
2446000	2449000	But I got to tell you it's a lot of fun because you really do kind of have to get the motion.
2449000	2452000	You get a higher score if, and I think the technical thing is that,
2452000	2458000	if your controller ends at such and such an angle from when you slice through the notes.
2458000	2462000	So basically instead of sitting there going ee ee ee to like slice the notes.
2462000	2464000	Just like with your hands. Just little motions.
2464000	2467000	If you do these big flourishes and you know just extra.
2467000	2471000	If you play the game you get rewarded for being extra and over the top in Beat Saber.
2471000	2473000	And I think that's what's kind of really cool about it.
2473000	2478000	I've been having some minor problems like getting the aim right.
2478000	2482000	Because you can calibrate where the floor is but I can't get the right setting.
2482000	2484000	And I think it's just because my camera is too low.
2484000	2489000	I have a camera below my TV because trying to get it on top of the TV like you know it's hard to balance.
2489000	2491000	TV's are so thin it's hard to balance.
2491000	2495000	Yeah the floor thing. I really don't like the floor calibration thing.
2495000	2498000	There is one game. I think it may have been Accounting Plus.
2498000	2501000	It was one of them but most of them have it.
2501000	2505000	Okay it's like okay lower the floor raise the floor until it looks right to you.
2505000	2507000	Well that's hard to figure out.
2507000	2514000	So the one though I had it calibrated is it gave me the floor raising and lowering.
2514000	2516000	But it also said what height it was.
2516000	2518000	So you just set it to your height and boom done.
2518000	2522000	But like in Beat Saber you can kind of change the height but you can't.
2522000	2525000	Like it just kind of measures to where you're at. It's weird.
2525000	2528000	But anyway whatever I figured it out eventually.
2528000	2531000	I got it playable and that's the most important thing so whatever.
2531000	2536000	And the calibration stuff aside once I got in there and played it I had a lot of fun.
2536000	2542000	It was a decent workout like doing all those like playing all the Beat Saber and flinging around so it was good.
2542000	2545000	I hope they expand it with more songs later.
2545000	2547000	I mean not that the songs are bad they're really good.
2547000	2553000	But you know everybody on PC is modding everything you can think of under the sun into that game.
2553000	2558000	So it would be cool if maybe the Playstation gets some expansion packs and DLC soundtrack stuff.
2558000	2560000	So I would pay for more of the same stuff.
2560000	2563000	Some of those like chiptune dancy songs are really good.
2563000	2565000	So I like Beat Saber.
2565000	2571000	I highly recommend if you're a VR owner or a music game fan or you know both especially.
2571000	2573000	I picked that game up if you haven't already.
2573000	2575000	So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
2575000	2578000	So I don't have a whole lot of housekeeping to get into.
2578000	2581000	I don't foresee any shows off we have planned.
2581000	2585000	I do know Jamie is returning to the show and I already forgot the date.
2585000	2589000	But she got her work schedule rearranged when they start their new schedules.
2589000	2592000	It's either the last show in February or the first show in March.
2592000	2594000	So she'll be back with us in studios.
2594000	2596000	That means we're probably going to look a little different.
2596000	2600000	Because I'm going to move this whole thing over there where the Playstation 3 is now.
2600000	2602000	And then the camera will kind of be up and over at us.
2602000	2605000	And he'll catch Jamie over the shoulder so she can be Dr. Claw.
2605000	2608000	Or Ms. Claw as the case may be.
2608000	2609000	So it'll be fun.
2609000	2610000	Anyway.
2610000	2611000	Alright.
2611000	2613000	Let's get into some other gaming news.
2613000	2615000	So Loki has some stuff to start us off tonight.
2615000	2618000	So for all those people waiting for Metroid Prime 4.
2618000	2620000	You're going to have to wait a little longer.
2620000	2621000	Because guess what?
2621000	2623000	It's under a new studio now.
2623000	2625000	So I don't remember who it was that was developing it originally.
2625000	2629000	But now it's Retro Studios which is great because Retro Studios makes great games.
2629000	2633000	But they had to reboot the whole development process.
2633000	2636000	So unfortunately they did this really short video.
2636000	2641000	Shinya Takahashi who is Nintendo's development head.
2641000	2644000	Basically made this kind of apology video saying,
2644000	2650000	Hey you know we are rebooting the development on this.
2650000	2654000	And it's going to take some more time to get it done.
2654000	2656000	So probably not going to see that.
2656000	2658000	So he said without saying.
2658000	2660000	In my own words.
2660000	2661000	He said,
2661000	2663000	The game ain't good y'all.
2663000	2668000	So we're going to bring in the folks that kind of did this before to start over.
2668000	2676000	But if you thought or assumed or had your podcast speculating that Metroid Prime 4 would be out this year.
2676000	2677000	Yeah.
2677000	2679000	I'm going to need you to hold off those expectations.
2679000	2683000	Because we're looking like maybe 2021 or 2022 at this point.
2683000	2687000	Is that an accurate summary of what he said?
2687000	2691000	I don't know about 2021 but maybe like end of 2020.
2691000	2692000	I don't know.
2692000	2694000	That's not what I was getting from that.
2694000	2696000	I think if they're starting over Loki.
2696000	2700000	I mean they might be able to reuse some of the art assets maybe some of the ideas.
2700000	2704000	But I think 2021 is a little more realistic.
2704000	2705000	Not so much.
2705000	2708000	I think you know if they're coming out with an announcement like this.
2708000	2711000	They mean like it's it's bumped back.
2711000	2714000	You know but I appreciate at least Nintendo being transparent.
2714000	2721000	You know I think we all know that this happened with like Final Fantasy 15 right when it went from versus 13 to Final Fantasy 15.
2721000	2724000	And the game we got doesn't look anything like that.
2724000	2730000	Well I mean maybe a little bit but like it's very different from that early footage like this happens in the gaming industry sometimes.
2730000	2740000	But maybe it says something about this Internet culture and you know the way we interact with folks immediately on Twitter and setting those expectations and things.
2740000	2744000	Where maybe Nintendo felt like maybe we announced this too early.
2744000	2748000	We announced this early to get you excited about the switch.
2748000	2750000	And now we wish we hadn't done that.
2750000	2754000	Maybe we padded out our E3 announcements too much.
2754000	2768000	So interest isn't that interesting isn't that a damned if you do damned if you don't sort of thing because people want game studios to announce this stuff so well then I can they do it's like oh but the reality is well I guess that means we have more room for remasters.
2768000	2775000	So hey let's get a Mario maker remaster or Metroid Prime trilogy. I'd be down for that. Heck yeah portable.
2775000	2780000	And they already took out the Wii controls because they did they sold it on the Wii U.
2780000	2790000	It doesn't the 1 2 because 1 and 2 were GameCube 3 was a Wii game and they repackaged it it was either like I think it was like a Wii download on the Wii U but they that you could do it without motion controls essentially.
2790000	2794000	So I feel like the hardest stuff has already been taken care of in Metroid.
2794000	2800000	It would be great if they had a few resources to maybe bump up some of the textures but you know what whatever.
2800000	2804000	Obviously anything they do for that would take away from Prime 4 maybe.
2804000	2811000	So I don't know it would be it would be very cool though if they would re-release the trilogy to maybe wet our appetite a little more for Metroid Prime 4.
2811000	2812000	That would be cool.
2812000	2823000	But don't I mean don't get me wrong with this delay you know and I think one maybe refreshing thing about what I'm seeing on Twitter is instead of angry people going like oh fuck Nintendo I don't know what the fuck they're doing.
2823000	2829000	I didn't really see that it was more like alright I mean that's disappointing but totally understandable.
2829000	2833000	Like don't release a crappy game and call it Metroid Prime 4.
2833000	2842000	Exactly sometimes it's better to you know delay your game and restart development rather than hold a beta that looks kind of eh and then release your game a month from now.
2844000	2847000	Would you be talking about the next story in our showroom potentially?
2848000	2850000	Is that maybe what you're referring to?
2850000	2852000	No I'm not referring to that one but.
2852000	2854000	Oh the one that happened this weekend.
2854000	2855000	The one that happened this weekend.
2855000	2858000	Oh okay we'll get into that later but I mean I think I think there might be another good example.
2858000	2859000	Yes.
2859000	2860000	As well right?
2860000	2862000	Yes that would also be a good example of that.
2863000	2874000	Now BobbyBlackWolf over in our Twitch chat says the only people upset are probably investors and shareholders because they know a crappy Metroid Prime 4 would still be a million seller.
2874000	2882000	Yeah but as a Metroid fan I really appreciate they didn't release a crappy Metroid Prime 4 because I don't want the series to die because Metroid Prime 4 is crap.
2882000	2892000	And exactly and if you start releasing crappy games then you're going to lose all of that reputation that Nintendo has of being a company that releases quality games.
2892000	2895000	You don't want to be another EA or Activision come on folks.
2896000	2901000	Let's see SG100Matt says I completely forgot about Prime 4 being announced so I'm obviously okay it's delayed.
2902000	2904000	Really? Because I talk about it a lot on this show.
2904000	2906000	How excited I was for it.
2906000	2913000	But again I'm in the camper I'm like aw damn I was looking forward to that but again very happy they're not going to murder Metroid by releasing a half ass game.
2913000	2921000	Or slapping the Metroid name on another game that luckily I think everybody's forgotten about at this point.
2921000	2922000	Did y'all forget?
2922000	2924000	No I have not forgotten.
2924000	2928000	They did release kind of a snoozer Metroid game but.
2928000	2929000	Oh no I remember.
2929000	2931000	I knew it wasn't a Metroid game.
2931000	2937000	I'm talking about the 3DS multiplayer thing Prime was not Prime Hunters no that one was actually rad.
2937000	2939000	The other I don't even know what it was called.
2939000	2942000	That tells you how great that game was.
2942000	2943000	Let's see.
2943000	2944000	Prime piece of shit.
2944000	2947000	Federation Force thank you Bobby that was it.
2947000	2954000	No they had the other one was like Metroid going Doom multiplayer that game that was like the demo thing on the 3DS that was cool.
2954000	2956000	I wish that that should have caught more.
2956000	2959000	They should bring that out on Switch.
2959000	2961000	I'd be down for that you guys.
2961000	2962000	Oh my gosh.
2962000	2963000	Why not?
2963000	2964000	I don't know.
2964000	2965000	I don't know maybe I don't know.
2965000	2972000	Pie in the sky you know again I want him to work on Metroid Prime 4 so maybe I should just shut my mouth with all these other side projects.
2972000	2977000	Let's see Tigerclaw says Nintendo should look at Metroid Samus Returns on how to do a proper Metroid game.
2977000	2983000	I know the Prime series is 3D but I don't like it always being first person all the time.
2983000	2984000	Yeah I'm kind of with you.
2984000	2989000	I've always preferred the 2D Metroids to the 3Ds but like I don't hate the 3D Metroid games.
2989000	3000000	So like you know if and it has been a while since we did get Samus Returns I feel like okay it's the time is right for them to try a 3D game again.
3000000	3012000	Now with the technology of the Switch you know and the technology has come a long way from the GameCube even to the Wii where Metroid Prime 3 was to you know the Wii U's happened since then and now we're on the Switch.
3012000	3018000	That can run Doom reboot which is a pretty you know graphically intense sort of shooter.
3018000	3028000	I'm kind of excited to see what Metroid might look like in first person or third person because maybe now with the technology and the chips that are in those guys maybe you'll be able to switch.
3028000	3037000	Which ironically which would you know be kind of cool right just like you can in Skyrim right and the Switch runs Skyrim and you can do first person third person whatever you want to do right.
3037000	3038000	Sure.
3038000	3039000	So maybe we'll see.
3039000	3047000	Let's see Spyro 557 John in our chat says I actually have Federation Force but never played it lol.
3047000	3050000	Well I think that's probably a good thing not to do that.
3050000	3051000	Anyway.
3051000	3052000	All right.
3052000	3055000	Let's move on to our next story Logie.
3055000	3058000	Oh no I'm sorry it's me I'm sorry I'm getting backwards here.
3058000	3065000	We need to because I kind of shaded this a little bit already so I thought I talked about it has to do with rumors about Fallout 76.
3065000	3068000	There were some rumors going around the Internet as they sometimes do that.
3068000	3073000	Fallout 76 crashed and burned so bad y'all that it's going free to play.
3073000	3083000	Well usually companies don't come out you know usually the companies will say we don't comment on rumors or speculation but Bethesda came out and said no this is BS basically basically.
3083000	3091000	So anyway I've never seen ever just you know the rumor was founded because EB games in Australia apparently pulled copies from store shelves.
3091000	3101000	So that's that's where the rumor came from is that oh my God y'all they're pulling it from store shelves because this game tanked you know like that you know how the Internet and Twitter runs they all run their mouths with that right.
3101000	3111000	So anyway a message on Twitter where Bethesda and the actual Bethesda accounts we don't know who said it but they said there is no truth to this rumor.
3111000	3123000	So yeah they are not going free to play with Fallout 76 or tinfoil hat if they are they just don't want to tell you right now.
3123000	3136000	But anyway now I don't I don't you know I think the game I think the logical step is for the game to get drastically reduced in price like 20 bucks then go free to play.
3136000	3148000	I don't think it's going to go straight from $60 price to Black Friday sales and some of the you know minor 10 15 20 percent cuts you saw around that time to free free to play.
3148000	3150000	I think they would try to sell it for 20 bucks first.
3150000	3152000	What does it even mean sold for now.
3152000	3156000	I mean let's see aren't they still trying to get the 64 or am I wrong on that.
3156000	3158000	Maybe I don't think it's 60 anymore.
3158000	3160000	Loki's looking it up right now.
3160000	3162000	If you guys are trying to beat him to the punch.
3162000	3164000	Thank you for scrolling down the page.
3164000	3167000	Why do you do that.
3167000	3176000	So he's busy searching a popular retailer on his laptop there to see what they're currently charging for it and even see it listed on here.
3176000	3180000	Other than that there's a bundle there's a bundle and a bunch of shirts.
3180000	3184000	Do they not have the game.
3184000	3185000	Oh here we go.
3185000	3186000	Here we go.
3186000	3188000	Thirty nine ninety nine down to 40.
3188000	3189000	All right.
3189000	3193000	Well speaking of thirty nine ninety nine.
3193000	3200000	Well your deep discounts I saw but I checked online I didn't see the price points but I might pick it up for this kind.
3200000	3209000	I saw that there was someone had taken a photo of a Wal-Mart that was clearing out PlayStation classics for twenty five dollars.
3209000	3210000	I was like for that price.
3210000	3212000	Yes I would pick that up.
3212000	3214000	I wanted to find like a retail.
3214000	3216000	All I could see was that picture on Facebook.
3216000	3217000	It was a Wal-Mart.
3217000	3218000	Yeah.
3218000	3219000	Boston.
3219000	3222000	I was like Wal-Mart picture on Facebook.
3222000	3224000	That's kind of shaky ground right.
3224000	3226000	Somebody could have photoshopped that.
3226000	3227000	OK.
3227000	3230000	I was looking for a retail listing so I went to Wal-Mart site to see there.
3230000	3235000	And that's not what they were charging on Wal-Mart charging that reduced fifty nine I think or what.
3235000	3236000	Yeah.
3236000	3238000	The cheapest thing online right now is like fifty four ninety nine.
3239000	3246000	But I was going to tweet it to Bobby and say is this close enough because he said something on his show about when it comes down to twenty bucks.
3246000	3247000	I'll finally pick one up.
3247000	3249000	I was going to tweet him the twenty five dollars.
3249000	3250000	Yeah yeah.
3250000	3251000	And be like close enough.
3251000	3256000	Twenty five I think would be all right because that's that's you know that's worth it for like Bobby.
3256000	3257000	Bobby's clarifying in chat.
3257000	3258000	Still too much.
3258000	3260000	Twenty is my line.
3260000	3262000	He drives a hard bargain.
3262000	3263000	All right.
3263000	3264000	Let's see.
3264000	3267000	Frodo Swagan says that the only good thing about that game.
3267000	3271000	I think Fallout 76 here was the power armor helmet with the ultimate edition.
3271000	3273000	But some comments on the rumors.
3273000	3276000	Quest Buster simply saying this rumor was absolutely dumb.
3276000	3279000	Well at least it wasn't like somebody completely making it up.
3279000	3281000	They had some sort of.
3281000	3284000	But I agree it was a little bit of a jump to conclusion sort of thing.
3284000	3289000	Bobby Blackwell says fans were probably trying to shame Bethesda into going free to play.
3289000	3291000	As if it works like that.
3291000	3292000	But I get the comment.
3292000	3294000	Some people think it does work like that.
3294000	3295000	So I get it.
3295000	3299000	And that's why that follow up about the PlayStation being twenty five bucks.
3299000	3300000	I want.
3300000	3309000	That's why I'm kind of questioning and I didn't link it to Bobby because I was like I wonder if somebody is trying to like get that rumor going to see if competitors buy it.
3309000	3315000	If retailers like Amazon really will cut the price that low because you know right.
3315000	3316000	Yeah I gotcha.
3316000	3318000	We live in a crazy world.
3318000	3319000	Who knows.
3319000	3320000	All right.
3320000	3321000	Now we can go on to the next story Loki.
3321000	3322000	Sorry.
3322000	3323000	All right.
3323000	3325000	So let's talk about Deep Mind.
3325000	3335000	So Deep Mind is this wonderful A.I. system that they were using the plays like some different games before they had go.
3335000	3340000	And I want to say was it chess not Pokemon go but the ancient game go.
3340000	3341000	Yeah.
3341000	3348000	So now of course you know we're stepping it up instead of you know those simple games that we're going to take on Starcraft 2.
3348000	3365000	And so they actually took Deep Mind they trained it against or to play Starcraft 2 basically cramming I was 200 years worth of gameplay into two weeks because they sped up the games and had basically sped up the simulations.
3365000	3373000	So then they they basically pit them against some of the best Starcraft 2 players.
3373000	3386000	And apparently I did win because some of the it's sort of unfair I guess in the way that it operates because they can see the whole map it basically doesn't have to zoom in to different spots.
3386000	3389000	So the fog of war.
3389000	3391000	Well the fog of war is still there for them.
3391000	3397000	But I would say it doesn't have to like study things or be like what's that because the computer kind of it already knows.
3397000	3398000	Yeah.
3398000	3400000	But in and of course it played very unconventionally.
3400000	3406000	So you know it was hard for the competitors to basically counter some of this stuff.
3406000	3408000	Interesting though because A.I. is programmed by humans.
3408000	3414000	But this one though this one though it basically learned to play the game and it played itself.
3414000	3417000	And so it didn't really pick up any like their strategies I think.
3417000	3423000	So very cool. I would love to see like some video of this but just be careful.
3423000	3425000	This is how Cylons were made.
3425000	3434000	But I don't know man should we be threatened that the fact that you know that it's able to play Starcraft 2 so well I mean what's next.
3434000	3436000	No because Starcraft isn't real life yet.
3436000	3440000	What about Overwatch or like Fortnite or something like that.
3440000	3443000	A.I. is going to just take over everything.
3444000	3448000	As long as there's a plug to unplug it.
3448000	3453000	S2-100 Matt with the mandatory Skynet comment in our chat at VOG Network.
3453000	3461000	So kind of interesting. I mean it's interesting as an exhibition sort of thing but obviously computers winning game tournaments.
3461000	3464000	I don't know if it's that. I mean I don't know.
3464000	3468000	But then again during awesome games done quick don't they do like the assisted speed runs.
3468000	3473000	Well those are the tool assisted ones. Those are basically kind of like recording.
3473000	3477000	It's like recording a demo type thing.
3477000	3486000	But I don't know. Those are still all human input stuff but it's just that you're recording it so you can make it frame perfect.
3486000	3492000	DJ Rama asks in chat asks how is this any different from Deep Blue beating Kasparov at chess.
3492000	3499000	I guess on face value it's not. But there's the complexities of what Starcraft 2 is compared to chess.
3499000	3502000	I'm not saying chess isn't a complex game. Of course it is.
3502000	3509000	But the rule set for chess all things considered is very simple and doesn't have a lot of variables per se.
3509000	3512000	The only variable is responding to the moves of your opponent right.
3512000	3513000	Right.
3513000	3516000	But in Starcraft 2 your maps could be different.
3516000	3523000	Your positioning of things could go from what 64 squares on a board to millions of pixels.
3523000	3531000	So I think it's more like that level of complexity that goes with the Starcraft 2 game versus a chess game that makes this you know.
3531000	3537000	But you're right. Is this a repeat of what we've heard years ago with A.I. beats human at chess.
3538000	3545000	I'm curious. So if they're doing ink you know it's nonstandard strategies or something.
3545000	3550000	Can can we learn from this to basically play Starcraft 2 better.
3550000	3556000	Yes. Can can Deep Blue come up with a solution to end the government shutdown.
3556000	3561000	I think that's pretty good. That's pretty easy way to keep that cans of worms locked.
3561000	3563000	I had I had to make the joke I had to.
3563000	3569000	All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about something going from a joke to a bit of a mess.
3569000	3572000	Maybe another different type of joke and that is the anthem demo this weekend.
3572000	3579000	Look I y'all know I've been a little I've been a little bit skeptical a little salty about anthem here on this show.
3579000	3585000	And that's just because I haven't agreed with the the way that EA has been running things and making a lot of decisions.
3585000	3592000	And one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week but I tried to play the anthem demo by and talk about it because I feel like I didn't really play it.
3592000	3598000	Here's what happened. I was given a code to the VIP demo or the preorder demo.
3598000	3603000	But I guess a preorder got to invite one or two or three other people out of depending on maybe what level they preordered.
3603000	3610000	I don't know. Regardless I got an invite from a friend so I was like all right well might as well check this thing out because maybe who knows.
3610000	3613000	Maybe I'll stop being such a hater. Maybe the single blow me away and I'll change my mind.
3613000	3618000	So I downloaded the multi gig thing on origin set that all up.
3618000	3623000	So yes I tried to do it on PC because that's where I would prefer to play because I play a lot of games on PC.
3623000	3632000	I load up the demo. Now I didn't play it till Saturday because in my mind I was like when the doors open right away it's going to be a clusterfuck.
3632000	3638000	Sure enough what happened on Friday. Total clusterfuck right. Servers can't handle all the people and all that stuff fine.
3638000	3642000	So I knew in my head I was like it ain't going to really work till like Saturday or so they'll figure out the issues.
3642000	3647000	How do the servers like they know how many keys they gave out right.
3647000	3651000	Why servers just weren't prepared for the number of people. It's like so it's interesting.
3651000	3662000	So so Bobby actually addresses that perspective a little bit tonight on his show and what you're saying isn't really different from the way a lot of people on the Internet would say things and basically like you know how many people are going in.
3662000	3669000	You should have the servers infrastructure for that. But I suppose it basically comes down to this and I don't necessarily disagree with this.
3669000	3679000	I don't hate it for this reason. I hate it for other reasons. It's not that like they didn't necessarily have the server set up ready to go and all that.
3679000	3685000	But it's that some things you just do not know how it's going to work until you unleash it to the masses.
3685000	3692000	Right. I guess take our move to twitch for example some things we tested we thought would work.
3692000	3699000	We thought would go great. And then poof one week Skype breaks our soundboard that didn't occur in the testing. Who knew. Right.
3699000	3704000	Well I didn't know until we were there. Right. It's typical that Microsoft sub breaks everything.
3704000	3711000	But that's that's the gist. I'm kind of simplifying what's a more complicated issue. But that's the gist. Yeah. OK. So fine.
3711000	3719000	But here's the I go into the demo. I'm able to get past that log in screen. I'm playing for a little bit and then I get to a loading screen and the loading screens just loading and loading.
3719000	3726000	And I get to the loading screen after being asked like 17 times are you sure you don't want to play with other people.
3726000	3732000	Anthem is best experience when you play with other people. Push this button right now to join an experience with other people.
3732000	3738000	And I'm just like OK look I know how trash fires on the Internet are if I don't already know how to play this game.
3738000	3743000	By the time I join a group with people they're just going to talk smack even beta or not. It doesn't even matter.
3743000	3749000	So I want to just play a little single player so I can like how do how do I move.
3749000	3756000	How do babby crawl. Like I just want to play single player to figure all that out. Right.
3756000	3760000	But then I'm on the loading screen loading your load as you lose. And it's just I'm sitting on the loading screen for five minutes.
3760000	3765000	And this is after like for some reason I can't play on my main monitor.
3765000	3771000	I have to play on my side monitor because yes this is a 4K monitor and I can't play 4K gaming with my current setup.
3771000	3777000	But I had it downscaled to 1080p resolution but it still wouldn't play on my 4K monitor but like frame skip like.
3777000	3782000	So I had to play it over here which is weird. So I was already frustrated and I'm stuck on the loading screen.
3782000	3785000	And finally after five minutes of sitting on the loading screen I was like you know what.
3785000	3792000	Reclaiming my time. Reclaiming my time. I'm not. This is it's broken.
3792000	3797000	I don't I don't. Whatever. What was I thinking. What was I thinking. And I just I stopped.
3797000	3800000	And that's why I didn't talk about it during my gaming week and I didn't want to come out here and just be like.
3800000	3805000	Anthem sucks. I didn't play it because it wasn't really ready to be played this weekend.
3805000	3812000	Now I said to some extent I understand all these engineering things and that some things you're just not going to figure out until you go.
3812000	3818000	Here's where I have a problem. Here's why I think EA continues to screw with BioWare and their releases.
3818000	3825000	And why they're setting Anthem up to potentially and I might be wrong because some of the people that did get in and are playing it seem to enjoy it.
3825000	3831000	So maybe it'll do just fine. EA sold this as like a VIP sneak peek.
3831000	3838000	Who is in that preview this weekend. People that paid extra money or at least committed to.
3838000	3848000	I realize all the preorder systems are different but people who said they were going to spend extra money and preorder this more advanced edition of Anthem.
3848000	3854000	And that's who this was for. Their open demo for the public and for everybody is next weekend.
3854000	3859000	Now I'm not a big fan of paying more money to access games early as it is.
3859000	3863000	But that's just kind of the day and age we live in now.
3863000	3871000	Why didn't EA if they didn't truly know what they were going to be facing and if they knew they were basically going to be testing multiplayer with this whole thing.
3871000	3876000	Because they want you to go multiplayer very very badly through all the in-game prompts.
3876000	3884000	Why did they not do the open let's have everybody in it test first and market it as stress test.
3884000	3891000	This test will offer you experience of Anthem levels but you will probably experience frequent issues.
3891000	3900000	If they had sold it as what it was as opposed to the VIP very special people access edition.
3900000	3910000	I'd hate this whole thing a lot less. But that's the problem is that EA was tempting people with extra money and spend this extra stuff to get in this thing early.
3910000	3915000	They ain't even going to fucking work. But you see you're paying money to be our testers.
3915000	3927000	So you see if I were if it wasn't called a VIP test then where would be my sense of pride and accomplishment with EA.
3927000	3936000	I wouldn't feel as special. I wouldn't feel like this special snowflake that I was that I dropped money to play and that I'm just showing EA look at me.
3936000	3952000	I'm ready to give you money for no thing because it still would have been you could have been the little snowflake all you wanted because they would have marketed as a very special one level preview capped at level 10 to stress to stress test the servers.
3952000	3958000	Like sold it for what it was sold it for what it was as opposed to what it ended up being.
3958000	3960000	That's where I get into issues with EA.
3960000	3971000	And you know what this whole thing I'm complaining about has nothing to do with the hardworking people that made the game has nothing to do with the artist the engineers that are trying to fix the servers as fast as they're identifying the problem.
3971000	3974000	My issue if you think about it has nothing to do with that.
3974000	3981000	It's how it was marketed and sold by EA which when I got ticked off about a lot of things with Mass Effect Andromeda.
3981000	3989000	Guess what it was about decisions that EA made about how they were going to preview the game in advance when it wasn't really finished and all this other stuff.
3989000	3993000	Well here's my question. We only have like a month away. Do you think it's going to be ready in time.
3993000	4000000	Well then I heard another thing and I don't know if this is true or not but I heard another thing that the demo people were playing was apparently like a six month old demo.
4000000	4012000	I don't know if that's true or not. Take it with a grain of salt. But that just made me even go more like why would that be what you're putting out there for VIP people two weeks before the game launches.
4012000	4023000	Because I bet you there are people with those preorders that played that thing this weekend and canceled their preorder just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda when all of that started coming out.
4024000	4035000	Don't believe me. I know some of the person that gave me the key was thinking about doing it. I don't know if they did it but there are people that are going to cancel the preorder based off of what happened whether it's rational or not.
4035000	4050000	This is just what happened and then you know what else is going to happen because EA likes giving you that early access if you pay them the extra money because people are going to get that early access and see how much of a clusterfuck it is and then people are going to cancel more preorders that way to
4051000	4066000	Quest Buster in the VOG Network Twitch chat says that's kind of true. The blog statement by BioWare said that the demo was an older build. Well speaking of which this is it wasn't just my opportunity to rant about anthem but I actually did have a whole little thing here where BioWare has talked about what's going on basically this weekend.
4067000	4079000	So Chad Roberts with BioWare said in a BioWare blog post we've been testing the entire game and platform for several months but there were a few things we missed real world play frequently leads to unexpected issues.
4079000	4089000	I want to dispel one comment we've seen that we under plan for server capacity to ensure stability. We intend to manage our servers to match the player population as it grew.
4089000	4101000	Overall we had excess capacity to prepare for population increases and continue to do so. That said what's important is that all parts of the game work is designed to meet players needs and that did not happen in the opening hours.
4101000	4113000	So why did you sell it like something that was going to be different then. Like that's the problem EA stop lying to us. Like stop thinking we're all stupid just so you can take our money.
4113000	4121000	Like tell us what it really is and maybe these things won't happen.
4121000	4123000	That makes too much sense.
4123000	4125000	We can't do that honestly.
4125000	4130000	That's not nice warm fuzzy marketing.
4131000	4138000	Anyway some of the issues that have been cited rubber banding connection issues blocked entitlements blah blah blah blah blah.
4138000	4144000	I guess investigations are ongoing stuff is going to be fixed before the next demo.
4144000	4151000	Another comment from the same guy. I want to be upfront that this is a difficult one and something we may not resolve during this weekend.
4151000	4157000	Many players are not seeing this issue and the last thing we want to do is destabilize the experience for everyone.
4157000	4166000	You know what this is. You know what this is. I got the perfect analogy because this is what everybody's talking about all over again because of some documentaries that hit Netflix and Hulu this week.
4166000	4175000	This is gaming's version of the Fyre Festival a very elite VIP experience for those of you that spent a little extra money.
4175000	4178000	I got to watch that experience this special event.
4178000	4184000	Thanks EA for putting on the Fyre Festival demo this weekend.
4184000	4194000	Maybe I'm over maybe I'm being a little over dramatic here on this program but I think there's some merit to the comparison I'm making there.
4194000	4198000	All right. Let's move on. I don't I don't want to live in a negative space.
4198000	4200000	You know what. For those of you that are looking forward to Anthem.
4200000	4203000	I hope it's all I hope they've learned what happened this weekend.
4203000	4207000	I hope the game comes out. I hope it's wonderful. I hope you all have a happy time gaming.
4207000	4210000	Who knows maybe I'll come around on it.
4210000	4213000	Maybe I'll have to eat my words and be like I was wrong.
4213000	4219000	But right now I ain't spending 60 bucks on it. I got other stuff I can play like Kingdom Hearts 3 is out on Tuesday.
4219000	4224000	So yes that will probably keep me busy for like six weeks with the slowest I am on games.
4224000	4226000	So anyway let's move on to another story.
4226000	4230000	Loki so e-sports is definitely changing.
4230000	4240000	So one game company giant software is actually getting into the e-sports game and they're doing that with none other than farming simulator.
4240000	4246000	That's right. The first season of the farming simulator league is going to be starting soon.
4246000	4250000	It's going to consist of 10 tournaments that are going to take place in Europe.
4250000	4257000	They're going to have a chance to win up to two hundred eighty thousand dollars in prize money put up by the developer.
4257000	4264000	Now for those that are listening on the podcast you're going to hear like low motor noises because we're actually looking at footage of farmer simulator 19.
4265000	4272000	Because I'm I'm I have to be honest like I was like I don't like what what do you do in farming simulator like I far.
4272000	4276000	I know this has been like a game people talk about things for a long time.
4276000	4280000	But what what exactly what where's the competitive head to head and it's going to be with this.
4280000	4285000	And right now on the stream we're watching this guy with a tool chop a tree into smaller bits.
4285000	4289000	Now granted I probably did. I just picked a random like two minutes of gameplay here.
4289000	4294000	Maybe not pick the most exciting stuff in the world but a lot of the gameplay looks fun.
4294000	4297000	Maybe. Yeah no I'm not I'm not like dog in the game at all.
4297000	4301000	Like if this is like the type of thing you're into like people play flight simulators right.
4301000	4306000	Like you know we have I know we have a caller. He hasn't called in a long time but used to talk about flight simulators and stuff.
4306000	4310000	And that's cool. Like if you are into farming you're a 4-H person or whatever.
4310000	4315000	And the graphics do look really good. I'll say that then maybe this is going to be a game that's like right up your alley.
4315000	4321000	But like I don't really understand like what's what's the competitive side of this.
4321000	4326000	Even a slow dry game something like civilization or something.
4326000	4331000	You know I kind of I get that at least there's like a competitive edge or something like that.
4331000	4333000	No but they're going to do something.
4333000	4342000	But anyways they're saying they're going to hold 10 different events that says each event will allow teams and players to earn circuit points and win prizes.
4342000	4350000	And they said once the season has concluded the teams with the most points are earn will gather at Farm Con 2020.
4350000	4355000	Apparently they have Farm Con and to crown the farming simulator champion.
4355000	4359000	The winner will take home one hundred and ten thousand dollars in prizes.
4359000	4368000	Apparently they're going to time these events around major gaming events like Gamescom and Paris Game Week.
4368000	4371000	I guess they've sort of kind of dipped their toes in the water with this.
4371000	4379000	They've done some competitive farming simulator stuff with the farming simulator championship series.
4379000	4384000	But I'm trying to see what they what the actual events are.
4384000	4388000	Let me let me while you're looking at that let me get some comments in our chat over at VOG Network on Twitch.
4388000	4397000	Questbuster says I saw a good response to the same question on a forum that the actual management of things in the game actually requires quite a bit of skill to handle well.
4397000	4400000	To keep your farm successful. It's like Starcraft but with farms I guess.
4400000	4404000	I mean I'm just saying the footage didn't convey that but OK.
4404000	4410000	I mean no I mean there's there's management to it that you know it's probably interesting for folks that are like super into that.
4410000	4412000	So cool.
4412000	4416000	And Act F says very plainly I don't get World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 either.
4416000	4418000	I'm going for my jugular but I get it.
4418000	4421000	Those games aren't for everybody either but it's something that entertains people right.
4421000	4426000	This game might not be fun for me but it might be fun for you so you should go have a blast with it.
4426000	4430000	Yeah. So I'm not really sure what else they've got there.
4430000	4436000	It says they have a you know operate the competitive events and different agriculture related events.
4436000	4441000	They really say like I don't know if they like doing specific what the challenges are.
4441000	4445000	Oh shit they have like an actual like yeah like a whole whole controller.
4445000	4447000	Yeah that's like a awesome controller.
4447000	4455000	It looks like like the that mech game that you'll be telling less steel with telling them more like a lot of stuff.
4455000	4457000	I don't know. Anyway.
4457000	4460000	Looks like the Microsoft racing controller there.
4460000	4464000	Frodo swaggin's in our chat says this game is way too buggy to be an e-sports game.
4464000	4469000	A lot of the simulator games sometimes it doesn't plan for what needs to be simulated I guess.
4469000	4472000	I don't know. I check it out.
4472000	4475000	Bond's double assist at six acts asks again.
4475000	4478000	So the contest purse is how much. It was one hundred thousand dollars.
4478000	4484000	Well yeah they said two different amounts here so they apparently they're going to do this.
4484000	4491000	This tournament that's going to have 10 different tournaments across Europe and that has up to two hundred eighty thousand dollars in prize money.
4491000	4499000	And then there is this thing that they're going to have this farmer farming simulator champion that's going to take one hundred ten thousand dollars in prizes.
4499000	4507000	So I'm guessing that throughout the whole tournament they're going to have you know various prizes in the grand prize at the end is one hundred ten thousand dollars.
4507000	4514000	So throughout the rest of it you have one hundred seventy thousand that you can earn with all the other minor tournaments.
4514000	4515000	I guess.
4515000	4518000	And how much can I win from playing a DDR tournament.
4518000	4519000	I don't know.
4519000	4522000	Eighty percent of the pot and a free pizza.
4522000	4525000	Sadly I don't think we're at that same level just yet just yet.
4525000	4530000	Yeah I think there was just a world championships they probably did offer a slightly bigger prize.
4530000	4538000	Well funny to me this is being the only sport we ever like super got into this is being put up by the developer the publisher so Konami.
4538000	4540000	Where's where's the money.
4540000	4547000	Something about like they had to do like a thing across the street from the actual event to actually get like more people to participate or something like I don't.
4547000	4548000	It just sounds like Konami.
4548000	4549000	Yeah.
4549000	4550000	Konami is a mess.
4550000	4552000	What else is new.
4552000	4562000	Anyway maybe I shouldn't you go play all of your you know your cabinets out there and maybe save some of that money for prize pools.
4562000	4569000	All right well moving on to another game that people are talking or game series I should say that people are talking about this week Resident Evil.
4569000	4575000	Lots of people talking about the Resident Evil 2 remaster because I know that just recently came out so I think some folks have been playing it.
4575000	4581000	I passed on it because I like the old Resident Evil games but I don't I don't know if I really want it because they're with the V.
4581000	4583000	I don't know this new one support VR.
4583000	4586000	I know seven had the VR and I was like nope.
4586000	4588000	It was too much too scary too scary.
4588000	4589000	I can't.
4589000	4599000	Anyway but I know Resident Evil isn't only a successful game franchise but it's a successful movie franchise although the movie franchise like kind of wrapped up right.
4599000	4604000	They said they made the last one but we all know there's going to be a reboot in the future or things like that.
4604000	4613000	But there may also be something else as well because Deadline another one of those industry magazines reported this week Resident Evil TV series is in the works at Netflix.
4613000	4616000	Because Netflix is making so many shows these days.
4616000	4617000	Why not.
4617000	4620000	They've had some success from video game based things like Castlevania.
4620000	4622000	We know they're doing a thing on Witcher.
4622000	4625000	So although Witcher technically a book too but anyway.
4625000	4629000	No no reason why Resident Evil doesn't head to Netflix.
4629000	4632000	So that's the report coming out this week wasn't.
4632000	4633000	I can't.
4633000	4634000	No that was a rumor.
4634000	4636000	The Zelda thing was a rumor.
4636000	4637000	The thing was a rumor.
4637000	4640000	We never really got anything as ingress anime.
4640000	4641000	That's a game.
4641000	4642000	That's that's Netflix.
4642000	4645000	Netflix paid for rights for that which by the way it's still not out.
4645000	4647000	It's supposed to be out last year.
4647000	4650000	But Netflix just bought like distribution rights to that anyway.
4650000	4655000	Who's making the Resident Evil Netflix show German production and distribution company.
4656000	4657000	Konstantin film.
4657000	4661000	They were behind the Resident Evil movies that were kind of based on the games.
4661000	4663000	They had some characters in common.
4663000	4664000	They had zombies.
4664000	4665000	They did.
4665000	4666000	It was zombies.
4666000	4668000	And there was characters the same names.
4668000	4670000	And that's about it.
4670000	4679000	No show runner yet but the deadline report says that they think the plan is for the series to expand the Resident Evil universe and deepen the existing mythology.
4679000	4683000	The series will keep the basic premise which served as a setup for the movie franchise.
4683000	4689000	The drama series will explore the darker inner workings of Umbrella Corporation and what happens when the T virus breaks out.
4689000	4691000	It's in early stages.
4691000	4694000	Apparently there's action sequences Easter eggs all being planned.
4694000	4697000	We don't know when but give us some of that walking dead money.
4697000	4698000	Not too surprised.
4698000	4707000	I mean the Resident Evil films are kind of you know I know a lot of horror movie buffs because the stuff I work with with the cult movies the Rocky Horror and everything.
4707000	4711000	I know people that and Resident Evil like that whole series is kind of like a cult thing.
4711000	4717000	Like some people here locally made like a whole fan film about Resident Evil that I always see promoted around here.
4717000	4722000	So it's just you know it has its fans and I'm sure people will be very excited about a Netflix series.
4722000	4724000	You know going back to the ingress anime.
4724000	4725000	Oh boy.
4725000	4726000	All right.
4726000	4733000	I would love if the ingress anime was actually about people playing ingress sitting in your car.
4733000	4735000	What are you doing.
4735000	4737000	That little 70 year old girl.
4737000	4739000	My portal right now.
4739000	4741000	I'll show her.
4741000	4743000	I'm Logan.
4743000	4744000	All right.
4744000	4745000	Anyway let's see.
4745000	4749000	Metal mayhem in chat says the Resident Evil movies weren't good movies based on video games.
4749000	4750000	Good action movies.
4750000	4751000	Maybe.
4751000	4752000	Let's see.
4752000	4756000	S.J. 100 Matt says it's five years too late for the walking dead money.
4756000	4758000	Well maybe they want something to come take its place.
4758000	4759000	I don't know.
4759000	4760000	There's always going to be zombie fans.
4760000	4762000	Zombie movies have been around forever.
4762000	4765000	You know in horror movies gore movies people are just always into that.
4765000	4766000	That's the thing.
4766000	4771000	So I wouldn't say that just because The Walking Dead is kind of less like people seem to care about it less now.
4771000	4773000	Like it kind of peaked a while ago.
4773000	4776000	Like I wouldn't say that that means that Resident Evil can't be successful.
4776000	4779000	I'm sure if it's a good show it's a good show.
4779000	4783000	Netflix had a lot of good shows like everybody.
4783000	4786000	I still haven't watched it myself but everybody's talking about that haunting of Hill House.
4786000	4788000	It's like a phenomenal series.
4788000	4792000	It was a movie in the 90s that was kind of a right.
4792000	4794000	That was House on Haunted Hill.
4794000	4799000	No they did they did they did that and they did the haunting which was the same thing.
4799000	4801000	They came out like the same year.
4801000	4806000	There were two movies except one had Jeffrey Rush the other had Liam Neeson.
4806000	4814000	I'm telling you there were two haunting move to haunted house movies and the one with Liam Neeson is the one that's being adapted in this TV series.
4814000	4821000	Because the one that I remember from the 90s was the one it was the remake of the old Vincent Price movie.
4821000	4823000	Yes that was the Jeffrey Rush one.
4823000	4825000	Oh yeah that was going to.
4825000	4827000	Yeah anyway but they're both kind of.
4827000	4831000	But anyway the point is that Netflix series is apparently very good.
4831000	4837000	Sabrina the Teenage Witch cheesy ABC TV comedy show and Melissa Joan Hart although I did love it.
4837000	4843000	I really did love the Sabrina series but you know totally different direction Riverdale style direction for Netflix and apparently it's really good too.
4843000	4846000	Like Netflix has had a lot of like really good shows.
4846000	4848000	So anyway.
4848000	4849000	All right.
4849000	4860000	I think I think we should maybe focus a little less on the now and maybe go back to some classics with the classic game of the week.
4860000	4869000	And so we take a look behind the door that says do not open and we find a journey through space and time where we're joined by the one and only dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
4869000	4871000	Hi Jamie.
4871000	4873000	Hi we have a loading screen when you open my door.
4873000	4877000	Is it a blue screen of death or an orange screen of death if you will.
4877000	4880000	No it's a loading screen that shows someone going up a ladder.
4880000	4881000	I see.
4881000	4888000	All right well you're actually joining us I know on a work break tonight and joining us with not a whole lot of time to spare.
4888000	4891000	But the show just wouldn't be the same without your presence.
4891000	4893000	Excited to have you back in a month.
4893000	4895000	Well thank you for having me.
4895000	4896000	Well let's get to it.
4896000	4898000	The classic game of the week.
4898000	4901000	So I know you picked something a little timely this week.
4901000	4902000	So tell us about it.
4902000	4904000	The classic game of the week.
4904000	4908000	Well I picked Resident Evil 2 for our classic game of the week.
4908000	4909000	Well you can't do that.
4909000	4911000	That just came out.
4911000	4914000	No I'm picking the original silly beans.
4914000	4915000	Oh OK.
4915000	4917000	That works.
4917000	4918000	Yeah.
4918000	4924000	The original original original version came out actually in North America before it came out in Japan.
4924000	4927000	Of course over there it was biohazard 2.
4927000	4932000	It came out January 21st 1998.
4932000	4935000	So almost a full anniversary.
4935000	4941000	Which the funny thing is that of course I think that was also the release date for no.
4941000	4945000	But yesterday was the release date so it was a little bit later than that then.
4945000	4950000	But at any rate it was produced by Capcom.
4950000	4952000	And it's survival horror.
4952000	4961000	And you play as Leon or Claire who are trying to escape Braxton City after all the zombies have taken over.
4961000	4965000	The big thing with this one that made it different over the original.
4965000	4971000	The first game is that while it does focus on exploration and puzzles and combat.
4971000	4975000	It has different branching paths for each player character.
4975000	4976000	Different obstacles.
4976000	4979000	So it's a different story for each play through.
4979000	4983000	There was now this one was kind of the interesting one.
4983000	4988000	There is a and I've seen the full beta watch actually a full play through.
4988000	4993000	Is that there was what was called Resident Evil 1.5.
4993000	5000000	And it had a lot of stuff in common but instead of Claire it had another another lady in it.
5000000	5004000	And gosh now I.
5005000	5008000	Most of the time remember her name I don't remember her right now.
5008000	5009000	But it started with NC.
5009000	5011000	I'll have to look her up again.
5011000	5013000	But at any rate she eventually became Claire.
5013000	5021000	Although in the new game right now her outfit is one of the unlockable outfits for Claire.
5023000	5024000	So it's pretty funny.
5024000	5028000	I'm sure everybody in the chat room is yelling out the name right now.
5028000	5030000	But it doesn't work when we walk through the door.
5030000	5031000	I'm sorry guys.
5032000	5035000	And I'm at work right now and I kind of don't care.
5035000	5039000	I don't care to look it up.
5039000	5044000	At any rate it has been on so many different systems.
5044000	5048000	We had the PlayStation.
5048000	5055000	We had a second version which was the DualShock version that came out later in the same year.
5055000	5057000	It had a Windows version.
5057000	5060000	It had a Nintendo 64 version.
5060000	5062000	Nintendo was a Dreamcast version.
5062000	5064000	And a GameCube version.
5064000	5068000	So it is considered.
5068000	5070000	I mean it goes back and forth.
5070000	5074000	Some people consider this better than the original.
5074000	5076000	Than the first game.
5076000	5078000	And then some people say the first game was better.
5078000	5080000	It has had better voice acting.
5080000	5081000	I'll give you that.
5081000	5085000	But at any rate it has had so many other ports.
5086000	5091000	There was even a modified 2.5D version for the Gamecom.
5091000	5093000	And guess who had that version?
5093000	5095000	That would be me.
5095000	5097000	Nerd.
5097000	5099000	Well I don't know if I still have it.
5099000	5100000	It's somewhere in there.
5100000	5102000	And of course there was the sequel, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis.
5102000	5105000	Which was, as I call it, the Jill game.
5105000	5111000	And of course we just got the remaster which is pretty freaking amazing.
5112000	5115000	But moving forward, since it is a survival horror game.
5115000	5118000	You basically have to solve puzzles.
5118000	5121000	You get guns with ammo.
5121000	5125000	So you have to be very strategic with how you use it.
5125000	5130000	You can also have your life that you can check on.
5130000	5134000	And you can smoke the green herb to refill your life.
5134000	5136000	I'm sorry, eat it.
5136000	5143000	Or what Dan and I do is that there's the one where he mixes certain colors with brown things.
5143000	5145000	We call it the brown pile.
5145000	5147000	Wow.
5147000	5149000	And you get first aid sprays and stuff.
5149000	5151000	Yeah, we call it the brown pile.
5151000	5160000	And so you have, you know, your health reflects in the posture and movement speed of your character.
5160000	5164000	So if they're wounded they'll hold their stomach and limp a little bit.
5164000	5167000	But if they're near death they're just going to drag.
5167000	5172000	So they also have a limited number of items that you can store in different places.
5172000	5177000	You can, I think it was only Claire before that got the hit pack.
5177000	5185000	But now you can actually, well at least as far as we've found so far, you can get two hit packs in the current game.
5185000	5187000	So that's pretty good.
5187000	5190000	You also save your game using a typewriter.
5190000	5195000	But in the original one you had ink ribbons that you had to collect to be able to save your game.
5195000	5198000	Whereas this one is just save, save, save as much as you want, thank God.
5198000	5200000	Because it's hard.
5200000	5203000	Even in the easy version it's actually kind of hard.
5203000	5213000	But anyway, the game had real time models that, you know, your characters would move around.
5213000	5216000	But the backgrounds were all pre-rendered.
5216000	5223000	And it used kind of like a tank control, so meaning you used one to move and another one to rotate.
5223000	5227000	And then you had the zapping system.
5227000	5233000	So where you have the two different puzzles and storylines for the characters.
5233000	5241000	And if you finish scenario A with one protagonist, the B scenario has different things unlocked.
5242000	5249000	So like if one person did one thing in scenario A, then scenario B has to pick up from it or do two different things.
5249000	5254000	The original version of Resident Evil 2 had two scandal and mini-games.
5254000	5260000	One called The Fourth Survivor, where you play as an Umbrella Agent called Hunk.
5260000	5267000	Who also ended up being like a character in, was it Outbreak I think it was?
5267000	5269000	Like with his Delta Team and everything.
5269000	5270000	It was pretty neat.
5270000	5277000	And then you have the Tofu Survivor, where you play as a giant box tofu with a hat and a knife.
5277000	5279000	And the more damage he gets, the redder he gets.
5279000	5282000	And I think he can't heal either.
5282000	5290000	The Nintendo 64 version, actually no, all of the other versions except the Nintendo 64 version had a mini-game called Extreme Battle.
5290000	5294000	Which had four playable characters in three stages.
5294000	5296000	So it was pretty neat too.
5296000	5302000	Now, as far as I understand, the Fourth Survivor and the Tofu Survivor have made it into the new game.
5303000	5313000	So, the thing about the Tofu Survivor is that it was actually a placeholder character for working on the collision detection.
5313000	5315000	And they left it in as a playable.
5317000	5320000	I'm reminded of the killer Tofu song all of a sudden.
5320000	5331000	Well, at any rate, two months after, basically this game is set two months after the original Resident Evil 2.
5331000	5334000	Which is really great because the remake is also still set in the 90s.
5334000	5339000	So, and I'm not going to go into the story because if you don't know it by now, then whatever.
5339000	5345000	But let's go back into a little bit more though of the development.
5345000	5353000	So, Resident Evil 1.5 was basically, it was Elza, Elza is the name of the character.
5353000	5359000	Anyway, so this game was all laid out, it was mostly done.
5359000	5364000	You had different, you know, different characters in this one.
5364000	5367000	I like to consider it a gore if I like pre-release beta.
5367000	5372000	That some of the characters evolved into other people.
5372000	5378000	And then basically though, after certain things happened in the real world.
5378000	5385000	And you know, there were certain things that just did not mesh well with, not just the development team.
5385000	5390000	But with the powers that be at Capcom, they axed it and started all over.
5392000	5398000	So basically, that's how we get the current version that we see.
5399000	5409000	All the music was composed by Ueda Masami, Uchiyama Shisaku and Mishigaki Eshin.
5409000	5414000	And one track composed by Nusita Nalshi.
5414000	5421000	But it was all meant to be like mood music, you know, all kinds of horror themes, you know.
5421000	5427000	In the new game, by the way, if you get the deluxe edition, you can play with the original soundtrack, which is pretty cool.
5428000	5434000	But the music basically went between like the ambient music to kind of industrial music.
5434000	5436000	And you know, certain places were orchestral.
5436000	5440000	It just really was inspired by like real movies.
5440000	5447000	They actually did an orchestra album that was recorded by the New Japan Philharmonic.
5447000	5448000	So it's pretty cool.
5448000	5452000	There's also a remix album called Biohazard 2 Remix Metamorphosis.
5452000	5456000	But yeah, as I said earlier, there were all these different versions.
5457000	5464000	The PC port was a Windows 9x base, you know, so nothing really awesome.
5465000	5474000	Of course, Nusita 64 was going to have some pretty big limitations because the full motion video had to be super compressed.
5474000	5478000	And its port cost about a million to do.
5479000	5488000	They also added some different in-game information called the X-Files, like EX.
5488000	5491000	But they'll capital E, lowercase x.
5491000	5495000	They had different documents and different lore associated in the game.
5495000	5497000	And its resolution was of course different.
5498000	5502000	It did support the extension pack, which put it at 640x480.
5502000	5503000	Ooh.
5503000	5505000	It's just like Windows 3.1 back in the day.
5506000	5509000	They did spin a port for the Sega Saturn.
5509000	5512000	I actually do have the original Biohazard on Sega Saturn.
5513000	5516000	It got cancelled due to some weirdness.
5516000	5520000	Parking on the Saturn says the Saturn is kind of weird.
5520000	5526000	And then the games.com one only had Leon's story and removed a whole bunch of elements.
5526000	5533000	There was also, and this is the one I was talking about, there's an unfinished build of Resident Evil 1.5 that got leaked onto the internet.
5533000	5537000	And someone actually made it playable.
5537000	5539000	So there's full playthroughs now on the internet.
5539000	5551000	And then the game though in Italy was banned temporarily due to criticism from the civil rights movement over there.
5551000	5554000	Which re-looked at the depiction of a violent.
5555000	5566000	And also La Guardia di Sinangla, which is I guess a law enforcement agency in that part of Italy, seized 5500 unsold copies.
5566000	5571000	And then they lifted the ban after Sony requested a re-examination.
5571000	5575000	This was all a lot going on during multiple violence and video games.
5575000	5579000	You know, big stink that was being posed a lot of stuff.
5579000	5581000	Just being posed all over the place.
5581000	5586000	And you know, a lot of people found the story of course far-fetched but very compelling.
5586000	5589000	And a lot of people really liked that adapting system.
5589000	5593000	And of course its graphics at the time were pretty awesome for its day.
5593000	5609000	The only one that, you know, basically the subsequent versions that came out after the PlayStation except for the Nintendo 64 port didn't get rated as well as the original.
5609000	5617000	But now the Dreamcast one though was really, really lauded for its better sound development.
5617000	5627000	At any rate, you know, the game sold, gosh the advertising alone was $5 million in 1988.
5628000	5636000	And it broke like, gosh, like some records right at the start.
5636000	5645000	But the pre-orders itself in Italy were over $100,000 which came to about $6.6 million.
5645000	5648000	And it was the fastest selling video game in North America.
5648000	5655000	It sold in the weekend right after its release, it sold 380,000 copies and grossed $19 million.
5655000	5664000	And it surpassed the revenue of all but one Hollywood movie at the time and broke the sale record set by Final Fantasy 7 and Super Mario 64.
5664000	5668000	I wonder if the remake is going to get banned in Italy too.
5668000	5670000	Probably not.
5670000	5674000	Alright. Well I'm running out of footage so we've got to wrap up.
5674000	5675000	Okay.
5675000	5676000	But there it is.
5676000	5683000	At any rate, there were tie-in stories, there was an evil uprising and then the Dark Knight Chronicles and then one of the, I think, gun survivor games.
5683000	5684000	So there you go.
5684000	5689000	Alright, your classic game of the week but it's new all over again thanks to the remaster.
5689000	5691000	Resident Evil 2.
5691000	5693000	Hey, Jamie, we've got to get back to the show.
5693000	5694000	It's amazing.
5694000	5698000	But before we get back to the show, quickly, your thoughts on the remaster because I doubt Loki's played it.
5698000	5699000	I haven't played it.
5699000	5702000	So what are your thoughts on the remaster because I know you've been playing that this week.
5702000	5710000	We started off with the Claire scenario and honestly I find the voice acting is amazing.
5710000	5713000	And you know how picky I am on voice acting.
5713000	5720000	The voice acting is very good instead of, you know, having space between one person and saying something, it actually sounds like a real conversation.
5720000	5724000	Some people were talking about the face models.
5724000	5726000	I thought the face models were excellent.
5726000	5735000	And one thing that I, you know, I've kind of looked at this after the whole sync with Mouse Effect Andromeda is I've been looking at the characters eyes.
5735000	5738000	And the eyes have fantastic reflections.
5738000	5740000	They meet their tone.
5740000	5747000	And there's even, well, I'm going to spoil it because, you know, there's that character, Marvin, who was the cop that you meet up in the thing.
5747000	5754000	They actually showed his skin getting ashier and ashier as the game progresses, as he's, you know, dying.
5754000	5759000	They show like a realistic look of somebody bleeding out.
5759000	5763000	The head explosions and the people getting torn apart.
5763000	5767000	Okay, I know this is gross, but it's anatomically right.
5768000	5774000	Well, I'm serious. Like, Dan magnums somebody in the back of the head because we're taking turns with it.
5774000	5777000	And you can actually see the ocular cavity in their skull. It was pretty amazing.
5777000	5780000	No, thanks. I'll be passing on that. But hey, for you gore fans.
5780000	5783000	Girl, it's not that bad. It's not that bad.
5783000	5785000	You only have a few sections.
5785000	5794000	But one of the little tiny, tiny things is that they put nods back to the old game, like they had misspelled welcome, like with two L's for Leon's welcome thing.
5794000	5801000	So there's a big banner hanging over this. Has it spelled right that there's a gap between the L and the C, and you can find an extra L on the ground.
5801000	5808000	And then they have references to characters from other games like Rita, What's-Her-Face from Outbreak.
5808000	5813000	It's actually really well done, and her Easter eggs tie in the lore so amazingly well.
5813000	5814000	All right.
5814000	5816000	You even have tied zombies.
5816000	5819000	All right. Well, we're running long. We got to get back to the live show.
5819000	5825000	But any final thoughts from you, DarkSakura, before we bid you adieu for this week?
5825000	5828000	I can't wait to have my Sundays off again, really.
5834000	5842000	We can't wait to have her back. So there's DarkSakura joining us earlier today with the classic game of the week.
5843000	5848000	We're back here live in our studio with episode number 761 of our show already in progress.
5848000	5853000	And I guess I guess now I'm figuring out why there's less and less people, I guess, tuning in tonight.
5853000	5855000	I guess there's a big wrestling thing going on right now.
5855000	5856000	Oh, yeah. Royal Rumble.
5856000	5862000	Yeah, because Bobby was looking at the he likes to kind of see like, oh, how are we doing on Twitch right now with the against like other channels and stuff?
5862000	5869000	And he said, oh, there's a bunch of people, I guess, that will like watch wrestling and comment on it, like the kind of like watch parties or whatever.
5869000	5874000	They're not showing it. They're just like it's like come here and we'll kind of watch together sort of thing.
5874000	5876000	So kind of kind of interesting, I guess.
5876000	5881000	We'll talk a little bit more about that Twitch community feeling in an upcoming story a little bit later on.
5881000	5887000	Some quick, quick housekeeping with VOG Network before we get back into some news, including some rapid fire news.
5887000	5891000	But I did want to point out here, there's some big changes with VOG.
5891000	5894000	Some of the like old stuff into some of the new stuff.
5894000	5897000	And I mentioned earlier the radio feed is going to be sunsetting.
5897000	5901000	It's no longer going to be there, probably by the time a lot of you guys hear this in our podcast feed.
5901000	5904000	But obviously we had many wonderful years there via shoutcast.
5904000	5910000	So thanks to all of you that supported through the radio and will continue to do so through the video and Twitch TV.
5910000	5912000	And of course, the podcast that have always been there.
5912000	5915000	So many of our shows have been around a long, long time.
5915000	5917000	And so available through the podcast feeds.
5917000	5920000	Also, one other thing that's going to be going away very soon.
5920000	5926000	This could be the last week where you can actually check in to Orange Lounge Radio and participate with the gamification with VOG Network dot com.
5926000	5930000	The reality of the situation is more people were kind of into it in 2012.
5930000	5931000	It's kind of a newer thing.
5931000	5938000	And, you know, when four square was bigger and more people were using that, it was kind of like a little bit about where the idea was kind of inspired by of sorts.
5938000	5940000	But just less and less people doing that now.
5940000	5945000	We just kind of want to focus our resources on getting more eyeballs on Twitch and what we're doing over here and all that fun stuff.
5945000	5955000	So unfortunately, the gamification is going to be going away a little bit, which hopefully will, you know, just kind of allow the resources to go to recruit more help here to get some more original VOG programming and things of that sort.
5956000	5959000	So. All right. Let's move on.
5959000	5963000	Let's get in to get into some more gaming news, including some rapid fire news.
5963000	5972000	Loki. Yes. So, um, Minecraft is getting an update soon and they're adding composting.
5972000	5979000	So you actually be able to take some of your unwanted crops now and be able to turn it back into bone meal to help build crops.
5979000	5989000	Although from what I read so far that while it's nice that they have those there, it doesn't seem to be a very good source of getting bone meal.
5989000	5993000	It's almost easier just to wait for, you know, skeletons to just die.
5993000	6000000	But it is an option. And also people are using them to kind of look they look a little bit like beehives.
6000000	6006000	So, you know, people have set them up to look like mock beehives, I guess, for their farms.
6006000	6012000	But yeah, it is something that they're working on right now. So that should be coming soon.
6012000	6017000	One of my friends started those Minecraft realm servers and I keep meaning to like get in there.
6017000	6022000	But I I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do it. He said he invited me and I went to Minecraft.
6022000	6025000	I don't see it. So I have to figure it out. I don't know. Yeah.
6025000	6029000	We'll have to figure that out for us, too. Yeah. Or even just running.
6029000	6034000	Maybe just ran the PC version again. But now the console version will be better.
6034000	6038000	We'll do that. I like the Windows 10 version. That's what I play mostly. Yeah.
6038000	6045000	Yeah. And then, of course, you know, even though the movie's not yet out and I have high hopes for it,
6045000	6050000	Detective Pikachu is already going to be getting a sequel. So that's pretty awesome.
6050000	6058000	Apparently, they said they have hired, I guess with Oren Ziel,
6058000	6064000	who has written for such movies as 22 Jump Street, The Clover Paradise.
6064000	6070000	Let's not talk about Cloverfield anymore. The Cloverfield Paradox. OK, so he has one good movie attached to it.
6070000	6077000	And he's also writing for the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie and the upcoming moral comic.
6077000	6082000	They're doing another moral comic film. Yeah, supposed to be doing like a reboot.
6082000	6089000	Well, 22 Jump Street is good, I guess. But he's going to be right. It's not 21 Jump Street.
6089000	6094000	It's 22 Jump Street. The second one was funny. Both of the movies were great, actually.
6094000	6102000	And I'm disappointed that they were supposed to be doing a crossover between 21 Jump Street and Men in Black.
6102000	6110000	That would have been fucking hilarious. But they didn't do it because they don't have the balls to pull something that awesome off.
6110000	6116000	So we'll get Men in Black International instead and whatever. I want to see this Detective Pikachu.
6116000	6123000	I got to admit, I like good. I like the take they're taking with putting Pokemon in the real world instead of it being super cartoony.
6123000	6129000	I'm curious. I'm down to see the movie. I think a lot of that curiosity is why they're already greenlighting a sequel.
6129000	6135000	I think they see what the buzz is and that there's a lot of people that are approaching these trailers with cautious optimism
6135000	6140000	and are probably, you know, re sharing re sharing the trailers and stuff. You're laughing. No, no, no, no, no.
6140000	6148000	I'm not laughing about this. OK. I'm just thinking to myself, I really want the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer.
6148000	6155000	I need that trailer. I need to see what we're dealing with here. And I'm you love to carry.
6155000	6162000	I love Jim Carrey. And if Sonic is like. Twitter Sonic.
6162000	6167000	We may be in for a good. Yeah, a good movie, but I will see it anyways, no matter how it up.
6167000	6173000	And I just referenced it in our chat. There was a meetup between the the Twitter Sonic people and the movie Sonic people like met up.
6173000	6179000	But that means they didn't write the movie. Just just to be clear, I did go see Glass this week, which it was all right.
6179000	6186000	Yeah, I had watched like all the spoiler reviews and stuff like that beforehand and not a lot of people liked it.
6186000	6192000	And I see with their points, it was OK, but.
6192000	6198000	It's kind of like it's it's not the M. Night Shyamalan that made split and unbreakable.
6198000	6206000	It's M. Night Shyamalan that made the Happening and all of the other movies, but not as so not as terrible as that.
6206000	6211000	But it's just like. That's not really the way they are.
6211000	6214000	All right, well, Detective Pikachu looks great.
6214000	6221000	Looks like it might already be happening based on some of that positive spin. So let's see. Anyway, moving on to more rapid fire news.
6221000	6225000	Remember, I talked earlier about how the game's got to get the price cut before it goes free.
6225000	6228000	Yeah, ironically, Overwatch is getting a price cut this week.
6228000	6235000	Overwatch on PC is down to twenty dollars. So if you want to get the standard edition of Overwatch for PC, it's down to twenty dollars.
6235000	6239000	The original price was forty dollars, which I think was even probably a discount from there.
6239000	6244000	The legendary edition, if you want some more character skins and the crossover stuff is now forty dollars.
6244000	6249000	It was previously sixty dollars. So I'm not saying that like Overwatch is going free to play.
6249000	6253000	This is a very different story. Overwatch been out for like two years. It might.
6253000	6259000	I know that's a lot of buzz that always seems to come up is that, oh, Overwatch might go free to play, but it doesn't seem to be yet.
6259000	6266000	It seems to be they're still continuing to take the price down. I imagine the console versions will follow pretty shortly if they're not already there.
6266000	6270000	I think this is going to encourage more people to pick it up on a second system.
6270000	6277000	I think there's a lot of that happening because remember, Overwatch is not cross-play, nor do they seem interested in making it cross-play.
6277000	6282000	I think Blizzard kind of wants to keep the keyboard mouse people separate from the controller people.
6282000	6283000	I'm fine with that.
6283000	6289000	It would be nice if they would put the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 people together, but they just don't seem motivated to do it.
6289000	6295000	Well, they could do the Xbox One and PC people together because they would have, you know, the keyboard mouse support, you know.
6295000	6297000	Or just separate, you know, cross-play.
6297000	6301000	They're not going to do it. You're fanfic-ing. They're not going to do it. That's the reality.
6301000	6302000	I don't even care.
6302000	6305000	But it's only $20 if you want to get a different version of it.
6305000	6309000	But, you know, the console version's not changing, at least not yet.
6309000	6312000	But we don't know what the future might hold.
6312000	6316000	We do know what the future holds for the Epic Games stores and their free games giveaway.
6316000	6319000	They're giving away Jackbox Games, the very first one right now.
6319000	6320000	Oh yeah, I should have picked that up.
6320000	6322000	You can get that on PC. It's free.
6322000	6326000	The next game they're going to be giving out starting February 7th, Axiom Verge.
6326000	6329000	That's a pretty good title to be giving away for free.
6329000	6332000	That is a Super Metroid-esque kind of clone.
6332000	6339000	Obviously, they did some things different with different types of power-ups and things, but obviously very heavily inspired by Super Metroid.
6339000	6341000	Axiom Verge. Great soundtrack.
6341000	6343000	All done by one dude.
6343000	6345000	One dude did, like, the whole thing.
6345000	6347000	So it's a very, very great production.
6347000	6354000	So yeah, I mean, I already own it on PlayStation 4, but I'll probably pick it up again for PC. Why not?
6354000	6355000	It's free.
6355000	6356000	Exactly.
6356000	6359000	I think I have that on PC, actually.
6359000	6361000	You should double-check and check that out.
6361000	6364000	I don't know. I have a vast library of stuff I don't play.
6364000	6368000	Metal Mayhem asks, where is the Jackbox giveaway again?
6368000	6371000	It's in the Epic Games store, so I don't have a link because I'm trying to do a show.
6371000	6374000	Just go to the Epic Games store.
6374000	6377000	Epic Games dot com, and once you install the store, it'll be there.
6377000	6382000	And then, let's see, Dekeman says, just grab that on Switch. Great game.
6382000	6384000	I'm assuming that's Axiom Verge, not the Jackbox thing.
6384000	6386000	But they're both great, in my opinion.
6386000	6388000	Actually, both of them are on there, too, I think.
6388000	6390000	Both are on Switch, you're absolutely right.
6390000	6392000	So, yeah, Axiom Verge is cool.
6392000	6396000	If you are a Super Metroid fan, like I am, I think you'll get a big kick out of Axiom Verge.
6396000	6398000	I thought it was great.
6398000	6402000	Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6402000	6404000	And what's coming to a store near you?
6404000	6406000	I think I know the big one, right?
6406000	6408000	Well, let's start it off with Kingdom Hearts 3.
6408000	6411000	That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this week.
6411000	6415000	We have a game called Penguin Wars that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.
6415000	6419000	The Sinks and the Cursed Mummy on Nintendo Switch.
6419000	6422000	Dragon Marked for Death on Nintendo Switch.
6422000	6430000	Robotics Notes Dash and Robotics Notes Elite HD on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6430000	6435000	And Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown on PC.
6435000	6439000	And Wargroove on PC, Switch, and Xbox One.
6439000	6441000	Alright, traveling over to Japan.
6441000	6444000	Not coming out this week, Kingdom Hearts 3, because it's already out.
6444000	6448000	Came out on Friday. I actually have a buddy that imported it and has been playing it this weekend.
6448000	6451000	So, yeah, I guess it really happened, you guys.
6451000	6454000	Kingdom Hearts 3 really is releasing after all this time. It's pretty exciting.
6454000	6459000	But that already released in Japan, so that's why it's absent from the releases this week.
6459000	6463000	But what you do have on the release dates, you have Nelke and the Legendary Alchemist,
6463000	6468000	Ateliers of the New World, that's coming in a regular anniversary and premium box.
6468000	6472000	So there's a lot of different editions of that coming out from Koei Tecmo on the PlayStation 4.
6472000	6479000	Conception Plus, Oreno Kodomo Wu Undukure comes out this week from Spike Chunsoft.
6479000	6485000	And a collector's edition of Stardew Valley goes to retail for the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.
6485000	6492000	Also, Dragon Ball FighterZ Deluxe Edition is available on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6492000	6495000	Traveling over in Japan real quick to take a look at the Switch.
6495000	6498000	It looks like that same Nelke and the Legendary Alchemist is also available on the Switch.
6498000	6502000	As well as Robotics Notes Dash is available on the Switch as well.
6502000	6508000	Dragon's Marked for Death, Fate Xtella Link, that same Stardew Valley collector's edition.
6508000	6514000	And Opus Collection, which includes The Day We Found Earth and Rocket of Whispers.
6514000	6518000	That is all out. Oh, another duo edition on the Switch.
6518000	6522000	Child of Light Ultimate Edition with Valiant Hearts The Great War double pack.
6522000	6525000	So, busy week on both platforms.
6525000	6529000	I guess now that the Kingdom Hearts 3 release happened, everybody else can come to the party.
6529000	6533000	Filling in for the year updates, Loki, while Dark Soccer is still out.
6533000	6539000	I will do my best, because apparently certain sites don't know how to sort by date.
6539000	6542000	Yeah, she was really thrown by that last week, too. She was not happy.
6542000	6543000	So, we'll have to find a new...
6543000	6544000	Alright, so...
6544000	6547000	Where are you guys in Europe getting your release dates? Because we might need to follow suit.
6547000	6548000	So, anyways...
6548000	6554000	So, Ace Combat 7, Sky's Unknown collector's edition out on PC this week.
6554000	6557000	We've got... let's see...
6559000	6560000	Jesus Christ.
6560000	6564000	Christ Sings in the Cursed Mummy. That's on the Switch.
6564000	6568000	Kingdom Hearts 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6568000	6574000	We've also got Child of Light and a Valiant Heart double pack that's coming out on the Switch.
6574000	6580000	And Crash Dummy on the Switch and PlayStation 4.
6580000	6587000	Dragon's Dawn of the New Riders on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
6587000	6600000	And Song of Memories on PlayStation 4 and 8-Bit Hoards on PlayStation 4 as well.
6600000	6604000	And I think that may be it.
6604000	6605000	Alright.
6605000	6606000	Yeah, that is it.
6606000	6608000	Close enough. Alright.
6608000	6609000	Well, we're going to move on to the mailbag.
6609000	6613000	You guys email us over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com
6613000	6616000	and we read your emails here live on air.
6616000	6619000	So, I really appreciate you guys who take the time out to email us during the week.
6619000	6620000	Let's get to the emails.
6620000	6624000	First email tonight from Tom who emails us saying,
6624000	6626000	Hey all, congratulations on making the jump to Twitch.
6626000	6628000	All said, it looks to have been pretty successful.
6628000	6632000	I've been listening since the live 365 days and you've never failed to make me smile.
6632000	6636000	I've been wanting to give back in some way, so here's my OLR archive.
6636000	6642000	A super ugly, super simple webpage that lists every OLR MP3 I could find.
6642000	6645000	And I guess I'm okay to give out the link here because it's in our email.
6645000	6653000	https://olarchive.samurailink3.com
6653000	6656000	I've pulled all the episodes I could possibly find on the website,
6656000	6658000	Misty's archive, and a couple others.
6658000	6660000	If I'm missing anything, let me know. I'll get it added.
6660000	6663000	This does auto-update every week, so there's no maintenance to it.
6663000	6665000	Feel free to mirror, advertise, or link.
6665000	6666000	Very cool.
6666000	6667000	That's awesome.
6667000	6669000	I don't know where it's pulling those MP3s from.
6669000	6671000	Is it pulling from our own server?
6671000	6675000	If it's pulling from the SkyDrive archive that was up there previously,
6675000	6676000	or what all that pulls from.
6676000	6679000	I didn't look that deep into it, but that's still really cool.
6679000	6681000	This does remind me, though, to warn you guys.
6681000	6684000	This was something I really was supposed to take care of about six weeks ago,
6684000	6689000	but OLR is going to actually be switching hosts behind the scenes.
6689000	6691000	This should be a seamless thing.
6691000	6692000	You guys shouldn't notice.
6692000	6696000	It's just that the lovely space we've been donated for so long
6696000	6699000	can only sustain to be donated for so much longer.
6699000	6701000	So we're going to be moving it to a different space.
6701000	6703000	Probably something a little more like,
6703000	6705000	I'm not going to say it's going to be one of the big podcast hosts,
6705000	6708000	but likely one of the ones you're a little more familiar with,
6708000	6711000	which the good news is that's going to open it up to get it really easy
6711000	6713000	for us to get on things like Spotify and stuff like that.
6713000	6719000	But the downside is that because it will not be donated
6719000	6721000	and the space will not be limitless,
6721000	6725000	a lot of the old episodes are going to disappear.
6725000	6728000	So if you are linking to anything at orangeontrader.com right now
6728000	6733000	that is an old episode, I would urge you to grab it and save it elsewhere
6733000	6736000	because they will be going away in a few weeks.
6736000	6738000	Now, again, going to be seamless.
6738000	6741000	If you're just interested in the last ten episodes, the last five episodes,
6741000	6746000	you'll be fine because we'll copy those over when we go to the new solution.
6746000	6749000	But the vast archive that we have already on orangeontrader.com
6749000	6751000	will be going away.
6751000	6755000	So this email is actually very timely so I can kind of warn you about that.
6755000	6757000	Of course I would have still given you some warning,
6757000	6759000	but I do want to let you guys know it's coming.
6759000	6761000	I've referenced it a little bit on the show before.
6761000	6763000	Again, if you're listening to the pod, it's seamless.
6763000	6767000	My big thing is that I don't want to lose the people already subscribed
6767000	6769000	because that's a big deal.
6769000	6773000	We've been on iTunes a very long time since the day they launched podcasting.
6773000	6775000	So I don't want to lose the people we already have subscribed.
6775000	6779000	So we'll make sure that that all gets done seamlessly for you guys.
6779000	6786000	Anyhow, dgramaS says, Rob, tell that person to contact me.
6786000	6789000	I have a few hundred episodes.
6789000	6794000	So there you go, some OLR listeners networking together to listen to old OLR.
6794000	6799000	But I really do want to warn you, old OLR is very different from new OLR.
6799000	6802000	We've evolved a lot in 17 years.
6802000	6806000	So please do not judge the current state of Orange Launch Radio
6806000	6808000	based off of episode three.
6808000	6809000	Very different.
6809000	6813000	Anyway, Bobby says, oh, he's hosting each MP3 himself.
6813000	6815000	Wow, that's pretty cool.
6815000	6817000	Because I was going to say, there's actually more,
6817000	6819000	and Bobby might be interested in this too.
6819000	6827000	For other super nerd programmers like myself, Bobby, here's the API endpoint.
6827000	6831000	It will give you a JSON array of all episodes.
6831000	6834000	JSON, JSON, JSON array of all episodes.
6834000	6843000	So, https://api.olarchive.samurailink3.com.
6843000	6846000	So that same link, but with API dot in the front.
6846000	6849000	So have a ball with that.
6849000	6854000	Anyway, if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or hate mail, let me know.
6854000	6857000	We now return you to your regularly scheduled RuPaul coverage.
6857000	6859000	And that is from Tom.
6859000	6860000	I think it's awesome.
6860000	6862000	Well, we don't, because we have an email.
6862000	6865000	We are not covering Drag Race right now.
6865000	6867000	That's right. We have an email, so no Drag Race coverage this week,
6867000	6869000	which is a bummer, because there's a lot I could talk about.
6869000	6871000	But you'll just have to listen to Reading is Fundamental
6871000	6874000	with my buddies from gamebuoy.org and video game realness doing that.
6874000	6876000	So, anyway, thanks.
6876000	6878000	That's cool.
6878000	6880000	Yeah, I endorse it.
6880000	6881000	Why not?
6881000	6883000	Again, the footnote.
6883000	6887000	Old OLR is for you hardcore nerdy fans of the show,
6887000	6889000	which I love you and I appreciate you.
6889000	6891000	It's for you guys only.
6891000	6895000	I don't want new people to like, hmm, what's this Orange Launch Radio show about?
6895000	6897000	I've always heard of this, so they go and they don't download episode four.
6897000	6900000	Like, what the hell is this?
6900000	6901000	It's old.
6901000	6904000	It's very different. Very different.
6904000	6907000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
6907000	6910000	Let's talk about an email from YYR.
6910000	6913000	Hello, LR. I wanted to take a moment to clarify something
6913000	6915000	about the impending closure of the We Shop channel.
6915000	6919000	Tuesday, January 29th is the last day that you can purchase content
6919000	6922000	from the We Shop channel using Wii points you already possess.
6922000	6925000	So, time is running out. You better get on that.
6925000	6927000	You got until Tuesday.
6927000	6929000	Beginning Wednesday, you will no longer be able to buy
6929000	6931000	Virtual Console or WiiWare titles,
6931000	6935000	and any remaining Wii points you have will be forfeited.
6935000	6938000	It will be reinvested by Nintendo to make more money.
6938000	6942000	However, according to Nintendo's website, you will still be able to download,
6942000	6946000	re-download previously purchased software even after January 29th.
6947000	6950000	You will also still be able to use the Wii to Wii U transfer tool.
6950000	6953000	These services will be discontinued at a future date,
6953000	6955000	but that date has not yet been announced.
6955000	6959000	So, that's interesting because all the websites are kind of running with something else.
6959000	6963000	So, sorry.
6963000	6965000	So, interesting about that.
6965000	6967000	But, yeah.
6967000	6972000	I guess, though, I'm still okay with all the hysteria being out there about the closure
6972000	6977000	because I think a lot of people probably haven't checked their Wiis in some time,
6977000	6979000	but this sets them up for that.
6979000	6982000	You know, this sets them up to make sure you spend your points
6982000	6985000	so Nintendo doesn't just take your money for free
6985000	6987000	and make sure that, you know, you've bought everything.
6987000	6991000	And if you know the re-downloading ability is going away at some point,
6991000	6994000	you might as well just kind of have all that in order,
6994000	6996000	even if we don't know the exact day yet.
6996000	6999000	And I still think because it is scheduled to go away,
6999000	7002000	everything we said last week about the reality of digital and all that other stuff,
7002000	7004000	I think it still all holds.
7004000	7008000	And there are, I think, tools to still be able to download that stuff.
7008000	7010000	I think people have a lot of that backed up,
7010000	7013000	and you can still download it even if you don't.
7013000	7015000	But, you know, you should.
7015000	7017000	And why do you still have Wii points? Seriously.
7017000	7018000	I mean, like...
7018000	7019000	Spend them.
7019000	7021000	I don't even think they've sold those.
7021000	7024000	I need to just double check on my Wii U because I transferred it all.
7024000	7026000	I need to double check just to make sure.
7026000	7028000	I feel like I have, like, a 100-point balance.
7028000	7031000	I have one of those balances where I can't buy anything
7031000	7033000	because nothing is under 500 points, you know what I mean?
7033000	7034000	Yeah.
7034000	7036000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's where I'm at.
7036000	7038000	They got me.
7038000	7042000	They did the whole, like, what is it, 10 hot dogs in a pack but 12 buns?
7042000	7044000	That whole thing? They got me.
7044000	7045000	Anyway.
7045000	7046000	Yeah.
7046000	7047000	Moving on.
7047000	7049000	Oh, YYR finished up.
7049000	7052000	So don't worry yet about losing access to those NES games you bought 13 years ago.
7052000	7053000	Life goes on.
7053000	7055000	Well, I'm worried.
7055000	7056000	Anyway.
7056000	7059000	FrodoSwagons with our last email of the week saying,
7059000	7062000	So, I've heard a lot of hype about the new Kingdom Hearts game.
7062000	7065000	I have to admit, I have never played any of the games.
7065000	7068000	That being said, I don't really know a lot about them.
7068000	7070000	Can you explain what the games are all about?
7070000	7074000	I kind of need something new to play and I'm hoping this may potentially interest me.
7074000	7076000	And that's from FrodoSwagons.
7076000	7079000	Alright, y'all. Pull up a chair. We got a six-hour show tonight.
7079000	7081000	We're going to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
7081000	7088000	I honestly think that there used to be a YouTube channel that would do these wrap-ups of plot.
7088000	7092000	I don't know if they actually launched it or if I'm spoiling something.
7092000	7094000	I really hope I'm not.
7094000	7100000	But I know Captain Spike over at Game Buoy was supposed to be doing a Kingdom Hearts show at some point
7100000	7103000	that was going to kind of wrap it all up.
7103000	7107000	So, I mean, obviously I want to endorse the content that my friends are making.
7107000	7109000	So there is that.
7109000	7112000	But here's the thing. Look, obviously we're kind of joking.
7112000	7118000	We cannot possibly sum up the plot in even five minutes, let alone five hours.
7118000	7126000	I see that Eurogamer has a plot synopsis of the games that you need to know before you play Kingdom Hearts 3.
7126000	7128000	So you could try that.
7128000	7134000	I know there's other more entertaining channels that will do a plot summary of stuff.
7134000	7139000	Just do a quick YouTube search and you'll find several videos talking about the story.
7139000	7142000	Here's the thing. Let me actually approach the question a lot more simply
7142000	7145000	because he didn't say explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
7145000	7147000	He said, can you tell me what these games are all about?
7147000	7150000	Why are people getting excited about them? Here's the reason.
7150000	7157000	So when the Kingdom Hearts franchise first launched, it was Square Enix getting access to the Disney property.
7157000	7163000	The Disney games that we had until then, I mean, you'd have a couple good ones like DuckTales, right?
7163000	7166000	The epic game. Mickey Mousecapade was pretty cool on the NES as well.
7166000	7169000	So you'd get some kind of hit and miss when it came to Disney games.
7169000	7173000	But the thing that was special about Square Enix partnering up with Disney
7173000	7179000	is that you had a Square Enix RPG type of game but featuring Disney characters.
7179000	7181000	Now that's basically what Kingdom Hearts is.
7181000	7186000	Now it's not an RPG like Final Fantasy, although some elements are in that.
7186000	7190000	It's a little more real-time action-y. It's more of an action RPG.
7191000	7197000	It wasn't so much like Final Fantasy before, but now it's pretty similar to some of the Final Fantasy games
7197000	7199000	because those games are now real-time.
7199000	7202000	I would say mix it a little more with the gameplay of a game like Zelda.
7202000	7206000	You know how Zelda is more action-y and in the moment and has RPG elements?
7206000	7211000	That's kind of like mix Zelda with Final Fantasy and that's kind of like how Kingdom Hearts kind of plays.
7211000	7217000	And I encourage you to go there. Believe me, everybody under the sun is going to be streaming Kingdom Hearts 3 this week
7217000	7220000	because everybody's going to be like, I'm the first to stream Kingdom Hearts.
7220000	7223000	Everybody's going to be streaming Kingdom Hearts 3 on Tuesday.
7223000	7227000	I say everybody, but I can already see some people are going to be like, not me, not me.
7227000	7233000	That's fine. But when I say everybody, I mean a lot of your favorite streamers are going to be looking at it or checking it out.
7233000	7236000	So go check out some of the folks that are streaming it. It will give you a better sense.
7236000	7242000	But I think people get really excited about Kingdom Hearts because it is original Final Fantasy creators.
7242000	7250000	The main, excuse me, characters. The main characters in the game were like created by Square Enix kind of like for Disney.
7250000	7256000	So like Sora, Riku, those characters were made by Square Enix but kind of like for Disney specifically for this game.
7256000	7263000	But those characters basically travel to different worlds based on Disney franchises.
7263000	7268000	Which if I remember right, in the very first game, the very first place you go, once you get past like the town where they're all from
7268000	7274000	and you get to the central hub, the Traverse Town. I think the first one is Alice in Wonderland, if I remember right.
7274000	7277000	So you go to a whole world based on Alice in Wonderland.
7277000	7284000	And so you team up with, you don't team up with the Queen of Hearts, but you team up with either the White Rabbit or like one of the guards.
7284000	7290000	It's been a long time since I played you guys. But like those guys will actually join like a party and will play with you.
7290000	7296000	And like what you're trying to help bring order these different worlds and so forth and push back against the Heartless.
7296000	7299000	And now I'm getting into the story that could go on for hours and hours.
7299000	7304000	But this is why people love Kingdom Hearts because people really like Square Enix games, like Final Fantasy.
7304000	7307000	And by the way, the Final Fantasy characters show up in these games too.
7307000	7316000	So like when you go to this Traverse Town, like Aerith is there, Sephiroth is there, who is voiced by Lance Bass in the original Kingdom Hearts game.
7316000	7317000	That is a true statement.
7317000	7323000	Sora was voiced by Haley Joel Osment, who I think is still voicing him even for the third game, even though he's like full on adult now.
7323000	7328000	But when the first game came out, he was still kind of that kid that was in the sixth sense. You know what I mean?
7328000	7334000	So it's kind of interesting. But anyway, so it's like Final Fantasy worlds collide with Disney worlds.
7334000	7338000	And that's what get people very excited about it because there's a lot of Disney fans out there too.
7338000	7340000	I mean, look at the opening moments of tonight's show.
7340000	7343000	We geeked out for 10 minutes about Disneyland and Loki's trip there.
7343000	7347000	How much Kingdom Hearts content did you see at Disneyland?
7347000	7349000	None.
7349000	7350000	Isn't that unfortunate?
7350000	7354000	Well, I didn't look either. We spent very little time in shops.
7354000	7359000	I'm sure there was something, but I didn't go seeking it.
7359000	7361000	I didn't see any Tron stuff either. So, you know.
7361000	7367000	Yeah, that's unfortunate. Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is giving some input on this email as well.
7367000	7375000	There was an interesting video from I think GameSpot that actually talks about the history and how Nomura wanted to make a game like Super Mario 64.
7376000	7381000	Square said the only way you could get that over is if you had something recognizable like Disney characters.
7381000	7385000	Then it went into the stuff about how they pitched it to Disney and how Disney pushed back.
7385000	7389000	And Nomura was like, no, we'd make the game my way or we don't make it at all.
7389000	7393000	And Bobby says Sora is still Haley Joel Osment in a higher voice.
7393000	7398000	Dinkman says Leon, or Squall, is voiced by David Boreanaz, Angel.
7398000	7401000	If y'all are Buffy fans.
7402000	7403000	Let's see.
7403000	7407000	DarkTichyas says wasn't Kingdom Hearts the original elevator pitch since they were in the same office building?
7407000	7409000	Oh yeah, I think I've heard that story too.
7409000	7416000	Dinkman says they have a Kingdom Hearts version of Donald and Goofy they pull out on special occasions in different Disney parks.
7416000	7422000	One time I saw something Kingdom Hearts related at Disneyland. It was actually California Adventure.
7422000	7425000	And I'm still sad to this day. I couldn't afford that statue.
7425000	7428000	I would love a Kingdom Hearts movie series.
7429000	7432000	That would be just such a badass movie.
7432000	7436000	We know Disney will do crossover because that new Wreck-It Ralph movie had that scene with all the princesses.
7436000	7437000	It would be so fucking amazing.
7437000	7439000	I am so down for this.
7439000	7442000	Oh my god, a Netflix Kingdom Hearts show.
7442000	7445000	Except it would be on Netflix because Disney is launching their own Netflix.
7445000	7449000	So on the Disney service, Disney Go? Is that what they're called? I forget.
7449000	7451000	But anyway, that would be great.
7451000	7455000	Oh, Bobby Lockl says there was supposed to be a Kingdom Hearts TV show on Disney XD. It got tabled.
7456000	7459000	Well, bring it back for this new Disney Netflix competitor.
7459000	7462000	As if we need another thing to subscribe to.
7462000	7463000	Anyway.
7463000	7465000	Alright, let's move on. That was a good email.
7465000	7467000	Sometimes we gotta go back to the basics.
7467000	7472000	We have to remember too, I think it's very important to recognize that first Kingdom Hearts game was what, like 2001?
7472000	7479000	Like, some of our listeners, this is so weird to say, some of our listeners were probably like 5 years old when that first game came out.
7479000	7480000	And they're like 20 now.
7480000	7483000	And they're like, what was the big deal, you guys?
7483000	7492000	I think this is a big reason why in the past few years, Square Enix kind of did those HD re-releases of Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5.
7492000	7494000	Which kind of get people familiar with those again.
7494000	7495000	So, anyway.
7495000	7501000	Alright, let's move on. We do have some more stories to get out for you guys before we get to your calls via Discord.
7501000	7506000	If you're not already aware, last week we said goodbye to Skype and we said hello to Discord.
7506000	7511000	So if you want to call into the show tonight, you will have to be on our Discord at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7511000	7514000	I'll detail how that all works again in a little while.
7514000	7517000	Or you can refer to the pinned message in the OLR channel once you get there.
7517000	7520000	In the meantime, some more news stories for us. Loki.
7520000	7525000	Alright, so the GDC put out a survey to game developers.
7525000	7528000	And we got some interesting information.
7528000	7531000	So 4,000 game developers filled out the survey.
7531000	7537000	And it basically goes over different things, including working conditions, and uni-
7537000	7538000	Uni-
7538000	7539000	Uni-
7539000	7540000	Hi, I can't speak today.
7541000	7542000	Unionization.
7544000	7547000	So, let's go ahead and kind of run down some of the trends that we saw here.
7547000	7554000	So, first off, the survey came back with about 50% of the game developers actually wanting to unionize.
7554000	7556000	Which is pretty cool.
7556000	7564000	18% of the people that they had surveyed had also said that they were developing a game for a next gen console.
7564000	7570000	And that Steam is the dominant PC and Mac download platform.
7570000	7577000	But 59% of the people that they had responded to it, just like the 30% rev share.
7577000	7579000	Which makes sense.
7579000	7582000	Some other fun figures.
7582000	7587000	Nearly half of the game makers work over 40 hours a week.
7587000	7596000	Including, they said, 44% spent over 40 hours with about 3% averaging 60 hours a week.
7596000	7601000	The driving factor of that is mostly self pressure.
7601000	7607000	And wanting to work overtime just to get some of that stuff done.
7607000	7611000	And, let's see, other fun things.
7611000	7616000	Aside from Steam, some of the other storefronts that are high on the list here.
7616000	7619000	So Steam was the top with 47%.
7619000	7624000	Basically selling directly, so via your own websites, was 26%.
7624000	7631000	Followed by publisher owned Humble Store itch.io.
7631000	7633000	17, 18%.
7633000	7637000	Last being Discord and Cartridge. I've never heard of Cartridge.
7637000	7639000	That's something new.
7639000	7641000	Switch. Switch Cartridges.
7641000	7646000	No, Cartridge is a website with K. Not necessarily Switch Cartridge.
7646000	7653000	And, of course, they want, of course, a better portion of their profits.
7653000	7658000	As far as unionization, they think that 47% believe that they should unionize.
7658000	7661000	26% maybe. 16% no.
7661000	7667000	Whether they think that workers will actually unionize, 39% or maybe.
7667000	7670000	21% yes. 24% no.
7670000	7675000	Interesting. And this is all from GDC related organizations.
7675000	7677000	And GDC is coming up in March.
7677000	7679000	So I wonder if you'll be hearing more talks on this sort of thing.
7679000	7683000	And maybe there'll be unions there trying to tempt people to unionize.
7683000	7685000	Just something like that. Could be very interesting.
7685000	7692000	They're saying that the majority of the split right now in the game industry as far as developers is about 80-20 men to women.
7692000	7697000	They're saying that most of the devs are coming from Europe and North America.
7697000	7703000	That most of the people that responded have been making games for less than a decade.
7703000	7706000	So definitely I can see that with a lot of the trends.
7706000	7711000	A lot of those tools have become available more recently for free even.
7711000	7712000	Makes sense.
7712000	7714000	It makes it a lot easier to get into it now.
7714000	7717000	Let's see. What else?
7717000	7722000	As far as the company size that they're working for.
7722000	7724000	We'll just kind of go over this real quick.
7724000	7727000	So larger companies over 500. About 20 percent.
7727000	7730000	Also tied with that though is myself only.
7730000	7732000	So 20 percent working for themselves.
7732000	7734000	2-5. 15 percent.
7734000	7739000	And then kind of around that 100 person range. About 10 percent.
7739000	7740000	So, pretty neat.
7740000	7745000	Yeah. And the results are all what Loki's reading from is all available online if you want to check that out yourself.
7745000	7749000	Yeah. You can go to I think the GDC's website actually had the survey.
7749000	7753000	You can check out. They have like a brief little summary there.
7754000	7759000	Let's see. Yeah. It was at reg.gdcconf.com.
7759000	7761000	And then it's GDC's.
7761000	7762000	That's their registration site.
7762000	7764000	Yeah. So it's their red site.
7764000	7769000	Interesting. I'll be. I'm very curious to see where this talk about the unionization and everything kind of leads in the future.
7769000	7776000	You know that's not the first time that folks have talked about kind of coming together to unionize for you know some of these working conditions to be improved and so forth.
7776000	7781000	So I guess the only way it gets better is if everybody threatens to walk out if it doesn't.
7781000	7785000	But then there's a whole other flip side of that. Well we can replace you with somebody younger.
7785000	7789000	And so it's going to be an interesting battle to see what ends up happening there.
7789000	7796000	So I think I think in a way what's really happening is that I think especially as you talk about with those numbers with how big the studios are.
7796000	7805000	I think you have a lot of people that are just like I'm out. I can make my I must start my own studio with my buddies and they'll be four of us and we'll get the Marvel license and make a new card game.
7805000	7808000	Right. I think that's kind of in some ways.
7808000	7812000	I feel like that is where the why they're not going to unionize is going to happen.
7812000	7822000	It may be the case because you have a lot of people just get fed up quit go do their own thing and then they're perfectly happy doing it because the tools are out there to succeed as an independent person.
7822000	7827000	Look at look at Axiom Verge which we brought up earlier in the show. I was one dude.
7827000	7843000	You know another one last interesting thing so that half of the devs that responded said that the switch was the most interesting platform and of those went out for have had their game sell the best on the switch as a platform.
7843000	7853000	So that's pretty interesting. Yeah. All right. Well let's move on. I want to talk about something it's kind of a follow up to something we talked about last week because this is more late breaking news during our show last week.
7853000	7865000	And I don't know if you heard it all about this Loki but there was a twitch stream that was going on that was trying to raise some money for a gender dysphoria charity which is transgender issues.
7865000	7874000	Mermaids is the UK charity that was raising this money and what's and I still don't understand the how and maybe somebody in chat kind of knows how this happened.
7874000	7885000	But apparently what happened is that Congresswoman Alexia Ocasio excuse me Alexandria Ocasio Cortez AOC as people are calling her now ended up calling into this stream.
7885000	7897000	And then that kind of had the streamers like sort of floored and she was able to talk about you know why transgender rights are important and how we're still fighting for you know those those qualities and so forth but also kind of talking about
7897000	7907000	like her own political platforms and you know some things because she's very recently in Congress and you know I realize she's a very polarizing person and I'm not here to get into our politics right or not.
7907000	7919000	I'm just getting into isn't it fascinating that this is how she's communicating with people and I think is in a way and I must admit part of kind of what draws me to her is almost almost like she understands memes.
7919000	7924000	She knows to go on Twitch like I think very often times we feel very disconnected.
7924000	7947000	I think for Washington is like oh it's just a bunch of old fuddy duddies that don't know what they're like there are a lot of old funny there are still there's lots I mean like you watch just like you watch any of these like different congressional hearings that they have about like Facebook and stuff and where they're asking just like grandpa questions about stuff like you don't know how to fucking computer work stuff.
7947000	7952000	Well well it's like it's just it's embarrassing you're embarrassing yourself.
7952000	7962000	So I think when we talk about like you know where the Gen X and the millennials kind of feel a little distance from the boomers it's like it's to see that representation more I guess millennial in AOC's case representation.
7962000	7976000	You know in Congress is pretty exciting for a lot of people just because you know you hear she is going on Twitch streams to promote you know her politics and the things she's talking about and I I kind of look at that and again regardless of whether you agree with her politics or not.
7976000	7984000	It's kind of one of those things where it's like wow like we feel a connection to Washington D.C. in the gaming community.
7984000	7992000	Anyway Bobby Blackwell in our chat room says the way I understood it is that she tweeted about it someone working the stream and not on the air reached out to her and worked out how she could call in.
7992000	7999000	So it was a match made on Twitter. What another frickin like how many people in Washington would you see connecting via Twitter.
7999000	8003000	Maybe the president has done a lot of business dealing on Twitter.
8003000	8014000	It's hard to see these connecting with people. Let's see anyway. Deep man says she made a joke earlier about setting up a smash tournament in Congress. She's hip. Yes. How do you do fellow kids.
8014000	8023000	Anyway and then fifth dream says she made an all your base joke. And today she did the why not both thing. So she she's the meme Congress woman basically.
8023000	8035000	Anyway all that aside again I don't want to make this an AOC segment but my point is isn't that fascinating where like politics came to twitch and that's where we were kind of talking about last week.
8035000	8041000	We kind of got into the conversation where it's like dude if you all thought twitch was an underground thing that people didn't know about before.
8041000	8050000	Like it's getting bigger and bigger and this is you know going back to the very beginnings of the show talking about you know where television going is the future of broadcasting.
8050000	8056000	We're looking at it and what's kind of developing here very homegrown it's very very fascinating.
8056000	8066000	Anyway there was a very interesting article written over at Ars Technica that talked about the new online town square.
8066000	8075000	And so I'm kind of citing that Web site in their article specifically because I thought it was a very interesting perspective on why everybody was kind of talking about this whole thing.
8075000	8082000	And you know also I'm talking about you talked about how like a game like World of Warcraft is sometimes like an interactive chat room.
8082000	8088000	The simplistic gameplay is something to keep you occupied. But while you talk with friends you know that's how some people view it.
8088000	8094000	And then you know now Fortnite a lot of people view that as less of a game and more of a social network.
8094000	8099000	You know as you know more and more personalities are coming up around Fortnite and things like that.
8099000	8112000	So anyway they say in an excerpt from the article here a quote perhaps more than any other artistic medium games provide a handy latch point for that kind of casual secondary social interaction.
8112000	8119000	And so they go on to talk about you know Twitch and so forth where the game itself is secondary to the people that are playing it.
8119000	8124000	And then so lastly the article kind of sums up here.
8124000	8129000	When people ask me what Twitch is my default answer is that it's a place to watch people playing video games.
8129000	8131000	But that's really an incomplete answer.
8131000	8146000	These days Twitch is often just a place is just as often a place where watching video games serves as a convenient excuse to gather with like minded streamers and viewers in the closest thing we have to a live digital town square.
8146000	8151000	And I thought so shout out to Ars Technica and I believe that was Kyle Orland who wrote that article.
8151000	8155000	I thought that was a really neat perspective on the whole situation and very accurate.
8155000	8158000	You know we've talked about how like Orange Lounge Radio for you.
8158000	8163000	I don't want to be like we started the trend but you know I've tried to say it here at Orange Lounge Radio for years.
8163000	8175000	We've all said like oh this show started because it was like it was us all gathering at the dinner table after playing DDR we were at the diner talking about you know DDR the music games and other games we enjoyed and just sitting around.
8175000	8179000	Talking about video games and that's kind of what we wanted to bring to the Internet.
8179000	8187000	Well it turns out that's a lot of people are bringing to Twitch is this very virtual space to have these conversations and kind of kind of what we're doing now.
8187000	8195000	I'm pretty sure everything you guys are seeing here on the side with the headlines that are coming up and everything you guys probably are already somewhat in tune with this.
8195000	8196000	Maybe not everybody.
8196000	8201000	I know there's a few listeners out there that maybe follow games a little more casually so they hear about some things for the first time on here.
8202000	8206000	But I think there's plenty of you that already damn well know the gaming news.
8206000	8215000	You're here for the discussion and I think that's super awesome and why we want to be able to participate with our listeners so it's not just Loki barking you and me barking you and all that stuff.
8215000	8224000	It's you know us having a conversation and I think that's really cool and just so interesting about where the future of broadcasting and so forth might be headed.
8224000	8227000	So what do you did you did you hear about that.
8227000	8229000	The politician on Twitch and all that.
8229000	8234000	Yeah I remember reading a little bit about that I just didn't follow too closely but that's cool.
8234000	8240000	I mean I hope that helped out their stream with getting more coverage and maybe more donations.
8240000	8241000	Oh yeah sure.
8241000	8245000	I think the goal was like five hundred dollars and they ended up making like three hundred thousand.
8245000	8250000	Don't quote me on those numbers but it was like yeah the awareness because it wasn't just AOC that came on the stream.
8250000	8254000	They got like Jim Sterling a lot of like you know personalities and people to call into that too.
8254000	8258000	So whoever the PR person was that did that.
8258000	8274000	I mean that's that's a person that ought to be hired like an EA or something to manage the communication there because whoever like managed that charity stream that was you know only aiming for you know a minor amount.
8274000	8283000	All these I mean five hundred dollars is nothing to I'd love to raise that kind of money for an awesome charity but I mean just when that was the goal and they just shattered through the roof like that's that took some talent.
8283000	8286000	So props to the organizers quite frankly.
8286000	8292000	I'm looking at our chat over at Twitch at our own little town hall at a twitch TV slash vog network.
8292000	8299000	Fifth dream today is gives the tongue in cheek answer saying you go to my free cams and do the same thing with naked ladies.
8299000	8302000	Hey you know what.
8302000	8305000	We all worship at some kind of temple I suppose.
8305000	8308000	Anyway bonds double six says filthy casual here.
8308000	8309000	Hey there's nothing wrong with that.
8309000	8318000	That's why that's why I really don't like I don't like to talk down to the audience ever and I'm not perfect and I'm going to have my moments where I should have said something better.
8318000	8328000	But I really do try to approach things where it's like I want to assume that like we're not just like like we're not the first person to break this news to you but at the same time if you haven't heard before.
8328000	8334000	Here's kind of like our take on what's going on it's kind of like a interesting fine line you have to walk sometimes right.
8334000	8343000	Yeah so anyway let's see guys you know says the twitch thing is cool but at the same time you don't want outsiders knowing about our secret places.
8343000	8349000	Once they see the twitch models dancing on their streams they're going to say it's a porn site and try to attack it.
8349000	8359000	But I think that's just again that's like one small part that's like saying somebody met somebody on World of Warcraft and took them across the state line and killed them like that doesn't happen to everybody.
8359000	8367000	It's it's horrible and it shouldn't happen to anybody but just you know unfortunately these types of crappy incidents happen in place.
8367000	8371000	I guess I just compared porn to murder sorry see what I mean about choosing my words better.
8371000	8378000	But I mean you know what I mean like that is one small part that the the porny thing you know obviously you can't have full on porn on twitch.
8378000	8385000	But the you know the the boys and girls that are you know using a little more appeal to sell you know their stuff.
8385000	8389000	I think that's really one small part of what twitch is offering.
8389000	8396000	So anyway let's see other comments here.
8396000	8401000	Bobby Blackwell says I'd love to raise five hundred dollars for my favorite charity vog network LLC.
8401000	8405000	Hey we appreciate all the subscriptions and the bitty donations we really do.
8405000	8413000	We've been very very pleased with how many of you guys are actually subscribing to visit the video archives or just support the network financially with your.
8413000	8419000	You know a lot of you guys just using your twitch prime that you get anyway once a month on vog network and that's awesome.
8419000	8420000	Thank you thank you thank you.
8420000	8426000	We you know we appreciate it and we we promise to spend your money wisely and really appreciate you guys kicking that in.
8426000	8430000	But it's not mandatory it's never been mandatory and it's never going to be mandatory.
8430000	8434000	Fifth dream today also making the comparison that's like read it.
8434000	8440000	Some of it is a toxic hellhole but some of it can teach you some shit.
8440000	8443000	That's true that's true. All right anyway let's move on.
8443000	8450000	Let's go to another story here and we're going to hear from you guys and open it up to the town hall of discord a little later on.
8450000	8460000	But first Loki I sort of got you know what is this 2019 and still we have game developers setting up their games to have the physics run based on the frame rate.
8460000	8465000	Why why are we still doing this in 2019.
8465000	8472000	Apparently that's the situation though with Fortnite so Fortnite on the switch runs at 30 frames per second.
8472000	8482000	And apparently with that you know apparently your guns fire a little bit slower at 30 frames per second versus like the 60 frames per second that you get on PC.
8482000	8490000	So for example they took one of the guns and at 30 frames per second it took twenty seven point five two seconds to unload the whole clip.
8490000	8497000	But at 60 frames per second they got it to unload the clip in twenty six point zero eight seconds.
8497000	8504000	And of course you can actually increase that amount too with a higher frame rate if you have it unlocked.
8504000	8515000	So is that very bad when we've got this cross platform thing going on. It is bad but it's also it's so like you know I I'm assuming it's pretty much similar to other game engines.
8515000	8522000	But like I know with like Unity and stuff they have the time delta time stuff and I think that's part of just most programming languages.
8522000	8532000	And that allows you to you know have all of your physics or all of your timing run at a consistent frame rate or a consistent rate based regardless of frame rate.
8532000	8541000	Why you lock it to stupid frame rate is beyond me. I mean other than I don't know the reason why you would do that but.
8542000	8548000	Here we are you know still doing that crap. So I don't know if they're going to fix this stuff but at the.
8548000	8551000	Well I'm sure now that it's been pointed out very much.
8551000	8557000	Yeah they said that they're aware and they're working on fix but they haven't gone in taking details of what that's going to be.
8557000	8564000	But I don't know why they should even be pointed out in the first place it's done. But like you follow 76 to the same shit and even worse.
8564000	8567000	So just mentioned by a chatter 53 today in our chair.
8567000	8576000	So I mean along with that there is some good news though Fortnite is going to be changing the way that they do their loot boxes with this Fortnite save the world.
8576000	8582000	So what they're going to be doing now is instead of the loot boxes or loot llamas.
8582000	8589000	Basically they're going to players will be able to buy them and then open them to find out what they've received.
8589000	8594000	Apparently though the update the v bucks llamas are becoming x ray llamas.
8594000	8603000	And before buying these new x ray llamas you'll be able to see exactly what they're going to receive in the players don't like anything in the llama.
8603000	8607000	They can wait until the next day when the contents inside the llama will change.
8607000	8612000	That's a pretty clever way to get people to calm down about this a little bit. I kind of like that idea.
8612000	8616000	X ray llama x ray llama. Yeah I like that.
8616000	8625000	And then they're saying you know. So I guess I mean that's a neat idea I guess it's still going to be kind of random but you'll be able to see what you're getting.
8625000	8630000	But you know what random thing you're getting. Yeah you can save your v bucks or something. Yeah.
8630000	8636000	Adept in chat says isn't it still the same though it's random. Yes but it's very different when you know what random assortment you're getting up front.
8636000	8642000	So your purchase isn't random. That makes sense. Yeah. What's your what you ultimately the transaction does not end up being random.
8643000	8649000	There's no gambling involved. I mean you know what it is you're going to get. It's just what's generated that's random.
8649000	8660000	Right. And you can only it'll be different each day I guess. I don't know if you can purchase like more than one of these something and then it'll be different each time you'll have to play more for a night to find out.
8660000	8671000	I'm not spending money on this. I did. I don't think I talked about it in my game because I think it was a couple of weeks ago at this point but I know it was like last week I went into Fortnite just to like fuck around in there and I was actually playing like the little like level editor and build your own thing.
8671000	8680000	So it's kind of something I was doing messing around with on Fortnite trying to trying to get a little more of the creative mode as opposed to like shooting people in alpha because I'm not good.
8680000	8691000	I'm not good at that part. But anyway. All right. Let's see a deep man says it's also great for data mining exactly what the player base is looking for.
8691000	8699000	Very interesting. They can kind of weigh like what selling and what's not interesting because you can't do that with a traditional blue box.
8699000	8709000	Frodo swaggin says I wish Rocket League could do that. Well you know if it does very well for Fortnite I'm sure other studios are going to look at that and go I want to do an x ray loot box.
8709000	8720000	So we'll see. Anyway meanwhile hey remember PUBG. That was the game everybody was talking about before Fortnite and there's still there's still a lot of people playing player unknown battlegrounds.
8720000	8730000	I'm being a little silly but I think it's really cool like what PUBG is actually doing. So there's an Xbox one event going on with snow sunglasses and it's a scavenger hunt basically.
8730000	8739000	So I guess it's a new snow map in player unknown battle. Yeah. So if you are an Xbox one player playing on this map you're doing a scavenger hunt.
8739000	8749000	So like they're posting a picture like here. And if you respond with a picture of found the spot here it is you go here then the first person upload that screenshot gets a bonus item.
8749000	8764000	But you can only get that once the same person and get it every time. And there's actually some real life things you can win to a picnic mat a PUBG logo eco bag and a winner winner chicken leg dinner bag charm whatever that is neat.
8764000	8776000	Yeah I think it's I think it's cute. I like that. So I like when they kind of like blend the real world with games and have those kind of like I know they're not offering any of those grease proof controllers or anything anymore.
8777000	8785000	Not that I've seen but stay tuned. All right. All right. It's so nice to hear Rob at this from Bobby in our chat.
8785000	8793000	It's so nice to actually hear Rob say PUBG since he said a year ago that he'd never be able to say it and would always say PUBG.
8793000	8800000	I still think the name PUBG is cuter and if it was a game involving pugs would be like super duper cute.
8800000	8809000	Somebody posted on my Facebook wall and I think I feel like we talked about this game before but some like shooty game where the cat was the weapon and you would pet the cat to reload.
8809000	8824000	It's adorable. I didn't see that. Do you see that like post. So he posted on my Facebook wall. I just assume though the game where a modern cat and the cat reloaded I assumed it was that postal probably with the cat silencer.
8825000	8834000	Probably. Hopefully they give away some pugs and the x x ray. I don't see the Xbox pinata the x ray pinata. All right. Anyway let's move on.
8834000	8842000	We got I think one or two more stories and then we're going to get to discord. So you might want to start lining up in our discord room over in the green room.
8842000	8853000	I got to say though if like they had ran you know how they have all those blind bags and stuff at the stores if they offered them in pinata form that might be a little bit more appealing because at least you get to beat the crap out of it first to get you know the
8854000	8865000	stuff out. It would be fun. All right. So let's talk about sales numbers. So the 2018 MPD numbers are out and they have some more information to share about that.
8865000	8874000	So they saw I guess we saw three point four billion dollars spent on games hardware and accessories and game cards.
8874000	8892000	And apparently there was a overall growth of 13 percent over 2017. And then so for hardware Nintendo Switch sold the most in December and generating the highest dollar sales in the month.
8892000	8912000	And then of course along with that let's see video games hardware sales overall is up eight percent to five point one billion dollars and then software wise seven point one billion dollars across all platforms seven percent growth over the year as well.
8913000	8928000	And apparently the highest annual amount since 2012 the top games for 2018 Red Dead Redemption 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and NBA 2K 19.
8928000	8941000	Let's see software charts. So for December we had Smash Brothers Ultimate number one Red Dead Redemption 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 4 Battlefield 5.
8941000	8954000	Those are top four there that Mario Kart 8 at number six. Still that is a lot Mario Kart 8 at number six Super Mario Party Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Spider-Man.
8955000	8964000	Overall of course I mentioned the top three that we had Madden Smash Brothers Ultimate number five for the entire year after one month after one month.
8964000	8970000	Spider-Man Far Cry 5 God of War Monster Hunter World and Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
8970000	8980000	That's pretty good for Monster Hunter being the number nine best selling game all year when I think for a long time they kind of thought the U.S. didn't get it so to speak.
8980000	8984000	I think we're going to see more Monster Hunter games in the future.
8984000	9000000	In talking a little bit more about Smash so Smash Brothers Ultimate was sold so well that it set a new release month dollar sales record for an exclusive game beating the last previous record holder which was Halo Reach in 2010.
9000000	9007000	Well it sounds like Nintendo had a great year but it sounds like a lot of games did very well this year so you know that kind of ties in.
9007000	9010000	I think this is a lot of the same report that was in the very first story we talked about tonight.
9010000	9017000	It was a huge year for gaming period. You know that doesn't really touch on the mobile end of things but still a very very good year.
9018000	9027000	FertileSwagons in our chat before we get to our last story here says I think Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is going to die. They're not releasing enough content at a good pace.
9027000	9040000	Red Dead Redemption 2 is going to have a problem just because with Grand Theft Auto Online there's so much you can do with it like you can just go out and then they've done a lot of that where it's just like wacky shit with it.
9040000	9051000	They've got like a battle royale mode they have a mode now that's sort of like oh what the hell was it we just talked about it sort of like Rocket League.
9051000	9063000	They've got you know all sorts of different modes and like racing and stuff you can do in it but you can't really do that with Red Dead Redemption you're kind of limited to what exactly you can put in the game.
9063000	9076000	Like you can't be too weird I think with it and I just don't think we're seeing the appeal that they have with Grand Theft Auto Online. I don't think they're going to get as much of a return on investment they would hopefully get.
9076000	9082000	I know I'm not really interested in it. I haven't even finished a single player campaign yet.
9083000	9095000	Better get to it. Yeah. All right. Well one more story for you guys tonight and this has to do of course. Of course we had to talk about this. I saved it for last but there was a brand new dance dance revolution game announced this week.
9095000	9104000	So there was a solid gold cabinet. That's right. Solid gold cabinet. It's called DDR Ace 2 0 or a 20 if you want to be very American about it.
9104000	9118000	A 20. But I guess it's actually pronounced ace 2 0 because last year was ace. So I guess this is ace 2.0 something like that. Anyway lots of people photoshopping the logo to say for 20 because if you look at the logo like you said make one minor little change.
9118000	9128000	It was like it says DDR for 20 which would be a green cabinet not a gold cabinet. And then I did a really funny tweet. I thought I was being funny or I I photoshopped as bad Photoshop.
9128000	9142000	I took out I actually used like the Apple drawing thing on the phone and I took out the two. And so it just says 40. So I said you think I remember what I I tweeted something like bitch I'm too old for DDR.
9142000	9151000	I am dance dance revolution 40. So is this you know like one of those like it's hard for me to get excited about new DDR games anymore when I'm out of breath after I play Beat Saber.
9151000	9162000	Anyway it's not like we have a song list or anything like that it's just that hey the next DDR is a special 20th anniversary edition a shiny gold cabinet cabinet coming soon Japan of course.
9162000	9174000	You know we'll wait. And it is a different cabinet they have. It's like it's based off of like almost like a dance rush cabinets that they have. So very slim. The arrows are kind of different too.
9174000	9198000	So instead of the arrows being colored they're all gold and the LED lights underneath are red and blue. And I know that kind of playing that I guess the way they play is a little bit different too because I know that kind of affected some of the perfect attack competition that they're doing that some of the Japanese players are able to adapt to them faster than the U.S. players.
9199000	9210000	But that was not the only game though that they announced. They have other games too. They have mobile games coming which is kind of neat. So they've got mobile games for sound voltex for BeatMania 2DX and for Dance Dance Revolution.
9210000	9220000	And these aren't just like you know the mobile phone games you may be thinking of. They're actual like it's like you plug in your phone or tablet into a TV and they have wireless dance.
9221000	9240000	So they're going to be selling brand new soft pads and and for all of those who were growing up with DDR and saw way back in the day when they had on the PlayStation 2 the the arcade style controllers the ones where they're a thousand dollars that you could never touch because you couldn't buy them.
9240000	9250000	You can only buy them through Konami style or something like that. Well they're going to be selling some of those too. Oh wow. And so they're going to be available for I assume this mobile version as well.
9250000	9263000	They're also they have Bluetooth controllers as well for the 2DX and I think sound voltex as well. Very I would be so excited if I could play 2DX at home again.
9263000	9272000	He's so good. But yeah it looks it looks very cool. I saw like some gameplay of 2DX and stuff and you can use a touch screen on there you can also use the wireless controller.
9272000	9282000	So I'm curious to see how much all that's going to cost. But like here's a here's a picture like of the the actual arcade style controller. You can't say that when I can't show it. Sorry. We're looking at a picture but you can't see it.
9283000	9297000	But it looks like it's fine. It looks like it looks like a DDR stage like a metal state. It looks like a solo a solo pad sort of with the it looks just like the old arcade style controllers that they had for the PlayStation 2.
9297000	9310000	It's a metal pad with arcade arcade accurate everything. Although this one doesn't have like on the arcade they actually have like light strips around the whole thing on the bottom which is kind of cool.
9310000	9322000	But very much like the old PlayStation controllers. But it looks really nice. I have a cabinet so I don't really need this crap anymore. Well we'll see. We'll see what develops to that. I'm excited about that.
9322000	9331000	You know even if I joke that I am getting old for DDR maybe I just need to play more regularly again and then I could you know get get fit again playing some DDR. That would be very cool.
9331000	9344000	All right. We are now going to open up the discord channels for your calls. If you missed last week's show and you don't know how the calls work now we said goodbye to Skype and we now open up our discord server for calls.
9344000	9355000	So here's how it works. And I'm going to explain this a few more weeks and I probably will explain it less and less and refer you guys all to the pin post. But if you want to call into the show you just have to be a member of our discord.
9355000	9365000	It's it's totally free. You just go to vog network dot com slash discord and you join it just like any other discord server like where your Pokemon people are rating or how you're playing an MMO online or whatever.
9365000	9374000	And then if you do want to call into the show tonight you go to a channel called the green room and you can sit with some other all our listeners and chat amongst yourselves or test your audio if you want.
9374000	9385000	But please be nice to and respectful to each other. You can sit in there while you wait for us to pull you in just again due to time due to resources due to me usually preferring people that haven't been on the show before.
9385000	9393000	I may not get to everybody. Please do not be butthurt if you are not selected for all I try to get a good sampling if you want to increase your chances of getting on.
9393000	9399000	Tell us a little bit about what you want to call in about over on our orange lounge radio channel so that I know you're prepared.
9399000	9407000	All right. Anyhow I think that all being said we're ready to get to some calls and look you didn't get to experience this last time right. This is your first time on discord.
9407000	9416000	I haven't been able to experience the wonder that is the wonders. I think the auto quality is a little better. I don't know. We'll see. Anyway let's get to it. We are getting to our first caller tonight.
9416000	9418000	Hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.
9418000	9424000	Yeah. This is Bellamy. How are you. Hi. Good. Welcome back to all our what's on your mind tonight.
9424000	9435000	Well as you can see my one message on discord as I call in about games seemingly being dumbed down.
9435000	9440000	No gradually over the past decade or so. No I mean.
9440000	9450000	Tell us a little more about that. Like yeah obviously the podcast listeners couldn't see your pitch there in the orange on radio channel but yeah I was I was kind of curious what your perspective is on this.
9450000	9456000	You feel that games in general have been dumbed down in the past few years. Tell me tell me more about that.
9456000	9467000	Yeah. All right. Case in point you know most of us have grown up with stuff like this original Nintendo or Super Nintendo stuff like that.
9467000	9472000	And those games generally speaking have been brutally hard.
9472000	9482000	Those games never held your hand. They just gave you a flimsy you know instruction manual.
9482000	9494000	We said good luck. You know kind of assumed that you're intelligent enough to figure out how to beat the game. I mean you know case in point.
9495000	9508000	Sure. Like the old school Mega Man games were very like you really had to memorize patterns to get through those games. It's like I go back and I play them today and they're quite difficult to play those games today.
9508000	9523000	Exactly. Now and to cite an example Resident Evil series at least once on the PlayStation 1.
9523000	9530000	This may not be a great example but it's a little bit more recent.
9531000	9543000	In order to save your game you have to use the ink ribbons. Those ink ribbons were in limited supply. So you can spit and the CAs every 30 seconds.
9543000	9552000	You know now if every point five seconds if you want to. Yeah. Safety heart's desire.
9552000	9559000	To be fair though wasn't the ink ribbon thing kind of fucking annoying. Like I kind of thought it was annoying even when I was younger and that was first out.
9559000	9572000	But I mean I get I get it like I get what you're overall trying to say like it feels like you know games were like really really hard and now you know there's a lot of like easy modes and but there's folks in our chat room you know that that kind of like the easy modes.
9572000	9581000	Bobby Black Wolf you know he's a fan there. Gally in our chat room over at Twitch TV VOG Network says I play games to relax. So give me easy mode.
9581000	9590000	Let's see. Act Def says that's probably why I didn't like Mega Man back in the day. Here's the thing. I mean it seems like I don't know a lot of games that just went like full on easy mode.
9590000	9597000	I mean maybe they've re approached some of the design things like the ink ribbon concept you gave. But I even think of like let's say OK the old Mega Man games are really hard.
9597000	9606000	The newer Mega Man games just have a sliding difficulty level. So if you want to play like a really easy level you can do that and you can get through the game and experience the story and all that stuff.
9606000	9612000	But if you're the type that wants to bang your head on the wall and only have a certain amount of lies we're going to go all the way back to the beginning a level and so forth.
9612000	9621000	You can kind of do that. So I mean I think that's kind of like where the games right now is that there's a little bit more of a sliding scale and I think I think Metal Mayhem were a lot of that.
9621000	9630000	A lot of that I think probably has to do with accessibility in some ways. And you know we talked about how gaming was a very and this goes back to the very beginning of the show.
9630000	9639000	We started at you know 6 o'clock Pacific talking about how you know the gaming industry has grown it's grown and grown and it's a multi-billion dollar industry.
9639000	9646000	And now we have politicians going on Twitch feeds to talk about Donkey Kong 64 and these sorts of things that were unheard of several years ago.
9646000	9654000	And I think part of that is because more and more people can understand games and can play games easily.
9654000	9660000	Because for some people Rage Nator and I know for like hardcore gamers like you and me this is sometimes a tough concept to grasp.
9660000	9670000	But like with an Xbox controller if I were to hand I'm pretty sure I did this when I like was showing my mom you know when she was still with us different video games.
9670000	9677000	She'd be like there's too many buttons on this thing how do you remember what button this is there's so many buttons on this thinking thing right.
9677000	9689000	That's how a lot of people kind of react to controllers right now you can play so many different types of cell phone games just with your finger just touch doing very intuitive sorts of things.
9690000	9699000	And I think I kind of think that accessibility and the easiness part I think also opens up games to more people.
9699000	9704000	Because there's a lot of video games out there that are very narrative based let's take a game like Mass Effect for example.
9704000	9711000	That you know what some people don't necessarily want to do pew pew shooty shooty they just want to experience the story well guess what EA wants that money too.
9711000	9720000	So there's an easier mode in the game but for those that like the combat and that stuff you do have that more sliding scale level of difficulty I feel like you were going to say something.
9720000	9733000	Yeah I was going to say that you know I do I was kind of on on the same side with how you know I feel that a lot of games they had dumbed down but not necessarily done.
9733000	9747000	I think it's now that they've added a lot more accessibility this stuff I know with my kids you know trying to get in the games they wouldn't have the patience to play a harder game like that if they kept losing at a game they're just not going to want to play it anymore because you know 5,000 games.
9747000	9762000	Well it's just like everybody kind of has like ADD when it comes to like just entertainment in general if you're going to get if something is going to bring you frustration because it's so hard then you're just not gonna play it whereas remember when we started playing games you know a long time ago.
9762000	9772000	Arcade games were kind of the thing that was popular and you were used to games being hard because they would eat your quarters and that was the point of the game was to make money for the arcade.
9772000	9778000	And then you take the home game and it's slightly easier because hey guess what I don't want to keep paying money to play this game.
9778000	9787000	Yeah it's insanely hard still and that could be just because they're porting stuff over from the arcade and they didn't change anything or that's just you know the attitude that they had.
9787000	9800000	They didn't need to you know dumb things down so much but and also controls are a lot more simpler than I think now like with all the accessibility options they have like with some of the Mario games stuff that add this like a little bit easier mode into it.
9800000	9809000	I think it does help people you know keeps kids and stuff entertained in the game without getting overly frustrated with it.
9810000	9817000	And I noticed in our chat room also some folks talking about Celeste. Bobby Blackwolf points out I also like how Celeste handled the assist mode.
9817000	9824000	They never degraded you for it. They just said here it is. We'd love for you to try to play first without it but we understand that may not be the case. We hope you enjoy our game.
9824000	9829000	Here's something else to think about. I'm sorry Metal Mayhem I keep talking and don't let you speak but I'll let you speak out of this.
9829000	9840000	Here's something else to think about. Like you know if you take more of the concept of a game anybody can get out there and pick up a basketball and try to throw it in the hoop.
9840000	9853000	Anybody can do that. But sometimes the rules get changed a little bit depending on the crowd right. If you have kids playing maybe you won't mind so much if they hold on to the ball and don't constantly dribble it if they do a little bit of traveling.
9853000	9863000	But you know what. I mean if you want to get elitist about basketball or you know the fact that you know well it takes a long time to get really good at basketball. Yeah it does.
9863000	9874000	But the mere concept of basketball ball in hoop that's very accessible for everybody but it takes a lot a lot of time a lot a lot of practice to get really really good at basketball.
9874000	9883000	So you can do those that shit where you fly through the air and do the dunks and all that stuff and get paid millions of dollars to do it in front of an auditorium of screaming fans.
9883000	9899000	But at the end of the day basketball and pretty much put any physical sport in there is really only limited by the cost to buy a ball to buy the stuff needed to play the game which even then I think some people improvise.
9900000	9908000	We're going to play basketball but we're going to just do it with this bouncy ball that I just kind of had available. Anyway your thoughts your thoughts on our response middleman.
9908000	9919000	Well accessibility is all well and good but you know some sometimes things have been at least in my experience been done for accessibility.
9919000	9942000	Yeah. Okay. Take you know you know you know to a large degree like for example you know in some of the Metal Gear Solid games you know you know something in the outside you know you get a bid bid dialogue.
9942000	9951000	You know the colonel may say ah I see you found this item to use this item. You think push the click button.
9951000	9961000	That's just kind of that's also kind of like the game just kind of like giving you a tutorial without that's like a you know a game a game maker and a storyteller can kind of choose.
9961000	9966000	Do they want to just have a little pop up menu that comes up and says here's how to control your character use the stick to this.
9967000	9974000	Some games do it that way but some games kind of choose to do it in a very like tongue in cheek way where they have the characters explain it to you.
9974000	9981000	And that's just that's just kind of like a narrative choice on the part of the developers. Anyway Metal Mayhem great topic and great question.
9981000	9991000	I am going to let you go so we can get some more calls tonight. But thank you very much. I thought that was a good discussion if nothing else on accessibility and games and the difficulty and all that and kind of where we come.
9992000	9995000	Here for next night. Yeah you too. Take care buddy.
9995000	10004000	All right. Again if you would like to call into Orange Lawns Radio join our discord and you sit there in the green room channel which is only one person in there now.
10004000	10013000	There's about to be zero and you can give us a call. It really does help to to tell us a little bit about what you want to talk about tonight down in our Orange Lawns Radio channel on discord.
10013000	10017000	But for now let's get to another call. Hi you are on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this.
10017000	10022000	Hey what's going on. It's Ron. Hey Ron. It's always good to hear from you. What's on your mind tonight.
10022000	10030000	Oh some stuff besides the fact that I rebuilt my computer in two hours today. That was kind of fun. Hey I was seeing you chat about some of that earlier in the chat room.
10030000	10041000	Congrats on that. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. It was like it happened Thursday night. I'm like go out buy a new power supply to get it working.
10041000	10052000	Didn't work. Talk to one of my staffers and we got my rebuild going showed up yesterday. I came home from my trip put it together.
10052000	10058000	I'm more happy about the fact that I did not have to reinstall windows or any other application but that's not why I call.
10058000	10067000	Some people speed run video games you speed run computer building and that's fine. All right. No. In all seriousness what's on your mind tonight.
10067000	10086000	In response to earlier talking about cable and and digital streaming services. I pay one hundred and thirty five dollars a month for files and that's for their near extreme package that I've been grandfathered in and a one hundred one hundred megabit connection.
10086000	10102000	And sometimes I look at the stuff that I DVR and I'm like do I really need half these channels. But then I realize if I change those channels I'll lose my HBO and my Showtime that I will watch maybe four or five times out of the year.
10102000	10125000	And it's like I kind of want to cut that down because we're kind of getting to the point where cable providers just need to offer you the base package with some base programming and your choice of like four different streaming services you can add to your bill for like a hundred bucks a month. You know it's crazy.
10126000	10142000	Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I'm also typing with our multitask typing with our twitch room. But yeah. No. No. I was worried about the echo factor. I'm just like I just rebuilt this machine. We can't happen. No no no. We hear you fine. You're you're you're totally good.
10143000	10153000	Sweet. Yeah. You it's I mean even like HBO. I mean HBO is kind of selling their own online service too right. Yeah. But here's the thing.
10153000	10170000	You can get all of HBO's content and I believe access to the state channels for like 17 bucks a month or you could probably pay a few dollars less a month and get through your cable provider and just add the app because the app is so different from the streaming service.
10170000	10182000	It's the same thing. And sometimes if you're lucky providers will tell you like for like 20 bucks a month pick three premium movie packages and it's like you can't go wrong with that. You know.
10183000	10193000	Yeah. I do want to warn you buddy. The echo is back a little bit. You know we are hearing ourselves that go through. So you're going to have some more troubleshooting to do maybe and some testing. Sorry buddy.
10193000	10206000	I'll have to try another USB port on my machine. My apologies. No it's fine. It happens. That's what that's what happens anyway. But I am going to let you go for now. Everybody I hope we'll check out anime jam session on Tuesday nights here at Vogue Network.
10207000	10222000	Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. Take care buddy. Bye bye. All right. And that is that's everybody that wanted to call in so far. I'll give it a couple more minutes to see if anybody else calls in. But do you have any last minute stories of the things you want to get to right now.
10223000	10237000	Real quick. Yeah there is over 500 games on backwards compatibility for Xbox One now. Nice nice milestone that they've hit and they're saying that 538 titles and holy moly.
10238000	10246000	Yes. They said currently only 33 original Xbox games are backwards compatible. Hey better than zero. This is true.
10246000	10262000	I was trying to see if they had like a count of four of the most popular games on there but I don't see it. That's too bad. Oh yeah. That'd be cool to know like which games are being backwards compatible played the most. I bet like the original Red Dead Redemption is way up there.
10263000	10285000	Probably oblivion. Oh here we go. Here's a breakdown. Let's see. They actually have some numbers. Yes. The top most requested. Oh this is the most requested titles by votes. Black Ops 2 Red Dead Redemption Elder Scrolls Skyrim mostly Call of Duty so Modern Warfare 2 Modern Warfare Modern Warfare 3 World of War Mass Effect 3 Fallout New Vegas.
10286000	10301000	I thought the trilogy was the whole trilogy was playable on backwards compatibility. These are the most requested tiles by 2015. Oh that's old numbers franchises fully playable on Xbox One backwards compatibility just cause mass effect.
10302000	10320000	Bioshock. Let's see here. Saints bro. Hey you know you got to get Microsoft credit. That's and as Bobby points out in chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network. Do you have to rebuy all any of them if you own the original discs. No you do not. Yeah it's pretty awesome. Yeah very awesome.
10321000	10338000	I hope if Microsoft can kind of keep that messaging going into their next console they're going to win a lot of fans. We'll see. Yep. It would be great if Microsoft could be like hey because of trademark law and patents the time on the original PlayStation hardware has run out.
10338000	10356000	So the new Xbox will let you play PlayStation 1 games. I'm totally fan faking. It's not serious. But why don't they sell those we blame now. They sell those like fakie Nintendo Super Nintendo 5 or they sell those like fries and you know pretty soon people are going to be able to do that with original PlayStation.
10356000	10371000	So it'd be hilarious if Xbox are we getting. Are we going to have a soldier boy Microsoft collab here. Is that what we're doing. Let's hope not. All right. I'm so sorry I even suggested it. Anything else for last minute stories.
10372000	10384000	There was it looks like a mod that's being worked on that's trying to put legends all that into doom. Yeah I kind of saw it reminded me of when somebody tried to go the V.R. route with you. Yeah it's like three.
10385000	10396000	And I was like some things just don't need to be done. No it it does look cool though. But if I remember right. Didn't the guy like he started it but he's not able to finish it. So he's kind of like here's everything I've got. Hope somebody else will pick it up and finish it.
10396000	10409000	Yeah. So he's released it. It's a Zelda slash Doom mod that's on mod DB. You can go check it out if you want to look at it or finish it or whatever. All right. Well it doesn't look like we're getting any other callers in tonight.
10409000	10423000	So I think we will go ahead and kind of wrap up here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight. So I do want to really thank you guys for listening to the show tonight whether you're watching us live over on our twitch TV vogue network channel or if you were downloading the podcast and listening to this.
10423000	10434000	And if you've just found the show tonight randomly on Twitch remember we have a whole back library of episodes available in all your favorite podcast places like iTunes and Google Play probably being the two big ones.
10434000	10439000	So if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio we certainly appreciate all the follows and the biddies and all that good stuff.
10439000	10444000	But we really appreciate if you tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10444000	10458000	But we can only have those voices. So many of them heard unless we get more people here. So you could tell a friend and that goes a nice long way a little a tweet or a five star recommendation on a place like iTunes goes a very very long way.
10458000	10467000	Loki great to have you back this week. We missed you this week. But hey everybody needs a Disneyland vacation once in a while or some type of vacation. It's been a long time it's been like eight years.
10468000	10491000	Yes sir. You know more than eight nine years actually. So do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight. My final thought is I'm going to try to stream more this week. I know I've been kind of slacking on it but it's been it's been like a combination between just I just don't want to do it at this time or fighting with hardware because like it seems like every time I go to streams like something else is broken.
10491000	10511000	What is it going to be today. I haven't streamed in like two weeks. Most of my energy and time has been going into this. I have my I've been neglecting my personal stream so I really want to get back. But then then Bobby and I are chatting off the side and it's like what if we did this new thing and that new thing and I'm like it's going to be a long time before I get back to my personal channel.
10511000	10533000	But really exciting stuff on the horizon. It's not a bad thing. Still trying to get affiliate. Haven't quite hit that yet. What are you missing the followers. I'm probably missing everything. I don't know. Just keep keep at it. You'll get there. I don't know. But yeah it's just still not quite there. I definitely don't have the followers yet. I'm just trying to see if I can even see where I'm at here.
10533000	10555000	I think if you go to the either act stream summary I think is where it see stream summary and analyze that's where you can see on the right side. There should be a section that says path to affiliate. You guys probably scroll down. You're not going to see it yet. Let's see. Maybe not. I know. I know it's somewhere here. Maybe in the very channel here. Oh here we go. Analytics channel.
10555000	10584000	Anyway we don't want to bore the listeners. We've got to wrap up. Not there yet. So you'll get you'll get there. Just keep at it. Keep at it. You your setup is great as more people discover you. I think you'll you'll have more of a base watch in the DDR stuff especially because it's classic stuff. Anyway my final thought tonight is I'm going to play some more Beat Saber and clear some more songs because I had a lot of fun doing that. That was my way of getting some exercise this week. I also still need to come cameo at your house and on your stream. That's still a thing we need to set up. Yeah we do need to talk about that. So maybe we'll try to make that happen.
10585000	10601000	This week or next. So anyway thanks again for listening to or watching orange entree or whatever the case may be. We'll be back in seven days to do all over again. I know next week is Super Bowl Sunday so a lot of you are going to be preoccupied but we will be here because I don't really have a say in football.
10601000	10612000	I don't even know who's doing the halftime show this year. Sometimes I get excited about the concert. I don't even know who's playing this year and the commercials they're all posted the day before at this point. So I'm kind of like whatever on Super Bowl.
10613000	10625000	So we'll be here and Loki I know you're not really a football watcher so you will you'll be here too. So I'm so yeah I need I'm at 40 followers. I don't have I need 10 more followers to do that.
10625000	10637000	And then an average of three viewers in the last three days I'm averaging two and then any more chatters. So we're almost get there. I don't care. Whatever it's fine.
10637000	10649000	You'll get there. All right. Oh they say in chat Maroon 5. Oh I didn't realize. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever they do will be all right anyway. Sorry to the Maroon 5 fans out there anyway. We'll be here Sunday Bobby will not be here.
10649000	10663000	He does a big like gathering. It's a big day for him and his friends which is the case for a lot of you will still be here producing a new show if you can't be here. We hope you will be here live. But if you can't be here live of course check the podcast feed next week or for those of you that subscribe to our twitch channels.

That's it. We're going to wrap up. We'll see you next time in seven days. We'll do this all over again. Have a great week everybody and good night.
