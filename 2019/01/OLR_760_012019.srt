00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week I felt a great disturbance in the internet as if thousands of videos suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly unavailable. I fear something terrible has happened. We'll explain this as well as plenty more from the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 760 for this January the 20th of 2019.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts and not joining me tonight, Techmaster Loki, but in studio with us, back tonight, happy to have her back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hi.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi, how are you?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm doing okay. I forgot I left this Ragnarok thing open on my phone.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, are you are you farming for Ragnarok, Zeni or whatever it's called?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, I'm just farming for gems.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, I see.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to kill Baphomet and it won't let me kill it yet.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is that, that's a thing that you find in the game, Baphomet?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Alright, well anyway.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's also funny because I'm also leveling a Baphomet too.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let me come back to you in a minute, Jamie, because I know we have a lot to catch up on because you've been out for a little bit.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, you've been here through the Classic Game of the Week, but those that are watching on Twitch are probably wondering, who's this guy that's sitting next to me?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, Techmaster Loki is out this week.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This was the weekend of the broccoli farm trip, so I'll come back to that in a minute.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But this is Alan, Alan Alchemy.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hi, how are you?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm good.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Good.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, Alan's going to fill in for the show tonight since Loki.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I haven't been on this show in a long time.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You have, well, I feel like you've like come on like it's, oh, you did the classic game a few weeks ago.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She, she like wasn't even able to do the Skype thing.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, I did freelancer.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, okay.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But just in general.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Just in general.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You haven't, you haven't been on the show in a little bit, but we're happy to have you here tonight.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is great.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, um, for those that are listening on the podcast feed, I'm trying to change some things around on Twitch a little bit.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're probably actually wondering on Twitch, why can't you see Dark Sakura?

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Reasons?

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She's staying hidden tonight just because she wants to for one, but the other is actually also because we haven't been able to correctly configure our studio to get the shot that we want.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We do know the shot we're going to get that has Dark Sakura's kind of like Dr. Claw element in there.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I think on Twitch, she's going to show you her hand.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She's got, she can, she can do a little bit of that.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Uh, but anyway, so just due to like the configuration, I wasn't able to get it work for Dark Sakura to be on camera tonight.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And this part kind of affects the podcast as well.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you notice that the sound sounds a little different tonight, that's because the podcast audio is now going to match directly the Twitch audio.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It actually wasn't before there was stuff I was having to go back and splice in and some of that stuff.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But now it's actually going to line up a hundred percent.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's going to allow us to do our calls tonight on Discord because we're actually getting rid of Skype, which is another big change.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There's a lot of crazy stuff going on on OLR tonight.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No Loki, Alan's here instead.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Jamie's actually in the studio.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're switching to Discord.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And if I get the schedule I want at work, I will be back permanently in March.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, good.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm so happy to hear that.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So happy to hear that.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And in chat over our Twitch TV, because we do tape live at Twitch TV every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And of course our Twitch channel is VOG Network and you can watch us for free on Sunday nights.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You can watch us on demand with a subscription to our channel at Twitch TV.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And you can always listen for free on our podcast feed available in most any podcatcher like iTunes or Google Play.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nifty805 in our Twitch chat room says, God is a woman, voiced by DarkSakura.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There you go.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No shit.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She is the VOG tonight, the voice of Goddess.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There it is. Awesome.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And yeah, Spyro says the audio sounds better quality tonight too.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think not having the split is helping with that.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I did some rebalancing of things, so hopefully that's all good.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I don't know if it's coming through, but the video on my side now looks the way I've wanted it to.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's been a little bit blurry ever since we made the move to Twitch.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I think tonight is the first time it's like nice and sharp.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So Alan's sharp, I'm sharp, and it's not quite as washed.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It kind of had like a washed out look to it.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So it's very exciting.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And SG100Matt confirming in our chat that everything does look good.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Great.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm very happy to hear.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I look especially good.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, DarkSakura looks especially good.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Maybe at the end of the show, she'll let us turn the camera around, but no promises.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There might be a surprise extra guest host in that because I'm here, Mr. Smush, who is always attached to me like glue, may, oh, he just, he heard his name.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He heard his name.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He heard his name and he meowed.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He may decide that he wants to be with me and be in my lap.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So that will be a treat.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But we cannot.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He's a cat, so we make no guarantees.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We have to ignore him and he will insert himself into the situation.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If we try to make him come here, it will never happen.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All right.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So anyway.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's already making his presence known.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He is.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's starting to meow.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He probably wants food or something.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So anyway, thanks again, you guys, for being here live tonight.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And it's great.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We're going to jump right into our kickoff topic tonight.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So our kickoff topic tonight is to kind of pick up where we left off last week.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So last week we talked about some 2019 gaming predictions.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So we filled up our time capsule.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We actually took out 2018 and we read through them and had a good laugh.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And now we're getting into our 2019 gaming predictions.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But since Dark Sakura wasn't here last week, I mean, she joined us through Radio Magic and that whole thing.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But since she wasn't here last week, she was unable to contribute to the time capsule.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So I wanted to ask Dark Sakura tonight about some of her gaming predictions for 2019.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So Dark Sakura, please, I know you've written some things out before the show.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Will you tell us, did you end up with three or four?

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Four.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Four.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Would you give us one of your 2019 predictions, please?

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll read all of them.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, just give us one to start because we have to.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We have to.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Still no Half-Life 3?

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Talk about a safe prediction.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, OK.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Alan, you're a big Half-Life fan, right?

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I guess you used to be.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
OK, so tell us tell us about this like Half-Life saga going on, because I understand like they hired one of the old writers and Mark.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is it is it going to happen or not?

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, no.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We're never getting Half-Life 3 ever.

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mark Laidlaw, I think, was his contract ended with Valve because it's a new year.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have no concept of time.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
2016, 2017.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So he's no longer employed with Valve.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And then last year or the year before, the nondisclosure agreement for the script that he wrote for Half-Life 2 Episode 3 expired because that's how long it's been.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So he just leaked the script.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He just did like a fine replace on Gordon Freeman and Alex Vance to like some other generic names and said, hey, I'm going to put this on my blog.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And people realized, oh, this is this is Episode 3 that he legally can share now because that's how invested in the franchise Gabe Newell is.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So one of the co-writers from Half-Life 2 was brought back on to Valve.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And my prediction is that there were news stories about that writer.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It doesn't mean anything.

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We won't hear about him ever again.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He gets a paycheck from Valve.

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Doing what?

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We won't know.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It'll never happen.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, now Tiger Claw in chat over at Twitch TV says maybe no Half-Life 3.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But what if we got Portal 3?

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I mean, is Valve ever going to put out a game with a 3 in it?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No, they're done.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're off to VR.

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Dota.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Dota is the new.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There might be a Dota 3.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
OK. All right.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Interesting.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OK. All right.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, thank you, Dark Sakura.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let us have a little sidebar on Half-Life.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So what is your next prediction?

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Nintendo freaks out and goes back to friend codes for all the things.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Nintendo has another freak out and goes back to friend codes for all the things.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not completely unreasonable.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Like, you might think she's being very tongue in cheek, and I think she is.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But we've seen Nintendo freak out before, right?

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Nintendo did a freak out with the chat app on 3.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can't even remember the name.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
PictoChat.

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
PictoChat.

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They've erased it from my memory.

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No, PictoChat was the live chat.

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What was the one where you email each other?

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, well, no.

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Because PictoChat was the live chat room, and then there was the one where you sent each other little...

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It was PinoChat.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SwapNote.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
SwapNote.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you, Bobby.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They were all PinoChat.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SwapNote.

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And remember, like, because somebody sent a picture of a penis, the whole thing was done for.

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So that's it.

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So that's Dark Sakura's number two prediction.

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How about your number three prediction?

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Amazon's new streaming game service will not overcome Steam or the console market.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, so Amazon's going to do the new stream gaming, but it's not going to be enough.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't think it's going to be enough.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you think maybe Amazon might launch their streaming thing into, like, build it into the PlayStation 4,

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
build it into what's existing?

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Not too stubborn.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, it's going to be all the Prime stuff.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And because they own Twitch as well, they're going to try to push it through Twitch.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Mm-hmm.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Makes sense.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But no, it's going to be Prime poop.

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
All right.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And lastly, but not leastly, your number four prediction, Dark Sakura.

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
OLR may earn enough money for bus tickets to Penny Arcade Expo.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Finally, after 15, 16 years.

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, God, no, this is year 17, actually.

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We started in 2002.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is year 17.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm at that point where I'm low balling our age.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Here in the 17th year of OLR, we may earn enough money to get a bus ticket to go to PAX.

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why would we want to go to PAX?

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We went once.

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It was pretty fun.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We had a good time.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You know what, Dark Sakura?

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Will Wheaton signed my first model iPhone.

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Anything is more fun when we're there.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, when I'm there.

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So what happened to the other predictions?

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because I never got to look at what was in the old can.

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Sadly, we tossed them last week.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Really?

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
After I wanted to see it?

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I guess you have to listen to the show.

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Put this shit in the can.

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You have to actually listen to the show, Dark Sakura.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Here you go.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't listen to the show.

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is a dumb show.

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Who would listen to this shit?

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Anyway, I don't know.

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Alan, do you have any predictions?

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I know I didn't have you write them down, but if you do make an official prediction,

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
please make sure you note it and put it in the thing.

240
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That writer that was talked about for Valve, it doesn't mean anything.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Nothing will ever happen with it.

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Anthem is going to flop so bad, it may bring into question whether or not Dragon Age 4 gets made.

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's severe.

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Because they know Dragon Age is the cash cow.

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I do think Dragon Age 4 will still happen, but it might be like,

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
is there going to be a Bioware after Dragon Age 4?

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I will cackle loud squawking laughs when Anthem flops.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I will be like a witch.

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I will be there with you.

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Here's the thing, guys.

252
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm torn, though, because there are many people who have nothing to do with why we're pissed at EA

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and why we're pissed at Bioware that work on this game, and so for them, I feel bad.

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But at least my hope is what tends to...

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, a lot of what we're seeing come out of these big developers oftentimes is more like smaller indie studios.

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like, for example, we had the...

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think it was on the show that got cut off because of the power outage and the storm,

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but we were going to talk about the guys that worked on Hearthstone were about to make their own game with their own studio,

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and they just got the Marvel license, and that was a pretty big deal.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So I will go along with your cackling, but only for the management and for the other employees.

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I hope they are able to bond together, unionize, and make the game that they want to make.

262
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So I will wish for the negativity, but with a positive shell to that.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Frodo Swagons has a question.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Is there a way I can just get the audio?

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes. In Twitch, click the little gear.

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Touch the little gear, and you can find the options there.

267
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Makes it great if you're trying to listen in the car. Please don't watch in the car.

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
SSJ100Matt anthem is enemy number one in the eyes of Mass Effect fans.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That is largely true.

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
However, it is such a departure of why Bioware fans of yesteryear played any Bioware game,

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
in that you are a solo protagonist, you don't have a party, so there's no banter amongst the party members.

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I believe that's true, and there's no romances of any type.

273
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So even if it was like, we're going to throw Mass Effect under the bus to bring you this new cast of ragtag misfits,

274
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I would still be into that if for the romance options, for the interpersonal relationships, for all of the recorded dialogue,

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and Anthem isn't offering any of that.

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Anthem's just trying to be a Destiny knockoff.

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, so that's why I'm kind of like, it's such a departure of the Bioware formula, which we all fell in love with.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's less bitterness over we didn't get our Andromeda DLC, because Andromeda wasn't really very good.

279
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm still bitter about the DLC.

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
DLC or not.

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I wanted all the Quarian stuff.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well yeah, I did too, but it's such a departure of what Bioware used to be that I want to see it fail for that reason,

283
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
more than a personal affront to my Mass Effect fandom.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Anthem is New Coke.

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Anthem is New Coke.

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Or Crystal Pepsi.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, but I liked Crystal Pepsi.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's true. Okay, they're New Coke.

289
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Although when I went back and drank, I liked Crystal Pepsi when I was a kid.

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And they did that redo, or the whole like, everything 90s is cool again.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Like two years ago, whenever they brought back Crystal Pepsi, I had it, and I was like, this is like liquid sugar.

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They should have brought back Josta. Pepsi should have brought back Josta.

293
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And Surge.

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Surge is back on, you can buy Surge on Amazon.

295
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And Coke needs to put out Beverly in the US.

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Anyway.

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They need to bring back Coke Black for me.

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Alright, moving on, moving on.

299
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
My last prediction.

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
After, I'm going to mispronounce the name just because I don't have it in front of me.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Sekiro, the new From Software Dark Souls-esque feudal Japan game.

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, right, yeah.

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Once that is out, they are going to announce Bloodborne 2, because Sony is writing that check for that exclusive game.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Whether From Software wants to make it or not, they're like, oh, just like Bayonetta 3, well the check came in, so we're making it.

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's going to be announced, it's not going to be out, but I think that is a safe bet.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think that's a very safe prediction, but it's still a good one.

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They need to put out the current blue chip title, which is Sekiro, before they announce it.

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But yeah.

309
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Alright, good predictions. Be sure to write them down and put them in there so we actually get to look at them in 2019, okay?

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay. 2020.

311
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Or, yeah. Well, I would say I'm still writing 2018 on all my checks, but who writes checks anymore?

312
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, we do for the rent. That's like the one thing. We've still got a landlord who lives in the 80s.

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We pay our gardener.

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, there you go.

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
With a check.

316
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I think like one other bill.

317
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's so, I don't know if you've started doing this, but like now it's all about things like, you know, I don't want to endorse one or the other, but it's things like Apple Pay, Venmo.

318
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I think there's a cash, just one called cash.

319
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Cash app.

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The largest amount I've ever Apple paid somebody was like $460 to get extra ramps and two of the chests.

321
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I actually have three chests for my theater magic.

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I did, okay, so when I was at Final Fantasy Fan Fest, I sent $100 to one of my friends because he had a ton of money and cash on him because he knew he was going on the trip.

323
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And I didn't want to go to an ATM, but I wanted to play the slot machines.

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So I did, I sent my friend $100. He was like, here you go.

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And I was like, yay, no ATM fees.

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So that worked out.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But it's, I mean, that stuff is really big now.

328
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Like, I don't know about you guys, but like when I go out to eat and I swear this is not a commercial.

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I know there's so many podcasts that endorse one of these particular apps.

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's why I'm being very vague.

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's a bunch out there.

332
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But like now, like when you go out to eat and dinner and stuff, like it's, it's one of those apps all the time to like split the check or it's just, okay, I'll put it on my card.

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Everybody send me on, you know, Venmo or Apple pay or whatever you guys are using.

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So kind of interesting.

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Anyway.

336
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Also, if I may make a quick shout out.

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry, I forgot your name, but to the dude who is at Cliffs Variety that we started talking about, Pinball.

339
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hi.

340
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If that person is even watching.

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, I, if he's, if he's listening or watching, but, um, it's nice finding more and more pinball fans out there to the point that maybe we should have ourselves a pinball segment.

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Wink, wink.

343
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or a pinball show.

344
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Take that on.

345
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Who wants to be my cohost on, uh, on pinball hour?

347
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Pinball hour.

348
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We're looking, we're looking for more video content.

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We'll just call it the pincade.

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We're looking, you should recruit your hubby.

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I think would be a good one for that.

352
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He's been on, actually, he's been on some pinball podcasts.

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There you go.

354
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And there's actually, I don't know if you watch Twitch, but there's Twitch pinball stuff and it's kind of funny because.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He watches the Bro Do You Even pinball?

356
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Most things are widescreen on Twitch, right?

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So like, you know, you see interesting things with the layout.

358
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like for us, you have like the stories coming up on the side and the bar at the bottom and all that stuff.

359
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But like with pinball, since pinball is very narrow, it's like one small part of the screen and then you, you see the person playing it.

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You see the board.

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I watch many of them.

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But it's, yeah, it looks, it looks neat.

363
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But the big one he watches is the Bro Do You Even pinball?

364
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And then he watches some of the tourneys.

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
OK.

366
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So.

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Shout out.

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All right.

369
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And lots of lots of positive buzz for the pinball hour in our chat room.

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
KArts1 says it's been far too long since the Dan OLR appearance.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So there you go.

372
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I asked Mr. Husband tonight, you want to come be on the show?

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Will's coming over.

374
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We're going to play demolition man.

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We just got a demolition man.

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
OK.

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So, so this show got bounced.

378
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This show got declined in favor of demolition man.

379
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
However, I did get to hug one, too, who is the cutest people ever.

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's see.

381
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Also at the San Francisco March yesterday, because I was marching at the Women's March.

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I will endorse that one because they are very nice to Jewish people.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And like the DC one where the woman is anti-Semitic as fuck.

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But I got to pet an iguana and a it's like in the parrot family.

385
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But I got to hold a bird and feed it an almond.

386
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And you randomly saw a gamer Jamie Lee Curtis there, which I thought I saw Jamie Lee Curtis outside the Castro theater while I was still in full face.

387
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Awesome.

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah.

389
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I love Jamie.

390
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The reason why so pretty.

391
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Jamie Lee Curtis is relevant to OLR because she's like a gamer.

392
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
She goes to Evo.

393
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I want to grow up to be her.

394
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
She goes in cosplay, head to toe cosplay.

395
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So she's unrecognizable.

396
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I think it's a really cute story because I think correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was her son that got her into it.

397
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And she kind of became a gamer because she wanted like that with her son, which I think is awesome.

398
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And she's like one of the only people in Hollywood that's like still married to the same Christopher guest.

399
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah.

400
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Which is, you know, great.

401
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So like my point is Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect.

402
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I want to grow up and be her because I already have her name.

403
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Right.

404
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That should have been your stage name.

405
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Jamie Curtis Lee.

406
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No, because I would.

407
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You know why I picked Jamie Summers.

408
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Right.

409
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I do.

410
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If the listeners don't know.

411
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
OK.

412
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So the bionic woman.

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I was named after the bionic woman.

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes, I am that old.

415
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The character is spelled J.A.I.M.E.S.O.M.M.

416
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wait.

417
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
J.A.I.M.E.S.O.M.M.E.R.S.

418
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So I picked Jamie J.A.M.I.U., which is how I spell my name.

419
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
S.U.M.M.E.R.S.

420
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Not realizing that was already porn stars name, of course.

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Whoops.

422
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And apparently.

423
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's all right.

424
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There's a Rob Roberts that like makes guns.

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
If you if you search on YouTube, not that I'm endorsing this guy's channel, but there's like a gunsmith or something.

426
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That goes by Rob Roberts.

427
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And his parents really did name him that.

428
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And that's why he's angry and he sells guns.

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And that's yours is chosen.

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There's there's a rugby guy because there's if you go to Wikipedia for Rob Roberts, I'm not notable enough to be on Wikipedia,

431
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
despite that I'm the co-producer and co-host of the longest running podcast.

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But we won't go there.

433
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There's a rugby guy that's named Rob Roberts.

434
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Rugby's cool.

435
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm all right with that.

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh, well, she's 50.

437
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And she really is like one of those classic bombshell type of porn star looking ones.

438
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Good for her.

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And she also is in a video with Jeff Stryker.

440
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
All right.

441
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This has gone way past gaming predictions.

442
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I think it's time to advance to the next segment, which is a little more appropriate for these conversations we're having, which is how is your gaming week?

443
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So Dark Sakura, what types of video games have you been playing this week?

444
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, this week was actually a super busy week.

445
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I had bronchitis last week.

446
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Well, the past week before.

447
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And so if you hear me hacking, I have the leftovers.

448
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So really, it was just all watching awesome games done quick and then me and Dan rewatching the streams.

449
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But I've mostly played pinball.

450
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I've been playing theater magic because I freaking love that game and ours is pristine.

451
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Dan should be supposed to be working in my World Cup soccer.

452
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I found the reason I like theater magic so much and World Cup soccer is apparently I just like games designed by John Poppadook.

453
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So go fig.

454
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's also and I've been trying I didn't put it up in the show,

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
but something interesting is that Steve Ritchie may be getting to work on his dream game, which might be Black Knight 3000.

456
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, cool. Give me your money.

457
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah. But, you know, it's just been, you know, mostly even playing Pokemon Go and playing, you know, idol pouring and this would block puzzle game because, you know, I like spatial puzzles.

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Sure.

459
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I've just been trying to keep my mind going because I'm losing it so much.

460
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You should look at the game that Bobby had on his show tonight.

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That looked pretty cool. And that was like a spatial puzzle kind of game.

462
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So, yeah. Cool.

463
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, and I'm actually going to be I want to play it on the old SNES because I want to do a Jamie Cheats at games.

464
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Just like put in the game genie and like do Final Fantasy six with the speed shoes on all the time.

465
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know, just just because I love, you know, after I've beaten games 57 million times, sometimes I just want to play through for the story.

466
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So I was thinking about doing like a Jamie Cheats and just do me cheating at games.

467
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, you know, have you I don't know if you've looked a lot at the Switch online library of NES classics on if you played around with that.

468
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Something they've been doing is that every month they've been adding, you know, two or three new games, but they also have been adding one or two SP games.

469
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And what's really interesting about the SP games is they're based on all they are. They're just save states.

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They're like official Nintendo sanctioned save states. But in the beginning, they were really cool.

471
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like there was a Zelda one where you start Zelda, but you have two hundred and fifty rupees and you have every item that you can buy from a merchant.

472
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Like somebody ran around the game. So like if you just want to power through Zelda without worrying about a bunch of that bull, you just you can use that Zelda SP.

473
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And then they did like a Gradius that's starting on the last level.

474
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Well, they just put out this last month that they put out a I think it was Ninja Gaiden starting at the very last boss fight.

475
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So you can see that but with full life that what nobody probably ever saw the actual endings.

476
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah. And then what was the other one? A ghouls and ghosts or ghosts and goblins on the second play through or on the last boss with the with the key.

477
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They started on level six with key. I don't remember because remember you have to get the item and carry it through the last level to the game officially.

478
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm a girl. I can barely beat level one. Barely. So and I think I did it on a Commodore 64 when I was seven and not in my 30s or 40s.

479
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So it's not. But anyway, my point is those SP titles are kind of a way to like, oh, get that little oomph.

480
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's almost like fingers crossed that they do end up supporting Super Nintendo games someday.

481
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Maybe we would see something like that, like a Final Fantasy with certain things already on your account.

482
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I want to know who would be interested to see me cheat. No. Just tell me if you want me to cheat.

483
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Cheat through life. All right. Hey, what was it?

484
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And I'm thinking of Eddie Guerrero in wrestling because he used to always cheat to win.

485
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But I don't know. I think it's the only one I ever hear about is Sami Zayn.

486
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I don't know why, but that's the only thing I ever hear about. It's fun to just, you know, just play for fun.

487
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You know, the challenge is great, but I've already done it 50 million times. I have nothing to prove.

488
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Whatever. Fair enough. I get good when you can cheat.

489
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Let's go over to Alan. Alan, how was your gaming week? What kind of games you've been up to lately?

490
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I haven't been playing a lot of games because the cat will not let me.

491
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is so true. So he used to just be fine in my lap when I played.

492
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But now, not only does he want to be on my desk, because I have a big enough desk for two monitors.

493
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If he plops himself down to the right of my keyboard, I can reach over and pet him. Everything is fine.

494
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But he specifically likes to be across the keyboard, literally, like, on top of.

495
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And you can't really play, or he'll attack my hand as I move the mouse.

496
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So there's a point where I'm just like, I'm not playing Overwatch right now. I'm just going to get up or do whatever.

497
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So yeah, it's endearing, but also annoying.

498
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
ActDeftInChat says, and that's a problem how? Mr. Smoosh deserves all the attention.

499
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
When I'm in the middle of a ranked match in Overwatch and he decides to do it,

500
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it is unfortunate for the people I'm playing with because I'm not entirely focused on the game.

501
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But he's also saving me from Overwatch because this particular season of ranked mode Overwatch has been terrible.

502
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And I should be playing it because every time I play it I get upset because the rounds and matches go really poorly.

503
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So I think he's just looking out for my emotional well-being.

504
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He's like, it's time to log off, honey. Put Overwatch down.

505
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's like the meme where it's time to stop posting with the cat paw on the mouse.

506
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He's like, you can play healer all you want. Your team's not going to win because you're in the doldrums of the toilet of ranked mode.

507
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Give it up. Give it up, sister. I was on a huge Dark Souls kick for a while.

508
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I played Dark Souls 2 to death. I think the last time I was on OLR I was playing Dark Souls 2.

509
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Pokemon Go, we do raids. We were driving by on our way to do something completely unrelated.

510
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We noticed a bunch of cars parked at the end of our street where a Pokemon raid is and we pulled over and we're like,

511
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
are you guys doing a Pokemon raid? So yeah, that was fun.

512
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And they're like, yeah, there's two of you, right? Because they needed two more people to have a full group.

513
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yes. So without giving away where we live, we've told the local people in our part of Sacramento,

514
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
if there's a Pokemon raid at this park, we just have to put on our shoes. We can walk there.

515
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So yeah, Pokemon Go, Dark Souls and Overwatch when the cat will allow me to play, that's really it.

516
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
All right. Not a whole lot.

517
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, VG Realness agreeing with you on Overwatch saying,

518
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
OMG, tell me about it. It is so bad this season. I know VG Realness has been doing some streaming

519
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and go check out the clips at VG Realness' channel because he's got some real interesting people over there.

520
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Once you dip below, like bronze is fine, but once you dip below 1300, 1200, there's no coming back.

521
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Come back the next season, do your new 10 placement matches. Once you get into the 1100s, you're just hurting yourself.

522
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You need to love yourself.

523
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says you should also put on pants, not just shoes. That is a good idea.

524
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah.

525
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Let's see, S2100 Matt says...

526
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The jury is still out on that one.

527
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Some of the people on ranked Overwatch are a little too intense when I played.

528
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I know Allen and the others here are not, but the intense randos are off putting.

529
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't know. I mean, then again, I don't really play ranked at all, but even in things like World of Warcraft,

530
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
where I'm running dungeons and people are being shitlords, like I just go K or cool.

531
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Like I don't even like I maybe engage them with like one word or even one letter responses and then I just ignore them.

532
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Like I know that's a hard thing to do. Sometimes it's easier probably in text, but like I just fuck them.

533
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Like I don't have to acknowledge them or anything.

534
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
In ranked mode, you should, I feel, have a headset, even if you don't want to say anything.

535
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Like if you don't want to talk to these people, if they say, hey, do you know how to play this healer?

536
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You should be able to grunt like yes or no.

537
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think that's a reasonable expectation to play ranked.

538
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But yeah, there are people because I will be like, I'll be the one that says, hey, let's switch it up because we only got a minute left.

539
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And this isn't working. It hasn't been working for the past four minutes and no one's really saying anything.

540
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So let's switch it up. But yeah, there are people that are like, God, you guys are all terrible.

541
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And it's like, we are in bronze. We're all bad. You're bad. We are all in the sewer together.

542
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So I mean, just call you the Ninja Turtles and you ain't Master Splinter.

543
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
When you point a finger at us, there are three fingers pointing at yourself.

544
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This is bronze. We have no aspirations of grandeur here.

545
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So before you say, God, you're all fucking terrible. You two.

546
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We're all in hell. We're all going to die here.

547
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So knock off the attitude.

548
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You're just getting cheered on in chat.

549
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Delvin is like having church right now.

550
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Tell them Alan, K Arts 1, drag them.

551
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I love it. So, yeah, we're all going to we're all going to die down here in bronze.

552
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, yeah, for ranked mode.

553
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Some people are terrified of of like they don't want to interact with the players.

554
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't think that's good for ranked because the whole point of it is that you're taking the match seriously.

555
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But once you're in that low of a level, it's just do what you can with what you got.

556
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And that's my gaming week. Go with what you know.

557
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
All right. My gaming week.

558
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I've been playing some Final Fantasy 14 because they unleashed the blue mage in Final Fantasy 14 this week,

559
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
which was fun for a minute. But then you kind of realize, like, I'm leveling this blue mage.

560
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm going around and getting all these spells and stuff.

561
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And why? Because you can't take it into current content or do anything really like cutting edge with it.

562
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So it's kind of it's like this entire little sideshow they built into the game, which was fun for a little bit.

563
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But like everybody figured out how to cheese it. Like you could kill.

564
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I maybe was guilty of participating, but basically you can switch to your level 70 character.

565
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Go find a level forty nine mob. You can't you can't do it with level fifty.

566
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You go find a level forty nine mob, kill it.

567
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And right before the XP is rewarded, use your macro to switch to blue mage.

568
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And you get all that experience on your blue mage and you level up like fast.

569
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So all you really have to do is go hunting for the spells, which is a little bit tedious, but I don't know.

570
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I might go back and keep trying it because I hear the Master Carnival is kind of fun,

571
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
which is like the end game thing for blue mage only.

572
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But I just I don't really totally understand Square Enix's and the development teams like stubbornness.

573
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And we don't want this to be a full job because it will be too overpowered.

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You could cast level five death on things.

575
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So it's like, OK, then just don't let people use that spell.

576
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Like limit the spells they can take with them into raids and things like that. It would not be crazy.

577
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Just say there's a magical field that prevents certain spells like it's fucking Final Fantasy.

578
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Make it up like a wizard did it. Yeah, a wizard.

579
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's it's a wizard, Harry. Like just it's not hard to just come up with something as why you're doing it a little differently.

580
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like I feel like they're like, we have to implement blue mage just like it was in Final Fantasy five.

581
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Never mind that blue mage was a class in Final Fantasy 11 that worked out very well.

582
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Actually, there are a ton of jobs in Final Fantasy 11 that 14 is never going to get.

583
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And blue mage could have just as easily been one of those like I'm not going back to that game.

584
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So I just you know, I I don't hate it as much as some people we know.

585
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And I'll give you give you that. But I it's just kind of one of those.

586
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It feels like I don't like that. It's like a sideshow. I just wish I mean, it's it's an OK sideshow.

587
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's about as exciting as things like PvP.

588
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But you know, I just wish there was a way they could kind of realize it into the full game.

589
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And I think it might mix up the meta a little bit. Did Stormblood introduce any new PvP maps like like the big group ones?

590
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I think so. I haven't played it a lot, but I think they have their their trying on bless bless their hearts.

591
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Bless their heart. I mean, actually, I got to say, I've played some PvP in Final Fantasy 14. It is kind of fun.

592
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It is. Well, that is a shame. It isn't as well known as something like World of Warcraft.

593
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But it's just it's it's a tough cookie to break into because so many people are playing World of Warcraft and some of those other PvP games.

594
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's hard to just put out a new game and expect it to take fire.

595
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But I'm not knocking the PvP scene of Final Fantasy 14.

596
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It actually they're they're the players that do it do a good job. And it is it is.

597
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I like that they it's a very different type of game than the rest of the base game.

598
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But anyway, that's enough about Final Fantasy 14.

599
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Other games I've been playing this week include World of Warcraft.

600
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Ironically, still working on leveling my shaman in that game.

601
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm going to start playing it again. Yeah. I'm waiting for Delvin to come back.

602
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I think they're opening the next raid next week, so I think he'll finally be back.

603
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm starting to wonder if I have out geared Delvin who's been raiding because ever since the last patch,

604
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
they're handing out like I level 370 and 375 gear like cookies.

605
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So I wonder if maybe I pass Delvin. He just doesn't know it yet.

606
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So I'd be really funny because he was helping me try to level and then kind of took a break to go play Overwatch and all that stuff.

607
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So that'd be fun. And then let's see what else Pokemon go as well.

608
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Something you didn't bring up that I want to is that event that they had over the weekend for the Phoebus.

609
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That was so bad. Like the event wasn't a normal community day.

610
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It was just for three hours.

611
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
All Pokestop quest rewards are going to let you catch Phoebus and you might be able to get a shiny.

612
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And it's like the quests were ridiculous. Like it should have been.

613
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
If they made it if they made it a week long, I would feel a lot differently about it.

614
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah. It needs or at least even just a full day.

615
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
A full day would have been a lot easier to stomach than just three hours.

616
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like they tried to make a second community day and I don't want to community days and Pokemon go a month.

617
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like just have one.

618
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And if you want to do the Phoebus thing is like a special event that goes for a day or two.

619
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Because they've done like two day events before.

620
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
They did the Farfetch'd was out here in the US for a couple of days.

621
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The love disc being shiny or whatever like that big. It was only a couple of days.

622
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So anyway, I just that was a trash event.

623
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It flopped and I hope they don't try something like that again.

624
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I mean, I was OK with the event itself.

625
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And if they want to make the quest like catch 15 Pokemon to finish the quest, then just give more time.

626
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You know, I mean, like, yeah, people do it for longer. That's all.

627
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So and some folks in chat act deaf saying, yeah, a weekend would have worked perfectly.

628
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It was frustrating to say the least.

629
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
As you and Matt says, I mean, the Pokemon requires you to walk 20 K in order to evolve.

630
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It just wasn't worth it. Yeah.

631
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I mean, technically, you would want after this.

632
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You would want two shinies because you want to keep the baby and then you want to evolve one.

633
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And I actually already have 100 percent Phoebus, which is now a melodic.

634
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah, I got that in an egg some time ago. So it's like a year ago.

635
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm not as big on the shinies. I mean, they're cool, but like I'm not Shane about it.

636
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
They're cool. I like the few shinies I have.

637
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But I like the 100 percent stuff more than I get really excited when I get a 95 percent of the shinies I have are.

638
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I have because of community days.

639
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I do not have the luck of catching.

640
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I remember once we were in Safeway and you got a shiny yellow Geodude and you like gay gasp.

641
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Well, because Geodudes do look cool.

642
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You know, they do. But I just finding a random one in the wild. Yeah.

643
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I have the worst luck. Yeah.

644
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So anyway. Yeah, I like finding them in the wild there.

645
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
They're pleasant little gifts. Like, I'm not going to be like, I don't care about shinies.

646
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Like, they're cool. But at the same time, like, oh, darn, I missed the Phoebus shiny.

647
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'm not going to lose sleep.

648
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I caught like 20 Wilmer's today. Not a single one was purple. I want a purple Wilmer.

649
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I think I hatched a purple one. Aren't they pink? I thought they were pink.

650
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
They're purple. They're purple. All right. Whatever.

651
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I believe you guys. Geez, Rob. Sorry.

652
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Anyway, that was it really for my gaming week.

653
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Next week, I still need to play New Super Mario Brothers U.

654
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I keep me needing to do a stream and I've just been preoccupied with other things.

655
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But also, if I'm not crazy, isn't this the week where like Kingdom Hearts 3 is like actually happening, right?

656
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Is that this week or is that next week?

657
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's the 20th Tuesday of not this upcoming week, but the next week.

658
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, OK. So it is next week.

659
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
29th. 29th.

660
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But I'm still like, well, I mean, the Utada Hikaru song is out with Skiller X.

661
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah.

662
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That hit Spotify and Apple Music and all that stuff this week.

663
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And like, I need to listen to the Japanese one first.

664
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's weird to think. I like the song, but I don't like the part where the Skrillex stuff is turned up to 11.

665
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Because like, you know, the part where she's singing like, let me face, let me face, I don't want to get muted.

666
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So I guess the whole thing.

667
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But like, you know, the little song and then like even with the drum and bass, I'm fine.

668
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But then when it goes like it's just like slow down, like stop.

669
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's just too, too much.

670
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Which is funny because there actually is a Skrillex song that I like all because of Deadpool.

671
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I have discovered that actually like Bangarang.

672
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
That's the whole scene was hilarious.

673
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And it was in Cactus Canyon Continued where they did the Cowboys versus Aliens thing.

674
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I really like the Celine Dion song that was in Deadpool.

675
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So I just think it's great that he got Celine Dion to.

676
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
She plays that in her Vegas show.

677
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, really?

678
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah, it's actually as far as like Celine Dion power ballads go, like it's a really good power ballad, honestly.

679
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So, hey, it is what it is. All right.

680
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I was listening to a podcast where someone was like,

681
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
there's not going to be an episode of this show when Kingdom Hearts three comes out because fuck y'all.

682
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And then they were like, Kingdom Hearts two came out when I was still in high school, like 15.

683
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And now this person is almost 30. And I was like, oh, my God.

684
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah, I was like, didn't Kingdom Hearts two come out like right before we started?

685
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh, children.

686
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Because Kingdom Hearts 2001 and Kingdom Hearts two is 2005.

687
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I don't know. No one look it up. Who cares?

688
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But yeah, it's been it's been a while. It's been a minute.

689
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Anyway, someone in chat, I'm sorry, I missed the name. It scrolled off.

690
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Someone in chat asked if I was actually wearing a corgi shirt.

691
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And I am. But it's actually like kind of like the memes.

692
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm trying to show it off on Twitch.

693
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We can actually see how the corgi is saying, bork, bork, bork.

694
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And I love this shirt.

695
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Like, I don't happen to own any dogs. We're more of a cat household.

696
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But if we did get a dog, I do want corgis.

697
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And I want eight of them on a lease, just like the Queen of England.

698
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
All of her corgis are dead.

699
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What? Why would you say that?

700
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No, it's true. She actually stopped breeding her corgis

701
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
because she doesn't want anyone to raise her dog's puppies.

702
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The line of what was her first dog's name?

703
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But she didn't want anyone else to raise the puppies from that line.

704
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm depressed. We're changing the topics.

705
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
All right.

706
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Great. Why don't we talk about depressing, violent things

707
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to start off the show tonight?

708
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Girl, I'm just all about the facts. You know me.

709
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I know. I know. All right.

710
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Let's move on. Let's get into some gamey news.

711
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
All right. Loki. Loki is not here tonight.

712
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Alan.

713
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Really?

714
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Look. Look.

715
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Do something.

716
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You're our current chaos bringer.

717
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Do you see any round table or like five guys in front of me?

718
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Do something one way for 17 years and then suddenly try to change it.

719
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yes.

720
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
All right. Alan, why don't you start us off with some news today?

721
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So, the irony is that right before it's my turn to talk about a news story,

722
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
my tablet apparently has crashed.

723
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But luckily, I know this off the top of my head.

724
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
NetherRealm Studios, who put out in 2017 Injustice 2,

725
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
they announced what pretty much everyone knew was in the pipeline.

726
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Mortal Kombat 11 was announced.

727
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
They had a big event where they invited a lot of YouTubers and Twitch streamers.

728
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Also, SonicFox was there.

729
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Our favorite blue furry fighting game champion.

730
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Oh, yeah. I love that guy. Yeah.

731
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah. So, a lot of the big names from EVO were there.

732
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And they announced 11 and they showed,

733
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
there's I think eight or nine characters official.

734
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But if you keep on top of stuff like this on YouTube or on Twitter,

735
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you'll see that in the playable demo.

736
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Because the people that got invites to actually play the game,

737
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
they got a copy of the video to put on their channels.

738
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I didn't know that you could do that.

739
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I thought if you went to a special event where you could play the game,

740
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that footage belonged to the company.

741
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But a lot of the people that I follow have been putting their time playing 11

742
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
on their own channels with them playing.

743
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The release date is April 23rd.

744
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It looks like it still has the...

745
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Each character has three different fighting styles.

746
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Cassie Cage in Mortal Kombat 10 had Hollywood, Ballistics,

747
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
or something else.

748
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Or Jax's daughter, Jackie, had full auto, shotgun, and tech or something.

749
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And that means that she has three special moves that are the same across all three.

750
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But then there are three more special moves that you only get

751
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
depending on which fighting thing that you're in.

752
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
X-ray attacks have been replaced with things called fatal blows.

753
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You can only use one fatal blow per match.

754
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So if you use your fatal blow in round one and it's a three-round match,

755
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
you don't get to use it the other two times.

756
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The antagonist is named Kronika, and it's the first new character.

757
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's the first main antagonist that's a woman in all of the Mortal Kombat games.

758
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Something to do with time travel, of course.

759
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I guess you've had bad girls before.

760
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Melina was kind of an antagonist.

761
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
They've always been a tertiary or the henchman.

762
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I didn't even really realize that until it was pointed out.

763
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
She's the first main end villain. That's cool.

764
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Mortal Kombat 9 was really incredible.

765
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I remember when the Sony network was down for two or three months,

766
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
two games came out that you couldn't enjoy them online

767
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
because of that Sony thing. It was 2007.

768
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It was Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat 9, the reboot.

769
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Mortal Kombat 9's really awesome thing was the story mode

770
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
where you get to play the game, but then in between each round

771
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
you got cut scenes and they sort of dictated which character you played

772
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
based on the perspective of who was witnessing the story.

773
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So they're keeping that in 11.

774
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It looks like the story...

775
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Because Mortal Kombat 9, sorry I'm jumping all over the place,

776
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
took the stories of the original Mortal Kombats 1, 2, and 3,

777
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
cleaned it up and unified it into one big storyline,

778
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and also parts of MK4 with Shinnok and did that.

779
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
MK10 was the storyline from Mortal Kombat 4 and then a new continuity,

780
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and I was hoping that Mortal Kombat 11 would have

781
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Deadly Alliance or Shaolin Monks,

782
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
because a lot of the Mortal Kombat sequels for PS2 and 3 were kind of garbage

783
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and they had a lot of throwaway characters that weren't memorable at all.

784
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I was hoping that they would take the existing canon, as ridiculous as it was,

785
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
throw out the trash and retell that story,

786
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
but with better writing for this new game.

787
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
We hardly know anything about the game,

788
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
but with this new antagonist, Kronika, and the time travel,

789
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
it looks like they are doing more of a departure as far as the story.

790
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The time travel element, I imagine, lets them bring back a lot of characters

791
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
that weren't in Mortal Kombat X.

792
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We already know that Baraka is back.

793
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Scarlet, she's like a blood mage, or like a blood ninja.

794
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And you thought she was kind of a throwaway character.

795
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
She was a really badass, awesome character in Mortal Kombat 9,

796
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
but she only existed as a DLC character in 9.

797
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And to see her back is really great.

798
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I think the big three that they need to announce to make all the fanboys happy

799
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is Cabal, because Cabal is awesome,

800
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Noob Sabat, they've already done Baraka,

801
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and Shang Tsung, really, those are the fan favorites that weren't in X

802
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
that people want to see in XI.

803
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So there are eight or nine...

804
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
When I played Mortal Kombat, I liked Cabal.

805
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So for those that don't know, I have historically really loved the Mortal Kombat franchise.

806
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I love the old games, they're fun, they're cartoony and gross and funny.

807
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But I enjoyed Mortal Kombat 9, kind of, and then Mortal Kombat X,

808
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm like, this is too much.

809
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Some of these fatalities are fucking gross.

810
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I just hit the point where I'm like, this is nasty.

811
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It was that one you showed me, and you called it when I finally broke,

812
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
was that Jax fatality where he puts out the cigar in the person's head.

813
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
He takes the top of their head and basically snaps their jaw back

814
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
so that their head hinges open like a trash can,

815
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and he puts the cigar out on their tongue, and you can see down the esophagus.

816
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The problem is, when it was the graphics level of Mortal Kombat 2 and 3,

817
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
it was a cartoon and it was funny, but it's too real now.

818
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So I tuned in to that Mortal Kombat 11 thing.

819
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Why wasn't he that real?

820
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Because I felt some sense of, oh, I'm a gamer, commentator guy,

821
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I should know what's going on, and I do like Mortal Kombat.

822
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So I tuned in just in time to see Baraka doing a fatality on Scorpion,

823
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
where I don't even remember what happened.

824
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
He stabs him four times, and each time is gross,

825
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and then he stabs him, pulls out his brain, and starts eating it,

826
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and I was like, done.

827
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
This is ridiculous.

828
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah, the end.

829
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Look, I get that it's over the top.

830
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I get that some of you are into stupid horror like that,

831
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
meaning over the top, not like I have friends.

832
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I work with the horror film festival here in SAC.

833
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I respect your guys' fandom.

834
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It is just, for me, I'm just like, I don't, just enough, enough.

835
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So that's it.

836
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I would like to just play Mortal Kombat without that level of craziness.

837
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So I like Injustice.

838
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah, I don't mind.

839
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Injustice is for me.

840
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't mind, because when I was a teenager,

841
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I would buy Fangoria magazine, and I really like horror,

842
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
which you wouldn't really know, because I don't,

843
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
it's not like we go see horror together.

844
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
My friend made me watch faces of death, and I cried.

845
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So I don't mind the detail of the graphics.

846
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I just want the deaths to be funny slash creative,

847
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
and a lot of the really gruesome fatalities in Mortal Kombat 10,

848
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
they were graphic, but they were also boring.

849
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Like, wouldn't it be awesome if we just made someone blow up

850
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
in their guts hanging from the ceiling?

851
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Not really, because that's not interesting.

852
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
The one that you really liked, that was gross,

853
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
that you thought was funny, was the Cassie Cage one

854
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
where she takes a selfie.

855
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You liked that one, that was gross.

856
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That one was pretty funny.

857
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It was funny. It was gross.

858
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, so a lot of people on YouTube have analyzed the footage

859
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
of what they showed at the special event,

860
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and you can see Kano in the background of a stage,

861
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
so people are like, okay, Kano's not confirmed,

862
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
but he's probably there.

863
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Same thing with Johnny Cage.

864
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
In some of the menus of the advanced modes,

865
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
like the time towers or whatever,

866
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
you can see Rain because it's tilted.

867
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It's tinted purple, and the silhouette is what Rain looks like.

868
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So even though they've only officially confirmed,

869
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I think, eight or nine out of the 25,

870
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I think there's going to be 25 core characters,

871
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
then 60 LC, they said, for a total of 31 or maybe 32.

872
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
If you're really into the putting on the little eyepiece

873
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and analyzing the meta of what footage,

874
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
you know that there's going to be more characters in there

875
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
than what they've announced.

876
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So I'm looking forward to it.

877
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I guess I'll pre-order it to get Shao Kahn,

878
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,000
even though he's one of the cheesiest fighting game bosses of all time.

879
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, so that's the thing that happened.

880
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Netherrealm Studios, Mortal Kombat 11.

881
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But I do think it's funny that, obviously, if you guys didn't already know,

882
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Alan and I just celebrated two years of marriage.

883
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We've been together for nine,

884
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and that I feel this way about Mortal Kombat,

885
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but Alan loves it, and I'm like, all right, have fun.

886
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Go play it over there where I don't have to watch it.

887
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I've literally turned into my mom.

888
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Some long-time OLR listeners may remember that clip.

889
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Oh, I wish I had it, because I even took video of it, funny enough.

890
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It was with Molina.

891
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, and I showed my mom some of the fatalities in Mortal Kombat 9,

892
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and I remember her sitting back there going,

893
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
This is so rad. This is gross.

894
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Who does this?

895
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And I've turned into that.

896
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Through the course of one game, when it came to Mortal Kombat 10,

897
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I turned into that.

898
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

899
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm glad that Mortal Kombat 7 Elis exists.

900
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I will not be buying it, but I hope you guys do and enjoy it.

901
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Perfectly said. Well said.

902
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I hope you have fun, honey.

903
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'll be over here playing Hello Kitty Adventure.

904
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Ronda Rousey is the voice actress for Sonya.

905
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Why, though?

906
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
If this had happened for Mortal Kombat 10 when she was an up-and-comer,

907
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and sort of like...

908
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Before she became people's problematic fave or was canceled, whatever.

909
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So, eh, I'm indifferent.

910
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
She's a UFC fighter.

911
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I think her last big match is she kind of got her ass beat more than she won,

912
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
which is neither here nor there.

913
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That's what's happened to athletes in that very dangerous sport.

914
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I guess she needs to get a paycheck from somewhere.

915
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Yeah, so...

916
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah.

917
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
All right.

918
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Next story.

919
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
All right, we will talk about the next story.

920
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well, if you want to watch people playing Mortal Kombat videos online,

921
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
you might be doing that on YouTube.

922
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And unfortunately, a lot of gaming-related YouTube videos

923
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
have recently come down.

924
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
That's because Machinima pulled all their videos this week,

925
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
like, just overnight.

926
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Gone.

927
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Apparently, this is because they're going to be merging with Alation,

928
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
part of OtterMedia, part of AT&T Warner.

929
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So you got to go down, like, four parent relationships there of companies,

930
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and that's where this is going.

931
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Apparently, some folks were not told that this was going to happen.

932
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Like, video producers had no idea this was going to happen.

933
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But there was a Twitch clip going around where Lawrence Santang

934
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
from Rooster Teeth tried to get some insight on what was going on.

935
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Warner, at this point, cannot verify the copyrights to all videos

936
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
in Machinima's network, and there are a ton of videos.

937
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It costs a lot of money to do it,

938
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and this is on videos that aren't getting any views.

939
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So they cut it loose.

940
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's that.

941
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That's a business.

942
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
That's how it goes.

943
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But, you know, there were a lot of people that partnered up with,

944
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
worked with Machinima, that just suddenly...

945
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Or made content for that channel.

946
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Because people were still making content,

947
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and some folks were being told they were being dropped from the network,

948
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
but who knows what's going to happen with Machinima now.

949
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But it's one of those big wake-up calls about this day and age that we live in,

950
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
is that someday the place where all the content is being made may go under

951
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
or choose to pull all the videos.

952
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I mean, I hate to say it, but Twitch would not even be immune to this.

953
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
This is a great home right now.

954
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm loving that we've been exposed to new folks.

955
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Shout out to any new people that have just discovered OLR

956
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
because of our move to Twitch recently.

957
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Say hi if you're out there.

958
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'd love to hear from you.

959
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But if you want to lurk, that's cool too,

960
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
because I like to lurk on Twitch feeds a lot too.

961
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
But, you know, Twitch may be gone someday.

962
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Who knows?

963
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Amazon might sell it.

964
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Twitch might, you know...

965
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Who knows?

966
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It might be gone today.

967
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm not saying negative.

968
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
That's just the reality.

969
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Things come, and things go.

970
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Just like people.

971
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
People come, people go.

972
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Right?

973
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And that may happen to Twitch.

974
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But the good news is, at least this is still a podcast,

975
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
so I feel like the content we're making couldn't disappear completely.

976
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
At least the audio is still going to be there somewhere in space.

977
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I know there's that OLR archive and stuff.

978
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Even if you can't download them,

979
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
you can download a lot of back episodes right now still.

980
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But, you know, there's unofficial archives and people have MP3s.

981
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
This still ultimately was the decision of an individual business

982
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
rather than YouTube coming down with their scythe

983
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and cutting a ton of content.

984
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It was...

985
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Well, but if you think about YouTube's hair-trigger copyright content thing,

986
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
that could have weighed in the decision.

987
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I mean, we can't say for sure.

988
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
But that could have weighed in the decision.

989
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
But I think ultimately it was kind of the copyright issue

990
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and the fact that, you know, there's still a lot of blurred lines.

991
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I mean, even when it comes to video games.

992
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Maybe Warner didn't want to get put in a situation

993
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
where somebody's doing a video about a Nintendo game

994
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
and now Nintendo wants to sue Warner

995
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
because, hey, that's my game in your clip

996
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
because, let's face it, a lot of these Let's Plays and things like that,

997
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
as far as, like, copyright stuff goes,

998
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
they still exist in this very kind of nebulous space

999
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
where a lot of creators don't care.

1000
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
They turn a blind eye to it.

1001
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But then you have companies like Nintendo who, up until recently,

1002
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I know they changed their thing recently,

1003
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
but up until recently was very actively trying to get a piece of the pie for themselves.

1004
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You know, it's a little bit of a blur out there.

1005
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Anyway, going to chat for some other comments here.

1006
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Questbuster says Maximilian Dood's videos were hit like this,

1007
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
but he was able to put them back up as a YouTube partner

1008
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
after talking with them and working it out.

1009
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
One more and then I'll get your comment.

1010
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
KArts1 says, Glad to see YouTube MCNs gradually fading away

1011
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
as content creators are wising up to their predatory practices

1012
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
and going independent with fan funding platforms like Patreon.

1013
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I never really considered Patreon as a YouTube competitor,

1014
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
but I suppose there is something to be said for that.

1015
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah, a lot of people that have had to censor their content on YouTube

1016
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
in order to keep it monetized,

1017
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
like World of Wonder who does RuPaul's Drag Race,

1018
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
they have to bleep out swear words.

1019
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
If you're a member of the Patreon or however that works,

1020
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
you can see the unedited videos.

1021
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That's another one with Vet Ranch,

1022
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
is they have to put up two copies of their videos

1023
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
because they do animal surgeries on there.

1024
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I like watching the surgeries.

1025
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
One of the horror YouTube channels I subscribe to is called Dead Meat.

1026
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
They do videos called Kill Counts.

1027
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's great if you're into horror.

1028
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
If the movie is really nasty, he has to put it on his Patreon.

1029
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
What I was going to say, MaxMillionDude,

1030
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
when I was saying if you know who to follow on YouTube,

1031
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
you can see all of the speculation of the little meta investigations

1032
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
as to who else is in Mortal Kombat 11.

1033
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
MaxMillionDude is one of the guys that I watch,

1034
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
and also Super, simply just the word Super,

1035
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
watch his gameplay videos of Mortal Kombat 10,

1036
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and the combos he does, they're incredible.

1037
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
He's my favorite YouTube fighting guy.

1038
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Okay, quite the endorsement.

1039
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
All right, well, let's move on from those vanishing YouTube videos

1040
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and talk about something else that's vanishing, right, DarkSakura?

1041
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yes, yes, yes, with a warning.

1042
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The Wii Shop is going away on January 31st.

1043
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Bye! Bye, bitch.

1044
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But all of the functions, of course, associated with it

1045
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
are going along with it.

1046
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So, meaning, like, if I wanted to redownload Final Fantasy IV,

1047
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The After Years, which was a great WiiWare title.

1048
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Wii Shop closes.

1049
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You can't do it. The Wii Shop's gone.

1050
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So, what you will need to do to get your shit is that...

1051
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Pirate them.

1052
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Girl.

1053
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Don't do that.

1054
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You can redownload all your games.

1055
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You can download them.

1056
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Basically, if you go to the Wii Shop channel

1057
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
and go to titles you've downloaded,

1058
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
after the 31st, you won't be able to redownload

1059
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
the ones that you've deleted.

1060
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And also, I mean, the video streaming apps

1061
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
are going to be useless after a while,

1062
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
so you can basically make yourself tons of room to save all those games.

1063
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I think a lot of them already are useless.

1064
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I think a lot of them are already closed.

1065
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The other thing, too, is that if you've got Wii points,

1066
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
spend them up.

1067
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You can't buy more.

1068
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
They turned that off a while ago.

1069
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
To be fair, they warned us about this.

1070
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You were warned.

1071
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But the limit is disappearing in two weeks, too.

1072
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah.

1073
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But the day is coming up.

1074
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And the very last thing is if you've got a Wii U,

1075
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
transfer your shit to your Wii U.

1076
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Do all of it.

1077
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
We did a transfer, like, a long ass time ago,

1078
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
so we're pretty okay with it.

1079
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But, I mean, I'd hate for people to spend all this money if they have

1080
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and then lose their stuff.

1081
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah.

1082
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's frustrating.

1083
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
One big thing I've been trying to do is that, you know,

1084
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
a lot of people bought the Wii, right?

1085
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It was one of the top selling consoles ever, right?

1086
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I was in line.

1087
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, that was something we did.

1088
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But here's the thing to keep in mind with that.

1089
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You probably know more casual gamers,

1090
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
like families that have a Wii in their house,

1091
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that have no idea this is coming.

1092
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Now, they may not use that Wii that much anymore,

1093
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
but I made a Facebook post and I just said,

1094
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
hey, I know I have some casual gamers that don't follow a bunch of gaming news,

1095
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
but if you own a Wii, you probably want to know about this.

1096
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Because I would bet I know people, like families,

1097
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
that just bought a 2,000 Wii Points card,

1098
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
put it in there and never spent the balance.

1099
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So get in there, spend it, download it.

1100
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Let your friends know that are more casual gamers that happen to know a Wii

1101
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
because they'll be pissed if it goes away and they didn't know.

1102
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Like, that one time, they want to go fire it up again

1103
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I mean, chances are if they haven't booted up their Wii in a year,

1104
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
they're probably never going to.

1105
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But I still think it's nice to give the heads up.

1106
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And, you know, why not?

1107
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's a chance to go back and maybe rediscover some stuff on Wii

1108
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
because as older as that console is,

1109
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
there was some great stuff on the Wii shop.

1110
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Like, Konami did those remakes of the Castlevania adventures

1111
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
and the Game Boys.

1112
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Like, that has not come out anywhere else,

1113
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
which is really unfortunate.

1114
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
The Final Fantasy IV After Years, they did do that,

1115
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
but they remade it.

1116
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So if you want the version that looks like Final Fantasy II or IV Super Nintendo,

1117
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
you got to get the one that's on the Wii.

1118
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
So, you know, just things to think about.

1119
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
But unfortunately, if you never bought the points,

1120
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
you're already cut off on that.

1121
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So you may have to turn to piracy for that,

1122
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and I don't usually endorse piracy,

1123
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
but if we're at the point where that is the only way to experience some of that stuff,

1124
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
then what can we do?

1125
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It also has a lot of people thinking right now about,

1126
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and it was funny, we got an email about this last week,

1127
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
so it almost kind of piggybacks on that about

1128
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
why to buy games digital versus why to buy them physical.

1129
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And this is something I think that really puts itself firmly in the go physical column

1130
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
is that if you had bought stuff, you know, anything you bought on the Wii digitally,

1131
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
you can't redownload it.

1132
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
If your Wii gets fried in a power failure or electrical storm,

1133
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
which I think happened to Bobby, that's it, sayonara.

1134
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So, something to think about, you know,

1135
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and I think I have a lot of people thinking about,

1136
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
oh, maybe with the Switch.

1137
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Now, the Switch has been very widely successful,

1138
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
but so was the Wii.

1139
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So as long as you are okay with the Switch getting shut off in 10 years,

1140
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I don't know.

1141
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
All right.

1142
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Going to chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network,

1143
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Bobby Blackwell says, yep, lost all my Wii digital purchases.

1144
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Granted, I maybe spent $30 total,

1145
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
but that's still 30 bucks, right?

1146
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Let's see.

1147
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Metal Mayhem points out the thing is, Rob, PC games are rarely physical nowadays.

1148
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Very true points.

1149
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I'm not sure how to respond to that.

1150
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I mean, shops like Steam have it written into their rules

1151
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
that like if Steam ever gets pulled down,

1152
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
they have a button that they can press that kills all the DMCA.

1153
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So you'll at least be able to play your purchases.

1154
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And let's be real.

1155
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There's a lot of abandonware.

1156
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Yeah.

1157
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Right.

1158
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Where people are like, well, technically copyright law only applies so law.

1159
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I think Nintendo would feel very differently about this

1160
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
in the ROM sites they took down.

1161
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah.

1162
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But whatever.

1163
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I think a lot of companies turn a blind eye to it.

1164
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But there's a abandonware thing where old games you can usually download.

1165
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
GOG tried to market this stuff, but GOG couldn't survive on it.

1166
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
They're trying to, you know.

1167
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah.

1168
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It's kind of the sideshow of their service now.

1169
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And now they showed their true colors too,

1170
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
what jerks they are.

1171
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Well, that's a whole other Oprah.

1172
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
If there's a special edition of like From Software announced

1173
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Dark Souls trilogy and you can buy a super mega edition

1174
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
or like Mortal Kombat 11 with like a bust of Scorpion

1175
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
and like, you know, I don't know, a cloth tapestry to put on your wall.

1176
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Like fan stuff.

1177
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
A plate and spoon and fork and a cloth.

1178
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
If you're willing to pay $150 for this special edition

1179
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
that comes in like a big box, you can get the game plus all this fandom crap.

1180
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Those are only for the console version of games now.

1181
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
You can't get those.

1182
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I think Skyrim was the last PC.

1183
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I mean, I'm sure Skyrim was like seven years ago.

1184
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So obviously I'm sure there have been some since.

1185
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But by and large for the last two or three years,

1186
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
if you want the special fan stuff, you have to get it on console

1187
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
because they don't make those for PC.

1188
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You can just download the game is my point.

1189
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Let me read a couple other comments from chat here.

1190
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Nifty 805 says, someone somewhere is still buying Just Dance for Wii.

1191
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
True.

1192
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I mean, remember, sometimes in other countries,

1193
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
places that aren't the US or one of the main European territories

1194
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
where games are launched first or Japan,

1195
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
if you're in a different country, sometimes you do get stuff later.

1196
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And you know, like we've had on the show before in Brazil,

1197
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
the Sega Genesis is still kind of having its heyday.

1198
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
You know what I mean?

1199
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
The Master System was the big one.

1200
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
For a long time because, you know, after it kind of died here,

1201
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
they got a lot of the second run.

1202
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
A lot of Genesis conversions were made specifically for the Brazilian market.

1203
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Yeah.

1204
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
For Master System.

1205
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And it's not like Brazil is some small country.

1206
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
You know, these places are huge.

1207
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
There's a lot of people there.

1208
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Brazil is kind of fucked up right now.

1209
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah.

1210
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Again, a whole nother robot.

1211
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Let's see.

1212
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Tiger Claw in chat says, in fact, I bet you can still find Wii games

1213
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
or so at a thrift store or flea market.

1214
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Oh, absolutely.

1215
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Absolutely.

1216
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
There's still tons of Wii games.

1217
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh, yeah.

1218
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
If we went to a random store.

1219
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The flea market.

1220
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah.

1221
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
You'd find tons.

1222
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Of course.

1223
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
All right.

1224
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Well, let's move on.

1225
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Let's talk about our next story, which Alan,

1226
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I think you're going to talk about, which kind of on your LOL anthem

1227
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
bandwidth a little bit.

1228
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah.

1229
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So Visceral Games, who I believe also made Dead Space, I think,

1230
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
which EA ruined and drove under the ground.

1231
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
EA shut down Visceral Games in 2017.

1232
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Visceral Games at the time was working on a Star Wars game

1233
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
that was code named, Star Wars game code named Ragtag.

1234
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
When Visceral was shut down by EA, they gave those assets,

1235
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
the Visceral had, and spun it off to EA Vancouver.

1236
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And it was supposed, the Visceral's vision of the game was supposed to be,

1237
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I think, single player campaign, just like a narrative Star Wars game.

1238
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
But EA Vancouver was supposed to make it into an open world.

1239
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And open world is, I don't know, like, I mean,

1240
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
open world is like your Breath of the Wild, your Skyrim,

1241
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
your Elder Scrolls, your, just take that thought already.

1242
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Sure. But like, you know, that would have been cool. I would have played that.

1243
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Yeah. Well, it's been cancelled.

1244
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So when it was still a Visceral Games property,

1245
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
they did have a few screenshots or a few concept art things.

1246
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
So Visceral did have something to show.

1247
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Nothing, since this game was handed to EA Vancouver,

1248
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
they have not themselves put out little snippets of their own work.

1249
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:11,000
So it's kind of just been vaporware since it was handed to them.

1250
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And now EA has confirmed that it's been cancelled.

1251
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
However, Star Wars Battlefront II is still being updated.

1252
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And also Respawn, which I think is something under the giant EA umbrella,

1253
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
because really who can keep track of how fucking big they are now,

1254
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
are working on a game called Jedi Fallen Order,

1255
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
and those are still things that are happening or will happen.

1256
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So EA is like, we're not just sitting on the Star Wars license,

1257
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
even though when LucasArts had it, they made 5,000 games, you know,

1258
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
but now that we have it, but whatever.

1259
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So it was one of the last few...

1260
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Granted, it was LucasArts, but...

1261
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It was one of the last gasps of Visceral Games.

1262
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It was given to EA Vancouver, and EA, I guess, didn't like where it was going

1263
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
or how it was turning out, so it's gone.

1264
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That's too bad.

1265
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Short and sweet.

1266
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
That's too bad.

1267
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
All right, well, bummer for those folks that were working on it.

1268
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It sounds like a cool concept.

1269
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I wonder where it went wrong.

1270
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Maybe it just was something that didn't work or didn't play well

1271
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
or didn't feel right.

1272
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I don't know.

1273
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Well, another game that is disappearing,

1274
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
but this one's already been out there, and it's a very different reason.

1275
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Westward Mobile.

1276
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That's right.

1277
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I don't know how many of you guys are watching that show.

1278
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I'm sorry, not Westward, Westworld, excuse me,

1279
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
because it's based off that TV show, which I admittedly have never seen

1280
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
because I'm usually doing podcasts on Sunday night,

1281
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and, you know, very few shows I ever watch anymore.

1282
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It's like androids in the Wild West with titties.

1283
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Okay, I've only seen the Drag Race parody

1284
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
when they did West Girl or whatever they called it.

1285
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
They did Breastworld.

1286
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Breastworld.

1287
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I saw that, and that episode was so bad

1288
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
because I didn't understand any of it

1289
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
because I guess it was a parody of the show.

1290
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
But anyway, and I don't know why Eureka never got sent home.

1291
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But anyway, we won't talk about that.

1292
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That's a different podcast that you do.

1293
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Sorry, all right.

1294
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Different show.

1295
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Anyway, Westworld Mobile was a little too similar to Fallout Shelter

1296
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
because Bethesda took them to court.

1297
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Bethesda took Behavior Interactive and Warner Brothers to court over it,

1298
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
and you know what's happened?

1299
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And nobody knows if this is directly a result or what's going on,

1300
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
but Warner Brothers has pulled Westworld Mobile from the app stores.

1301
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
In-app purchases have been disabled in the game,

1302
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and you can still play the game through April 16th.

1303
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
That is the day when it's going to be shut down for good.

1304
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Previously, after suing the pants off of Behavior Interactive,

1305
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Bethesda and they both said the two sides claimed

1306
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
there was an amicable end to the lawsuit,

1307
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
but apparently that meant you got to shut the game down.

1308
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And so they put out a little statement.

1309
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
We hope you've enjoyed playing it.

1310
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
We're sorry to tell you the park is entering a new phase

1311
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and will no longer be taking applications for new employees.

1312
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It's going away.

1313
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Bummer to those folks that spent money on the game,

1314
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
but again, this is something I have to remember

1315
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
when I play Pokemon Go.

1316
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
When I spend money on coins and incubators and bag upgrades,

1317
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
which yes, I may have done a time or two,

1318
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
that is going to go away someday.

1319
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Pokemon Go will not exist forever.

1320
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
In ten years, the technology will be so good,

1321
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
there's probably a different type of game that supersedes Pokemon Go,

1322
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and that's the game that we're playing.

1323
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It starts to look like the Detective Pikachu movie,

1324
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
but in real life through our AR glasses,

1325
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
our hololenses, and all that stuff.

1326
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But all that joking aside, we have to remember

1327
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
this money we spend on things is not going to be around forever,

1328
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
and it's a hard lesson learned as well for this Westworld game,

1329
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
because I don't think they're doing refunds.

1330
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I don't see refunds anywhere here.

1331
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So when you buy things, it's for the moment, and that's that.

1332
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So there it is.

1333
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Going to our chat room.

1334
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Let's see.

1335
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Some folks in chat are talking about, oh,

1336
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
SG100Matt saying, I saw the original movie.

1337
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That's it.

1338
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Bonz006 says, I don't know if he meant to say HoloLens,

1339
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
but it says I want HaloLens in my actual glasses.

1340
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I don't know, that whole Google Glass thing kind of went away.

1341
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But I mean, I know Microsoft still has HoloLens back there somewhere,

1342
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
as something they're going to do someday

1343
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
on a more commercial front.

1344
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Who knows?

1345
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I would still think there's going to be that in the future.

1346
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
We're all going to have little things like Geordie LaForge on Star Trek,

1347
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
but for him, it was to help him with his blindness, if I remember right.

1348
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
For us, it'll be how we see AR, like a gaming device.

1349
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I don't know. I don't know. We'll see.

1350
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, they're doing a lot with HoloLens.

1351
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You just don't see it because it's not in your purview.

1352
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's a lot of not gaming stuff, which to be fair, sure, that's fine.

1353
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And that's where Kinect kind of ended up being strongest, right?

1354
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Like, Kinect, as much as Microsoft has pretty much killed that off for gaming, effectively,

1355
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Kinect, as far as I know, is still going, especially in hospitals

1356
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
and places where you need the very sterile types of environments

1357
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
where the gesturing and all that is actually really good to be able to navigate.

1358
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
So, I would imagine HoloLens could have a similar market in,

1359
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
you know, this show focuses on gaming,

1360
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
but what could HoloLens and that AR technology do for other industries,

1361
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
medicine, science, you know, exploration?

1362
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
You know, imagine being able to put on the HoloLens

1363
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
and explore Mars from a rover that's sending you images back.

1364
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Who knows? Who knows?

1365
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I don't want to get too sci-fi, but that is, it is what it is.

1366
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
All right, let's move on.

1367
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Dark Sakura, take us to something maybe a little more traditional, I don't know.

1368
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Traditional?

1369
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Ish.

1370
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It's not very traditional, but it's really nice.

1371
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So, Fortnite.

1372
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
What do we hear about Fortnite all the time?

1373
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Angry seven-year-olds calling each other horrible names.

1374
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Well, Tim Sweeney, who is the game's creator, is doing other stuff,

1375
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
but it's not really much to do with the game itself.

1376
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
He, now that he has Uber money from the Fortnite,

1377
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
he is actually doing some more philanthropy.

1378
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
He is using his money to buy parts of the Carolina mountains

1379
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
so that they are not deforested.

1380
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
He's purchased nearly 40,000 acres of land,

1381
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
which makes him one of the largest private landowners in North Carolina.

1382
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
He's also used his money to participate in conservation parcel projects,

1383
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
like expanding 1,500 acres to Mount Mitchell State Park.

1384
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And so he donated also $15 million for a conservation project

1385
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
for Box Creek Wilderness.

1386
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And the other thing about the area that he bought

1387
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
is that it's part of the Blue Ridge Mountains,

1388
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
some rather untouched, pristine land.

1389
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Corporations have had their eyes on it for a while.

1390
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
He outbid them and took the land to keep it from being ruined.

1391
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Wow, that's a pretty big move.

1392
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
That's why I always say forests are the more traditional thing.

1393
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
It's so that he can do a battle royale for real.

1394
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Your ass is going to get dropped into that forest.

1395
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Or is he setting up a preserve?

1396
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Wasn't this the twist in the village?

1397
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Possibly.

1398
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Sorry if I ruined that movie for you, but I actually saved you in a way.

1399
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I liked that movie, but it's only worth seeing once.

1400
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And it's like 20 years old.

1401
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
If you haven't seen it at this point, you're not going to.

1402
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Anyway, but I'd like to read his quote about it, if that's fine.

1403
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Sure.

1404
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It's one of the most diverse areas in North Carolina.

1405
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
It has such rare plant and wildlife species.

1406
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It seems a perfect fit with the Fish and Wildlife Service.

1407
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
This is a first step.

1408
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
There will be other places protected.

1409
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
The goal is to connect South Mountain State Park to Chimney Rock.

1410
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
This is one piece of the puzzle.

1411
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I just have to read this comment from chat.

1412
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I'm sorry because I'm cracking up.

1413
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm sorry if I pronounced your name wrong.

1414
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Jay's Unown.

1415
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm sorry, Jay's You None.

1416
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm sorry, I don't know which way it's pronounced.

1417
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But says in the chat, 100 content creators get dropped into a forest.

1418
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Yes, maybe this is his elaborate setup for, you know,

1419
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
all these people that play Fortnite.

1420
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It's like, now show us what you've learned.

1421
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Drop Ninja.

1422
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Drop Jake and Logan Paul in there.

1423
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
They get the frying pan to protect themselves.

1424
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Sorry, Jamie.

1425
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Well, at any rate, the other thing is that he's actually been keeping full transparency on this.

1426
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So that instead of just, you know, being all fake and quiet about it,

1427
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
he's being very public with it and saying, no, this is it.

1428
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
In writing, this land will not be developed.

1429
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And just looking at the pictures of the scenery, it is super, super gorgeous.

1430
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Now, he also did outbid for another piece of land.

1431
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
A 1500 acre place that was called Stone Hill.

1432
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Stone Hill that he actually outbid people that wanted to turn it into a fucking golf resort.

1433
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Can Tim Sweeney please buy all of the land around Dollywood and the Smoky Mountains

1434
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and just to make sure Dollywood is always preserved and will be a monument to humanity?

1435
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Actually, I think that Dolly owns the land around it.

1436
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Oh, good. Oh, good.

1437
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Well, don't take it from Dolly.

1438
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
If Dolly owns it, Dolly keeps it.

1439
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
But, you know, I just want to, I'm just trying to protect Dollywood.

1440
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And honestly, she's also someone else for her philanthropy that I'm really happy with

1441
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
because she goes out and gives all those books to kids.

1442
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Oh, yeah.

1443
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And she does so much.

1444
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And on top of that, she is so, it's kind of a rarity in the country industry,

1445
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
country music industry to find someone who's so LGBTQA, et cetera, friendly.

1446
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Luckily, we're seeing more and more of it, especially with the younger folks.

1447
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So that's good.

1448
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But I was going to say, since we were talking about perfect people tonight,

1449
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Jamie Lee Curtis is in that list.

1450
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I would definitely say Dolly Parton is absolutely in the list of perfect people.

1451
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Absolutely.

1452
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Along with Dark Soccer, Rob Roberts and Loki.

1453
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And Alan.

1454
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Oh, yeah. Alan's, Alan's all right.

1455
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I guess you could put Dan in there, too.

1456
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Okay. Anyway, all joking aside, Bobby Blackwell says,

1457
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I want Tim Sweeney to carve the initials ZZT into one of the trees.

1458
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Who would have thought, who would have thought all those years ago,

1459
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
did you ever play ZZT, Alan?

1460
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Who would have thought all those years ago playing ZZT,

1461
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
that this would be the guy that now is like literally saving the forest

1462
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
because of his success from Fortnite.

1463
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Bobby also has the comment, the winning comment that says Fire Knight.

1464
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
All we need to do is just have him find like a clearing and put like a,

1465
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
fairy stones in the middle and then just leave it there.

1466
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
All right. With a, with a cast iron pan in the center.

1467
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Let's move on to a couple more stories before we get to our classic game of the week.

1468
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Although there might be, there might be a twist, so stay tuned.

1469
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Y'all wanted a twist.

1470
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
All right. Anyway, we promised a twist in 2019, so stay tuned.

1471
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You might be hearing about a game you've heard about before,

1472
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
but in a different way.

1473
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
All right.

1474
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Spoilers.

1475
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I'm not, you've done like 500 games, Jamie.

1476
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
All right.

1477
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Have I?

1478
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah. This is episode 760.

1479
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
There's that many games?

1480
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
You started that segment 250. Anyway.

1481
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Fucking A.

1482
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Moving on.

1483
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Alan, what would you like to talk to us about?

1484
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Overwatch's next seasonal event, which is for the lunar new year.

1485
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
It's the year of the pig.

1486
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
No comments from the peanut gallery.

1487
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Thank you very much.

1488
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Is it the year of the nasty pig?

1489
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Yeah.

1490
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I'm gonna leave it at that.

1491
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Hi, Delvin.

1492
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I'm gonna leave it at that.

1493
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Drag her, expose her.

1494
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
People are watching are like, what the fuck are they talking about?

1495
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
From January 24th through February 18th,

1496
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
there's going to be ranked capture the flag mode,

1497
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
new legendary skins and epic skins of the sort of Chinese New Year motif.

1498
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Soldier 76, who I will talk about in more detail in just a minute,

1499
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
is getting, if anyone ever saw Karate Kid 2,

1500
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
there's those little, I don't know if, what the real context of the culture is,

1501
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
but at the end of Karate Kid 2, they had those little leather bound drums

1502
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
with the little beads on them that each family had its own symbol.

1503
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I think it's Okinawan.

1504
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Okay, Okinawan.

1505
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
All right.

1506
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Oh, yeah.

1507
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
That's very much like Blizzard to have a Chinese New Year event,

1508
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
but then put Japanese cultural things in it

1509
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
because it's all one big mishmash, right?

1510
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Who cares?

1511
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
New emotes, victory poses, voice lines.

1512
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
You have about, I think, three weeks to get it.

1513
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
You get it via loot boxes.

1514
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
You can earn three loot boxes a week in arcade mode.

1515
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
For every third match you win, you get a loot box.

1516
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
So you win nine matches total. That's three.

1517
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And then the more you play, you XP.

1518
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
You gain levels.

1519
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You also get a loot box from leveling.

1520
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So if you play the fuck out of Overwatch for these three weeks,

1521
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
you get enough loot boxes more than likely to get what you want to get.

1522
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Because usually you're like, I don't play this character,

1523
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
so I don't really care about that costume,

1524
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
but I really want the Mercy one or whatever,

1525
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
though I think she got one last year, so she's not due for one this year.

1526
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
So yeah, you don't have to give Blizzard your money

1527
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
to buy these loot boxes. Just play the game.

1528
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
But it helps.

1529
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Yeah, it helps.

1530
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And also, if you're going to get some money,

1531
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
wait until the last day of the event.

1532
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Don't just give them $40 and open up a bunch of loot boxes,

1533
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
because you may actually get what you want in the free ones.

1534
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Yes, yeah.

1535
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
So this was a new story back when it was very stormy,

1536
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
and the show lost its power.

1537
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Yeah, the OLR week, we had to cut the show short.

1538
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I will keep this brief, because I know all three of us in here

1539
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
could talk about this for hours.

1540
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It was announced that Soldier 76 is canonically gay.

1541
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I've enjoyed the fallout of that announcement

1542
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
from the people that it upset more than I care about the fact.

1543
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I think 76, honestly, is kind of a boring character.

1544
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I would have much preferred that Zarya is a butch-les,

1545
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
because I know a lot of lady people that are lady friends

1546
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
who are in love with Zarya and want Zarya to carry them in her big, beefy arms.

1547
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
But what we want in our fanfic isn't always what we get.

1548
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yes.

1549
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
More ace characters, please.

1550
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Yes.

1551
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Who knows?

1552
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Or Junkrat, I think would be...

1553
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
He's not your stereotypical...

1554
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Okay, fan wank all you want.

1555
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
They might release some stuff later, though.

1556
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
But anyway, so people are upset.

1557
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
They're like 76. They made 76 gay for no reason.

1558
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I'm going to let all of you watching on Twitch

1559
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
and listening on the podcast in on a little secret.

1560
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I, myself, am gay for no reason.

1561
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Wait, what, you're gay?

1562
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Yes.

1563
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Oh, my God.

1564
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Just is how I turned out.

1565
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So the reason why stuff like this is important is

1566
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
people say, who cares, why does it matter?

1567
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
There's nothing in the canon to suggest that 76 was heterosexual.

1568
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
There's no official girlfriend. There's no dead wife story.

1569
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
He has a few lines of conversation with Anna

1570
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
that one could maybe infer was flirtatious.

1571
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But unless someone says, oh, by the way...

1572
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I flirt with girls.

1573
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Oh, by the way, this character is gay.

1574
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
The default is to assume that he's straight

1575
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
even though there isn't any evidence

1576
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
because, again, this is a video game.

1577
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Some characters, of course, have the dead wife story

1578
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
where you're like, okay, he was married to a woman.

1579
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
He's probably, you know, at least bi.

1580
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So for them to say, oh, yeah, 76 is gay,

1581
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
for people to get so upset about that,

1582
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
it's because the 14-year-olds

1583
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
that are upset about this announcement

1584
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
don't see a character whose sexuality is ambiguous

1585
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and go, oh, I can't make assumptions about this

1586
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
because they haven't said either way.

1587
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
No, they're going to assume, unless they're told otherwise,

1588
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
the character is straight, and that is why

1589
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
announcements like this is sort of like,

1590
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
hey, you make up like 85% of the population,

1591
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
so we're not really worried about

1592
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
you not seeing enough of yourself in media.

1593
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So let's pick a character and just say,

1594
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
hey, I mean, there's already a ton of fanfic

1595
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
that him and Reaper have a very sordid past

1596
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
now that, you know, Reaper is dead and everything

1597
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
and an edgelord in that Hot Topic mask.

1598
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
But, yeah, it's been fun watching people say,

1599
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
oh, I don't care that 76 is gay, why does it matter?

1600
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But then the same people will also say,

1601
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I don't want to play 76 anymore

1602
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
because I don't want people to think that I'm a Fraggle,

1603
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
but not a Fraggle.

1604
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
It's another word with an F and two Gs.

1605
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So it's funny, and I'm glad Blizzard did it

1606
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
just to stir shit, honestly,

1607
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
because ultimately it doesn't matter,

1608
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and it's like the whole thing about people being triggered

1609
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
and the unique snowflakes,

1610
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
but once something like this comes out,

1611
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
the people that accuse people of being too sensitive

1612
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
lose their goddamn minds is hilarious to me.

1613
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
That's all.

1614
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Well, Alan, the chat room would like me

1615
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
to do this on your behalf.

1616
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
No.

1617
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So the one thing that I would like to see,

1618
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
because you could get a spray of 76 and his partner,

1619
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
who we've never heard of before,

1620
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
so this really is like something

1621
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
that Blizzard pulled out of their ass.

1622
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I thought, wasn't there like a picture

1623
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
from an earlier thing that was brought up?

1624
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
That could be true because the Overwatch lore

1625
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
is so filled with like huge gaps of contradictory nonsense

1626
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
that you don't really follow the story

1627
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
of Overwatch that much,

1628
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
but I would love a dial, because 76, he's like a dad.

1629
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
He wears awful, clashy, plaid polka dot clothes,

1630
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
and he like is a...

1631
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
He wears socks with sandals, for God's sake.

1632
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah, and he's all about the barbecue,

1633
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and he dances with like no rhythm,

1634
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
and he's kind of like, you know, this.

1635
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So I would love it if they still snuck in.

1636
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Like if Ana says,

1637
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
76, how about after the mission we go to brunch?

1638
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And he says, you know I love brunch, or whatever.

1639
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I would find that hilarious

1640
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
if they gave him more little dog whistle things

1641
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
aside from a spray of him and his boyfriend,

1642
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
because it wouldn't make him effeminate or anything.

1643
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Just say, hey, the man loves his brunch.

1644
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
He likes a French toast.

1645
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Right. Oh, my God.

1646
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Sia Tabiri says, bottomless mimosas.

1647
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
That could be a line, yeah.

1648
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Anyway, sorry.

1649
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Some of the chatters are saying,

1650
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
ow, that mic drop hurt my ears.

1651
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I'm very sorry.

1652
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I had to get the effect for the podcast.

1653
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I'm sorry. I didn't think it would be that loud.

1654
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And just if you're worried, there is carpet down here.

1655
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
It's a solid floor.

1656
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
There's like a rug here.

1657
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So it did not drop on a solid floor.

1658
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
All right, anyway.

1659
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Uh-oh.

1660
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Oh, there you go.

1661
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
So isn't that funny?

1662
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Nifty in chat says, smoosh is breaking our hearts

1663
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
by refusing to make a cameo tonight.

1664
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And so Dark Soccer just made it happen for you guys.

1665
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
There you go.

1666
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So that's all.

1667
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Smoosh will let me hold him sometimes.

1668
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Blizzard did something really random,

1669
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and people that claim to be above it all lost their minds,

1670
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
and I found that to be hilarious.

1671
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And the Lunar New Year event is coming next week.

1672
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
All right.

1673
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
That's all.

1674
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I don't know if you'll find this hilarious as well,

1675
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
but probably not.

1676
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
But Assassin's Creed Odyssey, you know,

1677
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I don't know how much you know about this game,

1678
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
but they took the BioWare approach

1679
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
where you could kind of select a lot of different paths

1680
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for your character and that whole thing.

1681
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
And you can also openly romance whatever gender you want

1682
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
because it's 2019, and so we have that kind of reflection

1683
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
of fluid sexualities in the game.

1684
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,000
So anyway, the controversy is coming from this first DLC,

1685
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
or excuse me, the latest DLC that just came out,

1686
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Legacy of the First Blade Part II,

1687
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:20,000
because in this DLC, you have a baby with another character.

1688
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Now, that's not to say that gay folks cannot adopt babies,

1689
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
but you have a baby the old-fashioned way

1690
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
with another character.

1691
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And so the child grows up and so forth,

1692
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
so some folks are kind of pissed about that

1693
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
because it broke the cannons that they had

1694
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
for their characters before.

1695
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Now, to be fair, Ubisoft has come out since and said,

1696
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
we missed the mark with the DLC,

1697
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
and they wanted to, according to the creative director

1698
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
named Jonathan Demont, players should not be forced

1699
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
to engage in a lasting romantic relationship

1700
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
with the DLC character.

1701
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
The player can engage to carry on the assassin's bloodline.

1702
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
They can choose to move on afterwards

1703
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and continue their relationship.

1704
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So I guess that's something they're going to be changing

1705
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
with the DLC and making that work out.

1706
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
So anyway, not handled the best way to be like,

1707
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
hey, you've got choice, psych.

1708
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
One of the best games that has done this right,

1709
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I think, is Sims 4, because in Sims 3 or 4,

1710
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
you can be like, can this character have kids?

1711
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It doesn't ask you what gender they are.

1712
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Can this character have kids? Yes.

1713
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
How do you want them to, like, whatever?

1714
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Because it's a video game. It's not real.

1715
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
If they just say, if there's the main character

1716
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
and his male gay romance and they have a baby,

1717
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
just don't explain it.

1718
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Just don't explain where this baby came from.

1719
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh, we had it the biological way.

1720
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's a video game. It's not real.

1721
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It's not hard in this day and age to figure out

1722
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
how two people of the same gender end up with a kid.

1723
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
There's many different ways to do it.

1724
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Many, many, many. Anyway.

1725
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I realize, though, this is a game set in history,

1726
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
but still, come on.

1727
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
You can't do so much of this and then take two steps back.

1728
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Assassin's Creed is based off of,

1729
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
what's the main storyline? Genetic memory.

1730
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Where you're going back through your DNA to the memories.

1731
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
That's not real.

1732
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Good point. That's not real.

1733
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So, they don't need to make things make sense

1734
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
when it comes to stuff like this, in my opinion.

1735
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Fair enough. No, I agree. Fair enough.

1736
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
All right. Well, let's move on.

1737
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Let's get to another segment we like to do here.

1738
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Every week on the show, we step into the gaming vault.

1739
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I'm sorry, I did not yet bring in the music,

1740
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
so I don't have the cute little music.

1741
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Just this week, I'll work on that.

1742
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I see how it is.

1743
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I'll work on a proper bumper for next time.

1744
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Well, technically, tonight's segment is a little different anyway.

1745
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So, tonight, usually once a week, we have Dark Sakura

1746
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1747
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
hey, you kids should be playing this game

1748
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
and find a classic game of the week.

1749
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
But, we mentioned at the end of last year, once a month,

1750
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
so what, in 2017, you did classic consoles, right?

1751
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Mm-hmm.

1752
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
2018, you did classic peripherals.

1753
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Mm-hmm.

1754
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
In 2019, she's going to do classic soundtracks.

1755
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
So, Dark Sakura.

1756
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Specific this year.

1757
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Specific.

1758
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
8-bit soundtracks.

1759
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Oh, okay.

1760
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Oh, I didn't know you were going that far.

1761
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Don't box yourself in, girl.

1762
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
No, because next year, I'm going to do 16-bit.

1763
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
All right.

1764
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
All right.

1765
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Because I'm lazy.

1766
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Well, what is the classic soundtrack of the week?

1767
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Duh.

1768
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
The Guardian Legend.

1769
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Great pick.

1770
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Because it has really good music, but since the game,

1771
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
people don't always recognize the game, you know?

1772
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And it's got such good music that I really am just like,

1773
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
why do not enough people give this game's soundtrack its due?

1774
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:03,000
So, the music was composed by Miyamoto Masatomo,

1775
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and Sanzō Takashi.

1776
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And it actually, so much of this, I mean,

1777
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
it's still popular today that one of the most popular

1778
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
of the OC remixes is a Guardian Legend remix.

1779
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
It was like the second most popular track they had in 2002.

1780
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
It was pretty crazy.

1781
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,000
And then even several cover bands,

1782
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
like video game cover bands,

1783
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
have done tunes from the Guardian Legend.

1784
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
But as for the composers themselves,

1785
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
just to give them some attention is Miyamoto did,

1786
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
he actually was one of the music designers for Gardick,

1787
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
and Zanac, and Govellius for MSX2.

1788
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I'm trying to look at some others that might have been

1789
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
known a little bit better outside of Japan.

1790
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Xevious Faudrot Saga for MSX2.

1791
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
He mostly did NES, SMS, and NES music.

1792
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
But also, sorry, MSX is what I meant.

1793
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
But is really just like, mostly did the compile stuff.

1794
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
He also did some Godzilla games.

1795
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:25,000
As far as Santo, he basically worked on the same music tracks

1796
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,000
like Govellius for MSX, Guardian Legend for NES,

1797
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Tombs and Treasure, and Govellius Valley of Doom

1798
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
for the Sega Master System.

1799
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
He also was sound effects designer for Psycho Chaser

1800
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
for PC Engine and Override for PC Engine.

1801
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But at any rate, I don't know who would argue with me

1802
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
that this doesn't have a place amongst one of the top

1803
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
underrated video game soundtracks out there.

1804
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I love this soundtrack. It is so underrated.

1805
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I wish I had found the music for you that's my favorite.

1806
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
It's one of, I think it's like, whatever the point is.

1807
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I hate the bullet noises in this. They're so loud.

1808
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
So I'm sorry if that's overpowering things a little bit.

1809
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
This is something I'll listen to at the soundtrack in my car.

1810
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Yeah. Oh no, it's so good.

1811
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
It's pretty amazing.

1812
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
There's some good shout out to OC Remix,

1813
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
because we've been trying to feature them

1814
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and their talents more and more as we've moved over to Twitch.

1815
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
They've got some great remixes there.

1816
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
They have this orchestral one.

1817
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
It's been up there for years, but I love it.

1818
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
It makes it sound like this game could be a frickin' movie.

1819
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yeah.

1820
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
But, you know, we've all ranted and raved about this game,

1821
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,000
but the thing that, for all of the stuff that this game does,

1822
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
to have such an amazing soundtrack on top of it,

1823
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
it's just like, this is like the Monte Cristo at Disneyland.

1824
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
The perfect sandwich.

1825
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
That's what this is.

1826
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It's the perfect, perfect game.

1827
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Do you have like a favorite song?

1828
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Well, yeah, so I was saying, it's one in,

1829
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I can't remember the level it is, but it's like,

1830
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I think the blue background where it's all,

1831
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
it's one of the walking levels, one of the adventure levels,

1832
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
and it's just really chill.

1833
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
It's just a chill piece, and I'll listen to that just over and over.

1834
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I think my very favorite is the one we just heard

1835
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
with the very first corridor, Area Zero.

1836
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah.

1837
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Yeah, I love it.

1838
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And I like this music too, because it sets the mood for the game.

1839
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
And also, you find Lolo.

1840
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
You do?

1841
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Yeah, but again, it's just one of, I think,

1842
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
the best soundtracks there are.

1843
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And like I said, you know, now I guess a month ago,

1844
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
this segment is going to be to highlight soundtracks

1845
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
that you might not be familiar with,

1846
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
or might not have thought of amongst the best,

1847
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
but they really deserve the attention.

1848
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
So you probably will not be highlighting Super Mario Brothers,

1849
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
because everybody knows that one.

1850
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Everyone knows it, or the Zelda games, or Mega Man.

1851
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Okay.

1852
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
You know, I'm not going to go in those directions.

1853
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I'm going to go with the stuff that people don't often think of.

1854
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And with as much as we talk about Guardian Legend,

1855
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
usually we're talking about how it plays.

1856
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah, and to be fair, you know, again,

1857
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
we've been doing the Classic Game of the Week since Episode 250,

1858
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and I'm sure this was one of the first ten.

1859
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I don't think it was the first.

1860
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I don't think it was the first.

1861
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I think you did the game with the witches that you love, scrolling.

1862
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Not Cotton. I didn't do Cotton, did I?

1863
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I thought you did do Cotton was one of your first picks.

1864
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Hold on, hold on.

1865
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
But I'm looking at it.

1866
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
It's Fantasy Zone.

1867
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It's Fantasy Zone.

1868
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
It's Fantasy Zone.

1869
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Oh, it's Fantasy Zone?

1870
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Okay.

1871
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Yeah.

1872
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
But Guardian Legend had to have been one of the first ten.

1873
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Guardian Legend was six episodes in.

1874
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Okay, so yeah, we haven't talked about it in several years.

1875
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I can't believe I did Blazing Star before that,

1876
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
but I love Blazing Star in Kid Dracula.

1877
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I think it was one of those things,

1878
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
you were saving Guardian Legend for a week,

1879
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
then you couldn't come up with anything else,

1880
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
and six weeks in, you couldn't come up with anything else.

1881
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Well, then you did the week after.

1882
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I did.

1883
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And then Loki did the week after that.

1884
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
You probably weren't here for a little bit.

1885
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
You probably took a break, so it happens.

1886
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
All right, anyway, anything else to say about the soundtrack here

1887
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
for our Classic Soundtrack of the Month, the Guardian Legend?

1888
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I am still super pissed that the fan remake got C&D'd, because...

1889
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Oh, yeah, there's some footage of it out on YouTube, you can see.

1890
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
But I just wish that they would just still do it under the table

1891
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and release it anyway.

1892
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Well, you know.

1893
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
That's Lolo.

1894
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Isn't it Lunar or something?

1895
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I don't know, but I just bought Lolo because it looks like Lolo.

1896
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It does.

1897
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
But anyway, all right, I'm going to go ahead and kill the music there,

1898
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
take it back to us in the studio.

1899
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
There it is, your classic soundtrack.

1900
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Everybody's reading me because it says Classic Game of the Week on the side.

1901
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I didn't want to ruin it.

1902
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
If I'd put Classic Soundtrack, you would have known you'd get a soundtrack tonight,

1903
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
so just deal with it.

1904
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
All right, anyway.

1905
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
You wrote you.

1906
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Without any Roxy, thank you.

1907
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
All right, I love the Guardian Legend, it's a great soundtrack.

1908
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Anyway, we're going to take a little break here in studio,

1909
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
but what's awesome about tonight,

1910
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
so what we've been doing on Twitch the past few weeks,

1911
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
because Dark Soccer has been working Sundays,

1912
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
she's kind of had a segment that fills in here,

1913
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
she's been doing her Classic Game of the Week as a segment.

1914
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Well, tonight we have something very special.

1915
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
We actually have a viewer video that's going to be talking about MAGFest.

1916
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
So sg100matt sent us a video, and I'm going to play it for you guys now.

1917
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
He did a great job on it, where he's actually going to take you guys to MAGFest

1918
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
to get to experience a little bit of it.

1919
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And I love this, and with Jamie hopefully coming back to the show full time in March,

1920
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
if everything goes her way with the work situation,

1921
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I really want to invite other people to kind of help build this segment with us,

1922
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
like a little halfway point during the show,

1923
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
so we have a chance to get up and refill our waters

1924
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
and use the restroom and all that stuff,

1925
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
and hopefully we can feature other Twitch streamers.

1926
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
We can feature maybe some indie games or some other things.

1927
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So anyway, I'll let sg100matt take it from here with a special look at MAGFest,

1928
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
and we'll be back after this.

1929
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Hello, LR and VOG Network.

1930
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
This is sg100matt.

1931
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I am sending you the first ever video email to the mailbag.

1932
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Now that the show is on Twitch,

1933
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I figure this will be a fun way to send an email.

1934
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It also gives Rob's voice a little bit of a rest so he doesn't have to read anything.

1935
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
So for years you've heard me and along with many others talk about MAGFest.

1936
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I know that I've called in several times over the years to talk about it,

1937
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
and the one thing I always notice is that I've had a hard time articulating

1938
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
and explaining what MAGFest is all about.

1939
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Now that we have this wonderful platform and video,

1940
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I figured why don't I just show you what MAGFest is all about.

1941
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Now over the course of the weekend I took some pictures and shot some video

1942
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
to kind of really show what my experience is there.

1943
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Now don't worry, podcast listeners.

1944
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I'll do my best to explain what I'm showing.

1945
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
But enough about me. Let's get to it.

1946
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
So MAGFest is short for Music and Gaming Festival,

1947
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
and it takes place just outside of Washington, D.C.

1948
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
at the Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center.

1949
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
The show runs 24 hours nonstop from Thursday to Sunday.

1950
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
The place hosts the panels, concerts, and various forms of gaming and fandom.

1951
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
The show is run by fans for fans.

1952
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
It's not corporate run, and none of the major studios or console makers are there.

1953
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
It has a strong, independent feel,

1954
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
and almost feels like a big video game party with your friends.

1955
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
The first thing I'm going to talk about is the music portion of the festival.

1956
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Throughout the weekend in the Grand Ballroom at the Convention Center,

1957
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
various video game cover bands and chiptune artists took the stage.

1958
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
This year's group of talent was a stacked roster of artists,

1959
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
such as MC Frontalot of the Tiberian Sons,

1960
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
featuring Command & Conquer composer Frank Klepacki,

1961
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
and friend of the VOG network, Megaran.

1962
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,000
There was also Chiptune Rave hosted by a slew of DJs.

1963
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
One concert that I really enjoyed was the Bit Brigade,

1964
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
who played the entire Mega Man 2 soundtrack,

1965
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
while a player speedran the entire game.

1966
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
It was definitely a fun experience.

1967
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Now the last concert I really enjoyed was performed by Bernalfoss.

1968
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
He performed at the Gaylord Hotel Lobby Bar,

1969
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
which was the first for the festival.

1970
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
It was really cool to kind of see him perform in a piano bar sort of environment.

1971
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Now the cute aspect that I like about MAGFest

1972
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
is the music wasn't just dedicated to the concert halls.

1973
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
In these little squared off spaces known as Jam Pods,

1974
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
people can bring in an instrument or DJ setup to just jam out.

1975
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It's kind of like MAGFest's take on street performers,

1976
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,000
but it's just regular attendees playing a DJ set or an artist covering gaming tunes.

1977
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Moving on to the rest of the festival.

1978
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
One of the big draws to MAGFest is downstairs at the Expo Hall.

1979
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
The Expo Hall is home to the Vendor's Hall,

1980
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
the MAGFest Indie Games Showcase,

1981
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
as well as the console, free play, and arcade room.

1982
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Now both the arcade and console room are open,

1983
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
free to play, 24 hours non-stop during the duration of the festival.

1984
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:58,000
There are over 100 arcade machines that are provided by collectors and vendors

1985
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
from around the area, and they're all set on free play.

1986
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
No quarters or tokens required, and again,

1987
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
they're running 24 hours the whole weekend.

1988
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
If you have an itch to play a game at 3 AM, you certainly could.

1989
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
So the arcade hall was split up into different sections.

1990
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
There was an area called Candyland that had a lot of Japanese-style sit-down arcade cabinets

1991
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
which had various fighting games and bullet-hell shooters all loaded onto them.

1992
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
There was a Japanese import and music game area that had a lot of Bimani games

1993
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
like Pop'n Music, Bimani 2DX, U-Beat, as well as Technica.

1994
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Various versions of Pump It Up and DDR were also there.

1995
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
There were just a ton of games there, including Initial D and Bishiboshi, just to name a few.

1996
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000
There was a great selection of retro machines as well.

1997
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I got to play some of my favorite machines like Row Blasters, Virtual On, Dragon's Lair, and Tempest.

1998
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,000
One great sight was seeing an F-Zero AX full-motion arcade machine.

1999
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Those were really hard to find and it was a huge line the whole weekend planned.

2000
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
This year had probably the biggest showing of pinball machines.

2001
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
There were so many machines, both new and old, that were fun to play.

2002
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:17,000
There were dual table machines. There were tables from both big companies and small companies.

2003
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
There were tables with LCDs. There were tables that were just giant.

2004
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
There were just tables that I had never seen before.

2005
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
If you were a pinball fan, there was a table for you.

2006
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Now on top of all that, there were periodic tournaments in the arcade hall

2007
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:39,000
ranging from games like Killer Queen, to Windjammers, to pinball tournaments, to even a claw machine tournament.

2008
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
There was just so much to do in the arcade hall this year.

2009
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Let's talk about indie games.

2010
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:53,000
The MAGFest Indie Game Showcase is always a treat and a great spot to see and meet a lot of indie developers.

2011
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
A friend of the show YYR showcased there a few times.

2012
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
One game I really liked is a game called Soundfall by Drastic Games.

2013
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Soundfall is a music-driven dungeon crawler where players hack and slash their way through levels to the beat of music.

2014
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
The game looks beautiful and extremely well done.

2015
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Be sure to check it out when it comes out this year on PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Switch.

2016
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Now the Indie Showcase isn't just dedicated to games that are set for mass release.

2017
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
There are some really wacky arcade machines as well.

2018
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Some of these are just proof of concepts and not meant for mass release.

2019
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
One game in particular had you control characters using four juicers.

2020
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:44,000
As you can see here, users touch the direction they want to move their character that's on the screen

2021
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
using said juicer and oranges that were supplied.

2022
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:58,000
In the console hall, you can rent out various consoles and games at MAGFest's massive library to play at any time during the weekend.

2023
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Say if you wanted to play Adventure on the Atari 2600 or TimeSplitters on the PS2 at 3am.

2024
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Then you can just come on down to the hall and play them.

2025
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,000
There are over 100 TVs set up for people to play any game they wanted to in MAGFest's game library.

2026
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And even run a tournament if you wanted to.

2027
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:26,000
One of the highlights of the expo hall that has become a frequent guest over the years to the festival are the BattleTech pods.

2028
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:37,000
The BattleTech pods are a fun experience where you can play a 10-minute free-for-all mech battle against other people in a fully enclosed pod with flight controls.

2029
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,000
After your game, you are even given a printout of the complete stats of your match.

2030
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
There were about 8 pods there and were provided by a group called Virtual World from Michigan.

2031
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,000
All these machines, despite being built in the early 90s, were extremely well maintained and taken care of.

2032
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And of course, they were free to play and were running 24 hours throughout the festival.

2033
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Now outside of the expo hall, MAGFest had a lot going on this weekend.

2034
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
There were a ton of different panels running at all times during the festival.

2035
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:21,000
There were voice actor panels, there were celebrity Q&As from people like WWE wrestler and hardcore gamer Xavier Woods.

2036
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
There were panels about teaching people how to make things.

2037
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
There was a class about how to make your own chainmail armor.

2038
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,000
There was a class taught by Freddie Wong about video editing.

2039
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:36,000
There were even some strange panels like the lore and mythos of Disney's Haunted Mansion.

2040
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
The one panel I'd been waiting to go for years, but never got a chance to, was the Yoga for Gamers panel.

2041
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:48,000
It is something that's always popular, but I just never had the time to do it, but now I made the effort to try it out.

2042
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
This class was taught by an actual yoga instructor, who played some calming video game music while we did yoga.

2043
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I'd never done yoga before, and for a first timer, this was a really fun experience.

2044
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Some have said that MAGFest has gotten too big and has outgrown its venue.

2045
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I don't dispute that MAGFest has certainly exploded and has even branched down into other festivals like MAG Labs and MAG West.

2046
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
But this year's show had so much going on that the crowds felt spread out.

2047
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:30,000
There were the concerts, there were the panels, there were the cosplay and LARP scene, the expo hall, there was laser tag, there were bridge commander rooms and demo scene rooms.

2048
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
There was a classic computer museum, which I'm showing right now.

2049
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,000
There was also a massive board gaming room, which moved to a different location this year.

2050
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Anyways, it did not feel like the 22,000 plus attendance that MAGFest reported this year.

2051
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
The crowd really just felt spread out and manageable.

2052
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
This was certainly one of the better MAGFests that I attended all my years of going.

2053
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,000
The staff at MAGFest really focused on being inclusive and accessible to everyone, like there were gender neutral bathrooms.

2054
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
At registration, pronoun ribbons were provided for people who wanted one.

2055
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
MAGFest even provided listening impaired attendees licensed sign language interpreters.

2056
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
All in all, the vibe at MAGFest felt great this year.

2057
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:24,000
The big complaint that most people have, though, was the hotel situation.

2058
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Despite there being five hotels within walking distance of the festival, those tend to sell out quickly.

2059
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I, for example, had to stay off site two miles away because I did not look at what the hotel lottery system at MAGFest has.

2060
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:44,000
But even that turned out fine because the travel to the show through shuttle and ride sharing was manageable and easy.

2061
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
All in all, I had a great time at MAGFest this year.

2062
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,000
If you're a gamer of any kind, I can't recommend MAGFest enough for you.

2063
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
So that pretty much wraps it up for me.

2064
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I hope you enjoyed this video email and this little trip to MAGFest with me.

2065
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
And I hope this video inspires you to make your own video content for the show.

2066
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
But anyways, back to the show.

2067
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
That was great! Oh my god, sorry, the video started over again because I didn't hit the button fast enough.

2068
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,000
But that was great! Thank you so much, s2100matt, for that look at MAGFest.

2069
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
That was so awesome. I loved it.

2070
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I hope that doesn't scare you guys off from doing your own because I think Matt has a lot of practice editing a video.

2071
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But I would hope that some other folks will consider doing their own video.

2072
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I thought that was a great way to take a look at something that maybe not everybody has seen before.

2073
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I've been to MAGFest a couple of times before, but I haven't been in a couple of years.

2074
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,000
So it was kind of neat to see how some of the offerings this year were a little bit different and some of that cosplay.

2075
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I know not everybody on the podcast will get to see this, sorry, do the best we can.

2076
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
But there was a really adorable Snorlax cosplayer that showed up in that video.

2077
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I was like, oh my god, that's so cute! It was really great.

2078
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:01,000
It felt like we got to really see that through the eyes of one of our listeners and people that participate with the show, s2100matt.

2079
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I would really encourage you guys, if you are going off to conventions that we need to see or be a part of, send some video over.

2080
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:14,000
It doesn't have to be as graceful as what Matt did, but send us a little bit of an intro and an outro and we'll figure out a way to put it together.

2081
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It was very, very, very cool.

2082
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:25,000
So yeah, going to chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, we had some really great feedback there on the video.

2083
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
AlphaKnotagram saying very grateful for that.

2084
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And yeah, it was great. Loved it. So very cool.

2085
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That was your first time getting to kind of see MAGFest.

2086
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Do you guys hear Alan and Jamie? Did it look pretty cool? It looked like fun?

2087
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

2088
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Lovely cool.

2089
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Yeah, it looked pretty cool. We'll have to do something like that for DragonCon too this year.

2090
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So look for that. Maybe VOG will produce our own stuff too.

2091
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Anyway, we're going to travel around and do some rapid fire news now and talk about some other news that's happened in the gaming industry pretty quickly here in our rapid fire news segment.

2092
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
So let's go over to where are we starting? I think Alan tonight with rapid fire.

2093
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Yep. Yep.

2094
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
So everyone's favorite video app for watching torrented movies and porn.

2095
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
VLC media player.

2096
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Or it also powers the videos. The video you just saw from Messaging100Matt was VLC is built into OBS.

2097
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I believe in truth in journalism.

2098
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
No fake news here.

2099
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Yeah. So VLC media player, which has been around for ages. That is true.

2100
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:45,000
The president and lead developer of it Jean Baptiste Kempf has sort of wondered aloud, maybe VLC on the Switch would be fun and useful for people with Switch because the owner base is quite large because Switch is a smash hit.

2101
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Right now VLC is available on Xbox One. So this is not completely uncommon for them to do something like this.

2102
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So that is maybe a thing. He's just sort of, you know.

2103
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Yet still no Netflix. But VLC.

2104
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Oh, yeah.

2105
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Yeah. There's Hulu at least I guess.

2106
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Funny you should say Hulu. I love that segue.

2107
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Who who?

2108
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Hulu is dropping Wii U support the little Nintendo console that just couldn't on February 20th of this year.

2109
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I don't know if Hulu means or no longer supporting it means you can run the app if you already have it.

2110
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And if you try to contact tech support about it, they'll be like, no, we that's old news. We don't help people with problems with that.

2111
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Or if it means it's going to be like if you try to load the app, it's going to give you an error message.

2112
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:56,000
The point is, is that they're not if you have Hulu on the Wii U and that is your main source of watching Hulu find literally anything else to watch Hulu on after February 20th.

2113
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Literally anything else.

2114
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Yeah. If you if you have Hulu for your toaster oven and that's they support that. Watch your shows on the toaster oven with Hulu or the switch.

2115
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I imagine many we you people have moved on to switch many, many, many of them. So there you go.

2116
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Yes. So no longer supporting I think is a vague term. It just means.

2117
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Run Hulu anywhere else than the Wii U.

2118
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
All right. I'm done.

2119
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Speaking of things you can run on many different places, Rocket League, that full cross-play compatibility, it's live now.

2120
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:32,000
So PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC all can do battle.

2121
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Psyonix did announce this past week that the cross-play beta supports I guess is the beta, but it's still live.

2122
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
So that means you can now all play Rocket League together. That is awesome.

2123
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
We've come a long way since last year when Sony was really dragging their feet on it. So this is great.

2124
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I think there's going to be just more and more and more people that go in on this.

2125
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
So anyway, I guess it was three months ago they did the cross-platform beta.

2126
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
So now Rocket League players on all these different platforms,

2127
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:03,000
they have the option to randomly match make either with or against each other and all the different online match types.

2128
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:10,000
That is awesome. But you do want to make sure that the cross-play platform box is ticked in the gameplay tab.

2129
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
It is not something that necessarily will be enabled.

2130
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:20,000
We talked earlier in the show about the Nintendo games coming to the Nintendo games that are on Switch Online.

2131
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:25,000
We talked last week about Super Nintendo games possibly coming to Switch Online because of a data mine.

2132
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Well, the data mine went a step further in this past week probably because of the latest update we just got that brought,

2133
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
what games did we get, Blaster Master and Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link.

2134
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
And then we got that fighting game in Japan only.

2135
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:44,000
But anyway, also in that update, descriptions. Some of them for a Super Nintendo game.

2136
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Apparently the description for Super Mario World that reads,

2137
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:56,000
there's no time for vacation when Bowser and his Kooplings are up to no good during a vacation in Dinosaur Land and so on and so on.

2138
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It's the little flavor text for the game that's in the little library when you go to select games.

2139
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
It's in there now in English for Super Mario World.

2140
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
The interesting thing is that's the only game that has English.

2141
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:14,000
But some other languages like Super, excuse me, some other games like Super Mario Kart got a Spanish description.

2142
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:21,000
In fact, a lot of games in there now have descriptions in looks like eight different languages.

2143
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Including German, Spanish, French, Italian and so forth.

2144
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
All the countries where Nintendo usually localizes its stuff.

2145
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
The only one that's in there is Super Mario World for English.

2146
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
But folks have been able to data mine based on the descriptions.

2147
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Potentially a launch lineup could look like this.

2148
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Again, this is all rumors.

2149
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But Breath of Fire 2, Contra 3, Demon's Crest, F-Zero, Kirby Dream Course, Kirby Dream Land 3, Kirby Super Star, Mystical Ninja, Pilot Wings, Poppin' Twinbee, Super Goals and Ghosts, Mario All Stars is still kind of a question mark.

2150
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Super Mario Kart, Super Mario World, Super Metroid, Super Punch-Out, Zelda A Link to the Past.

2151
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
That's a very solid list.

2152
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
You've got your Marios, your Super Metroid, your Zelda in there.

2153
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
But then you have some deeper cuts like Poppin' Twinbee, like Jamie's kind of losing it over there.

2154
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Breath of Fire 2, Mystical Ninja and some more like deeper cuts that were good Super Nintendo games.

2155
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
So that's a hell of a launch.

2156
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I hope this is a thing Nintendo is about to go.

2157
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
You wanted us to bring even more online? Here you go, Thwack.

2158
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
So, we'll see.

2159
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Again, this is all rumors.

2160
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
But, I mean, why would they put the descriptions in there if they weren't planning to do something with it? Am I right, kids?

2161
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2162
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Actually, some pretty neat things.

2163
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Bandai Namco released a little bit of teaser information about a new game focusing on the world of Dragon Ball Z in particular.

2164
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:55,000
So, they've just listed as Dragon Ball Game Project Z Action RPG.

2165
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:03,000
As well as bringing out more characters for Dragon Ball Fighter Z, including someone from Universe 11.

2166
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So, now I have to go back and watch all that Dragon Ball again to figure out who the one from Universe 11 is.

2167
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I have to actually remember what Universe 11 is from Super.

2168
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
That's just how much I remembered of it.

2169
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I don't know shit about Dragon Ball, sorry.

2170
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Other than Ultra Instinct and Vegeta losing his shit like he always does.

2171
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I know that's a meme. I know that much.

2172
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
He always loses his shit. That's just a trope.

2173
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
And then, last but not least in this.

2174
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:40,000
There is going to be, well at least it was listed this way as a separate download.

2175
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:47,000
They said that Final Fantasy X HD Remaster for Switch is going to be available on the game card.

2176
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
But Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster is download only.

2177
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Which, I mean, I've got originals. That's cool.

2178
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I have an import of it. That's also cool.

2179
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
But are they portable?

2180
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Well, no. But I mean, I think it's just kind of weird that they would have one on the card and not sell the other.

2181
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Especially with what we were going over for about owning the copy versus the downloadable.

2182
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Good point. One, this is rumor.

2183
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,000
But two, it's one of those things that I could really see this happening because Mega Man Legends did the same thing.

2184
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It might just be cartridge size limitations.

2185
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
And if they were to include a second physical card, they'd have to up the price of it.

2186
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Why not?

2187
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

2188
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Or why not take orders or something for it?

2189
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
But I will say, I know you do have the originals, but the remaster is really good.

2190
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Did you get the remaster on Playstation 4 or PC?

2191
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
No, I didn't get the remasters.

2192
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Oh, you should. They are good. They did a good job with them.

2193
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And they're on PC and PS4 and everything else.

2194
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Does Titus still have like an idiot?

2195
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Of course. That's the part you have to have. Ha ha!

2196
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I'd rather not.

2197
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Yes, Alan?

2198
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
The X and X2 remasters for...

2199
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Ten.

2200
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Oh, sorry. Ten and Ten Two remasters for Steam PC are unfortunately, and I discovered this myself when I tried playing it about a month ago.

2201
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
And then I hit the forums and read it to see if I could do anything about this.

2202
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:18,000
It's actually hard capped at 30 frames a second, which on PC seems very silly.

2203
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I thought there was a hack for it.

2204
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I looked for one. I couldn't find one.

2205
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:34,000
But Square has since learned their lesson because Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2 and the Final Fantasy XII remaster with Balthier and Fran all run at 60 or higher.

2206
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:40,000
So it's just Ten and Ten Two, which is one of the first remasters they put out on Steam.

2207
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Aside from the little single digit ones, like four and five and whatnot.

2208
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
The sort of water colored and 3DS ones.

2209
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
That is an unfortunate thing for the PC version.

2210
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
In our chat room, great comment from Spyro Jonathan, who would know a few things about the Spyro series, saying

2211
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
this same situation happened with Spyro Reignited Trilogy.

2212
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Everyone had to download Spyro 2 and 3.

2213
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
So it's not like this is unheard of.

2214
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
And as I mentioned before, the Mega Man collection did the same thing.

2215
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Interesting. For me personally, I love the fact that these games are coming to Switch.

2216
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I love that they're going to be portable.

2217
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I'm not going to buy them again.

2218
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I have them on PC. I have them on PlayStation 4.

2219
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,000
My need to have it portable is not that strong.

2220
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
How often do you see me playing my Switch portable anyway?

2221
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
When I go on a flight.

2222
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
When Animal Crossing comes out.

2223
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Or in bed when you're waiting for your eyes to get tired.

2224
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
That's about it.

2225
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
That's it. I think that's it for rapid fire news.

2226
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
But we want to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

2227
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
And check out some video games coming to a store near you.

2228
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I think we'll start in the US.

2229
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Are you going to take this over for Loki tonight?

2230
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Yes.

2231
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
What have you got for us?

2232
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,000
On the 22nd, Chaos Child is coming out on Windows.

2233
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
For Windows.

2234
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Also on the 22nd, the Raven Remastered for Nintendo Switch.

2235
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
On the 23rd, we have At the Gates on Windows.

2236
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
The 24th brings us three titles.

2237
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Battle Fleet Gothic Armada 2 for Windows.

2238
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Life is Strange 2 Episode 2 Rules on Windows, PS4 and Xbox One.

2239
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And My Memory of Us on the Nintendo Switch.

2240
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
That's all on the 24th of January.

2241
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:28,000
The 25th brings us Resident Evil 2 Remaster on the big three.

2242
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Actually, that's not big three because Nintendo Switch would be in that.

2243
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
On Windows slash Steam, PS4 and Xbox One.

2244
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
The Resident Evil 2 Remaster.

2245
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Any releases after that bleed into the next week.

2246
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
So there's going to be another OLR before that.

2247
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
But yeah, the 29th is Kingdom Hearts 3.

2248
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
But again, that is more than a week out.

2249
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Okay, so here's why I was thinking Kingdom Hearts 3 was this week.

2250
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Because looking at the Japanese release dates,

2251
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
they're getting Kingdom Hearts on the 25th.

2252
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
So they're getting it a few days earlier.

2253
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
So Kingdom Hearts 3 will be out in the wild officially.

2254
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Not any of that.

2255
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Is it 2002 again? What the fuck?

2256
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I know, right?

2257
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So in Japan, looking at the Japanese release dates,

2258
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
obviously that is the huge tent pole for this week.

2259
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
And there's not a lot of games going up against it.

2260
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

2261
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Very big deal.

2262
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I believe there's a whole little, like,

2263
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
you can get the game with, like, an art statue thing.

2264
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I think they may even have a special PlayStation for it out there as well,

2265
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
which is a pretty big deal.

2266
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
But also coming out, actually, Biohazard is coming out.

2267
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Biohazard 2 is the Resident Evil 2.

2268
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
So it's going up against Kingdom Hearts over there in Japan.

2269
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
So that's pretty cool.

2270
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
And let's see, going over to some other releases.

2271
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Senran Kagura Burst on the...

2272
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I'm sorry, that was a U.S. date that snuck in there.

2273
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Higurashi no Naku Koro no Hyo in Japan is out on the 24th.

2274
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
So there's a couple games sneaking in there the day before Kingdom Hearts,

2275
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
but that's it.

2276
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Suke to Suke 2-Day Sankaku Renai

2277
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and Sengoku Hime Senun Sanuraku Guren no Ishii in regular and limited edition.

2278
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Checking the Switch real quick to see if anything's coming out there.

2279
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
No, I think they're taking the week off.

2280
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Probably conceding this week over to the PlayStation 4

2281
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
and the huge, huge, huge release of Kingdom Hearts 3.

2282
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
So traveling over to Europe, were you able to get that?

2283
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:27,000
The Raven remastered on the 21st on the 24th Resident Evil 2 remake.

2284
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:33,000
And also on the 24th, Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story plus Bowser Jr.'s journey.

2285
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Alright.

2286
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
That's it.

2287
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Well, we are about to go to the mailbag, but before we do...

2288
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I just realized I should have downloaded and played the Resident Evil 2 demo for PC.

2289
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
It may not even...

2290
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Because I know for Resident Evil 7 where you start in the house

2291
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
and you have that flashback of the journalist,

2292
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,000
that demo, you can't get it anymore because they want you to buy the game.

2293
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
So I hope that that demo is still available.

2294
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Did you get it for any of your consoles?

2295
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
No. I mean, no.

2296
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Rob, don't curr.

2297
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I played the one on PlayStation and I did really enjoy it,

2298
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,000
but it's just like, again, the scary, violent stuff is not usually...

2299
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
But yet, I live for Silent Hill and all that stuff.

2300
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
So it's like there's exceptions to every rule,

2301
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,000
but I haven't been up and up on the Resident Evil, sorry.

2302
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
But there was a story we cut from the show tonight

2303
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
that talked about that you can extend the time on the demo somehow.

2304
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Bobby Blackwell is saying right now in chat,

2305
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
the RE2 demo lasts 30 minutes and then it's over, one-time play.

2306
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
So it self-destructs.

2307
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I know on YouTube...

2308
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I know on YouTube and Twitter,

2309
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I saw links to videos of people beat Resident Evil 2 new demo

2310
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
in under three minutes,

2311
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
which I don't know if it's an 80% glitch thing

2312
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
or you just run past all the zombies and you're at the end.

2313
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Hey, you don't have to shoot a goddamn thing.

2314
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
People are speedrunning demos.

2315
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Well, then again, I'm laughing,

2316
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,000
but our buddy Flaco Jones did the PT thing for a long time.

2317
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Yeah.

2318
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
People do.

2319
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Even if you don't finish the demo, it's over.

2320
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Oh, so it's just you have 30 minutes, bitch, hurry up.

2321
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Pretty much.

2322
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Okay.

2323
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Well, they want you to...

2324
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
The object is to make money.

2325
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
They don't want to give the whole thing away for free.

2326
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Well, the object should be to entice me to play the game,

2327
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
not frustrate me, but...

2328
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
All right.

2329
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
You know what's a good demo, Ni No Kuni?

2330
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Stop. Now you're trolling.

2331
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
All right, let's get to the mailbag.

2332
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
You guys like to email us over at participate at orangelontrader.com

2333
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
and we read your emails live on air.

2334
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I get to take a break this week because Jamie's back.

2335
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
So your turn, Jamie.

2336
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,000
All right.

2337
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Hello, Alar.

2338
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
We don't have music for this anymore, do we?

2339
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Not yet.

2340
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
That's one of my future improvements.

2341
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Sorry, guys.

2342
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Okay.

2343
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
We'll have little...

2344
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
My plan is to do little intro titles

2345
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
with little titles and the music and all that dumb stuff.

2346
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Okay.

2347
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Yeah.

2348
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I was just like, why is it quiet?

2349
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Yeah, sorry.

2350
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
In the future.

2351
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I write to you with the boldest of bold predictions for 2019.

2352
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
It's probably too late for the time capsule,

2353
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
but it's too ballsy to not share.

2354
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
This is actually a two-part prediction.

2355
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
The first part of this is that Microsoft will reveal

2356
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
the successor to the Xbox One this year.

2357
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
For now, I'm just going to call it the Xbox Two,

2358
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
or maybe it's number two.

2359
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Ha ha.

2360
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
The second part of this,

2361
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
and the one that could really shock the gaming world

2362
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
if this comes true,

2363
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
is if Microsoft were to come out and say,

2364
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
hi, did you buy the Xbox One X?

2365
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Well, if you did, guess what?

2366
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
You already own something that will play Xbox Two games.

2367
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Even better, you'll get to play them

2368
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
before the new console even comes out.

2369
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
As far-fetched as this may sound to some,

2370
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I believe there's a good chance it could come true.

2371
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Can I jump in here?

2372
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Because actually Microsoft,

2373
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:41,000
I believe this actually wouldn't quite be the shock

2374
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
that you're saying.

2375
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I mean, sorry, I don't want to, like,

2376
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
just argue with you,

2377
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
but Microsoft has kind of said.

2378
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Why don't we let the email finish?

2379
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Oh, is he addressed this?

2380
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

2381
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Okay.

2382
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Stop jumping the gun, Rob.

2383
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Mm-mm-mm.

2384
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
The likelihood is that Xbox Two is just going to be

2385
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
a more powerful Xbox One,

2386
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
down to being 100% backwards compatible,

2387
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
and the reality is the Xbox One X

2388
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
has over four times the graphic performance

2389
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
of the original Xbox One.

2390
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It's almost a generational power gap.

2391
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Would it truly be impossible for the One X

2392
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
to run Xbox Two games at a slightly lower level

2393
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
of performance or detail?

2394
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Microsoft has demonstrated

2395
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
with their backwards compatibility initiatives

2396
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
and other consumer-friendly policies

2397
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
that your investment in Xbox games

2398
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
can move forward in time beyond the console's generation

2399
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
where the investment was made.

2400
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
This would be the ultimate form of doubling down

2401
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
on that philosophy, and I, for one, hope they do it.

2402
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I'll end this by addressing something

2403
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
that was discussed on last week's show.

2404
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
The whole light guns can't work on LCD things.

2405
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Namco already developed a gun controller

2406
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
that works on LCDs back in 2007.

2407
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
It's called the GunCon3,

2408
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
and it works using the same type of infrared technology

2409
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
that the Wii Remote uses.

2410
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
However, it uses two sensors instead of the Wii Remote's one,

2411
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
vastly improving its accuracy.

2412
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
The controller works perfectly and is a lot of fun to use,

2413
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
but unfortunately, only three games were ever made

2414
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
that support it.

2415
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Time Crisis 4, Raising Storm, and Deadstorm Pirates,

2416
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
which I didn't know Deadstorm Pirates came out,

2417
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
and I need to have it, because I fucking love that game.

2418
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Well, if you're going to buy it on the eShop,

2419
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
you better do it for the 31st.

2420
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
No, I'm going to get the disc.

2421
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Good.

2422
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Oh, well.

2423
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Congrats on the successful move to Twitch,

2424
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
and have a great week.

2425
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Hugs, Aaron, YYR.

2426
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Okay, so it didn't totally address what I was going to say.

2427
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Yeah, we should let our listeners finish.

2428
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Yes, fine, fine, fine.

2429
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Let me finish.

2430
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
But here's the thing.

2431
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
When the X, I could swear when they announced Project Scorpio,

2432
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
they said something about that was the direction that they were going,

2433
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
that they want you to be able to like,

2434
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
that Xbox was just going to be like a platform,

2435
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
and that you'd have these different players for a platform,

2436
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
kind of like iPhone, right?

2437
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Like most iPhone games that come out,

2438
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
you can play on your X, you can play on your 8,

2439
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
you can play on your 7.

2440
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
10.

2441
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
You know, whatever.

2442
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
You can play as, Mortal Kombat X is on the brain tonight.

2443
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
But you can play on all these different phones.

2444
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
They might run a little slower.

2445
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
They might have decreased performance and lower graphics on the older stuff.

2446
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,000
But for the most part, they'll play on a variety of things.

2447
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
And so I know we've kind of had this talk before,

2448
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
because I feel like Microsoft has kind of tipped their hand

2449
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
that this may be where they're going.

2450
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Now, where I do think in the email, it's kind of like,

2451
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
oh, I didn't think about that, is when YYR mentions,

2452
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,000
that you'll be able to play them here first.

2453
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
That would be something kind of, hmm.

2454
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Like, can you imagine if like, you know,

2455
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
a console is about to come out with these launch titles,

2456
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
but yet the launch titles are playable on what you already have.

2457
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
But if you want to play them better, you'd get the new console.

2458
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
It would be interesting to see what effect that might have.

2459
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Perhaps it would be like sort of a limited one.

2460
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Like, for example, some of the RAM cart games for the Saturn,

2461
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
you could play some of them without them,

2462
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
but you would be missing like frames of animation

2463
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
or features in the game.

2464
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Like, you'd get music or animation or something like that.

2465
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
So I'm not trying to, like, I wasn't trying to be rude to the email.

2466
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I just feel like we've had this talk about Microsoft

2467
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
and like the phone ecosystem type of thing before.

2468
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
So I feel like Microsoft's kind of tipped their hand

2469
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000
that they're thinking about going this way anyway.

2470
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:10,000
But you kind of, the rest that you spell out there is very interesting,

2471
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
and we'll see how that plays out.

2472
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
There's only one other email that came out this week.

2473
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:20,000
There's a cool game that came out this last week that I've been playing.

2474
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Grammar, please.

2475
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I was just curious if anyone has checked it out or not.

2476
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
It's called Farm Together.

2477
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
It's surprisingly extremely fun and a really good time killer.

2478
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I found myself losing track of time getting lost in the progression system.

2479
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
You can play by yourself. That sounds personal.

2480
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Or with friends or random people.

2481
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
That sounds fun with random people.

2482
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
It's actually crazy how seamless the loading time is going into other people's worlds.

2483
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It's only 20 bucks and well worth it, in my opinion.

2484
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,000
That might just be the perfect kind of game you can stream and play with viewers.

2485
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Anyway, until next time, Frodo Swagons.

2486
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
P.S. Hi, Jamie. Hi.

2487
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I did not know this game, but I love listener recommendations,

2488
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
so I might have to check it out.

2489
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Those show.

2490
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Thank you.

2491
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
That's it for emails?

2492
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Yes.

2493
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
All right, well, we hope we will get some more emails.

2494
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And look, this is how the inbox is supposed to look, Rob.

2495
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Empty.

2496
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I can't see because you're not on cam. Sorry.

2497
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
You know what? Look at this.

2498
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Do you guys see this?

2499
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,000
This is what the inbox is supposed to look like.

2500
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Damn it.

2501
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
All right, she can do that now. She couldn't do that before.

2502
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
All right.

2503
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Moving on.

2504
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Let's get back into some more gaming news.

2505
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,000
And then a little later in the show, we're going to be taking your calls via Discord.

2506
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Stop it, Jamie. Stop playing with the camera.

2507
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
All right.

2508
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
It's kind of fun.

2509
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
All right, let's get to some stories.

2510
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Alan, what do you have for us?

2511
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Microsoft, who's the author or, sorry, developer and publisher of Forza.

2512
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Publisher.

2513
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Publisher.

2514
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I believe it was developed by Phase 10.

2515
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Oh, God, what's her name?

2516
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Series 5?

2517
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
What's her name? Something 10.

2518
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Anyway, sorry.

2519
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I forget the developer in the moment.

2520
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Womp, womp.

2521
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I just totally killed my own momentum on this story.

2522
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Turn 10. That's it.

2523
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:18,000
There were going to be emotes of Vine, Internet meme, YouTube culture, the Carlton, the floss,

2524
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,000
which is what cultural phenomenon Fortnite is also doing.

2525
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:28,000
But Fortnite is getting the shit suit out of them by all of these different content creators or dance creators.

2526
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:34,000
So in a preemptive mood to avoid all of this BS, my point is that Forza is getting those stripped out.

2527
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Microsoft is washing their hands of it.

2528
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:44,000
At the very least, they want to see how the Fortnite stuff plays out.

2529
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Because I know that Alfonso Ribeiro of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, who has the Carlton, he also did it on...

2530
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Silver Spoons.

2531
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Oh, yes, and Silver Spoons.

2532
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Little Ricky Schroeder.

2533
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Little Ricky Schroeder.

2534
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
So he is suing Fortnite.

2535
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I don't think... I was going to say Soulja Boy, but the Soulja Boy dance is not in Fortnite.

2536
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
But a bunch of other people...

2537
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Actually, when Jamie was reading the emails, I was furiously Googling to see if something that I had heard on a podcast about choreographers was true.

2538
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
You know, in Hollywood, there's all these different unions.

2539
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
There's the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, Directors Guild.

2540
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:40,000
And they all say, if this is a hit and it's being played 15 years from now, or a Blu-ray boxset of this is sold, we still get a check cut to us.

2541
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Which is why all of the actors from Friends, they don't have to make anything else in their life as far as new material.

2542
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Lisa Kudrow continuing to grace us with her presence is a favor. It really is.

2543
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Yes. And I had heard that choreographers were one of the few entities in Hollywood that don't have a union sort of caping for them.

2544
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
So they're sort of free agents.

2545
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:11,000
So if there was that lip sync battle show with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, where he did against Anthony Mackie, I think is his name.

2546
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:17,000
He did Rhythm Nation by Janet Jackson, which is one of the most iconic dances of all time.

2547
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
With the March March Turn, March March Turn.

2548
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:26,000
And I was wondering, obviously they had to pay Janet and her label rights to use Rhythm Nation on that show.

2549
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,000
But they also copied the dance from the video step for step.

2550
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Does the choreographer, whether it was Paula Abdul or whoever it is, got...

2551
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Who really did do some of the choreography with Rhythm Nation.

2552
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Yeah, that's how Paula Abdul got her started before she went into singing.

2553
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Anyway, if that person also got paid. It's a very interesting question that this Fortnite dance thing has revealed.

2554
02:11:52,000 --> 02:12:00,000
The Google reading that I did while emails were being shown were...

2555
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:06,000
That actually it's all up to the contract that the choreographer has with that studio.

2556
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:13,000
There has to be a recording of the thing that makes it permanent, like this is how this dance goes.

2557
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Yes, actually, dances can be copyrighted and choreographers can receive royalties.

2558
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:25,000
The question is, did these individuals who came up with these Vine and YouTube meme dances,

2559
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:33,000
if they had taken that step to copyright that stuff, however that's done...

2560
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Like Backpack Kid, who's more of a meme than an actual...

2561
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Yeah, like Backpack Kid, who did the floss on SNL.

2562
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Which, no, I will not be doing those dances again.

2563
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:51,000
If they sort of shot themselves in the foot by waiting until someone else copied their intellectual property before they sued.

2564
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I find this whole story fascinating.

2565
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I do too because, again, it just kind of all goes into like there are these new...

2566
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Like the technology is going faster than the laws that really support it.

2567
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:08,000
This has to even do with Let's Play and the things that are big on Twitch and so forth right now.

2568
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
It's this really uncharted space, you know?

2569
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,000
It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, but I don't blame...

2570
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:21,000
It was actually Playground Games did Horizon, Turn 10 did the main Forza series, whatever you want to call it.

2571
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Sorry, I misattributed that.

2572
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:29,000
But Forza Horizon, that's why I was frustrated I couldn't remember who did it because I love that series, it's so good.

2573
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,000
But I can kind of understand why they're like, maybe we just want to slip that out and see...

2574
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,000
We got a bunch of other dances in here, maybe no one will notice.

2575
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,000
But they wanted to take that preemptive caution.

2576
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,000
So who knows how long the Fortnite lawsuits are going to take or whether they are settled out of court

2577
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,000
and there's an NDA and we never hear what actually happens, if the dances stay in the game or not.

2578
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:56,000
But Microsoft is like, let's have them get muddy

2579
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:05,000
and we will watch after the embers cool off, if they're going to put those dances into the game.

2580
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:14,000
And I imagine... I'm curious to see if it's settled, if Microsoft will include the dances

2581
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,000
even if it means they have to write those people a check or if they're going to be greedy and say,

2582
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:23,000
okay, actually we can't use these dances but we're not going to pay the royalties either and just strip them out entirely.

2583
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:30,000
It's all fascinating to me but anyway, yeah, no dances in Forza. For now.

2584
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Well, let's move on and talk about something else that seems to not be happening for now, I don't know.

2585
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
But you know, Mighty No. 9, remember that?

2586
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
That was the Mega Man, we're going to make this game because they're not making a new Mega Man

2587
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:50,000
and then the actual guy who made Mega Man went over to make this game and it was met with some mixed success.

2588
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Some people were like it, some people say it's not so great.

2589
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It was as welcomed as a fart in an elevator.

2590
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,000
You know what, having done the playthrough, I can kind of see both sides of it.

2591
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I understand why people were into it but I also understand what it was lacking.

2592
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:07,000
But anyhow, the point is when they did this Kickstarter and all this stuff they said it was going to come to these platforms.

2593
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:11,000
And now it's interesting because we're seeing this happen with a lot of different Kickstarters

2594
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
and things that have been crowdfunded is that by the time the game is finally ready to come out

2595
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
these platforms don't necessarily exist anymore.

2596
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So a lot of people have still been asking though, because Mighty No. 9 does have its fans,

2597
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,000
people are still asking, you know I backed this to see a 3DS version of it, 3DS when?

2598
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:35,000
And I don't know guys, but Nintendo of Europe recently removed the listing for Mighty No. 9 3DS on the official website.

2599
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:42,000
It is still on the North American website but that should be something interesting that it's removed from the Europe version.

2600
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,000
You know level 5 did absorb concept so maybe something happened there.

2601
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Nothing was ever really concretely said on the Vita port either.

2602
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Everybody's just assuming it's dead because well, not even Sony is planning to support the Vita much longer,

2603
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
certainly beyond this year.

2604
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:03,000
So yeah, don't know. And people are wondering, is Red Ash still a thing that's coming?

2605
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
And how is this treatment going to impact Red Ash if at all? And you know, so forth.

2606
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I don't know, like I have to admit, like if they're just going to kill it on the 3DS platform, fine.

2607
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Come out and say it's done because the Switch does handheld and it can all happen over there, like just do it.

2608
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,000
And the people that backed it on the 3DS can redeem it wherever they want on the Switch or the PC or what have you.

2609
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:26,000
But it would be nice to kind of have some definitive answers there,

2610
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:34,000
but it is a very interesting side effect of crowdfunding and just how long some of these things have taken to download.

2611
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:39,000
VG Realness in chat says, okay but for real, how long ago did that Kickstarter start?

2612
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Bobby Blackwell says, I first donated to it in 1984.

2613
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
It's been around a while.

2614
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:52,000
St100mad says, I loved Mighty No. 9. It's really shitty though that they didn't honor what they said they were going to do.

2615
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I'm a mixed bag. Like the 3DS is still an active platform.

2616
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Nintendo is still supporting it with the Luigi Mansion 2 and all that stuff.

2617
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:08,000
You know how I feel about it. I kind of feel like the Switch is also portable.

2618
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
It's better, whatever, but I get the argument.

2619
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:18,000
But Kid's Console, even Loki bought the 2DS for his kids this past holiday and that's been a big thing.

2620
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I'm sure they were playing that on the car ride down to the broccoli farm, so anyway.

2621
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Alright, a few more stories for you guys before we get to our Discord calls.

2622
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Yes, we are changing it tonight. We're going to be taking calls via Discord.

2623
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I'll outline how that's going to work a little closer to when we get to the segment.

2624
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
But if you are not already on our Discord, you do want to get there,

2625
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:40,000
vognetwork.com slash Discord is all you need to get into the Discord server.

2626
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:44,000
And all the instructions right now are pinned in the Orange Launch Radio channel, but I will reiterate.

2627
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:50,000
We're going to be doing it a very similar way to how we were inspired by some other folks.

2628
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:55,000
So we'll illustrate how that's going to work a little later on.

2629
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
But first we have some more news for you guys, including another story from Dark Sakura.

2630
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Yes, well and it's a shame that Shane isn't around for this one.

2631
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Because there's a Power Rangers fighting game coming out for my birthday.

2632
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
For me, for my birthday.

2633
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
They made it specifically for you.

2634
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Well it just says in April.

2635
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Dark Sakura's Power Rangers.

2636
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
It's called Power Rangers Legacy Wars, Power Rangers Battle for the Grid.

2637
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:28,000
So it's Rangers and villains, old and new versus each other.

2638
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and eventually PC.

2639
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Being worked on by Enway, Hasbro, and Lionsgate to do 25 years of American Power Rangers stuff.

2640
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Although, I don't know.

2641
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I want a game like that, but I want it to be the entirety of all Toei Super Sentai.

2642
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Which is hundreds of Sentai.

2643
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Yeah, that would be amazing.

2644
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
The one that Shane was really into was the train.

2645
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
The ones where their mechazords or whatever were trains.

2646
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
My favorite was Mega Ranger, which we got as Power Rangers in space.

2647
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
And I hate Power Rangers in space, but I love Mega Ranger.

2648
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
It seems like they skip seasons here.

2649
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Like they never brought the train one here, but they bring other ones here.

2650
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
It's interesting how that works.

2651
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
We had Car Ranger.

2652
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
What was it, Turbo?

2653
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
And then they brought, I don't think they did Maji Ranger over here, did they?

2654
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
But anyway.

2655
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Yeah, I think they do kind of skip seasons.

2656
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I mean, in Japan, I imagine they do like three or four a year.

2657
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Shane would know.

2658
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
You're right.

2659
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I thought they did like one a year.

2660
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Like one new series a year, but.

2661
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Nifty in Chat says, I want TV Rita.

2662
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
That would be awesome.

2663
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Rest in peace.

2664
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Yeah.

2665
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Oh, yeah.

2666
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
That's right.

2667
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
So.

2668
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
All right.

2669
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Well, I'm looking forward to that.

2670
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
I do like a good fighting game and Power Rangers are fun.

2671
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Even if I'm not as into it as everybody else, I still appreciate it.

2672
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
So anyway, let's move on.

2673
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
We got some more stories.

2674
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Something in one of your favorite series.

2675
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Sorta.

2676
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Right, Alan?

2677
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Yeah.

2678
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I bought Elder Scrolls Online like a year or two ago when it was on sale.

2679
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
One of the many 80% off Steam holiday sales type situations.

2680
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I've never installed it or activated my account or registered it or anything.

2681
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
So think about that.

2682
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I'm mostly talking out of my ass here, but I am a huge Oblivion Morrow and Skyrim fan,

2683
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
especially when it comes to playing them on PC and mods.

2684
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,000
He has beat every quest in Skyrim.

2685
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Besides the generated ones and that.

2686
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Yeah.

2687
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Every.

2688
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Every one.

2689
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
There's one exception to that.

2690
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
The vampire DLC.

2691
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Oh.

2692
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I have not finished that storyline.

2693
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
But weren't you like, it's trash.

2694
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
No, it was just like, I need to wait for mods for this to make it better.

2695
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Okay.

2696
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
To make it better.

2697
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I thought you didn't like the whole vampire concept.

2698
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I thought that's what it was.

2699
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
So the latest expansion for Elder Scrolls Online.

2700
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:50,000
It's Elsewhere, which is the land where...

2701
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Ow, what's happening on the camera?

2702
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Food is important.

2703
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:01,000
That is going to be released on, thank you, June 4th.

2704
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Elsewhere is where the Khajiit has wares if you have coin.

2705
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,000
The cat, they make really good assassins.

2706
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
You're going to go there.

2707
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:18,000
And it's a place that I don't think you've visited since the early, early Elder Scrolls

2708
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:22,000
games like that were on the 486 or whatever.

2709
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Your Dagger Falls and your arena where all of Cyrodiil or Tamriel was available to you.

2710
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
This is what this place looks like with modern graphics.

2711
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And it's going to be via, I think, Elder Scrolls Online takes place...

2712
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I don't know where it is on the timeline, but it's way, way, way in the past so they

2713
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,000
can do whatever they want and not have it worry about the continuity.

2714
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:50,000
So there's a trailer for it on YouTube.

2715
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
It looks very pretty.

2716
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
And if you're into the cat people, if you're a furry...

2717
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
No, I'm just kidding.

2718
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Look forward to it.

2719
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
And that is coming out on June 4th.

2720
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Alright.

2721
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Yep.

2722
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Cool.

2723
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
That's one of those games.

2724
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I'm like you.

2725
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I bought it on PlayStation 4 on an Uber sale and then I was like, eh, it's okay.

2726
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
And I didn't really play it again.

2727
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
But I need to check it out again because it was pretty cool.

2728
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Alright.

2729
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Anyway, let's see.

2730
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I think this is our last story for tonight before we get to our Discord calls.

2731
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:22,000
So if those of you that are on Discord, if you want to start lining up in the green room, you can.

2732
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
But for now, one more story for you guys.

2733
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
And, of course, it had to be about this.

2734
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Well, you know, Mario Brothers U, excuse me, new Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe came out on the Switch,

2735
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
which is the reimagining of the Wii U.

2736
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
So, of course, you know where I'm going.

2737
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
You read it in the sidebar.

2738
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:40,000
But even those of you listening on the podcast, you know where I'm going with this.

2739
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Of course, it's been modded and hacked already because hackers are going to hack.

2740
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
And what did they do?

2741
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
They put Bowsette into the game.

2742
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
That's right.

2743
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Bowsette has already been hacked into new Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe.

2744
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
And folks are playing already as Bowsette in the game because, you know,

2745
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:00,000
you're supposed to be able to do this whole like Peachette thing where she takes on Toadette.

2746
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Yeah.

2747
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
But, of course, somebody made it so that you can play as Bowsette.

2748
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:08,000
So, those of you that are like, Bowsette, waifu, you can actually play that

2749
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,000
and live out your fantasy and the privacy of your own home with the lights off

2750
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,000
and all that good stuff if that is what your heart so desires.

2751
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Anyway, actdeftinchat says, I pass.

2752
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Orangewright says, did they talk about the Donkey Kong 64 charity livestream?

2753
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:31,000
No, but I believe that is what I was just reading about that before the show went live tonight.

2754
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Let me explain the Discord thing and then I'll jump to that Orangewright.

2755
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:39,000
So, the way its calls are going to work now on Discord is that if you would like to be on the show tonight,

2756
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
you're going to join our green room.

2757
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
So, in the Discord, there's a channel that says green room.

2758
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
You just join that.

2759
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
There's already some people in there now so you can see where it is.

2760
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:51,000
And then if you want to mention a little bit about what your call is going to be about

2761
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:54,000
in the Orange Lounge Radio channel, that helps us kind of know like,

2762
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,000
oh, this is what we're going to be anticipating and expecting.

2763
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And then one at a time, we'll drag you into the live room where we're here with the studio.

2764
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
And you can be on the show.

2765
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Please, please do not be offended if you're not picked to be on the show for a night

2766
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,000
because we're going to try to really mix it up with new people and familiar faces around these parts.

2767
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Also, although I know our pal Bobby Blackwolf also made a switch tonight,

2768
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
we will not be incorporating video at this time.

2769
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
We're not Orange Lounge video right now.

2770
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
We're Orange Lounge Radio so we're still going to just keep these calls.

2771
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Audio only for now.

2772
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Not to say I won't change my mind on that in the future,

2773
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
but especially with the way we're doing it to set up to work with our technical setup

2774
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,000
where we're using two different computers to accomplish the streaming.

2775
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
It just makes more sense for us to do the audio only.

2776
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:44,000
So all that being said, I wanted to address the comment really fast

2777
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:48,000
that was said by Orange Right about the Donkey Kong 64 charity livestream.

2778
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,000
So apparently they were doing, and I'm sorry, I don't know all the details,

2779
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
and Orange Right, feel free to help me out in chat if you know more of the details.

2780
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
But apparently it was like they're doing a charity livestream

2781
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,000
and it was for some type of trans charity.

2782
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,000
I don't know if it's education or protecting trans youth,

2783
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
but I know it was bringing awareness for that.

2784
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,000
And I just know her as AOC now,

2785
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:17,000
but she's that one new Democrat in the House that people really cannot stop obsessing about.

2786
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
And with good reason.

2787
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:23,000
She's got quite some strong ideas and has no problem putting them out there.

2788
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Okay, I'm not going to get into politics.

2789
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I believe is her name.

2790
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Is that right? Okay, thank you.

2791
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
So anyway, apparently she was on this stream.

2792
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
And I don't know if they called her or what the deal was.

2793
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
They asked her to come on or whatever.

2794
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,000
But she actually joined the stream and gave a little chat

2795
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
and talked about how the Nintendo 64 was her favorite console.

2796
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And even though she didn't have one herself,

2797
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,000
she went over to her friend's house to play it, which, you know, mood.

2798
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
That was me exactly, right?

2799
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
My buddies upstairs in the college dorms had it, so I had to play theirs.

2800
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
And she then went on to talk about, you know,

2801
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
why the trans protections are important and so on

2802
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
and why the charity was a good thing and kind of give that political angle.

2803
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:05,000
But, I mean, it is something to say, despite however you feel about politics.

2804
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Like, I don't really care right now.

2805
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:11,000
It is something to say that a member of the House of Representatives

2806
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
just appeared on a Twitch livestream.

2807
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Like, if you don't think Twitch is mainstream, y'all, it's here.

2808
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Right?

2809
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Have you seen her tweets lately, too?

2810
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Oh, well, yeah, she's very, she's a meme machine.

2811
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
All your base.

2812
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Well, you know, even if you don't agree with her politics,

2813
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I don't agree with her politics 100% of the time,

2814
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
but I'm at a good, like, 70, 80%.

2815
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:39,000
But anyway, she had this picture of herself with a glass of wine

2816
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
watching Drag Race, and I was like, mood.

2817
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
She says she wants to be a judge.

2818
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:48,000
I think part of the reason why I like her from that element,

2819
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
again, you know, I'm really trying not to touch politics,

2820
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,000
but just, like, I feel like I see somebody from my generation

2821
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
and my people in Congress, and that is a really cool feeling.

2822
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
You know what I mean?

2823
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Yeah.

2824
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
So, that's part of why I really like it.

2825
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,000
And to see her jump into a Twitch stream, I think, is really awesome.

2826
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
So, anyway, let's see.

2827
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I do have one.

2828
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Yeah, please.

2829
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,000
My favorite headline and response to AOC

2830
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,000
and whatever controversy her antics inspired.

2831
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
There was a story.

2832
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I don't know if it was Wall Street Journal, wherever,

2833
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
that was like, given AOC's antics,

2834
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,000
should we be electing more millennials to Congress?

2835
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
And the response was, well, given how linear time works,

2836
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I think that's going to work itself out.

2837
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Yes.

2838
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I died.

2839
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Yes.

2840
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Well, yes, I think that will just inherently happen.

2841
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Anyway, all right, we're going to, for the very first time,

2842
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
start to take some calls via Discord.

2843
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:48,000
So, we're going to get to our very first Discord caller,

2844
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,000
who I think should be there.

2845
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Hello.

2846
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
You're on Orange Tons Radio.

2847
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Who's this?

2848
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

2849
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Hey, Akdeft.

2850
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
It is great to hear from you.

2851
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
You're the very first one.

2852
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Do we sound okay?

2853
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Yeah, you sound pretty okay.

2854
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Pretty great.

2855
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Hey.

2856
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
You sound great to us.

2857
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,000
So, welcome.

2858
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
And I know you wanted to talk about something tonight

2859
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,000
that I kind of addressed earlier in the show,

2860
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,000
but I want your take on it.

2861
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
So, please, what's on your mind tonight?

2862
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Well, Pokemon Go.

2863
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Yeah, like always.

2864
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:17,000
But, yeah, like you already talked about on the beginning of the show,

2865
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
it was the Phoebus event.

2866
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:24,000
It was the most frustrating three hours I have ever, ever lived.

2867
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:29,000
And I really don't want to do that again ever.

2868
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Like, wow.

2869
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Why did you hate it?

2870
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Why did you hate it?

2871
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:37,000
It's not necessarily that I hated it,

2872
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:41,000
because the concept itself, when it was announced,

2873
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I was, oh, this does look cool.

2874
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:49,000
It seems like a really, really good way to play

2875
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:55,000
instead of just like trying to catch a random Pokemon

2876
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
like in other community days.

2877
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:03,000
So, it was okay on the concept, but the execution really, really failed.

2878
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:06,000
And like we were saying at the beginning of the show,

2879
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
three hours wasn't enough.

2880
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:13,000
It should have been probably a whole week, even just a weekend,

2881
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:19,000
just like Saturday, Sunday, do the missions or the investigations.

2882
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Like a mini event, like they did the love discs and stuff like that.

2883
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Yeah, and it would have worked fine.

2884
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Like really, really okay, but only three hours was not enough.

2885
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
It was really frustrating.

2886
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Even though I did get a Phoebus shiny,

2887
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:39,000
and it was actually like good percentage of IVs, it was 93%.

2888
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:44,000
It's still like, my God, I was exhausted.

2889
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Even my records, because I was driving with my friend,

2890
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,000
and we were pretty much traversing all over the city,

2891
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:59,000
searching for PokeStops that gave the missions.

2892
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Do you have a lot of spots in, because I know you're in Mexico,

2893
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
and you're in Mexicali, if I remember right.

2894
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:09,000
I know sometimes in the other countries that aren't like the US and Japan,

2895
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,000
PokeStops can be kind of sparse, because Ingress portals are sparse.

2896
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Do you have places like graveyards or parks or places that have a lot of portals,

2897
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,000
or do you really have to travel from place to place?

2898
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
We're starting to get more portals now,

2899
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:30,000
because more people are actually playing Ingress and getting to level 10.

2900
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Even in my own house, my brother is a level 10.

2901
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:38,000
So we're making portals off Ingress.

2902
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
And you know, actually, just a real quick aside,

2903
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Ingress really stepped up some of their OPR reviewing right now,

2904
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
and they're doing like rewards.

2905
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I got a new portal up in Ingress, because I reviewed 100 candidates in OPR,

2906
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
and it bumped my submission to the top, and I got a new portal over at,

2907
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
I don't want to say where, because I don't want to give away where I live,

2908
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
but a nearby park, and we just went there today.

2909
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Because I was like, oh, there will be a new PokeStop there, and there sure was.

2910
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:01,000
So it was kind of fun.

2911
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
But anyway, Alan, you wanted to jump in here too with something.

2912
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Yes, I was going to say, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to set aside

2913
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
the three hours to grind these missions.

2914
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:18,000
So when the event started, I cleared out my missions, and I got three of them,

2915
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
because that's how many you're allowed to have,

2916
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
and those three were ultimately all I did.

2917
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Two of them were to walk your buddy and earn a candy,

2918
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
so I loaded up, of course, Magikarp.

2919
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:37,000
So after I got those three Phoebuses, and neither one of them were shiny,

2920
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I mean, I didn't even finish those last two quests until six or seven in the evening,

2921
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
which was way after it had finished.

2922
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,000
I did a total of four quests.

2923
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:53,000
And I absolutely understand Niantic asking themselves the question,

2924
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:58,000
how can we incentivize playing the game for a certain period

2925
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:01,000
that's not as blown up as a community day?

2926
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
And this is not it.

2927
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,000
It was a swing and a miss.

2928
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:07,000
So as far as experimenting goes, great.

2929
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
But guys, this is not it.

2930
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
I did 32.

2931
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Oh my god, you did 32?

2932
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Yeah.

2933
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I know Shane did a lot.

2934
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Shane did a lot, and he got a shiny on his first and one of his last,

2935
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,000
but he went over to the college here,

2936
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:28,000
and because he tried to go downtown,

2937
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:31,000
but the Women's March was going on the same day, which is cool,

2938
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
but it shut down all the streets.

2939
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:36,000
So he got frustrated trying to park, because there's people everywhere,

2940
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
which is a huge event.

2941
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
So I guess he'd never been over to the college.

2942
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
And by this point, when we were kind of hearing,

2943
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
like, downtown's a mess, this event is a mess,

2944
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Alan and I were like, let's go get brunch.

2945
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
We'll just pick up some things.

2946
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Fuck it.

2947
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,000
We're just going to go get brunch.

2948
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,000
And that's what we did.

2949
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,000
We just went and had brunch, and then we picked up these quests

2950
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
that were like, catch 15 Pokémon,

2951
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:01,000
and of course, there's nothing spawning at brunch.

2952
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Luckily, I save all my quest rewards.

2953
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I don't know why, but I do.

2954
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
They were on brunch too.

2955
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Yeah, apparently they all were too.

2956
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,000
So I got all my 15 catches for my quest rewards I had stocked up.

2957
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,000
So, anyway.

2958
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Any other thoughts you wanted to get out on Pokémon GO

2959
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
or anything else, Akdept, before we let you go?

2960
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Yeah, returning a little bit to the Pokéstops thing

2961
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
and the portals thing on Ingress.

2962
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Yeah, they're kind of sparse here,

2963
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:30,000
but not necessarily that they do not exist,

2964
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
so there's not too many.

2965
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:38,000
They're just, the big locations here are pretty much in some places,

2966
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:45,000
so we had to go to downtown, to historical downtown,

2967
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
then to the university here,

2968
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:51,000
and other many places that have those many Pokéstops,

2969
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
because, yeah, even though more portals,

2970
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,000
more Pokéstops are appearing in the town,

2971
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
it's not necessarily that great still,

2972
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,000
but we're working there, at least.

2973
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:06,000
But to be fair, even in a place like where we live, Sacramento,

2974
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
if we want to get a concentration of Pokéstops,

2975
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
we have to go downtown, to the capital or to the college.

2976
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Alan and I live in suburbia,

2977
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:20,000
so we're lucky to live right down the street from a park,

2978
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
so we have a couple of things, a couple of portals,

2979
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
but that's really it.

2980
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
We have to kind of get in the car and go somewhere

2981
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
if we want to really get stops.

2982
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,000
But not to be, because we probably do have it better.

2983
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
There's probably more stuff here,

2984
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
just because we have more people to play Ingress

2985
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:38,000
and network here than probably where you do where you are.

2986
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:42,000
But it will be interesting that Niantic making that change to OPR

2987
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
is going to have a ripple effect.

2988
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I've seen at least five new portals in our area

2989
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:50,000
and talking about suburbia go live in the last week

2990
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,000
since they made this change, and they're all becoming stops or gyms.

2991
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
We actually got a new gym out of the whole thing,

2992
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
so it'll be interesting to see how that all plays out.

2993
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
So, anyway, thank you so much for the call, ActDeft,

2994
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,000
and for being our very first caller on Discord.

2995
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Appreciate it. Have a good one, buddy, okay?

2996
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Hey, thanks for having us always.

2997
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Yeah, no problem. Thanks for being here.

2998
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
All right, that was ActDeft here on the program.

2999
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Let's get to another call here on Discord.

3000
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
We're going to go to this call.

3001
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3002
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Hey, this is Metal Mayhem, also known as Raging Eater.

3003
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Hey, Metal Mayhem, how you doing?

3004
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I'm good, how are you?

3005
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,000
A little bit on the cold side, but always good.

3006
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Yeah, I know. We've been having some really bad storms.

3007
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
It's not cold here.

3008
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
These are not bad storms.

3009
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Well, they're California bad, girl.

3010
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
They're not even a storm.

3011
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Our power got knocked out. It was bad enough.

3012
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Yeah, for 30 minutes. That's nothing.

3013
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,000
All right, anyway.

3014
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
How many candles do you have?

3015
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
You haven't even burned that one yet.

3016
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Everybody has it because I have a flashlight in my pocket.

3017
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Everybody has it worse than we do. Anyway, sorry.

3018
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,000
What's on your mind tonight, Metal Mayhem?

3019
02:35:54,000 --> 02:36:02,000
All right, well, since Dr. Stocker did a segment earlier on game soundtracks,

3020
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I would like to talk about that just to tie in with the show.

3021
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Now, as the three of you obviously already know,

3022
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:19,000
game soundtracks have been included in games for a while now.

3023
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,000
You can buy them on iTunes and stuff like that.

3024
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:29,000
But at one point, they were a bit of a rarity to be included with games.

3025
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:37,000
That being said, assuming that you have game soundtracks in your personal libraries,

3026
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:41,000
the first one that you ever got.

3027
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Okay, so here's my answer to this.

3028
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
So, Dr. Stocker, I don't know if you heard the whole question,

3029
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
but basically asking about game soundtracks.

3030
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
I know you would probably have an impressive library

3031
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:52,000
because game soundtracks were not like before there was iTunes,

3032
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
before there was Spotify, game soundtracks.

3033
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
You had to go to import stores to get them and stuff.

3034
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Or Chinatown.

3035
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Yeah, they weren't very common in the states.

3036
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Or anime conventions.

3037
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Yeah, but anyway, here's the funny thing, Metal Mayhem,

3038
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,000
something you may have forgot in the design of this question, and that's okay.

3039
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Remember where Orange Lounge Radio started as a dance dance revolution

3040
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:15,000
and music game related show because that is my honest answer.

3041
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I started getting into game soundtracks with the dance dance revolution soundtracks

3042
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
because I loved me that cheesy Eurobeat that you heard in things like

3043
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Dance Dance Revolution third mix and stuff like that.

3044
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:30,000
And that kind of went on to the dance mania albums, which were big in Japan,

3045
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
which were a lot of the licensed music came from.

3046
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:36,000
If you ever listened to OLR in the early, early, early days

3047
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,000
when it was a live 365 station, we would play music not just from

3048
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:44,000
like Bimani games, Konami games, we played dance mania mix

3049
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,000
because we wanted to do it because obviously DDR freak radio was a thing

3050
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,000
and we wanted to be different.

3051
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,000
We were first though.

3052
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Yeah, so well, you know, but we wanted to be different.

3053
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
So we kind of had that whole different take on things.

3054
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:57,000
So, yeah, I mean, that's when I really started getting into gaming soundtracks

3055
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
and realizing there was stuff to import.

3056
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
I had a shit ton of anime soundtracks back in the day.

3057
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Yeah.

3058
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
When did you first get into gaming soundtracks?

3059
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Well, Dan and I were kind of into it right away because when I moved out here,

3060
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,000
he had already had he imported Symphony of the Night,

3061
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,000
which came with the soundtrack.

3062
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
So we were already listening to that.

3063
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
And then, you know, we were picking him up for fighting games.

3064
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I had I got like a Street Fighter Alpha 2 soundtrack that came with like

3065
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:27,000
a screensaver and shit, you know, back for Windows 95 or me or whatever.

3066
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
And then we had picked up all the Marvel versus Capcom ones.

3067
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
We had some King of Fighters soundtracks.

3068
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:38,000
When Busta Move came out, I paid something like 45 bucks

3069
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
and bought a legit Busta Move soundtrack.

3070
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:45,000
And then I tore up AX looking for Busta Move 2.

3071
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:50,000
And I want to say I like downloaded MP3s on like Napster

3072
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,000
of the Busta Move slash Groove soundtrack.

3073
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Remember, I also ripped mine.

3074
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Yeah.

3075
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:56,000
You know, who knows?

3076
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:59,000
I mean, I may have downloaded your rips on Napster before I even knew you.

3077
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Well, I remember giving you a CD of all my rips for one.

3078
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Well, yeah, but that was later.

3079
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Yeah.

3080
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I remember downloading it.

3081
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,000
But I also, though, was kind of, you know, very much into J-pop at the time, too.

3082
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:14,000
So I had like two mix albums and Globe and Mr. Children.

3083
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,000
One of my favorite albums still, like from the DDR days, you already,

3084
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
IU Trance, which is the Ayumi Hamasaki Trance album.

3085
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,000
True story.

3086
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
I think it was like three or maybe even a fourth one as a voice.

3087
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
True story time.

3088
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I love that first CD.

3089
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:33,000
We were at DragCon this year and there was no line for YUHA, Hamasaki.

3090
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
I always feel bad for those queens to get booted early.

3091
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,000
They were so talented.

3092
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Bless you.

3093
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:40,000
So but anyway, we were just jawing with her because there was nobody there.

3094
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,000
And I was like, well, I know that you said that you got your name from Ayumi.

3095
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Are you actually fans of the AYURO remix?

3096
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
And she's like, oh, my God.

3097
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Yes, someone has heard of them.

3098
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,000
And Victoria is there like watching us like, huh?

3099
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Yeah.

3100
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:58,000
And we're just talking about Ayumi's Para Para, you know, Para Para,

3101
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:02,000
things on stage and everything, just completely gushing.

3102
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,000
And then, OK, we got to get this picture done.

3103
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:06,000
So, yeah, I love I love that you brought it back to drag.

3104
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:11,000
And then her photographer messaged Monet Exchange saying that Victoria was coming over.

3105
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,000
All right.

3106
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Because she's wearing the sponge dress.

3107
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,000
OK, I got to I got to get some of these comments from chat.

3108
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Orange, right, says I bought imported soundtracks from Red Octane back when they were a store.

3109
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Act F says I have the Scott Pilgrim, the game OST on vinyl, which apparently DJ Romas helped

3110
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:27,000
out with.

3111
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:31,000
I was importing sound anime soundtracks from Play Asia back in the day.

3112
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,000
I had a couple of rare's from various DDR tournaments.

3113
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
You know what?

3114
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I might still have all of mine.

3115
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:42,000
I think I still have in the studio from like an OLR giveaway pile that we never gave away.

3116
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I need to see if I have more there, like the rare CDs that we just never gave away.

3117
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I need to like just offer to send them to people or something.

3118
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I don't know.

3119
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,000
I think I also got one of the game crazy exclusive ones, like a pile of them from Dan.

3120
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Now I'm looking to see if they're fully hoarders.

3121
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
So we have them.

3122
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
We don't throw stuff like that out.

3123
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I there's some shelving over here that you guys can't see on Twitch, but I was seeing

3124
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,000
if it was over there because I thought I had some on the shelving over there, but I guess

3125
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
not.

3126
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I don't know what actual vinyl I still have because I have weirdos mandatory fun because

3127
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,000
he signed it.

3128
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
We have even worse by Weird Al.

3129
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:21,000
I have the Xanadu album because of course I do.

3130
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:27,000
And I have a sealed Parlophone release first printing of Demon Days by Gorillaz that I

3131
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:28,000
never opened.

3132
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:31,000
And apparently I could get me like five hundred bucks.

3133
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Go big if I ever sell it.

3134
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:37,000
OK, Metal Mayhem, we've been doing all the talking quickly, though, before we get to

3135
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,000
our next call.

3136
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
What about you and game soundtracks?

3137
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Like what what got you into collecting?

3138
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
If that's the thing you do or did you wait till the digital age?

3139
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Oh, you know, I didn't start out with the intention of collecting.

3140
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:54,000
It just happened to be a happy accident.

3141
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:01,000
My first soundtrack I got was the one that was included with the Super Nintendo version

3142
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
of Killer Instinct.

3143
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,000
And I love these.

3144
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Killer Cuts, right?

3145
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Killer Cuts.

3146
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Yeah.

3147
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Yeah.

3148
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I played it so much.

3149
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,000
You know, it was ridiculous.

3150
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:20,000
You got to a point where my tiny family hated that CD after a while and.

3151
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:29,000
You know, throughout the 90s, I went to my local record store, you know, I just walked

3152
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:30,000
through.

3153
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
We're looking for like that.

3154
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Metal Mayhem, could I count the Mortal Kombat motion picture soundtrack?

3155
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Because it did have the who is it, Utah Saints or who did that?

3156
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,000
The the techno song.

3157
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Everybody knows.

3158
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Utah Saints.

3159
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Doo doo doo.

3160
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Does that count?

3161
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Actually, you know, slight modification.

3162
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:54,000
You know, Utah Saints did the later versions of that song.

3163
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,000
The original Irish was called The Immortals.

3164
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Oh, right.

3165
02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,000
OK, you're right.

3166
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:00,000
You're right.

3167
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Yes.

3168
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Yes.

3169
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,000
OK.

3170
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Utah Saints.

3171
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Yeah.

3172
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Another mix that they did.

3173
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
You're right.

3174
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:08,000
They did.

3175
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:09,000
I think they did one later that had like more fighters.

3176
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:10,000
The original song was Twilight Zone or no.

3177
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,000
It was.

3178
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
It's very similar.

3179
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,000
It's got a very similar rift.

3180
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
But Twilight Zone came out around the same time.

3181
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,000
It was all that 90s.

3182
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Yeah.

3183
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Anyway.

3184
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Metal Mayhem.

3185
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
I got to I got to wrap up so we can take another call.

3186
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
But I'm good.

3187
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Good topic.

3188
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
We love talking about game soundtracks.

3189
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,000
It's something we've lost here.

3190
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Real quick.

3191
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Anything else you want to mention before we let you go?

3192
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Oh, not not not much.

3193
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:34,000
You know, you know.

3194
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:38,000
I'm glad that you finally made your way over to Twitch.

3195
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:46,000
You know, I know the focus is on talking the audio, but sometimes it's nice to put.

3196
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
You know, the people talking, you know?

3197
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Yeah.

3198
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Yeah.

3199
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Well, first off, I'm glad that this segment is working tonight, because you might remember

3200
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,000
last week it broke the show and, you know, a couple of weeks ago.

3201
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
So I'm just glad we have this segment working again.

3202
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
And who knows, we might be able to bring video back in the future.

3203
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,000
But, you know, I do want to be very aware that we do have podcast listeners and I don't

3204
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:08,000
want listeners to call in going, I want to show you something.

3205
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
And then it's like, it'll be really weird for a little bit.

3206
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:14,000
So I think in general, most of our podcast listeners kind of like understand that we've

3207
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
made this move to Twitch.

3208
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:18,000
So there are going to be some little things here and there that end up being visual cues.

3209
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:23,000
But I do want to I do still want to remember, you know, it's the goal is to be a little

3210
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,000
more like when Howard Stern is on E.

3211
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:30,000
You know, it's still mostly the radio, but there's that visual enhancement to it.

3212
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,000
That's where I kind of want us to be at, too.

3213
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
But anyway, thank you so much for the call, Middle Mayhem.

3214
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Take care, buddy.

3215
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,000
All right.

3216
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Let's see.

3217
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I think we got room for one more call here.

3218
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
And let's do it.

3219
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Let's do it.

3220
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Hello.

3221
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Hello.

3222
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
You are on orange on radio.

3223
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Who's this?

3224
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

3225
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
It is Rama.

3226
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Hey, Rama.

3227
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
It is so good to hear from you.

3228
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
And congratulations, by the way.

3229
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:53,000
I know anime jam session had its debut on Twitch as well this week.

3230
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
So congratulations.

3231
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I know you guys had some some audio, but I mean, look at us.

3232
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
We're still having issues every week.

3233
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
If we get to the end of the show tonight, knock on wood, it'll be the first show we've

3234
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:08,000
had without any technical issues since maybe the very first show on Twitch.

3235
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Achievement unlocked.

3236
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Yeah.

3237
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:14,000
So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

3238
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:17,000
I just want to thank you for derailing my topics for tonight.

3239
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Because when you start talking about classic soundtracks, I'm remembering the many times

3240
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I have taken the Greyhound bus to conventions with buying import CDs and listening to them

3241
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:33,000
on my CD player from times where I would go with my squad to Chinatown.

3242
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:39,000
We will be buying these these quote unquote import anime and some may.

3243
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Yes.

3244
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Sorry.

3245
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:46,000
I just want you to know I finally got rid of all just all of my son may CDs, except

3246
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:50,000
for the run the ones for obvious reasons.

3247
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Some lying around that had like stuff from like slayers and everything.

3248
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Sorry, I didn't.

3249
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,000
I didn't mute.

3250
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:56,000
I was trying to cut back that echo.

3251
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
There's some echo coming through on Rama's headset.

3252
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
So I was killing our mics for a little bit.

3253
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Sorry.

3254
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Oh, I was just going to say, like, I still have like a few of those like multi show anime

3255
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:10,000
some may disk somewhere like the best of 95 best of 96.

3256
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:17,000
And yeah, I remember when Rob's hooking my video, I remember going to this was picking

3257
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
up second and third mix soundtrack.

3258
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:22,000
So I'm just like, where's the first?

3259
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
And it took me a while to realize.

3260
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Oh, it's all together.

3261
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Nevermind.

3262
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:32,000
So I'm sure you have an opinion on this whole bows that hack that we talked because I feel

3263
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
like you're the bows that defender here on.

3264
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:38,000
But I'm sure you have an opinion on this hack we talked about.

3265
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:43,000
It's not even that it just reminded me of something that happened a few months back

3266
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:52,000
and at the height of bows that some people started champion as bows it as the official

3267
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
representation for trans rights.

3268
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
And I saw that I'm like, you know what?

3269
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:01,000
I'm just going to go over to this side of the Internet.

3270
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I'm like, I'm welcome to claim, I guess, whatever.

3271
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I'm actually really bad, by the way.

3272
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:13,000
You might want to check your discourse to make sure the echo canceling is on.

3273
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
But I'll try to I'll try to push through here.

3274
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Actually, what I'm going to do, I'm going to mute you real quick.

3275
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Well, I mean, it's so wrong that they can't hear you right now.

3276
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
I'm just going to mute you while I respond to that part real quick.

3277
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:26,000
But as far as like the bows, that thing goes like, you know,

3278
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:30,000
and people claiming that as the icon and so forth, like, you know, that's it.

3279
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
People people got to do that.

3280
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:35,000
You were talking earlier in the show, like the Zaria, like is the icon and so forth.

3281
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:39,000
You know, people want to see themselves as the content they consume.

3282
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Yeah. So whenever anything new springs up, someone somewhere is going to say, OK,

3283
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:50,000
well, we this the the official developer is never going to say this outright.

3284
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:55,000
So we would we would like to claim this person within our conversations in our community.

3285
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
So, yeah, why not? Yeah. Anyway, I have you on the speaker again.

3286
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Rama, anything else you want to bring up on the show tonight?

3287
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Couple things. Magfest, when you're talking about the Snorlax, I've seen him there every year.

3288
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:15,000
And it's really awesome there. I believe in the footage I sent somewhere.

3289
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:19,000
There is footage of Snorlax fighting a Scyther. And I thought that was pretty cool.

3290
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Wasn't your first year the year after I stopped going?

3291
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Unfortunately, I just want you to know that we had a blast going.

3292
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,000
But Mako's like, I'm not going unless all of VOG is going.

3293
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:37,000
I'm just like, I think it'd be easier to pull the rest of the teeth out of my mouth.

3294
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Or it might be easier to just get her to Dragon Con. But yeah, I would love to go to Magfest again.

3295
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Just the unfortunate thing is, this is not the job that pays my bills.

3296
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:54,000
As generous as y'all have been with the bitty donations and the subscriptions and things like that.

3297
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't really pay the bills. But I'm hoping maybe I'll have the time available to do it next year.

3298
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:05,000
But the reality is we're going on a cruise in March. So, I don't know if it's going to work out.

3299
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:08,000
But you never know. Never say never. Anything is possible.

3300
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:15,000
And I totally get that. But this is something that I always discuss when we do our convention reviews.

3301
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:21,000
It's like this. If this is your first time going to the con, commit a day early.

3302
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Stay an extra day. Do the silly touristy shit.

3303
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:30,000
If you got friends there, stay longer and then come back the following year and just hang out.

3304
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,000
I did that. I speak from experience.

3305
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:38,000
I still do that with Dragon Con every year. I do that to accommodate for jet lag and all that stuff.

3306
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:43,000
And actually this year, it looks like my plans are cementing up a little bit. I haven't bought the flight yet.

3307
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:47,000
I don't even know if Bobby knows this. I've said I might do this, but I am going to do this.

3308
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:52,000
I'm actually this year going to fly into North Carolina where Xtaphir moved to.

3309
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:57,000
And then we're going to road trip to Dragon Con together because Xtaphir is coming to Dragon Con this year.

3310
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:00,000
It's official. It's his first year at Dragon Con.

3311
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:05,000
So this time instead of spending a bunch of time in Atlanta.

3312
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Well, I'm still going to be there at least the day before because the hotel is covered that day.

3313
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:15,000
So we'll still get in like on the Wednesday when the con, technically I guess now starts on Thursday.

3314
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
I mean, but it used to be a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday thing.

3315
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000
But now, you know, Thursday is the new Friday, whatever.

3316
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
But Thursday was always like my touristy day.

3317
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:25,000
So I guess that'll kind of be the case this year.

3318
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:29,000
But now this time I will have spent a little time because I'm going to fly out to visit Xtaphir.

3319
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,000
So there, it may be a very real possibility there's going to be two weeks with no OLR.

3320
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Because I may fly out to visit Xtaphir on like a Saturday and then stay there like Sunday.

3321
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
And I'm taking the entire next week off.

3322
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
So it'll be fun this year.

3323
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Road trips are absolutely fun like that.

3324
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:50,000
I mean, me and my squad, we did it from New York to Raleigh for an amazement couple of years.

3325
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,000
It was a blast.

3326
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Yeah.

3327
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,000
And Bobby reminds me, we did do that for MAGFest one of the years.

3328
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Because I have a picture of Rob going across the National Mall going to an Ingress portal.

3329
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Yes.

3330
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
That I did one of the missions one year or something like that.

3331
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:03,000
And yeah.

3332
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:08,000
And I remember one year I was with some of my other buddies and we stayed like an extra night out in Virginia.

3333
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
I'm going to mute you again. Sorry, buddy.

3334
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
It's just the echo is too much.

3335
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:16,000
But we stayed an extra night out in Virginia and we did some of the touristy stuff the next day.

3336
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Thank gosh, we did it a few years ago and didn't try to do it this year when the government was closed.

3337
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
But that year it was all open.

3338
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
So anyway, let me unmute you, Rama.

3339
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,000
And any other final thoughts for us before we let you go tonight?

3340
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:33,000
I have my finger on something and I can't remember what it was.

3341
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Oh, yeah.

3342
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
One thing about MAGFest.

3343
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Friday night, I'm like, OK.

3344
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,000
I'm like, I can't wait.

3345
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:47,000
The car's almost over and I'm looking at my watch and it's like, wait, it's Friday, not Saturday.

3346
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I'm used to Thursday as day zero to chill and relax and just just meet up with people.

3347
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Then we do the con, not whereas we're here Thursday.

3348
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:57,000
It's day one.

3349
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
You hit the ground running.

3350
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:03,000
That threw me off that that screwed me up.

3351
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:06,000
My first best two is I flew in on a Friday.

3352
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:10,000
I flew in on Thursday expecting I'd have that day.

3353
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:16,000
And nope, it was like the panel I wanted to see was Thursday night and I like barely made it.

3354
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:19,000
So anyway, Rama, I'm going to let you go.

3355
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Thank you so much for the call.

3356
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:24,000
And congrats again to anime jam session on its transition over to Twitch.

3357
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
And we'll be looking forward to seeing you again this Tuesday.

3358
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Thank you. Appreciate it.

3359
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Worked a little more kinks.

3360
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:33,000
We're going to have a lot more fun and I'm going to start a new segment called the weekly.

3361
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:34,000
All right. Sounds good.

3362
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Look forward to it.

3363
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Take care, buddy. Thanks for the call.

3364
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
All right.

3365
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
There it is.

3366
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:42,000
And that was that was everybody that had lined up in the green room.

3367
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
So that's going to do it for calls tonight.

3368
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Thank you guys so much for calling in.

3369
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Really appreciate it.

3370
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:50,000
So it's about time to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio here.

3371
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,000
First off, I want to say before we get to final thoughts.

3372
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Alan, thank you so much for filling in tonight.

3373
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:56,000
You're welcome.

3374
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Chatters, tell me if you guys agree, but I think Alan did a fantastic job tonight because you were so well researched on your stories.

3375
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:06,000
And consider you don't even get you are well researched than we ever are.

3376
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
You were ready to talk about those and you didn't even really get to pick those.

3377
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I gave those to you this morning and you were like ready to talk about.

3378
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Yeah, well, I did.

3379
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:18,000
I did look at them before the show, but the MK 11 one is with it's something that I'm into regardless.

3380
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Usually I try to pick the stories that play to people's fandoms.

3381
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Like if it's about Mass Effect, I'm going to give it to her.

3382
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:32,000
So Mortal Kombat 11, of course, I gave you one of the new characters in MK 11 is people have been pronouncing it Garris.

3383
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:37,000
But and I'm like, there's only one Garris and this is not it.

3384
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
So it's not my space bird husband.

3385
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Garus.

3386
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,000
How's it spelled?

3387
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:45,000
It's like G-A-R-E-S or G-A-R-U-S.

3388
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:52,000
So, yeah, it's anyway, I my ears perk up when I hear that character's name on the fighting YouTube that I follow.

3389
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:58,000
And I'm like, that's no, that's not hashtag, hashtag not my Garris.

3390
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
I want a Mass Effect fighting game now.

3391
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
So you have a lot of love from our chatters.

3392
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
V.G. Realness says, bring in more Alan.

3393
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
S.G. 100 Matt says, Alan is a great fill in host.

3394
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Active says, yay for Alan.

3395
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Spyro Jonathan says, this year, maybe you could stream from Dragon Con on here.

3396
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:20,000
The only downside to that is that Internet, Wi-Fi and all that stuff can sometimes be unreliable.

3397
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:30,000
But there is a very distinct reason why amongst this whole move to Twitch, we scaled things down to a miniature or mini sized computer.

3398
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Because it makes it very, very easily transportable.

3399
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:39,000
And the convenient part about Dragon Con is that really Bobby brings his whole setup anyway because he'll do the VR stuff.

3400
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:44,000
But I would say even if you don't get something live because the Internet is kind of, I mean, we'll see.

3401
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:47,000
We'll see where maybe we'll have 5G everywhere then. I don't know.

3402
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:53,000
But barring that, I'm certainly something in video form, I think is a given.

3403
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,000
You're going to have to see something like that.

3404
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,000
So we'll see. Stay tuned, G.I.s for that.

3405
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Anyway, Alan, thanks again for being here. You did fantastic.

3406
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:04,000
And I'm not just saying that. Do you have any final thoughts for Alyssa or Snyder?

3407
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Anything else you want to address before we head out?

3408
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:10,000
On the show role, it still talks about the FUs of the week.

3409
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:18,000
And I don't have one actually. I was going to say I got some really good news that hopefully will become even better news in the coming week.

3410
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:22,000
So I will announce that on Twitter and Facebook when it's appropriate.

3411
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:27,000
But if there was an FU of the week, I was going to abstain because I'm all about putting positivity back into the world.

3412
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Good. Good. FUs of the week are now on a on demand situation.

3413
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Jamie's like, I need it. Then we do it.

3414
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:39,000
OK. All right. But thank you again for being here. You did great.

3415
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Dark Soccer, it's so lovely to have you back in studio. I've missed having you here in studio.

3416
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I've missed being here because I hate working Sundays.

3417
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:50,000
I know. I know. But you know what? Congrats to you and everything you've been going through in your job.

3418
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,000
I know part of that was moving on up into something you wanted to do.

3419
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Yeah. So super what I wanted to do. But I'm going to four by tens. Oh, good.

3420
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:04,000
So I've done it once before. But, you know, I was also one hundred eleven pounds heavier and got tired a lot easier.

3421
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:12,000
So hopefully this will be easier on me. And hopefully if everything works out, I'll be off Thursday, Friday and Sunday.

3422
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:18,000
OK. So that means I get my Shabbat back and it means that I get my will not daytime Shabbat, of course,

3423
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:22,000
but I'll get my Friday nights back for services and I get my Sundays for the show.

3424
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Well, fingers crossed, because we we really need to have you back here in studio.

3425
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,000
I mean, Loki and I, Loki and I do a good job and at least we get in the classic game of the week.

3426
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:37,000
But it's not the same, you know. Also, though, I will be in San Francisco on Easter for Sisters in the Park

3427
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:42,000
because it's the fortieth anniversary of the the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.

3428
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:46,000
I thought you were going to bring up the sexy Jesus competition. Yeah, hunky Jesus.

3429
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Well, they have sexy Mary and hunky Jesus. Oh, that's sorry. And then the Easter bonnet.

3430
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:57,000
But but I would just like to say that it would be nice that if you're in the area, come out.

3431
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:03,000
And it's actually back at Dolores Park. I am really looking for more conventions to attend.

3432
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:07,000
I'm even looking at possibly going up to Portland Retro Expo with me.

3433
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Well, I'm talking about like video game related things for the show. There are I mean, video game cosplayers there.

3434
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:19,000
True, true. But so if you have conventions, especially West Coast, because it's much easier for me, places I can drive in a weekend.

3435
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:23,000
And Portland and L.A. are about as far out as I can go. So I can't really go East Coast in a weekend.

3436
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
But, you know, I'm looking for more opportunities to do things like that.

3437
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:29,000
I want to get the word out about Orange Mountains Radio and Vogue Network and our move and all that stuff.

3438
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:35,000
So, yeah, I also I actually now I'm actively looking for co-host for pinball thing.

3439
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:41,000
And I'll talk to Dan, too. So. All right. Well, we'll see you at least on tape next week.

3440
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:45,000
But we hope to have you back here in person soon. So, dude, if I had the time to call in, I do it.

3441
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:50,000
But I had no money, not no money, but I have that bronchitis that killed it. So fair enough.

3442
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:55,000
What else? What else? Thank you, American health care system. My final thought tonight.

3443
02:57:55,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Just thank you, guys. I am just very happy that like a lot of improvements worked tonight.

3444
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:07,000
The discord thing worked. Hopefully the recording works. I'm still going to find out about that with that whole change.

3445
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:12,000
And the video is looking sharper and great. And I'm just like really happy and how far we've come in a month.

3446
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:17,000
I've been trying to improve little things every week and it's been going great. And thank you, guys, for being here.

3447
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Of course, you guys are such an important part of that. And that's it.

3448
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:24,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange On Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

3449
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3450
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:30,000
But we can only really air those voices if they're here to air them.

3451
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:37,000
So help us spread the word. A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you heard about this show goes an awful long way.

3452
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:42,000
We also appreciate all the followers and the biddies. I'll acknowledge you guys here on Twitch after the credits.

3453
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Thank you guys again so much for just being here and supporting Orange On Radio and helping us grow.

3454
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:50,000
We're going to roll the credits now, but we cannot wait to see you in seven days.

3455
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:56,000
So have a great week, everybody. Happy gaming. And for those of you that have a three day weekend, happy Martin Luther King Junior Day.

3456
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:05,000
And remember what this weekend is all about. You know, treat treat people with respect, for heaven's sakes, especially in Overwatch Bronze League.

3457
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Have a good night, everybody. We'll see you next time.

3458
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:11,000
