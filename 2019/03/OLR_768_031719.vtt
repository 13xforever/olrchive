This week on the heels of the shakeup of gaming companies as we know them, the Legend of Android Gaming Machines returns. Let's just hope it doesn't follow the same path as Uya did. This is just one new alphabet initiative. Join us for more of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I got a gamer hat on too, look!

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
It's a Klonoa hat.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Oh it's a Klonoa hat.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
It's an official Klonoa hat.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I thought it was just Pac-Man because I can only see the one side. Awesome.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Very cool.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Because he has Pac-Man on his hat.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
And Techmaster Loki of course is here as always.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Nothing video game themed on.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
What's your shirt?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I couldn't see on the side.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm getting a whole bunch of new shirts this week.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Nothing green. Pinch. Pinch.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
You see this?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Do you see this world?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I have green on my Apple Watch.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Happy St. Patrick's Day

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
to those of you that are in the mood for this season.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Or some of my friends call it

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Straight Pride.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh it's an oatmeal shirt.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'll explain this in a minute.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
You know whenever gay pride gets brought up

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
there's always that troll that says

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
here you go, today's your day.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Celebrate. Enjoy your moment.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Every day.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Is white people straight pride?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
All those characteristics are really

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
on display today. Have you been down to downtown today?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Have you been down K Street?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I avoided it like the plague you.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Anyhow.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So the shirt I'm wearing for the sake of the podcasters.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
We are a podcast but we do tape

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
live at Twitch TV every Sunday night

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 Eastern

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
VoGnetwork.com or VoGnetwork.com

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
So the shirt I'm actually wearing

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
is a Beat the Blurch shirt

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
from when they did those marathons a couple years ago.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay here's the funny thing behind this.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So I actually didn't run the marathon.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I was all signed up, ready to go.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I got super sick the night before.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And it wasn't one of those like

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
ugh I'm sick

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
and I don't think I can go.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
No I was like

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
sick. So it wasn't happening.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
So my pal Melody went and she brought back this shirt

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
so it's really funny because it says I beat the Blurch

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and I ran 5k and it's like no you didn't hoe.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
But oh well I still have the shirt

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
and it's one of the only green things I own so

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
it seemed appropriate to wear tonight.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
A little warm for today though. We did get quite

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
toasty. I have

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
not been outside all day. How sad is that?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I foraged today. Did you?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
For dandelion greens. Okay.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Well it was definitely

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
eaten a lot in the US during the Depression

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
because people ain't got no money

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
for food. But dandelions

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
the leaves are full of calcium

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
and iron and the

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
blossoms are actually edible as

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
well. Good source of fiber and beta carotene.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Are you vegan? No. Fuck no.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay. Hey listeners

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
do you see this? A little

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
traditional dish. This is

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
dead boiled cow.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And it has been in my mouth

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
it is almost as salty as I am.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Right. Almost. Almost.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Almost. But nothing can meet

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
those levels besides dead maybe the

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
ocean. Boiled bovine.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Anyhow. Hello to

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
everybody in our chat room because again

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
we do tape live at twitch.tv

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
slash vog network and we do have

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
lots of folks in chat. Some folks

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
also noticing on twitch tonight we did a special

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
our border tonight is green.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Just a little wink and a nod to the day

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
today and Bobby joined in on that too

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
so that was kind of fun. So yeah there you go.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Let's get into some video game discussion.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
After all we are a show that talks about video game

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
and gaming culture. And I

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
guess this first kick off topic tonight is

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
a little bit about gamer culture. But this

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
has been all over the news. In fact I'm looking at an article

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
that actually came in on Reuters

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
about this. And it has to do with

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
influencers.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Influencers. And those people

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
that can influence people. I hope the camera

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
can pick up my eyes rolling.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's a little further back now Loki.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
You might have to roll them really good. That's why I'm just

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
subtitling

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
that with my eyes are rolling.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Before I even say the name

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
of the influencer why are you rolling your eyes

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
over here. Because it's not a non story.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I mean obviously you pay people

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
like any brand you pay people

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
to sponsor stuff.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Alright let me tell you what you're talking about.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So long story short

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Ninja whose real name is Tyler

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Blevins it seems like was

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
paid one million dollars

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
to promote

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Apex Legends which

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
one might argue successful

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
campaign because Apex Legends has

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
been doing very well for itself. Not necessarily because he did it though.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
That's true. You don't know if it's

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
because of him or just because of the strength of

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
the game itself. I think it's the game.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I think a big part of it is the game too.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I think

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I want to get to the rest of the story but I think a big

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
part of Apex Legends success is

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
the fact that people were kind of

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
like I don't know about you guys but

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
like I can only be

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
sustained by one video game for so long.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And I've joked about this on the show before is that

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I have and I don't mean to make light of like actual

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
conditions or anything. So if you can think of

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
a better name to call this and I'm open to it.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh my god. Let's not be so

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
super PC about everything.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Like we're going to start

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
now.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm just saying.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I have gamer ADD so I'll play

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
one thing for like five or ten minutes.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I am totally offended by that. My son

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
has ADD.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Actually ADHD.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't care. I'm just joking.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
How about just general

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
lack of attention span.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
My point is that I can only play one thing

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
for like five.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
But you guys know I do this. I spend a bunch of

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
money on a game. I play it for a little bit and then it's like

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
on to the next game. There's very few games

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
that are able to hold my attention. Now

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
before because I'm sure there's chatters already

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
chiming in. What about the MMOs?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Because I do play things like Warcraft.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I play Final Fantasy 14.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And I kind of tend to stick to those for a long time.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But I think part of what makes those games a lot

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
different is the more social elements

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
of those games. But anyway.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I was getting to a point with this with Apex

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Legends specifically. So with Apex Legends

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
the deal is that I think

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
a lot of folks who are

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
kind of like ready for the hot new thing after a couple

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
months. I think they were kind of done with Fortnite.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Not necessarily like done with Fortnite

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
like oh I'm over this game. But it's like

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
when this new kid shows up on the block that's

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
oh it's like a similar

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
formula but a little

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
different. And you know a different way of doing it.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Like I think a lot of people were like oh let's move

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
on to this. Because it's like kind of what I enjoy

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
but something new. Kind of

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
what happened to PUBG

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
once Fortnite came along.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Not to say either of those games are doing

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
terrible for themselves or not even like do well

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
but you know you can only be number

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
one for so long. Or maybe like not even

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
necessarily

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Fortnite but like

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
maybe even Black Ops 4 or something like that.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
There's lots of different games

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
out there. I think getting

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Ninjas because he's very

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
well known for playing

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Fortnite and whatnot.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And maybe the thought was okay

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
you get an influencer like this who has

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
a lot of the attention of the Fortnite crowd maybe

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
they'll see this and then want to try the game

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
out because it is free to play.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So I think that really helped a lot

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
is being that it's free and

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
not trying to sell you a $60 game that they're

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
going to throw the same type of microtransactions

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and sort of monetization

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
schemes on top of.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Very true. I think the free thing really helps.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Although Bobby Blackwolf in our chat points

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
out PUBG was the

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
first big Twitch success story which I would

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
agree with. It wouldn't have gotten any traction if

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
they didn't have big Twitch streamers playing it.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Although PUBG wasn't free if I remember

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
right. It was kind of on the cheaper end of things.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
PUBG isn't free yeah. Yeah it was like a $20

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
game I think when it was first in early access.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's still. Yeah it's still. It's still like

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
20. They might have upped it a little bit.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Kind of like Minecraft. Remember Minecraft was cheaper

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and then the price went up when it got really popular.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And I think PUBG is a very similar sort of

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
story. I think it was cheaper in the beginning than it is

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
now but it's not. It's certainly not $60.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It's still a budget title if you will.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah. So and that

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
probably helps it as well.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Anyway.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Let's see. It was noted

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
that Ninja had

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
excuse me. Ninja

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
had tweeted about the game on February 5th

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
and then he had 13 million followers

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
on Twitch and went to play the game

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
on Twitch and he was paid for

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
1 million and this was according to a source

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
that gave that to Reuters.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I think that's how you pronounce that Reuters.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So anyhow and he may not have been the only one

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
that was actually paid

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
for this either.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
It sounds like there may have been other folks too.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah. So I mean

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
but this is the type of thing that they do

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
though. I mean even with like Battlefield

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
5 I think they had paid influencers as

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
well. There's

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
a lot of games that they have paid influencers

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
on and I think

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
the only reason it's notable is because it's like

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
oh it's a million dollars but I mean honestly

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
it's the same as like beauty care lines

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
paying celebrities to promote

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
their stuff on Instagram or whatever the

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
case may be. The same thing. Or paying

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Kylie Jenner to promote Fyre Festival.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Yes exactly

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
like that. I'll be honest I mean even though

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm not like a huge huge influencer

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I got offered like

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
some crazy ass discount to

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
show off a cat ring.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I wanted to buy one anyway.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I mean the only reason that they were asking

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
people to pay for it is because the money goes back to charity

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
for homeless cats. So I was fine

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
doing it. So basically they were only charging

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
me the donation.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
And

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
there's another

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
channel out there that's called Pretty

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Pastel Please and she's in Australia

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
she used to work

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
actually she still works in advertising I think

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
but she talked about the whole influencer

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
thing and how it works behind the scenes too.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So it's exactly

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
there's a product to sell and there's someone that's streaming

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
it then

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
money's gonna go into

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
it. Right I mean and this isn't

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
gonna change it and it's a smarter

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
advertisement anyways because what are you gonna do actually put

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
out like TV advertisements or anything like

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
that. I mean it's

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
this is

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
this is the easiest way to get

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
to your target audience is by

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
going to where you know the

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
eyes are obviously twitch streamers

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
YouTube streamers

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
social

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
media platforms it's

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
gonna be it's basically targeted advertising

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
for this type of stuff and to put

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
stuff elsewhere

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I mean doesn't really make sense

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
you're not gonna get as much of a return on

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
investment for that stuff so it just

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
makes sense. It's like I mean

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
to take it a lot more simply it's like when people choose

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
billboard placement they're gonna put

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
the billboards in the place

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
that the message needs to get out number one the most

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
like if it's for advertising not just the

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
you know y'all suck

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
you know you homophobes shut up. But I'm

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
talking about like the advertising ones

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
they're gonna put them like for restaurants

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
on the side of a highway so that

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
hungry people will go on

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
driving hangry and go get a burger

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You know I think in the interest because you were talking

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
before I was having my coughing fit

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
sorry guys you were talking a minute

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
ago about how you've been offered this kind of

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
influence stuff and I think in the interest of disclosure

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
so is VOG Network and myself

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
personally in fact we're talking

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
about doing a game stream on

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
VOG Network right now with

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
a particular smaller publisher

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
but it's one of the it's a much smaller thing

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
it's like you know sure you give us an advanced

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
copy of your game for free we'll play it you know

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
for a couple hours just you know for the fun of it

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
you know because hey free game and you know

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
something that we can you know premiere to an audience

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
hopefully but I think

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
what strike I mean there there's also

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I think a big step difference between that between

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
like you know ooh free game for playing

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
it early on stream and one

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
million dollars there's a big

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
big I'd do it for a million

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
right but

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
to be fair I mean

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I don't want to sound like a bitter Betty either you know

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
it's very you can see how many people follow VOG

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Network in my personal channel versus how many

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
people followed Ninja and it's very

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
very different

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I would love it if 13 million people actually

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I don't know if I would love it if 13 million people

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
followed VOG Network because then your

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
every little thing goes under scrutiny and all

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
that stuff and like you know you joked about

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
earlier when I was you know choosing my words

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
carefully well if we had

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
13 million followers I'd probably have to be

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
oh my god are you telling me that some of

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
their feelings are gonna be hurt

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
oh no people with hurt

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
feelings who gives a fuck

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
without going too far I give a fuck

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I give a fuck too because I think

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
maybe not a hundred percent of the time

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
are these things that we see on

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Tumblr and stuff always but some of it is

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
valid I understand that but like

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
using common sense aside from

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
you know the obvious things like

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
being just like completely insensitive

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
to people you're

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
gonna get somebody's gonna get

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
upset about some opinion you have about

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
something you can't please everybody

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I will say this I think

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
that and this is just

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
people don't understand the

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
the difference between uh

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
intent and impact

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and so

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I think that we do have a responsibility

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
to watch some of what we say or make sure that

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
we preface it saying this isn't

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
said with malice here's the story

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I mean I think call out culture

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
is a disease

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
but that being said there are people out

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
there who need to fucking be called out because they are

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
doing it out of malice and I think the best

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I want to move back in the story but the best example

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I can give of this is that you know like back

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
early when this show first started

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I probably have used a phrase

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
a few times that I picked up off project

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
runway when he used to say hot

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
tea mess right

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
that used to be a phrase that was in pop culture and you probably saw it on

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Saturday Night Live but like now in the

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
year 2019 I realized that that phrase

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
ain't cool and there's some people who yes

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
their feelings get legit hurt when they hear that

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
and so like you know I respect that so that's

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
that's what I'm talking about you know what I mean like you know

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
if somebody's going to get but at the

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
same time okay I have been a

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
long time running host of the Rocky Horror Picture

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Show right and there's some people

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
that will write essays about how

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Rocky Horror Picture Show is problematic and all this stuff

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
and I wasn't it meant to be

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
in a way and I say it is a

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
product of a different time in

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
1975 this is all there was but

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
et cetera et cetera so some people

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I think want to

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
be mad just to be mad but

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
some of it is legitimate so we have

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
to navigate this delicate

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
place in between anyway

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
where was I oh yes Ninja has 13 million

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
followers and I don't a Ted Talk

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
um anyway

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
some other streamers were paid for this as well

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
EA paid Shroud who I guess is a popular

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Polish Canadian streamer with

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
6 million Twitch followers

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
but that guy actually declined

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
because didn't want to

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
oh no I'm sorry I'm sorry that guy declined

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
to disclose the terms of the deal so it sounds like he

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
did it but we don't know how much money he was paid for it and so

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
forth but um

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
interesting

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
that this is a part of our

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
gaming culture now is that

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
some of these people that we do choose

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
to elevate with our Twitch

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
follows and the biddies and the subs

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
and all that stuff some of the people that we

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
do choose to elevate

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
um were

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
are making coin off it

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
basically I still

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
don't see why

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
PDP is still around

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
that is a whole nother Oprah that I don't

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
want to get into right now

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
so I should just really duct tape his tongue

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
to the top of his mouth and never remove

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
it anyway

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
um let me go to our chat over at

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
twitch.tv slash vog network

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
um

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
um let's

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
see uh some people are talking

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
about me uh leaving the room

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
uh bobby's saying we need to influence more so we need you

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
alive uh quest buster

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
in uh our twitch chat says

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
apex legends is something that

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
uh shroud probably would have paid

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
played anyway also he was

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
consulted for the game months ago as a

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
secret project which he publicly

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
admitted and you know I've heard of that type

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
of thing in the gaming industry before not just

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
with influencers but I've heard of it with

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
reviewers you know this is a thing

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
is that some game

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
websites and some big game websites

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
will take money

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
to do a

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
a review of a game basically that is

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
confidential between the site

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and the publisher it's not the

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
real review it's a mock review basically

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
but it's like the actual like the way they would have reviewed

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
it if they played that product today that

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
review is never published it's sent to the publisher and the

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
publisher or the developer uses

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
it to implement feedback and make the game

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
better and then the real game

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
is reviewed by somebody

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
else on the same site obviously

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
you could understand that once somebody takes

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
a deal like that and has reviewed the game

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
one time that's not the same person that can write the

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
review later on but that whole like

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
consulting with a

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
personality is not particularly

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
unique to the gaming industry

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
what I think is unique is that now it's not

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
just like game reviewers but it's game

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
players and people who

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
in some ways you could say

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
review games live on stream

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I guess that's that's

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
kind of one thing I think I've seen

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
done on Twitch before maybe have done myself

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
is that I'm getting my first impressions

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
of a game live on stream and

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
if I had 13 million followers

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
that's something I might be able to make

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
a little more money doing so

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I don't know do you guys

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
think this is a dangerous thing for the industry

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
or it seems like based on

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
kind of like what I was hearing a minute ago based on the

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
fact that Instagram influencers are paid

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
and other types of industry

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
leaders are paid for endorsements

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
you know lovely celebrities

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
are paid for makeup campaigns and things like that

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
that maybe we're okay with this because

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
this is what we do

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
as long as they're following the law and the fact that

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
they're disclosing that's an advertisement

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
and that type of thing I don't see a problem

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
with it which they all did

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
so as long as they're doing that not trying to do

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
some shady shit where oh

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I'm being paid to say something good about this

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
but I'm not telling you that it's an advertisement

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
that that's the only problem

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
which YouTube had a big thing with that

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I want to say about a year ago

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
yeah it was the FTC

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
coming down on like all sorts

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
of different things and it was

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
it's they've been better about it

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
because I think some people were unaware

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
of what the law was but

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
it's been I think it's been

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
alright as far as people disclosing

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
stuff just as long as it's very upfront

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
like hey this is a paid advertisement

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
or you know paid sponsorship

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
with this you know

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
we're talking about this game

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
here's why um

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
then I'm fine with it

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't know I don't watch Ninja

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
so I don't give a shit you know either way

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
and honestly to

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I don't think yeah

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
it's good that he did that

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
and he's promoting that

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
but don't think really the game

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
needed that it was pretty

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
strong on its own but

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
do you think maybe that and

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I don't think we want to say one person alone

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
did this but maybe the influencer

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
campaign as a whole let's say and all these

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
streamers that they may have worked out deals

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
with to do this do you think maybe that helped

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
this punt out the gate

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
because this game landed with a bang

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
as opposed to a slow build

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
maybe a game that took a little while for people

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
to discover and then it kind of

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I guess but what might be more like

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
a Minecraft type situation it would be interesting

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
to see like how

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
you know how much of an influence those influencers

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
had like how how this

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
boosted the numbers to be interesting to see

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
but I don't know yeah it's a bummer because apex legends

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
they don't ask you where did you hear about our game

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
they don't really well they could have like I don't know there

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
could be maybe a link in the video or something like that

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
that has some sort of like tracking

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
tag or something enough that's the way

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
twitch usually does things if

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
you're playing a certain game maybe I have to

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
admit I wasn't watching those streams so I don't know

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
but I do know that sometimes like as an

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
affiliate there are certain games

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
and it's not all of them there are certain games that

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
if twitch sells them on the store

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
if you're playing them on your stream there'll be a little

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
link right under the stream to buy the game

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
and then that streamer gets a little cut of the money

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and then I'm sure they can measure all that

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
analytics as well so I don't

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I don't know but well I guess you know

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I think they've got that whole twitch prime thing

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
right now is running with apex

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
legends so maybe that's a way that they're

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
trying to measure their audience I don't know

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
there's a lot I don't know I think this is a lot

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
of uncharted territory

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
one other thing I want to bring up in response to what you

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
say because I thought it was interesting because you talked about during

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
the whole YouTube scandal that you had a lot

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
of people who didn't know what the law was

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
which you know well they claim not

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
to know what the law was yeah fair enough

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
but I think when it does come to the law

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
you know not everybody

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
is very good at interpreting the law

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
all the time I think YouTube

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
tried to make strides to

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
dumb down the law and make these

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
videos for creators to help YouTube

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
makers understand the law

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I think that's part of what they felt

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
their onus was to do which is fine

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
but I mean it also goes to

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
conversations about as our technology moves

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
more and more and more our laws

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
don't always seem to get updated

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
fast enough we talk about this all the time when it comes

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
to copyright, trademark

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and IP laws

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
you know the dancing thing

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
that's come up before right the Carleton

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
is in the game and how do we handle that

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
right that whole thing

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
is just like this uncharted territory because the

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
laws are being updated as fast as the technology

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
yeah this is causing this

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
very interesting sort of story and they're not going to be unfortunately

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
because you have people that are

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
have a lot more money that want to control things

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
so they can keep all that money and

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
it's not going to change

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
yeah very interesting

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
let's see other comments in chat

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
5th Dream in chat says to me it just seems like

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
business as usual they do it on

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
TV always so

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and Questbuster follows that up with

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
same here I'd be more surprised if

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
EA didn't do something marketing wise 5th Dream

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
so maybe this is just this interesting

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
new territory maybe you're going to see I think it's

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
kind of happening already but maybe you're going to see more

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
and more folks on

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Twitch you know getting

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
some sort of

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
maybe either commutation be it

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you know free game or maybe

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
well maybe we'll see that with EA's

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Battlefield 5 thing that they've got

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
the new battle they have the new

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
was it

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Battle Royale mode that's coming to

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Battlefield 5 that they

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
had a trailer out for this week

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
they'll be showing that off because

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
everybody's got to jump on that

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
bandwagon all I got to say

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
is you can't be an industry leader if you're following

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
people so

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
alright

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
let's move on to what sorts of

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
games have been influencing us

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
this week as we talk about how is our

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
gaming week and the types of video games that we've

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
been playing this week Dark Soccer we'll start with you

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
how was your gaming week I

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
played a bunch of pinball really Pokemon

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Go I touched

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Ingress once

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
just to see if it was still there

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I'm still playing

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
idle pouring I don't really mention it but I'm still

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
playing it

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I am borrowing

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Horizon Zero Dawn

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I haven't started it yet but I figured I would

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
start it on stream or something

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I was actually planning on starting to

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
stream this week but I have a birthday party

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
on Wednesday night and I'm going to see

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Renae on Thursday so

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
which by the way thank you so much for

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
that shout out about women in games

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
here in Sacramento that was awesome

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
oh that was something

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
that Bre did right? Oh sorry that was Bre

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
why did I say Renae? I don't know but thank you Bre

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
because Renae was also floating

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
an article this week but it was about a different topic

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I posted Renae's thing my brain

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
is like broken it's fine sorry

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I have a donut

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
we miss her though she should come back to OLR

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
when she's ready I miss everybody

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
but no but I'm

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
going to go hang out with Renae and so maybe I'll play

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
games while I'm in San Francisco

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
while I was at

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
did I talk about the

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Munster's release party at coin op?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
you did a little bit last week

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I didn't know if I had mentioned it but that was lit

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
so

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
we actually had a tweet that came in this week

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
about some folks were appreciating the pinball

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
talk that came up on OLR and I was like

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
dark soccer is a big pinball fan how many machines

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
do you have in your house now?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
three in the house no six in the house

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm at the house

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
collectively no I'm actually having to do the math

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
we are giving back

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
pinbot 2.0 we're borrowing it

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
we're trading back

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Adam's family to get our twilight zone back

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
so twilight zone creature from the black lagoon

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
judge dread

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I thought she was counting

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
like the ones in the house versus the ones in the garage

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
and I'm like same thing

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
the shadow and

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
one other I can't remember

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
so we have

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I think eleven

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
right now it's enough where they're not only in your

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
garage but you have a spare bedroom

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
we move more in the house because Dan's Mustang is coming home

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
so we have to clear out the garage

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
so there's room for the Mustang

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
they're no longer rusting

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
it's a 1969 Mustang coupe

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
so do the math

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
it's huge

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
damn muscle cars though what's your favorite table

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
you own I already know this I actually have two

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
well World Cup soccer

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
is my favorite but my second favorite

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
is theater of magic what's the worst table you own

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
fuck I really hate

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
judge dread is

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
grown on me but I do not

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
like creature from the black lagoon

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
a lot of people love it it's just not

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
that fun for me and probably my least favorite

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
of all time would be the hobbit the new one

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
because it's slow as fuck

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
do not like a slow table

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
but you know it turns out that I have a type

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
with designers well I love everything

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Steve Ritchie has done I seem

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
to be a John Papa Duke girl so

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
because my two favorites are Papa

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Duke tables alright

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I thought I thought it was appropriate to engage

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
in a little pinball talks there you go heck yeah

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
but we have Ghostbusters and I've been playing the

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
crap out of it for me I'm still waiting for

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
pin bot to hit virtual console because I love the

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
NES version of pin bot even though I know a lot of people hate it

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I loved it they're actually we were

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
watching some pinball game reviews

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
like for NES versions the version

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
of the getaway that came out for

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
for one of the home

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
consoles it was pretty terra bad

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I think getaway was

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
the NES I think they did that

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
one after pin bot because I know there was a

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
getaway that came out pretty pretty not good

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
yeah Bobby Black Wolf

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
is a little bit inspired

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
perhaps saying I still really really need to finally

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
clean out the room we're turning into our

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
arcade so I can finally start down the path

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
of Dark Sakura and Dan and collect

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
pinball tables absolutely

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
well you need to come over before

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
we get rid of brighter pin bot 2.0

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
yeah I want to come play do you know what that is

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
not the 2.0 I played your

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
you had a regular brighter pin bot at one point

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
oh wow so basically

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
brighter pin bot 2.0 has an extra board added

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
to it that has new rule sets

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and it's linked to usually a color

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
DMD that has

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
different game modes and different things

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
and a new soundtrack like a digital soundtrack

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
it's pretty freaking amazing

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
so

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
after the show everybody

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
look on YouTube

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and find video of a brighter

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
pin bot 2.0 just soundtrack

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
the soundtrack makes me think of

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
old Space Mountain

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
and by the way Dick Dale died

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I heard, sad

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
alright, Loki how was your gaming week

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
what did you play? I didn't play a whole lot because

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
like I said I was working in Unity trying to get myself

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
back into the swing of working

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
in Unity again

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
so I finished my

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
code along tutorial

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
thing it was like some tank combat game

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
so that's done

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I'm not really doing anything that I'm definitely not

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
publishing that because that's just

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
there's nothing different than what they

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
provide it's just kind of following

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
along to kind of get into the groove

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
of working in Unity

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
and also it kind of showed me a little bit

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
of the audio mixer which is something that they added

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
a while ago but since I haven't used

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
it before I didn't really

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
know what it did so that was kind of cool

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
to learn that a little bit

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
and then let's

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
see I played a little bit of Dance Dance Revolution

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Extreme I saw your

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
live stream yeah a little bit

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
it was funny because I haven't noticed this

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
because I have a legit

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
extreme but I'm running a mod

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
disc right now because I was playing

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
other mixes but I don't know

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
if it's the drive or the disc I

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
burned but it doesn't run very well

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
on the other mixes so

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I put it back to extreme because I just didn't

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
want to mess with that crap anymore

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
so I have extreme and I'm running mods

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
in it but I didn't realize that the extreme

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
version that's on that mod disc

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
is a modded extreme

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
so it's got extra modifiers on there

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
like the 0.5 speed

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
wave and there's some

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
other thing it was the stuff that was in like

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
extreme

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
it's not extreme plus because I think

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
extreme plus is the one with the marvelous

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
the marvelous ratings

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
there's one it's

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
what the hell

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
is it called Megamix it's like

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Megamix but Megamix also had one

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
that I can actually adjust the clock speed

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
of the game so that the songs that speed up or slow

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
down so it's like

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
oh that's like a Beat Saber type of thing

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
so it's Megamix mods so it's got some of those

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
in there but

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I didn't realize it was in there until I

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
was playing it I was like wait a second 0.5

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
speed that's not normally there like oh

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
crap this is a modded one so

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I tried that in

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Max 300 and nope

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
cannot play it like that it's

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
it doesn't work well for me so

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I was

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
just playing other stuff though so I have been going through the

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
mods some more because I don't

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
remember like some of these

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and I also have to remove some of the ones I have duplicates

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
on there or just they're broken like I have

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
a dynamite ray of one that I think I

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
made maybe that's off by

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
like at least a whole

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
measure so that kind of sucks

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
and then I

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
played

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Pokemon Go a little bit

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I didn't play too much on PC

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I played

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
a little bit of this game called

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Jelly Mario which is

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
a weird

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
web game you can play so it's

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Jelly Mar

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
.io and

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
go check it out it's free

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
and you basically have to

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
traverse Mario and

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
he's just this big jelly thing and everything in

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
the world is very

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
jelly like and it's

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
very hard especially when you get to the

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
castle because you have to dodge

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
all the fire bars and

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
sometimes you just can't get the

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
momentum right to be able to pass

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
through that so let me play that on stream on Tuesday

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
because I'm planning on streaming

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
on PC on Tuesday either

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
maybe Jelly Mario and

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Saints Row 2 but I wanted to do

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Saints Row 2 because I love Saints Row 2

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
and it's a great game and I watched some other guy

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
that I follow call me Kevin

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
play it and it looked hilarious I'm like

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I remember how hilarious that game was I want to play that

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
so we'll be doing that

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
and I'm going to try to stream

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
more DDR during the week

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I wanted to stream more actually

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
earlier in the week but I was fighting with

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
stupid OBS

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
because it decided that oh hey you don't have permissions

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
to run this anymore for no reason

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
so I had to

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
download it again and it finally worked but it took me

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
30 minutes to figure that out

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
but yeah I need to

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
get back into the swing of playing DDR every day

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
instead of just like once or twice a week

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
alright that's it

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
my giveaway probably a little more scaled

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
back than I'm used to I don't want to talk a lot

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
about this yet until I've really truly

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
made it a habit but I'm trying to

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
change my fitness journey and that all

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
started this week so I'll leave it at that for now

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
until I actually stick with it

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
because I don't want to be that person that's like you know two days

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
into it like I'm making these greats and then

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I fall off the wagon so check

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
in with me in a few weeks but

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
meanwhile so that's been cutting into my time

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
a little bit but meanwhile I'm still

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
playing the good old MMOs that I have

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
been sticking by like World of Warcraft

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
which is funny because I don't

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
you know when I used to play

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
and was super into wow I would do

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
raiding and I would do all this stuff I've been playing

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
kind of by myself but one thing I've

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
kind of noticed about World of Warcraft that's kind of

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
grown on me is that there's so much more you can do by yourself

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
like I've geared my character up to

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I hit the point where my resto

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
shaman is now out geared my

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
warlock that I was running for a while

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and my shaman

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
whose named Porkchop by the way

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
in memoriam of the

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
very first queen to ever be booted from

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
RuPaul's Drag Race

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
so Porkchop is

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
level 300 and plus I just love

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
a panda shaman named Porkchop

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
oh she's still around I haven't like

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I don't think I've deleted a character

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
that was like above level 10

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
if I play though I'll probably move my

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
dragon huntie

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I mean honestly

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
demon huntie the only thing that matters about

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Horde and Alliance or I'm sorry the only

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
thing that matters to play with other people is Horde and

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Alliance like your server like just doesn't

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
matter anymore it really doesn't

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I want to like play in areas

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
yeah I know but you get moved over to other servers now

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
like the whole thing like if you and I

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
party you'll suddenly be on my server

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
shit yeah yeah no and like

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
servers don't even fucking matter anymore it's great

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
like I wish Final Fantasy 14 would steal that

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
technology but anyway yeah

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I do a lot of world quests

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
and I just do a lot of like queuing up by myself and things

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
like that and that's just kind of like my mind numbing

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
thing to do but I have played other games

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
too and one I haven't talked about on the show yet even

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
though I started it last week and I played

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
a little more this week so I'm

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
continuing my PlayStation VR adventures

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and catching up on my backlog on PlayStation

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
VR I started playing Skyrim

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
VR so I've been playing that a little bit

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
so that's a game that you've actually played that I have yet

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
in the play yet oh right high five

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
okay so

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
well here's the thing once I found out

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
you don't have to actually use the

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
move controllers because I was like

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
that sounds like a ridiculous and like look don't get me

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
wrong like move plus VR

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
is great for like Beat Saber

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
this print

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
vector I was talking about last week

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I did download that radial G game

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
as well I played that a little bit that actually doesn't

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
use the move so I don't know why I brought that up just then but I did

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
so

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
so but I'm like I don't want to play Skyrim

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
with a freaking move controller it's like this is too

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
much I don't need to this is not how you play

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Skyrim

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
you don't need to do it that way right so

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I just want to like controller

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
but just instead of my TV VR

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
because the Skyrim world

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
is gorgeous it always was even

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
from the very first version of the game

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
so I wanted to see what that looked like in VR so

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I'm playing just with

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
the plain old controller and I'm

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
playing in VR and it is

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
it's a very good looking game like I found myself

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
doing the same thing I think a lot of us did

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
when we first played Skyrim I was stopping

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
to stare at the flowers because I'm like they're so

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
purple and they're 3D and they're

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
cute so here's the interesting thing about

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
VR because obviously VR brings

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
all these you know

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
concerns about is somebody

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
going to get motion sick and things like that

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
so what they do

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
they actually have all sorts of ways

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
you can control it but

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
you can turn by looking

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
and move in those directions but

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
what you do is that the right stick

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
instead of being a full pivot to

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
look around and move instead it like

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
turns you automatically like maybe 30

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
degrees one direction so like if you tap

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
left on the right stick it just turns you

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
30 degrees one direction and I think

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
now I believe you can change it and

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
make it a full rotation

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
but then that means you're rotating it's going to be different from

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
where you're looking and that's what makes people sick so that's

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
not the default but they if you want

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to play the throw up ride you can I guess

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
but I'm getting

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
kind of used to the whole being able to move

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
on the right stick and like change

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
my perspective and it actually kind of

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
works and I dig it it's

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
you know the way you actually target things

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
then is to look so let's say like I've been playing

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
a mage and let's say I zap a wolf

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
which you know as you're walking down from that first

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
cave you run into a couple wolves so I zapped

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
a wolf with lightning and then

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
to loot the corpse you have to kind of like look at

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
the wolf so that your little crosshair

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
goes on it and then you can loot it so it's

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That sounds annoying as fuck

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I'm into it

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I don't know if I could play the entire

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
20 hour experience this way it's a

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
lot but like

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
20 hours or whatever

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
How long does it take to do the main story?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Main story only

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I don't know I've never finished

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Let's be clear I meant main story only

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Have I ever finished the main story?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Which main story?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Like just the main quest that gets you

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
to the game's ending

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
so to speak

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
There is a main questline and it's separated from side quest

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
when you're looking at your journal there's very clearly a main questline

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
The Alduin main questline

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
or the main questline with the two

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
factions

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I think the Alduin

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
is considered because the factions

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
can't you do both technically?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I think

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
My husband Alan is the expert on that

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
because he has played Skyrim

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
every single

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
every single

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
minus DLC he didn't do all the DLC

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
but every single quest

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
except for the ones that generate

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
because there's like the generating quests

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Oh god those never end

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
but I'm still pretty impressed at that

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
type of achievement

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It's interesting and I like watching

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
different scenes so they do some things

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
different so that very first opening scene

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
where you're in the cart and then you watch that

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
guy get killed by the executioner and the dragon

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
shows up they do it a little differently

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
because again they don't want to

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
move you without you

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
having some control over it so what

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
happens is that it kind of just quickly fades out

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
fades in to these different perspectives

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
so like you'll be standing there and it

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
fade out fade in you're looking up at the

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
sky and you see the dragon land fade out

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
fade in you're looking somewhere else

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
and I was kind of like wait a minute I don't remember it

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
being that way in the regular game and then I thought in my head

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
oh they're doing that because they don't want to

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
make somebody sick from motion that

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
they aren't controlling so they can't

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
deliver that the same way that you could in

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
a traditional monitor so it's kind of interesting

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
like those subtle little differences but

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
they didn't like take away anything or whatever

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
in fact I think it's good that they didn't just

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
slap Skyrim in VR and say play

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
they had to think of some of these things I thought was

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
very interesting so

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
um let's see

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
going into chat again at

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
live excuse me at twitch tv

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
slash vog network uh Bobby says

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I stopped with the move controllers pretty quickly

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
in Skyrim VR but that's how you play

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Twilight Princess right? Yes

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
but there is also a difference is that

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Twilight Princess was designed from

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the ground up for that whereas

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Skyrim they kind of had to shoehorn the

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
move thing back into it like I'm sure

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
it's a fine experience

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
it's just not what I want to play

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
because I don't associate Skyrim with that

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
whereas Twilight Princess

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
for me quintessentially

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
a Switch game yes I know

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
it was originally developed for Wii U but we all

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
know that they put a lot of thought into

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
the Switch instead on that and that

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
you know it was going to use those types of controls

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
you know at some point

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
early-ish mid-development or whatever

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
they made a conscious choice to

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
have a lot of Switch functionality in there as well

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
so anyway

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
let's see

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
oh I'm sorry I was

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
why was I thinking that you're right they said

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Twilight Princess and I immediately went to

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
um

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
my mind immediately went to the new one Breath of the Wild

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
my bad

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
so Twilight Princess on Wii well again

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
I still think the same argument applies

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
it was designed with the Wii in mind even though

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
sure it was also a game it was like the exact same

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
thing actually so maybe that's why my

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
brain kind of confused the two for a minute

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
anyway um

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Bobby says they also fade

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
in the edges of your vision when you

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
move which also helps decrease

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
motion sickness it does not eliminate

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
motion sickness for people who are extremely

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
prone I noticed that too I noticed

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the edges narrowed in really quickly

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
when you did that and I felt

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I didn't haze

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
the game for that because I'm like okay there's very much a reason

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
they're doing this like it's very

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
obvious like because when you look around you

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
have freedom so like it's not a system

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
this is a conscious decision I would hope that

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I could turn that off because like I

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
don't have a problem with motion sickness I played

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Minecraft on

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
um the Oculus

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
uh

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Gear VR thing and

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I used you know the controller

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
like you know you shouldn't really

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
this is not necessarily

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
recommended to use the controller for this and

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I was like nah this is cool I can't speak

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
to that specifically but I can

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
say there is a pretty extensive VR

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
customization menu and it wouldn't surprise

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
me if that was something you could turn on and off

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
but you know I

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
think it's smart that it uses

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
the safest settings by default

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
yeah if that makes sense so

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
anyway um I'm talking

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
a lot about a game that originally came

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
out many years ago so let's

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
move on I think that's it for our gaming

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
weeks uh I think it's time we get into some

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
gaming news I don't have a lot of housekeeping

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
because I don't know of any shows off

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Memorial Day but that's way

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
the day before Memorial Day will be our next

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
show off because I won't be here so I'm out of town so

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
we won't have a show that weekend so enjoy your

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
three day Memorial weekend I'm in Chicago that

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
weekend when is this Memorial

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Day so end of

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
May oh I'll be at DragCon

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
oh okay there you go so

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I'll be doing

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't know staycation programming

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
streaming playing games

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
kids kids alright

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
let's get into some gaming news Loki

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
so GDC is right around the corner

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
and of course the thought

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
or the tease has been

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
that Google is going to announce some sort of

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
game console or streaming service or

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
both or who knows

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
so of course a little bit more

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
credence to that Google has

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
announced via their Google

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
developers Twitter

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
page that hey guess what

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
id Software is

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
joining them alongside

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
during this whole

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
presentation not only that

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
they've revealed that also Ubisoft

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
is going to be

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
partnering with them as well

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
so definitely

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
seems to hint the fact

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
that hey you had this whole test

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
of like you know streaming

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Assassin's Creed

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and now you have them

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
partnering with them and

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
you have other game companies partnering

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
with them that yeah probably

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
there's going to be some sort of announcement at GDC

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I think that's kind of expected

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
at this point but I guess we'll

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
have to wait and find out March 19th

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
at 1230

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
so by this time next week we'll know

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
we'll be able to talk about it more in depth on the show

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
but any thoughts I mean you talk about

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
this whole streaming thing so does it seem like

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
maybe Google is going for a

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
streaming console that will stream

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
but not is Google making the Phantom

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
that's what I want

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
if it's going to be

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
exactly like the Assassin's Creed

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
thing was I would see it being built into

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
the Chrome browser

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
that may not be the case

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
for like say

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
you know like Android or something like that

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
maybe they'll have an app to go along with that

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
or something maybe it's going to

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
they're going to put out their own standalone

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
app or like kind of Google

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
TV type thing that's going to have

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
that built into it

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
we'll have to wait and see but

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I think since they were testing the whole browser

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
compatibility with that

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
that that's probably going to be the route at least

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
one of the routes that they're going to go

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
so we'll have to wait and see because I mean think about it

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
most people a lot of people use

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Chrome and you can just

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
hey install Chrome and

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
boom you have access to these games you know if you want

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
to pay a subscription or

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
whatever the case may be

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
and then you get to play these games

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
on a PC and it doesn't even have to be a high-end

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
PC it can be just one that

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
can run that

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
that has somewhat decent specs I think

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
and a decent internet connection

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
let me ask this kind of weird

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
question is that

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
we know that Google and for those that

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
are on Twitch my watch is yelling at me to stand

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
so I'm going to stand for a little bit so if it looks weird

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
sorry but

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
let me ask you like

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
because we don't know exactly what this

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
console is going to be doing

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
and we would be just

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
theorizing things

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and we could get proven wrong but what I can

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
ask is what

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
would Google need to do

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and I open this up to our chatters and Jamie

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
if you have an opinion as well what would

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Google need to do to convince

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
you to buy another console

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
and have another console in your house what

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
could they do knowing what you know about

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Google what could Google do

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
differently that hasn't been done

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
before

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I don't know if there's anything they

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
can do they just have to have good

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
games good exclusive games I'm not going to

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
buy another console to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
or Doom or something

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
like that that's already out on

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
numerous other consoles

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
honestly I don't really

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
see any reason to buy it because I have everything

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
else I already want most of my

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
gaming lately has been on my

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
PC well and to be fair they

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
haven't made the pitch yet so we can say that

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
now but if it's a system what

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
needs to be in that pitch to sway you

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
it's going to take something really

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
huge I mean that's all it is because

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I mean when Sony came

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
out you know for a first time with a new

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
system they had

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
a lot of good backing they had stuff coming

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
out that people wanted to play although Toshinden

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
doesn't necessarily count but

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
then you know

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
it's really a system is

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
only as good as the games that are on it

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
it's got to have the right

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
games to grab that attention like for example

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
if they had Namco behind

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
them and Namco's like we're going to do

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Klonoa 3 exclusively for Google's

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
platform I'd be like bitch

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
mine

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
well I mean yeah and to that

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
fact I mean remember Game Center and stuff

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
when they were trying to really hype that up on

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
the whole iOS site I mean they

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
had you know it doing

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
or was it Epic Games

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I don't remember doing the

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
one medieval

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
like first person game that they had on there and

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
that was just kind of it was cool

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
does anyone remember it now? No

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
so like

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
it's just hard like saying oh yeah we have

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
all these games that are popular on other

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
platforms but we're creating a new platform why

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
do I need to go to a new platform to play

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I want to know what

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
you're going to do differently are you how you're

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
going to make this more interesting than these

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
other platforms what are you going to give me that

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
the other platforms can't give me what

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
new like exclusively brand

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
new games are you going to have on this platform

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
that I can't get anywhere else

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
here's my thought and again I don't want to go

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
too far down this path because it's all theorizing

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
anyway but if it's you know

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
being able to play games

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
that are already available what can

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
they do to make you want to do that

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
put out a $40 console

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
and I know that sounds ridiculous but

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
you know keep in mind what that little Google

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Chromecast those aren't particularly expensive

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
right what if there's something that incorporates

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
gaming with that and it's like super cheap

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
and so it's like hey instead of buying

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
a $300 Xbox why don't you buy

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
this $40 Chromecast I get that

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
if it's that again

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
this is crazy I don't think that they could pull

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
$40 because Chromecast is basically

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
just a receiver your computer your computer

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
is sending the data to Chromecast

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I feel like I did this exact same thing last year

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
what if there's a Microsoft Xbox

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
they have like Google TV boxes

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
aren't that expensive like my box

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
what was it the my box they have

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
the Huawei one I have

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
it's um

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
it's like 80 bucks I mean it's not that

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
expensive and but and it

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
does like gaming stuff on it

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
like I can purchase games on there like through

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
the Google Play Store I have you can

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
install the Steam Link app on there

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
you can um

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
you can stream to it just like you can

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
with a

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
you know one of those dongles

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
so assuming that that's

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
powerful enough to run whatever app

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
that they have to be able to stream this stuff

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
then yeah that would work just fine

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
um I don't think

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
you can't obviously be a very

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
expensive console if you're gonna do that but

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
once again I don't know

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
if I need to really purchase another thing

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
because I have smart we're in the land of smart

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
TVs nowadays here's the thing too and my

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
wish list would be that I hope Google takes a good

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
hard look at why Steam Link failed but

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I mean we keep talking about this but I think at the end of the day

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
this is going to be more the streaming and the

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
existing games and all that might be

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
one element of this it might be a way to

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
um buffer the launch library

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
or whatever of Google's games but

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
and I think this is very important isn't it

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
out there now like on Twitter or somewhere that

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Jade Raymond is at Google that's

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
because you know she left

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
her last thing when the Star Wars right

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
she was on the Star Wars thing that got cancelled right

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and she disappeared and nobody really

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
kept tabs on where she ended up well it came out

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
this week she's at Google so

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
whatever this is likely

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
involves her and whatever

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
she's working on now so

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I don't think we're just talking about

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
existing games I mean and I don't know

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
she could be a vision person maybe

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
she's not designing a game I don't know we're not

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
gonna know until we hear this one yeah and I hope

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
that's the case because you're gonna need to

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
have exclusive stuff you having all the other

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
games things are good as well

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
but you need to have something that's

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
exclusive to your platform because you can't just

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
say well we have all these other games

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
that the same those consoles have too and you're like

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
well crap I already have that console

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
that has those games or I have a PC that has those

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
games the only thing I see that it's a pretty

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
decent angle that they could go with is like

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
you know what say you

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
don't have one of those consoles say you own

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
a Nintendo Switch and that's all you own you know

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
and they can't run these in your PC you know

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
you have a decent PC but it's not

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
a gaming PC and you can't run this stuff

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
well this box will help you be able to

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
play those games that you can't play

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
elsewhere and we can do it pretty cheap

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
and then that's you know and

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
hey we'll throw a subscription service in there as well

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
that's how I can see them being

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
successful with it but

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
we'll see I don't know they've tried

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
so many times with doing like exclusive

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
they tried to make like iOS

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
is gonna be like this big gaming

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
centric thing they've had exclusive games coming

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
to it and no one gives a shit about

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
that as far as being like oh my god

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
this is gonna replace my gaming consoles

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I think what

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
it is is I think

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
my prediction take it or leave it

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
is I do think Google is about to launch

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
they wanna be the Netflix of games as well

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
so they're gonna launch a competitor to Xbox

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Game Pass essentially I think Google's

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
looking to do that and they're gonna do it through

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
something that probably

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
integrates into your TV pretty easy but

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
maybe something they can also deliver through Android phones

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
although I don't think that will be very great for the gaming experience

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
but we'll see maybe Google

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
will prove me wrong

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
but I think they're going to launch

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
their own type of competitor for that

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and just like Netflix has to create

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
their own originals which

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
hopefully they don't cancel cause that was in the news this

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
week but I digress but just like Netflix

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
makes their own originals like Stranger Things and

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
shows that buff up the service

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I think they are creating a few of their own

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
in house type of games to

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
buff up whatever this is

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
but something very interesting

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Google did have a game developer before

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Niantic, Google let him go

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
when that whole alphabet split happened

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
now granted what Niantic develops

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
are not things for the television

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
when Niantic's been developing of course Niantic

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
is the developer of Pokemon Go

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
but at the time Ingress was kind of their bread and butter

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
but it turns out they were also

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
creating this Pokemon Go at the time the split happened

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
so you know

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Niantic's not creating games on the television but

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I think it is interesting to note

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
that Google did have a game developer

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
that they uh

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
and one that ended up being a pretty big deal

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
after Pokemon Go that they let out

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
they let walk out the door

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
so they may still have an investment level in it

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I don't know all the finance

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
but I think Nintendo is an investor

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Google probably still has some money in it

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
we'll see

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
and off topic a little bit did you get to see the screenshots

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
for the new Harry Potter game

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
um

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
oh yes I did

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I didn't make our show tonight

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
so some screenshots came out for Harry Potter Wizards Unite

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
which is Niantic's next game

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I still don't know what you do in the game

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
they're partnering with

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
going off script for a little bit

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
so they're partnering with the Warner Brothers

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
the Portkey games

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
and it really looks like based on the screenshots

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Portkey is helping them with the art assets

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
to give it that Harry Potter look

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
because the game looks pretty nice

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
and it doesn't look anything like Pokemon Go

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
or Ingress for sure

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
and basically there's no teams

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
so Harry Potter will not be a team based game

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
it sounds like you will join a house

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
for your character

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
but it's not something you're locked into

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
and it's not something where it's like

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Slytherin versus Hufflepuff

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
or whatever

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
it's not going to be like Ingress or Pokemon Go

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
or very team or faction based

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
and it seems like it's about collecting what's called

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
foundables

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
there's a lot of talk of things in the Harry Potter lore

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
that since I don't follow it as closely

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I didn't get it as much

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
but it sounds like it's kind of like a successor

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
to the ongoing story

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
but not the Cursed Child

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
kind of like in between that

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and something where you're looking for

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
these foundables because there's some sort of

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
war that's brewing in the world where they have to

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
bring all these collectables

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
back and you play some type of

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
magic force

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
and I apologize to the Harry Potter fans

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
which Jamie I think you follow these books more than I do

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
for sure

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
but you should look up the stuff that came out

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
on the game this week because there was very clearly some sort

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
of Niantic press day

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
that the embargo lifted and all these websites

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
did their previews the same day

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
so there's some more info on the game out there right now

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I'll take a peek, where my interest has been

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
peaked, aha!

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I think it's great that

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
they're taking a no teams approach because that tells me

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
it's a very different game from the other two

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
right out the gate

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I wonder though if they would have your house based on where you live

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
so if you're in the US you get

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
the Ilvermorny

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
it does not sound like that's

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
the case, it does sound like the

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
four traditional houses come into play

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
because in the story

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
you're going out into the world

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
to collect everything, so you could still

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
be like, yeah I think that's how

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
they wrote it in the story, but never say never

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Dark Soccer and again I am no Harry Potter

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
expert so anything is still possible

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
alright, okay

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
yeah I didn't understand based on the screenshots

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I know that they showed that you can do spells

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
to attack werewolves and crap

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
you have to save Harry

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
from being attacked by

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
there was this game I played on

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
iOS, it's probably on Android too

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I think it was called Magica or something

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I don't know if that was the name, but I remember

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
it was a game where you would trace

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
it was also a real world based

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
game and you would draw spells to

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
cast them in battle and stuff

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
and it seems like that is being included

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I don't know, we'll see, I mean hey it's free

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
you can try it out

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
let's see, see a Tiberian chat

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
says clearly developed by a Hufflepuff

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
diplomatic looking for things

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
not about Flashy showing off

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
interesting

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
so, well we'll see

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
of course I'm going to try the game when it

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
comes out, I have played really

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
great AR real world

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
games and I have played trash

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
AR real world games, I played Garfield

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Go for like a minute

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I played Garfield Go for a couple minutes as well

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I played that Draconius Go

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
that was like the rip off, actually the

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Draconius thing brought some different ideas to the table

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
that game wasn't trash, it just

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
was kind of clunky

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
you know what my sister plays a lot

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
actually is that Jurassic parking

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
she's like really into that

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
that wasn't bad, I didn't dislike

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
it, it was just a little, I don't know

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I don't like it when the stuff is randomly

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
generated, I think part of what's always

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
drawn me to my Niantic games

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
is that they are based on real world things

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I would have never known were there if I

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
hadn't bothered to look

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
you know, in the early days when I first started

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
playing Ingress, I was like

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
I never had any idea that these things

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
were in my neighborhood and I think that's exactly

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
what Niantic was trying to do with that game

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
is get you out into your

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
neighborhood and know that these things were there

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
now granted, it's all user based

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
so, for example

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
they call the thing down the street, I want to say what they

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
call it, but you know what they call that in the game

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and I don't think it is what they call it

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
it's certainly not, so

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I don't think everything is necessarily educational

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
so, it's yeah

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
taking liberties with

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I'm surprised that the other thing

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
that's at the other park

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
is not something because

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
that's more significant than

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
a box in the ground

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
it has been tried to be submitted

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
multiple times because I keep seeing it

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
and are you talking about a thing

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
that looks like a, and I'm sorry we're having to be cryptic

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I have a right to my privacy

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I don't even know what the hell it is

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
does it look like an electrical thing?

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
yes

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
that has tried to be submitted at least three times

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
because I keep seeing it in the freaking OPR

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
and I can tell you without question

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
who's doing it and why they want it

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
but it's

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
look, the playground's fine

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
gazebos are fine, that ain't fine

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
there's hazardous

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
don't go here all around it

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
that can't be a point of interest

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
anyway, Bobby Blackwolf points out

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
what's happening now around here is I'm seeing

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
pokestops for things that no longer exist

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
yeah, that happens too

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I mean, the game's been out a while

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
you could report them invalid in Ingress

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
I don't know if you could do that natively in Pokemon Go though

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
no, because I had to do that

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
there was some murals and stuff

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
that were near my house

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
that there's no mural there anymore

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I was kind of wondering

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
that inside, but then you look at the photo

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
and it's outside and it's clearly not there anymore

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
alright, well I want to move on

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I do want to go to the next story we have here

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
which is about

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
the Valve Store and the Steam Store

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
and a potential kind of

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
privacy sort of issue

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
that may have happened with the Epic Store

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
here's the deal

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Valve is out there implying that

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Epic's launcher has copied

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
user data from Steam

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
and now they're going to launch an investigation

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
whatever that means

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
apparently what happened is that Epic

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
did confirm this

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
was taking their launcher and it made an encrypted

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
local copy of your

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
local config.vdf

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Steam file, because what it was

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
doing is that when you would say yes

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
I want to import my Steam friends

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
into the Epic Store

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
game, it's using that

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
file to do it, but Epic is saying

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
in a quote they said

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
information from

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
this file is only sent to Epic if you

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
choose to import your Steam friends

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
and then only hashed IDs

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
of your friends are sent and no

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
other information from the file

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
and that's only

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
accessing that information after you choose

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
to import Steam friends, but of course

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Valve, not happy about it

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
in a statement to bleep the computer

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
it's been there forever though, I mean like

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
it's been like that for months

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
in a statement to bleeping computer

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Valve said, we are looking into

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
what information the Epic launcher collects

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
from Steam, the Steam client locally

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
saves data such as the list of games you own

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
your friends list and saved login tokens

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
similar to information stored

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
in web browser cookies, which makes sense

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
if you have 500 games in your library you don't want

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Steam loading that every time

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
But isn't that the same as like if I

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
downloaded the Firefox

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
web browser and it wants to import my data

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
and cookies and stuff like that, I mean that's basic

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Yeah, it's basically the same thing, you're right

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
And why are we throwing a fit about this?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I think they're just, whatever

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
You think they're making an issue just to make an issue?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I think they're making an issue just to make an issue

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
And maybe that's

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
part of it, I don't know

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Kaijuto in chat over

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
at twitch.tv slash vog network though says

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Epic fail

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I don't know, again, I don't know if this is any different

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
from what other places are doing, but maybe they

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
weren't super transparent in what

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
they were doing, but it would make sense

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
that if you want this

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
launcher, this store

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
to access your Steam's

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
friends list, then you are giving it some

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
sort of permission to access Steam

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Right? I mean that would be implied, right?

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
It just doesn't just magically know

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
And I don't, I did do the

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
import, because whatever

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
I did it in GOG too, because GOG

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
used to have that thing, I think they sunsetted it

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
But they used to have that thing where like if you own

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
a game on Steam, you'd like get a copy

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
of it on GOG, but it was limited to

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
certain games only, but still there were a few that

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
came over, so like I let my GOG

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
access my Steam, where

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
was the stink about that?

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I don't remember that

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
It's because it's convenient now, because everyone's

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
upset about privacy

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and people breaching privacy

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
agreements and stuff like that

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Hey look it, they're bad

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Bobby wants to point out the difference, Bobby

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
sometimes understands the tech stuff

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
better than I do, that's for sure, so he

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
explains what the difference is

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Epic is preemptively getting this

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
data, and then asking

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
if you want to import it

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Firefox doesn't go after the data

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
until you tell it to, that's the

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
problem, is that Epic is preemptively grabbing

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
that file going, I'm just gonna

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
put this right back over here

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
for when this user says they want to

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
import their Steam friends, because who wouldn't want to do that

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Fine, I mean I guess they could just

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
easily not

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
do that, I mean that seems like a very easy fix

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Are they even saying that Epic has

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
already fixed it? I'm trying to see if in this

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
story they mention that Epic already fixed

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
it, but this might have been too

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
no, I haven't

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
seen any, because this story was just from

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
yesterday on the 16th, so I haven't seen anything

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
yet, but I imagine that's something

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
that Epic's probably gonna do would be the easy

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
fix, would be to just stop grabbing that file

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
until you say yes

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
import my Steam friends

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Anyway

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Let's move on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
This one actually is going

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
to be a little bit of cultural

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
explanation

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
is needed behind it, but

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
there's a game that was coming

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
out, it's part of the Yakuza

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
series in Japan

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
that's called

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Yakuza slash Ryugagotoku

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
the game's called Judge Eyes

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and actually it was going to be coming out

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
in the US under the name Judgment

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
it was developed by Sega, well they took

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
it down off of their website because the

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
actor who plays a crime boss

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
in the game, the real life

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
actor, Pierre Taki

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
was

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
caught for possession

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
and use of cocaine

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
for a scandal

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
like that, drug use scandals are

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
pretty much, they're almost

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
career ending, it's what

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
happens is that instead of here where it

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
could drive sales of something

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
you know, or people want to know more

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
about it and the person's out in the limelight

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
and getting Lindsay Lohan style fame

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
there, people are

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
pretty much erased from the public eye

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
yeah I know, I was like, over here it's like

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
what, Lindsay Lohan's doing cocaine?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
what a shock, you know

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I'd be more surprised if she wasn't

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
doing cocaine

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
well in Japan you

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
sort of are publicly erased

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
so in that case

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
the game Judge Eyes

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
has been pulled off of Sega's site, all their

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
marketing, social media has been

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
completely removed, they've halted

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
sales of the game digitally, they've

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
pulled back their shipping orders

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
for the game, they are taking a big

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
hit to take this off the market

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and then of course whether or not it's going to have

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
US release still

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
remains to be seen

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I mean it did have, for the main character

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
it was actually handled

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
acted by and voiced by

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Kimura Takaya who's

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
a member of SMAP

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
so I mean we're talking big names

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
and if anyone

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
might not know

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Pierre Taki from his own

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
acting, he's also

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
part of a synth pop duo called Denki Groove

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
which I know that some people

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
listen to some of the Japanese

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
synth pop so

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I mean the game looked to be

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
pretty interesting, I had

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
even heard about it before

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
all this went down, but I'm really not

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
surprised that for

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
how it's going down in Japan that this is happening

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
this way, you know other situations

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
like this

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
is that there's

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
been other actors

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
there was, I'm trying to see

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Taki was also the voice of

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Olaf

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
yeah and I was about to say because Sia Tabiri in chat says

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
didn't something similar happen to one of the voice actors from Kingdom Hearts 3

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
yes it's actually the same story

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
but it's only going to affect the Japanese release

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
of the game because the voice acting is not

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
the Japanese voice acting is not

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
in the US release

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
it's another thing too is that anyone who does work

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
for a company is seen

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
almost directly

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
as a representative

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
of the company and so

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
they distance themselves from it

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
which basically is where that

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
public erasure comes from

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
is to protect

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
the reputation of the company

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
oh it's very much a culture thing, I mean not in Japan

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
but in some other countries

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
you can get put to death

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
drug smuggling is like a

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
death penalty charge, didn't you all watch Broke Down

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Palace?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
if an American were to go to Japan

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
and have pot on them

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
they would be

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
deported immediately

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and also usually banned from returning

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
to the country

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
which again, the marijuana

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
perspective is changing significantly

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
in this country, especially where we live

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
we're in California, there's a pot store not that far

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
from here and I drive by every day on my way home

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
from work

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
there was a delay in the release of some Studio Ghibli

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
stuff because

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
the musician Asuka who did

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
some vocals for a music video

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
was arrested for drug possession

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
and another anime, Kill Me Baby

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
were pulled from public circulation

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
because the voice actress

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Takabei had cocaine

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
speaking of the international

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
thing though, I know we're joking about

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Lindsay Lohan and I have no idea what her

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
drug status is

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
but does

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
it seem to only affect people

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
and celebrities from that country

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
because isn't there still a lot of

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
you know, like American pop culture

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
stuff that makes its way into Japan

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
and do they still hold

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
the American celebrities to that same standard

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
because I don't think they do

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I don't think so, I mean I don't know

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Well that's kind of messed up

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Either that or it's just only

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I don't think it matters so much

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
if it's a reflection on

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
an American arm of the company

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
because

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I guess they expect that shit from us anyway

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I don't know

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Stupid Americans and the cocaine

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
But I mean, in the long

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
run it's just like

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I don't know

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It's a completely different

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It's a cultural difference and we have to be respectful

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
of that but at the same time, you know

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
we are a video game show, it's interesting to talk about how this

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
wow, I mean because of this culture

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
this game that was supposed to come out is being delayed

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
not to make it better

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Big marketing too

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
The site for this, just looking at how it was built

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Good lord

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
There was some work that went into that

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And we're talking about Instagram line

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You know, some of the big marketing outlets

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And honestly enough, there is a part of me

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
that wishes we had that same sort of

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
idea here

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Because then

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
there wouldn't be such a big

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I'm going to do this terrible thing

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
because it's going to bring attention to me

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
How far down the rabbit hole

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
do I want to go?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
But here's why they don't

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Because we also have a problem in this country

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
about it being equal

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
based on what you look like

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
if you know what I mean, right?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Anyway, I got to watch

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Far Down the Rabbit Hole, but I think

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
that is an issue that we have to

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
deal with here

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
that is why we don't do that

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I'm saying

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I think that

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
public and business

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
ostracization

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
for people who are like that

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
until there's been a period of recovery

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
is a good idea

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
so that they aren't having

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
this big public spectacle meltdown and setting

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
an example for other people

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Well, isn't it also sort of the American way that we protest?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I mean, that's kind of what happens

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
That's different. I think that's entirely different

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
They've been having a protest

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
recently in Japan for LGBT rights

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
for a right to marry

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
So, just saying

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Protesting happens there, too

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Burn some bras

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
for equal marriage

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I don't know

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
What I'm saying is that

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
this is a different thing than a protest

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
This is

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
keeping a company

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
reputation

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
clean, and distancing

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
themselves from something like that

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
instead of using it as a marketing tool

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Some other comments in our chat

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
over at twitch.tv

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
you have to get special waivers to take prescription

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Adderall in Japan

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Can't buy ibuprofen over the counter

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Oh, really?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But you can get toothpaste that rebuilds the

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
enamel on your teeth, and they don't sell it here

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
But here, you can't get Tylenol 3

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
whereas you can go into Canada

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
and you can't

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Dear Canadian friends

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Anyway

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I hear also in Valve you can't get Tylenol 3

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
either

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Fuck off

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
they accept that pot is something that

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Westerners do, they do not

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
accept that pot is something that Japanese

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
do

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Interesting way of putting it, and that's probably

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
a very succinct way of saying it

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
SHA100Matt says, I think Russell Brand

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
got deported from Japan

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
for something like this. Whatever happened to that guy?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I know someone first hand

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
who I used to work with that got deported, and he's half

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Japanese

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I think his was like a limitation

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
that after like six years

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
he could return for family visits

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
But still, that's wowie

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
He got deported for pot

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Alright

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Taking drugs into other countries is just

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
generally not a good idea

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
unless you have a prescription

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
and you have all those forms

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
that was brought up previously

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
which is probably best you don't bring drugs

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Besides, if you're high on drugs, then all those genitals

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
become unblurred, and they can't have that

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
What?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
For porn

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Oh, Jesus Christ

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Remember Final Fuck X

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I'm like, there's a joke

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
you tried to tell that I'm just

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
not getting

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Alright, anyway

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Please can we move on

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Next story

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Let's move on. Let's talk about that number three

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
in Valve, shall we?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Well, Valve is not going to be putting out

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
a sequel for Left 4 Dead anytime soon

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
but that doesn't mean that you can't live without

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Left 4 Dead, because it's going to be back

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Left 4 Dead is coming back

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
as Back 4 Blood

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It is a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
that is going to be coming out

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
by Turtle Rock and Warner Brothers

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
it is basically

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
very similar to

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Left 4 Dead

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
They don't really have many details about it yet

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
not even any pictures, but

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I'm sure it'll be something we'll be hearing about very soon

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
maybe E3 or GDC

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
So, I'm looking forward to that

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
because Left 4 Dead was a pretty awesome game

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Too bad we never got a third one

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But here you go!

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Well, now we get something that's similar

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Isn't that interesting when that happens

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
when the publisher

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
doesn't want to make the next game

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
so the team is just like, alright, we'll just

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
go make our own studio and make the game

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
we want to make. Interesting

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
It's been a few years

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
since Left 4 Dead 2, though, so it'll be interesting

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
to see what kind of changes

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
they put in the game

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
new engine, certainly

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
some more social elements, who knows

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
We'll see

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Alright, especially because

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Left 4 Dead was one of those first

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
horde mode type of games that ever existed

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
and now there's been a ton of hordes

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Like a purely co-op

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
type of game

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Now we've had Gears of War, Mass Effect multiplayer

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Horde mode was kind of like

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
what we had for a while instead of Battle Royale

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
So it'll be really interesting to see

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
what they

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
now have learned in these years

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
that that genre was really

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
in the spotlight

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
That's something I'm trying to shoehorn

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Battle Royale in there

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Shehulk in chat says, yes, big fun

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Left 4 Dead 3

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Yeah, no, people really

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I know Alan was a big fan of Left 4 Dead games too

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
A little scary for me, but I might try it again

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I might try it again. My tastes in gaming

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
have evolved a little bit

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and you can make it even worse

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
How so? Like make it scarier?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Or can it make it cute?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I was going to say rainbows and puppies

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
and kittens

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah, I saw some pretty weird stuff

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Okay, that would be alright. If a kitten

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
jumps up and surprises me, I'm okay with that

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But it's a mean kitten

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
No, I don't like mean kittens

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
It's Goose

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Did you see it, by the way?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
See what? Captain Marvel

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Then I'm not going to spoil

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I'll never get to the movies

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
No, I'm going to take you to see it

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
One day this week, we're going to go

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You are going to enjoy

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Free movie, awesome

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
It is the best

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Do I have to see the other Marvel movies?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
No

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The last Marvel movie I saw was

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
The First Avengers

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Maybe for one of the after credits

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
But I can explain that because I haven't even seen

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Age of Ultron

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I haven't seen the Thanos movie

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Although everyone spoiled it for me

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Okay, well yeah, that one's been all over

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I've not watched it yet

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But, I mean

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I haven't watched

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Black Panther yet either

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Captain Marvel is the best

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I do want to see Black Panther

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
No, it is the best

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You haven't seen it, so you can't say anything about it

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Okay, fine, I'll watch it and then we'll see that

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
it's not the best

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
It speaks to women's experiences every fucking day

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And every man should be

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
required to watch it

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Okay, sure

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I don't watch a lot of superhero movies

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
at all, but I do want to see what is

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
coming out that I do want to see

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Is that us? That looks scary

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
as hell

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
That I want to see, that's for sure

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Alright, um

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Let's see, going in chat

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
If you're a cat lover, you must see Captain Marvel

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
My retort would be if you're a cat lover

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
you must see Carly Rae Jepsen's new music

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
video, because

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
that was also a cat thing and it's incredible

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
and so you should see it

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Okay, let's see

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Let's move on and talk about the

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Overwatch League

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And this was

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
kind of one of those things where I said

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I jabbed the Overwatch League a little bit

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I should say jab, I said it was room for improvement

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
when I was first talking about the Overwatch League

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
It's nice to see them taking this

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
step into this next story

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And the fact

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
that Overwatch League has been successful enough

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
to do this I think is pretty cool as well

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It says a lot about where esports might be going

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
But next year they are saying

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
according to Commissioner

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Nate Nasner

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Overwatch League teams

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
will be playing in their cities

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
next year, so

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
right now if you weren't already aware

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
there's the Blizzard Arena in

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Los Angeles

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
and that's where all the matches are being

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
played, but for next year

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
if you are the San Francisco Shock

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
which would be the closest team to us

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
there's going to be a place in San Francisco

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
where you go to see them play because

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Yeah, don't they have like their own esports arena?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I mean that's, I thought

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I know at least Oakland does, I'm sure San Francisco does somewhere

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I'm just not up and up on where all the places are

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Who it was that had the

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
arena, because I know that they were doing the

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
DDR tournament from there and

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
That was in Oakland

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Yeah, which I mean, you know

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The San Francisco 49ers play in Santa Clara

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
which is like 45 minutes away on a good day

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
so it doesn't always have to match exactly

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I don't know where they're playing this stuff, we'll find out

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yeah, but

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
you know, but what's going to be interesting about this is that

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
you have teams in China

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
you have teams in Europe

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
all over the US and Canada

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
so it's going to be like these time zones

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I'm like, dang

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
this might be a little rough on

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
some of the players because these time zones

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
are all going to be all over the map, right?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So, it'll be interesting

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
to see what the schedule looks like to make this happen

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
but I think this is

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
this is a good next step for esports

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I think it is important, I think if you want to

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
grow esports to have the availability

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
for people to go watch and see the game in person

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
and really see what it's all about

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I think that is going to be a great step

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
so, you know, maybe I'll go

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
to San Francisco and see one of these someday

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and see what it's all about

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I still have some

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
reservations on what the team

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
rosters look like and so forth, but we'll see

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
maybe that will improve in 2020 as well

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
yeah, so this has always been something

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
that they are going for

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I'm looking for the original tweet here, here it is

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
from Nate Nasner who says

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
there won't be even more

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
there's 20 teams today, there might be even more

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
by this time next year, so

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
we'll see

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
let's see, Bobby in chat

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
is saying

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I wonder if it's like the current structure

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
where there will be a weekend where a bunch of teams

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
are in a home team city

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
to play each other, that's what they're doing in

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Atlanta in June for the Atlanta rain

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
instead of doing home and away matches

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I'm unsure

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I don't know what

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that's, if it's going to be one for one

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
or what they'll do with that, it'll be interesting to see though

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
so

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
let's see, and yeah, as you see 100 Matt

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
as far as the team thing goes points out the New York

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Giants and Jets play in New Jersey

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and that's how it works sometimes, yep

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
so, anyhow

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
we'll see what develops with the Overwatch League, I think

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I think they're on, not that I want you guys to

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
leave, but I think they're on right now

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
and you know, I think they do

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
a lot of stuff throughout the week

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
there's a lot of programming there, so it'll be

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
it's going to be interesting to see if that gets

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
bigger and bigger and where that ends up going

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
so, alright, let's move on

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Darsakra, you have a kind of neat rumor

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
for us, right?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Well, there's been some interesting

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
revelations regarding

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
what should be, what could be the PlayStation 5

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
more rumors, but it's based

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
off of a patent that Sony filed

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
in October last year

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
and also, I think, quickly it's worth mentioning

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
this rumor, you got, you're reading this in like, what

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Esquire or something, it's a big magazine

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
so, like, this isn't just like some dude said on Twitter

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
this is like, magazines are picking this up and running

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
with it, yeah

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
So, basically, they think that the PlayStation 5

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
is going to include

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
deep learning technology

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
basically using the player's skills

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
and habits to adapt the games

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
the patent reads like this

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
with a quote

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Generally, a video game and video game

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
assistants are adapted to a player

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
for example, a narrative of the video game

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
is personalized to an experience level of

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
the player, similarly, assistants and interacting

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
with particular content of the video game

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
is also personalized

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
the personalization learns from

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
historical interactions of players

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
with the video game and optionally

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
other video games, in an example

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
a deep learning neural network is implemented

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
to generate knowledge from

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
historical interactions, the personalization

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
is then set according to the knowledge

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
so, basically, it's like Psycho Mantis

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
on steroids

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Is this real, I mean, it sounds fancy

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
and high tech, but I have to ask the hard question

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
is it really, though? I mean, don't get me wrong

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
this sounds neat, um, you know

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I love the idea of a game, especially like

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
for kids that are playing it, that like gets easier

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
if they keep dying in the same spot or whatever

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
or maybe if you're really good at it gets harder

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
but then I can't help but think, like, you know

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
like, let's say, like, an elliptical machine

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
can increase

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
or decrease the workout based on how you're

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
performing and where your heart rate is at

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
so, I mean, and that's just

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
a little machine

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
like, it's not a Playstation 5, so I'm just saying

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
like, it sounds like, ooh

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
it's this, like, big technology, but it's like

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
it more sounds like it's a way of thinking

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
a system, a core thing

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
to maybe put in that all games would consider

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
It doesn't seem like that's something that a system

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
should be doing, that's something that a game developer

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
should be putting in if they want to implement

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
that, because... Or maybe the game contains the algorithm

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
but the machine has the hardware for it

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And maybe it's something like

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
6-axis, not to put a negative spin on it

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
but developers can choose if they just

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
want to put it in or not very easy, right?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Or, let's say that Steam

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
gives you easy access

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
to put in mods and achievements and things like that

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
like, it's your choice if you want to, how much

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
you want to run with that type of thing, I could see that

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
but, if it is Sony's

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
thing, you can bet your ass

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
that things like Last of Us 3

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Uncharted, whatever they do

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
all these games I'm making up, but you know

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
our Sony's powerhouses

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
would likely implement this

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
you know, because they're Sony's games, so of course

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
they want to show off Sony's tech

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Right, right

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
What do you think, Barasaka?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Would you be more interested in

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
PlayStation 5 or something like this?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I just said that I think it's going to be implemented

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
through the games, with the hardware being on the system

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
and I honestly think it would be great

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I mean, but I'd also like the opportunity to be able to

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
turn it off and have it not transmit data

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Okay

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I don't want it to learn and then send my

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
habits to Sony

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Okay, makes sense

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
But that could be something they're thinking about is

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
the portability, so that like if I play at a friend's

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
house, but then you're right, you'd have to

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
send to Sony and maybe that's

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I don't mind analytics for

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
like anonymous analytics

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Um, you know

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
in the case of your computer with anonymous analytics

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
they use that to determine how to

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
you know, release software updates

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
how to make the things better, when to do

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
full security updates if a lot of people are

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
reporting the same issue, you know

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
that's fine, crash reports

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
whatever, but I don't want

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
personalized data

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I don't mind if it's anonymous, like

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
my 23andMe stuff is pretty much anonymous

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I don't care, but

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
if it has my name on it

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
which I opted out of anything that put my name on it

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I would have a problem with it

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Same goes with this, I don't want

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
my habits directly

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
related to me to go out

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
to whatever

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
they can store Let me ask this very

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
real question, because this is actually how

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I conduct myself on Playstation

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
What if you could put your fake name on it?

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I still

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
wouldn't want that because my fake name now is

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
so traceable It's still individualized

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
in a way Yeah

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
it would still be, because I mean

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
at the very least they would have whatever billing information

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
that you put in through it, because your real name is on

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
your billing information

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It's still linked over

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
If you're paying for like pay station network

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I, you're right

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I think Sony probably has that for me, but you do

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
since their little hack and that whole thing

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I believe you do not have to store

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
a credit card on Playstation servers But

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
if you've ever had one stored

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
your name is still there on the account True

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Historically

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
the information is there

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
You know, I'm what, either Dark Sakura

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
or Kurotsubasa, like every fucking where

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
people usually know that

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
if they see the name, there's a big chance it's me

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
So, just saying

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Let's see, and yeah, if you see Rob Roberts

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
you know it's me or the gun guy

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Apparently if you Google

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Rob Roberts you get a guy that sells guns

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
How about that? Alright, let's see

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Dungeon Buster I get a porn star for

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Jamie Summers Do you really?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And then some lady in Columbus

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
But you were supposed to be the Bionic Woman

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Where's the Bionic Woman? Because I spell my name differently

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Oh, that's right, that's right, okay

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Dungeon Buster or Quest Buster in our chat

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
at Twitch TV says

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Xanac, a throwback here, Xanac

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
adapted its difficulty depending on how the player

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
did during the NES days

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
The game would sometimes change in small ways

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
change up patterns, etc.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
That's true, but that's

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
not really learning

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Because it wouldn't retain

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
that information and it wouldn't

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
alter it, it wouldn't remember

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
that that was your difficulty level

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Okay, that's maybe the little click for me that I needed

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
to understand how this is like

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
new and fancy It's just programming

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
In this case, this would be machine learning

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
It would learn your habits and

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
adapt whatever game has the capacity

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
to use that to your habits as a gamer

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Okay, so like

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
They say, this bitch is a rage quitter, we're only

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
gonna let her play up to level 4

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Interesting, so how you perform

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
in Uncharted

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
may dictate the difficulty level where

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Last of Us starts is what this could be

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Possibly, that's how I translated it too

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Okay, okay, I get it

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Going further, if it looks at your habits on the

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
network, are you

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
a rage quitter? Are you

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
someone who gets a lot of abuse

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
from complaints? You could start

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
into whatever game

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
you might be streaming with all of these

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
marks against you, it could really go

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
a lot further than that

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Interesting, and of course there's sad little man babies

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
out there who'll try to be pissy to female gamers

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
and you know

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
like what happened with movie ratings

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
and everything, who will

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
There's people who've done it to me and the things

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
were completely unfounded, they were just

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
crying little man babies, so

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I drink male tears, I moisturize with them

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Keep crying

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
babies

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Let's try to see if there's other comments in chat

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Shehulk in our chat says

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
since the big Playstation 3 data lost

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
10 years ago, I still get notices

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
from possible theft from Sony

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and you know that whole data theft, it is

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
going to have to be something that's in the back of Sony's

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
minds about, you know, again assuming this

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
is true, but you know

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
a lot of magazines

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
and things seem to be running with it, is that

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Sony will have to be mindful

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
about how it uses that data

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
because it knows it's already been in trouble

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
for a breach of data once before

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
so, I mean

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
but I guess maybe the question would be

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
is how good you are or aren't at a video game

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
sensitive data

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
but I guess it really depends on

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
what is it that the Playstation is actually

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
collecting

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Anyway, SSJ100 Matt suggests

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
self-destruct the consoles

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
of chronic toxic players

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Hey, I always like the idea

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
of them getting their own little island

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Have fun at Toxic Fantasy Island

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
That's exactly what it is

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Toxic Fantasy Island

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And then we nuke it from orbit

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Complete with tattoo

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
We just nuke it from orbit

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Right. Now then we airdrop a bunch of therapists

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
That could be the intro

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
to one of our future shows

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Toxic Fantasy Island will not be seen tonight

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Just airdrop a bunch of therapists

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
that's all

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Let's move on. Something else to talk about

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Loki

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I don't know. The whole Toxic Fantasy Island sounds awesome

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So this is also

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
something that's pretty awesome

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
and surprising that's coming to Steam

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Halo the Master Chief Collection

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
is coming to PC

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
and it's also coming to

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
not only the Windows Store

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
or Microsoft Store or whatever we're calling it

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
nowadays, but the Steam

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Store as well

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
and on top of all of that

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
they're going to be including Halo Reach now

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
So it is

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
going to be

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
it will run at 60 FPS

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
it will support up to 4K

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
and they're going to be adding

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
on Xbox One the Halo Reach multiplayer

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
will be available as a free add-on for anyone

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
that owns the collection

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
and they said the single player campaign will cost extra

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
They don't have a date on the Halo Reach stuff

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
but they're going to be putting out

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I guess stuff piecemeal

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
so it's going to be

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Halo Combat Evolved

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Anniversary, Halo 2, Halo 3

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Halo 4

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
and then I guess

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I don't know. Halo 5 will be added later

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
So I think when I bought

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
my Xbox One

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I got a digital copy of this

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
because I don't think I have the disc

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I think it's a digital copy

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
so does that mean I'll get it on PC for free because it's digital?

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Maybe. You can play anywhere

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I don't know if it's a play anywhere game

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I thought everything was supposed to be play anywhere now

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Probably most of their games are play anywhere

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I hope

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Kaishido in chat says

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
all they need is Halo Reach 3-2

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
those games were so much fun

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
so yeah a lot of fans are Reach out there

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
so I'm sure very happy to hear that

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I haven't answered for all that

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I have an answer for that

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
No

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
You were never a Halo fan anyway

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
The only thing I liked about Halo

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
was Red vs Blue

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
and the shiny stabby weapon

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I like the shiny stabby weapon

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Oh yeah I do like the shiny stabby weapon

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Halo 2 is like a throwback to college for me

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I used to like to play that online with some of my college buddies

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
and we would use the shiny stabby thing quite a bit

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
My fond memory was

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Dan's bachelor party

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
because you were at my bachelorette party

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I was

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
We had to go to the house to get my stuff

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
and they had something like

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
5 TVs hooked up

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
doing Halo LAN

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Okay

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Before we get to our next story

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
this question keeps coming up in chat

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
and so I have to address it

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and they're noticing on the camera there

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
S2100 Matt says

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Yes I am

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
OLR bringing rivals together

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Okay

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Where every foodie has a voice

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I haven't started my Dunkin yet

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
because I have a little banana for a stomach

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Thank you surgery

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I had to finish my corned beef

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I told myself I was gonna eat so much

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
dead bovine until I got sick

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Guess who's sick right now

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
That would be me but I'm not like

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
super sick I stopped right before like

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
throwing up sick

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
So I am stuck

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So the donuts are being saved right?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
The donuts are being saved they are gonna be breakfast

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And that was a low key contribution

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Thank you which I greatly appreciate

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
The Boston cream is gonna be my

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I'm about to go to bed snack but I need a sugar rush

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
which isn't a good idea before you go to bed

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
And then my double chocolate

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
is gonna be breakfast tomorrow

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Where I will again

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
get the shakes from reactive hypoglycemia

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Low key was kind of

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
offer for me too but

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
since I am trying to be better about fitness

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I decided to pass on the donuts and while I

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
still do drink the coffee

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I had just had a Starbucks so I

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
didn't want to have lots of coffee

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
By the way though speaking of

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
fitness I am

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
thinking about going back to Nerd Fit

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Where they use their leveling up system

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I'm trying to remember what that was

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
That name sounds familiar

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
It was people to eat keto and all this

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
but

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
their exercise program

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
used like levels and then they would do like

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
this like special

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
challenge thing for like certain

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
exercises and you turn it in and you get a badge

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
and some shit but I'm thinking about

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
going back to like a leveling system

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
for working out because I am officially

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
not

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
the first week in April I've got

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
the okay to go back to powerlifting

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I'm gonna fill my arm

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
wings, my extra skin that I have

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
left over with meat

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
not just you know dead bovine

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I've been using the watch tracking

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
for fitness quite a bit that's been doing

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
really good for me which reminds me I was gonna

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
send a private information request to you

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Jamie but I guess you don't have yours, oh no

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
yours is right there, there it is

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I'm not competitive

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Some people have been sharing theirs with me

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I've been interested in what some

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
other people are doing but I'd rather just talk to people

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
and find out what they're doing

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
cause I like to think I'm fairly adaptive

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
with my fitness regimen

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I just found out that it will beat people

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
when you close your rings I didn't realize that

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
that was a thing but like so I was at

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
the gym yesterday and as soon as I get

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
off the machine I have multiple text messages

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
from people I'm sharing data with that are saying

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
like congrats or whatever and I'm just

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
like wait did my watch like

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
tell you that I'm so I thought that was

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
it was weird but I was like well that's

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
kinda nice I guess those little

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
those little bits of motivation can always be cute

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
so I just

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
really only

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
track myself

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
cause the only person I can be accountable to is myself

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
yeah being competitive

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
doesn't really do anything for me

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I'm not competitive with it it's more like

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I want to

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
these are good goals

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
like the standing thing I was doing earlier

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
they're good goals to have

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I do it for myself I don't need to share that data

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
with other people to feel good about what

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I'm doing or maintain my goals

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I'm not

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
there's some people out there who are truly

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I would say

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
motivated by competition

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
that's not me that's why most of the time

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
if I'm playing a game I prefer a single person narrative

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I prefer and so what I'm

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
gonna be doing is as I level

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
up I'm going to be

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
using like a game or something

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
and do say this is my level up game

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
but I will be sharing my level ups

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
with everybody in the form of content

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
alright well speaking of leveling

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
up moving on to

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
a next story before we get to our classic

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
segment the

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Xbox Live by Microsoft

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
is coming out for iOS and

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Android so maybe this is another way if you want to be

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
competitive with achievements this is

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
something you could do or you maybe don't want

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
to be competitive you want to just be able to send

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
messages to friends on the on their

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I'm telling you though this like combined with the

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Google thing they were talking about before streaming

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
like if I could like purchase Game Pass

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
you

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
know on an Android device

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
and be able to like play those like

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Xbox games on my TV or

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
on my PC

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
that would be useful

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
to me because I don't want to buy another console

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
well what this is

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
this news is about is that Microsoft is going to allow

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
developers of mobile games to use Xbox

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Live features it's a new mobile

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
SDK that is part of Microsoft's

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
initiative to allow game developers

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
you know of all sizes indie

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
small large to

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
use Xbox Live on whatever platform you want

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
to create on which we already

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
kind of knew Xbox Live is

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
making strides in going into Switch games

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
which was a big deal when we first talked about that

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
the only place you're probably not going to see Xbox Live

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
is on Sony which you know

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
you understand why that is the way

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
it is but anyway you can choose

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
from features like

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
achievements, clubs, gamerscore

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
friends list, family

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
settings that's interesting too

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
talking about adapting to

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
automatic settings

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
that's very interesting that let's say

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
you know this is a kid account right off the gate

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
so maybe it shouldn't show

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
dramatic blood effects or whatever

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I don't know it goes with a particular game

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
or because it's Loki you should show

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
extra dramatic blood effects

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
on the game. It's not dramatic if it's not

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
extra so

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
anyway very cool

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
this is coming and I'm sure we're going to hear more

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
about this at Game Developers Conference

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
but it was confirmed that this is

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
happening by the way in kind of a related

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
story of sorts it should be

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
mentioned about this too there is a brand new

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
app that came out for Windows

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
called Wireless Display and it

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
will let you play PC games

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
on your Xbox

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
with varied

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
success it seems like it's something that's still early

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
on now as it is today

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
you can play Xbox stuff on

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
your PC there's a little Xbox

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
app for Windows 10 I've actually done that and it

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
works well enough as long as there's not a lot

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
of other network traffic going on like I don't do it

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
if Alan's trying to play Overwatch because

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
technically I guess you could still do that if

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
you had your output

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
HDMI output from your PC into your

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Xbox remember they have a pass through sure

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
you could but this

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
is a way to do it through the network

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
through your house basically

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
but they're saying not every game

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
really works very well with this some folks have done

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
some testing and said some games work

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
some games don't

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
but I imagine it's going to be interesting

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
the more and more this technology gets refined

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
although at the same time I don't usually

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
want to play something like World of Warcraft on my television

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I want to play it on my PC but I guess

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
again for people that are playing things like I don't know

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
the new Devil's May Cry game let's say you're buying that

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
on PC then being able to

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
have that on your TV

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
is interesting but again

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
it's apparently working with some mixed success

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
right now seems like it's technology

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
that will probably get refined in the coming weeks

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
as more and more people complain about things

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
and so forth so

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
anyhow

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
some comments

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
on Microsoft She-Hulk over

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Xbox Live community is robust

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
much more social

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
than Sony or Nintendo

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
well that's you know I think we've joked here on

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
OLR that maybe Microsoft

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
should just build Nintendo's online forum

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
well Nintendo used to have a pretty robust

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
online forum and then they got rid of it

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
they did well it wasn't

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
you know the whole

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
what do they call it

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
the thing that they discontinued where you could do all the

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
cool pictures and everything oh SwapNote?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
no not SwapNote they have

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Miiverse oh Miiverse

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
okay

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I get what you're saying Miiverse was an interesting idea

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
but it really ran clunky it was kind of

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
it wasn't it was I'll say

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Miiverse was best when it was integrated

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
directly into the games like Mario Maker

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
that was a good use I will give you that that was

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
a really good use of Miiverse

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Splatoon kind of had that as well in fact

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
what they did is they just kind of like

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
took that part and put it in

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
the new Splatoon that's on Switch so

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
you know it's interesting

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I guess you could say the legacy of

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Miiverse lives on in that regard

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I don't know but anyway

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
other games continue to

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
live on here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
as we move into a segment we like

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
to call the classic game of the week or

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
as the case may be in 2019

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
once a month Dark

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Sakura dips into the gaming vault and says

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
hey here's a soundtrack

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
that you should be paying attention to the game

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
may or may not be great but

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
the soundtrack is definitely something

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
worth noticing so what is our special

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
classic soundtrack of the month

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
this is going to

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
be a game I will eventually review

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
but it's Abadox

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
The Deadly Inner War

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and this

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
particular game

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
okay there we go

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
this particular game

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
came out

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
this music doesn't go for this level

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I know what I did is I took the base music

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
and I just put it over gameplays they have something to look at

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
alrighty well anyway

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
but it's actually the first level has my favorite music

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
otherwise it's all ground beef

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
yeah it'll cycle through the

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
different songs in the game

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
but yeah the first level is actually my favorite music

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
in the entire game too because the game's hard

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
and I died a lot so

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
but anyway

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
it's I mean it's pretty

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
it's not like one of the best games ever

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
it was by Natsume

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
with the main

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
programmer having worked on Contra

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
actually the music

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
programmer having worked on Contra

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
but it was

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Sada Kyohei who

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
he did a lot of work for Konami

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
it really

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
was very influenced

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
by Contra

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
and some of the other shooting games

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
and this is the song you were mentioning

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
earlier I believe

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
this was like my favorite piece of music in this whole game

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
and it sounds like a fucking Contra song

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
it does

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
it's like I was showing this to Dan

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
and he's like oh yeah that's definitely a Natsume

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
game I was like yeah but listen to the music

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
he's like that sounds like Contra-ish

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I'm like yarp

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
you know that heavy

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
rhythm in it that you had from

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
a lot of the Konami games

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
but at any rate I mean

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
my second favorite piece of music in this game

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
is the ending music which I never got to

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
but people in my

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
my papa was really

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
good at this game and he beat the game

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
it was this

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and you know

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Jackal that he and I used to play a lot together

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
before he died and so

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
this

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I just had to pick this music I don't really have too much else

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
about the programming of the music but I thought the soundtrack

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
was worth a mention because for such a

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
you know

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
middle of the road game

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
the music in it was really good

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
yeah and this has been kind of the

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
neat thing about this little feature that you're doing

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
even though the first month you did Guardian Legend

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
which of course is a must right

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
you really kind of have been picking games that are like

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
okay maybe the games were eh

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
but the soundtracks are A

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
plus and I think that's always kind of neat

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
you want to play a game because

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
you just want to hear the damn music

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
it's so good

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
also I was just giving it a look

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
for Famicom information

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
the box art in Japan was so

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
much better than the crap we got here

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
She-Hulk and Child wants to know

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
is the soundtrack on vinyl?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I don't think so

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
this game really wasn't a super popular one

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
it was unique in the US

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
because it was a Milton Bradley published game

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
which kind of goes with

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
which you associate more with board games

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
exactly but Milton Bradley

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
did a decent number of releases for

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
games they did but none of them were

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
like A plus

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
like games you remember

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
but I mean wasn't Milton Bradley

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
the Game Genie

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
or not Game Genie that was Galoob

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
the

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
dammit the

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Power Glove

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
didn't they do I do not recall

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
don't remember who did Power Glove

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I don't know I'm looking it up right now

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
so they

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
did the power they were

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
partly responsible for the power pad

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
the power pad? yeah

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
so

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Milton life force

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
the games that were

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
done by Milton Bradley

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
that were published or distributed

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Cabal California Games

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Captain Skyhawk

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Gordon vs. Bird Marble Madness

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Time Lord

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
which is sadly a Doctor Who game

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
World Games

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
yeah not very many games

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
but they were and by the way

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Rob World Games is by Epix

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I do yeah that I do know

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
trust founder of the Epix

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
game store shut the fuck up

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
god

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
that happened on Bobby's show anyway

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
we're bringing it around

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
and keep in mind Milton Bradley actually

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
had a console in 1979

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
they had the micro vision oh really

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
yep hold on let's see something

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
real quick while we're here this is

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
turned into the Milton Bradley segment of the month

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
well I mean it doesn't

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
hurt to educate people sure

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
so ugh stupid accepting cookies

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I'd rather have a real cookie

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
thank you um so yeah

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
not much is coming up but yeah you know

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
they they did

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
different stuff I mean like I said

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
they had been in the video game business off and on

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
and had you know purples and things

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
like that but yeah so

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
there you go

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
alright your classic soundtrack

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
of the month how do you say Abadox

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Abadox oh wait you might

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
remember the commercial it's the kid playing on his

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
bed and then like purple slime shoots

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
out of his TV at him and it was supposed

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
it was advertised

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
as like the most disgusting game

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
oh yeah cause

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
that was all the shit that was on TV it was like

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
the Double Dare

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Fun House was even grosser and like all the

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
like gross splat and all that

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
stuff this game ain't

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
ain't disgusting I played R-Type

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
alright

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
uh we're gonna move on to a

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
viewer submission I'm very hyped about

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
this cause we haven't had one of these in a while since

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
um Matt did one of these for MAGFest but I did

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
put the call out and I said hey listeners

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
if you're interested in like you know highlighting a game

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
or telling us a little bit about you know a game that you're playing

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
or what have you I'm looking for some listener

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
segments and leave it to good old Flaco

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Jones who sent us this submission

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
tonight where um he's gonna talk to us a little

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
bit about the game Paladins and

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
uh pay attention cause he gets into the reason why

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
and I think it's uh it's really cool so we're gonna go

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
to uh this segment here courtesy of

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
our pal Flaco Jones

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Hey everybody this is

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Flaco Jones uh I wanted to make

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
this video because well first of all Rob asked for it

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
and I thought it'd be cool to focus on a

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
free game cause he said you know focus on free games

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
would be good and this came

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
up recently because on OLR they were talking

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
about Overwatch and how it doesn't

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
support cross play and how could they ever support

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
cross play I'm like well there's a game that does

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
support cross play that's a lot like Overwatch

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
and so this game popped in my head I'm like oh I should

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
make a video for OLR so they can actually see

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
the game in action so

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
uh this is Paladins I'm actually gonna make

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
my camera go away so

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
that I can focus on showing the game play

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
and I'm gonna edit stuff in so it's not just staring

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
at menus the whole time cause I'm pretty much gonna be

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
talking over the menus

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
so uh this is it it's free game

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
and because it's free

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
you can go to the store and you can

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
see all the stuff they try to sell you

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and there's DLC where you can

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
actually get all the champions

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
current and future for just $30 which I think

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
is a pretty good deal but I personally have never

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
spent a dime on this game I

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
do my daily quests I grind out gold

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I use gold to unlock champions which are you know

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
like heroes and Overwatch

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
champions in this game I'm gonna be comparing

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
it to Overwatch a lot because the games

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
are very similar it's been accused of being

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Overwatch clone not gonna

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
fight that accusation but I'm gonna say

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
it still stands on it's own

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
alright so and I wanted to briefly

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
show you since we were talking about

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
cross play you go to controls

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
you go all the way to the bottom and this is where the cross

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
play is uh the settings

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
are right here so you can say I only

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
wanna go against people using a gamepad

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
or I only wanna go against everybody and have

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
shorter queues I do

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
gamepad I think it's more fair and the reason

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
they do that they don't even say console is because

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
based on whether you have a gamepad

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
plugged in or not that's how it queues you

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
and if you try to queue in this gamepad and then pull it

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
out and try to trick everybody

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
and use your keyboard and mouse that won't work

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
it'll kick you out of the

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
games they said so in their patch notes so

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
yeah I play gamepad only

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I think it's really cool they allow that

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
because it doesn't matter what platform you're playing on

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
PC you're playing on Switch

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
you're playing Xbox One you're playing

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
you know Xbox One supports

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
keyboard and mouse as well so if you're playing keyboard and mouse

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
as Xbox One you still would be with

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
the allow all people not with the gamepad

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
people and it would show on your input method right there

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
um I didn't mention

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Sony I wonder why that is oh because they're not

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
supporting it right now so they're not supporting

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
cross play right now

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I think it's gonna happen but

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
you know there's been some controversy over

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
who's fault it is but the developers of this game

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
said they're ready to go the balls

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
in Sony's court so hopefully Sony approves that

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
pretty soon cause I would really like to play this

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
on Playstation uh

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
let's see uh what do we got here

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
oh yeah so if you wanna learn how to play

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
there's uh these training

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
modes over here they have

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
trainings for all the different modes which I'll get into those in a second

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
and they have a shooting range and the shooting range

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
you can practice as any champion and that's

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
kinda cool even champions you haven't unlocked yet

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
so I like that

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
there's no tutorial here and I think

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
that's weird and so I looked it up and sure enough

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
there is a tutorial on the other consoles

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
just on Switch they didn't put it on there because the

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
file size would have been too big so they

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
cut that out

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
that's too bad but you know so if you really

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
wanna learn how to play it is a free to play the game you could

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
download it on a different

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
console and play it on there and if you prefer to play on Switch

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
you can play on there but again it's cross

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
platform and cross progression

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
so anything you do saves across all the platforms

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
except for Playstation

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
so let's see I said I'd get into the modes

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
so here's the different modes let's go to Quick Play

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
and look at our settings so there's Siege

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
there's Onslaught and there's Team Deathmatch

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Siege kinda plays like the

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Overwatch hybrid maps those are the maps

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
where you capture the objective and then once you capture the

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
objective you escort the payload

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Onslaught

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
all that one is is take the objective hold it until

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
whatever team gets 400 points

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
first the longer you stay there you

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
earn points and getting kills also

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
earns you points and then Team Deathmatch

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
speaks for itself 5v5

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
you know just try to kill

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
as many as you can so there's like

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
there's one more big difference between this and

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Overwatch which is

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
when you start this game first

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
you'll have you pick a talent

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
every champion gets

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
three talents to choose from you select

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
one and it's kind of like your focus for that

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
game after that you

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
get to pick your loadouts now loadouts

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
are here in the game if you go

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
into a champion you can go

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
into their loadouts and you can make

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
new ones or you can use there's always a

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
preset one there so if you're uncomfortable

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
with this just use the pre-made but once

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
you get good at this game you can kinda build your own

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
so I think that's pretty awesome

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and then after you pick that when the game

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
starts they have this thing called the item shop

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
which I've heard is a lot like League of Legends

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I don't play leagues I don't know but as you

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
play this game you earn credits for

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
doing well at your character's job

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
if you're healing a lot you'll get credits that way

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
if you stay in the objective a lot you'll get credits that way

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
if you're a damaged player and you're

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
getting a lot of kills you get more credits that way you spend

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
your credits on this thing called

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
the item shop and the item shop

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
is kind of I think this game's answer to

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
hero switching that Overwatch has

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
you can't switch heroes in this game

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
so with the item shop you can kinda see what the

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
other team is running or even

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
compliment what your team is running and get items

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
from the item shop to boast

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
up those certain things so you can have

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
better healing you can

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
take less damage from direct damage if the

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
team has a lot of AoE damage you can

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
lessen the AoE damage just a little bit you can lower

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
your cooldowns you can increase your

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
ultimate you know

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
generation so there's all sorts of things

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
you can buy

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
in the item shop and there's not anything you can

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
pay to win they just you just earn it

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
like everybody else does by playing the game

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
and it's only for that match you don't get

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
they don't carry over so there's no

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
pay to win or anything in this game which is kinda nice

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
so let's look at the champions

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
this is the bread and butter

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
of the game I have a lot of champions as you

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
can see here I have all but it looks like

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
nine right now but there's actually rotating champions

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
which I don't have all of them actually I think

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I only have one I have two of them

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
so that means I'm missing

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
eleven characters out of the forty

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
forty man roster is really good

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
so again they

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
have these four that rotate every week it's not always

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
gonna be these four I'm gonna focus for this

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
video on the ones you get when you

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
start the game for free you've never played it before

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
and that is the reason

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
it's four is cause there's one support

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
that's their healers

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
one frontline that's their tanks one damage

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
speaks for itself

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
and one flanker which is the damage that

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
attacks from the side or behind

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
let's look at Genos

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
so Genos

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
is the free healer

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
that you get if you've never played paladins before

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
and here's how the abilities

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
break down I'll show

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
some video while I'm talking about it so you're

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
not just staring at this screen the whole time

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
so star splitter is his main attack

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
everybody's main attack is his right trigger

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
it's just like a machine gun

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
you know everybody in this game pretty much

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
shoots even the healers and they do pretty well at

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
it you don't have to do a lot of weapon switching

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
uh which is pretty cool

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
so and then his left one is his heal

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
the left trigger is his heal and that

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
his heal kinda works like Zenyatta

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
so he puts a heal bloom on

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
somebody it stays on him as long as you keep him in line of sight

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
and it does a good job

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
uh Stellar Wind is the

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
right shoulder button the right shoulder button on almost

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
every character I'm pretty sure

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
every character actually is like a quick

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
getaway button it's like some kind of speed button

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
so in this case

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
it's his Stellar Wind he moves 65%

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
faster and you can even

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
get a loadout where you take less damage

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
in that mode which is nice too

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
so it's a really good way

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
to escape from people something I kinda wish Zenyatta

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
and Overwatch had was a way to escape cause he really

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
doesn't he's kind of a sitting duck

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
uh and then the left button there

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
the left shoulder button is his void grip

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
you can also use that to escape with him but it

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
holds enemies up in the air stuns them does a little

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
damage if your teammates around they can kill the person while

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
they're in the air it's really cool kind of support

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
ability and his ultimate

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
is through time and space it channels this

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
tunnel of like death

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
and it shoots anybody that's

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
standing in the tunnel there's like a kind of a cast time

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
so you have time to get away from it if you're paying attention

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
but if he's got you trapped and you're in the middle of a fight

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
if you're standing in that tunnel

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
you're dead okay

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
so let's go to the next free character that's gonna be

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Lex Lex is the free flanker in the game

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
let's look at his abilities

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
he's got magnums

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
think like reaper's guns they just shoot one

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
at a time bang bang bang bang they're good medium

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
to close range

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
his left trigger is in

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
pursuit that just kind of

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
unloads his weapons even faster

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
in like a short area kind of like McCree's like

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
you know when he shoots off his guns really

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
fast

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
his R is a combat slide again

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
you can use that to escape or you can use it to close in on somebody

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
and finish him off

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
his left shoulder is retribution

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
you cast out on people they take more damage

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
you earn credits when you kill them when they have retribution on

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
you can spec for that to be better as well

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
and then finally his ultimate is the law

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
it's a lot like McCree's ability

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
where you kind of focus

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
on everybody in a little like area

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
when you shoot it off

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
everybody that's in the area

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
if they're 65% health or below

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
they get executed it's great

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
otherwise they take 600 damage still pretty good

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
so let's go to next is

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Ruckus Ruckus plays a lot

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
like D.Va from Overwatch so you'll hear me say

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
D.Va a lot so Ruckus has these

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
mini guns they're kind of like D.Va's

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
hand cannons

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
they shoot really fast the longer you hold

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
the button the more damage they do it's kind of cool

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Ruckus's left trigger is

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
a missile launcher so again kind of like

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
D.Va shoots some barrage of missiles

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
at people

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
advance is his quick getaway move

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
you press it and he has rocket boosters

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
again like D.Va that'll get

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
him in or out of combat to find

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
him in the situation a 5 second cooldown is pretty low too

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
you can advance to get in shoot a bunch

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
of people in advance to get back out and go back to your healers

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
it's kind of nice his left shoulder

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
is a shield called emitter

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
gives him like a bubble, absorbs damage

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
it's really nice again if you're in there being

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
a disruptor like you're supposed to do whether you play Ruckus

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
or D.Va they're similar

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
play styles and then his

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
ultimate is Hexafire

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
it's just like a one where he just

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
unloads all his weapons in like

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
pretty much a cone in front of him

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
and it does really good damage

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
if you can focus someone down

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
if you get a lot of people gathered in one area and you

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
unleash that thing and especially if you use your

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
emitter first so you're safe you can take

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
out like a lot of people at once

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
so

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
finally there's Viktor and Viktor

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
plays a lot like Soldier 76 from

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Overwatch sorry about all the comparisons but it's just

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
easier to describe it this way since more people know

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Overwatch I know I'm feeding

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
into the whole ripoff thing but you know

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
whatever I don't really care

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
so his assault rifle is like his

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
main gun but on this one if you hit the left trigger

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
you actually look down the sights so you get a little bit more

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
accuracy but he does move

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
slower because you're not just shooting

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
off the hip you're looking right down the sights

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
his R like Soldier's

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
you know right shoulder button is

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
like a hustle so he moves he can run really

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
fast but he can't shoot while he's doing it as soon as you start

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
shooting you come out of your sprint

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
sprint is what they call it for

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
for Soldier and then

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
frag grenade is his left shoulder button

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
he'll throw a grenade it does a lot of damage

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
you can hold the button

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
cook the grenade so that when you release it it

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
blows up more quickly if someone is closer to you

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
it's a really nice ability and then barrage his

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
his ultimate ability is really strong

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
and it just

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
kind of like Soldier again focuses on

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
everybody gets kind of in his sights

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
and if they kind of stand there too long

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
you can unload like a bunch of shells

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
on them and do tons of damage so

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
that's pretty much all the

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
characters that you get

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
when you start the game and they're not bad characters

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
not like they just give you a bunch of pushovers

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
they're very offensive minded

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
characters which makes

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
sense because if you just get into the game and

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
you just want to play a shooter

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
and you're not comfortable healing your tanking

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
well the healer and tank that they give you here are very

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
damage friendly all those characters are

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
really easy to use and you can kind of start

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
building a foundation in the game and

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
then be better after you

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
learn how to do them and you start unlocking other heroes

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
you start figuring out what's better but I'll still go back and play

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
those guys because they still do pretty

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
good damage so again

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
it sounds like a big commercial for Paladins but if you

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
ask me I still think Overwatch is a better game

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I play it more often

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I dabble in this game but

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
it is really fun

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
you can't really beat the price of free

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
if you're willing to grind

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
it's a good game and even if you want to pay for it

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
30 bucks isn't bad to get all the heroes

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
and it supports crossplay so if you want to

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
play with your friends this is a good game to play with your friends

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
because no matter what console they're on except Sony

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
you can play with your friends so again

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I'm Flaco Jones

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
you can find me on Twitch twitch.tv

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
slash Flaco underscore Jones

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
and uh

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
that's it back to OLR

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
hopefully that wasn't too long

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
No it was fantastic

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
thank you Flaco and it's

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
there was a lot of work that I know

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
goes into that video especially because it's very

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
clear he like had to play the game like multiple times

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
and multiple characters to put the right shots in and stuff

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
so I really appreciate the time you took to

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
put together that infomercial high res

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
appreciation time too no

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I'm just I'm giving a little crap because I

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
that's what I asked for I wanted people to submit games

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
um about uh or submit

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
things uh videos for

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
for games that they're like passionate about that they have

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
you know a lot of um you know

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
enthusiasm about which you know even though kind of

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Flaco admits eh Overwatch

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
might be kind of the game I go to more often

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
maybe this game is still worth your

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
attention especially when it's something that's free

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
uh and they do these kind of different ideas

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
and things like that so I actually I've played

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
um a little bit of Paladins

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
as well and I thought it was I thought it was

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
interesting I mean it was just again it was just like

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
okay I mean I I kind of

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
went back to Overwatch but I thought

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
you know okay this is something I could get into

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
also maybe I need to try it more on PC

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
because I played it on console and I'm just

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
more of a keyboard mouse guy at the end of the day so I do

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
kind of want to give that another go because

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
one thing that I had a problem kind of figuring out

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
was oh like what do all these

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
heroes kind of do and stuff but Flaco

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
did a very good job kind of demonstrating that in that little

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
video especially for oh these are all the characters

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
that you're going to start with and uh so forth

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
so yeah shout out to our pal Flaco Jones

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
against Flaco underscore Jones

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
over on Twitch you should all go

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
follow him if you aren't already

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
that would be incredible and thanks again Flaco

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
for that submission very cool and if you

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
have a submission get in touch with me on

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Twitter at Mr Rob Roberts we love

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
seeing the listener submitted stuff

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
um yeah it's great

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
um otherwise we've just been filling in with

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
with video clips of the news or whatever else

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
we can think of but it gives us a chance for us

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
folks here in studio to take a little bit

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
of a break so um

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
also in chat I notice

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Flaco's actually in chat right now

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
and getting some kudos there in chat

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
and rightfully so

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Flaco says a 12 minute video

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
and 45 minutes of playing for

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
cover shots yep that's it

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
but it looks like there might be some other

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Paladins players in chat because Nifty's asking

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
which character do you main so

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
uh pretty cool good stuff

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
alright um let's move on with some other news that we

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
have scheduled for tonight's show uh some rapid fire

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
news let's get some news uh kinda quickly out here

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
uh as we travel around the studio

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
and the world and check out quickly

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
some other uh headlines we might have missed

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
uh I think we're starting tonight with Loki

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
yeah so at the South by Southwest

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
gaming panel they um had some

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
details regarding um a new game

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
from Sega uh Team Sonic

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Racing uh which I think

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
has been teased before but they showed a little bit more

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
on it so they showed that

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
um you know

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
the different customization they have in the different

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
cars you can do which is kinda cool so there's

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
quite a bit of customization available

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
um

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I'm assuming based on

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
what they showed they said you know you can

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
encourage and see it allows you to unlock different

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
things in the game and different customizations

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I almost saw that as like monetization

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
type of thing but apparently you earned it in

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
game so we'll see um yeah I wanna

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
say in previous games it was kinda like that

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
yeah in game in game currency only

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
um there the game is

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
gonna be released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4,

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Switch and PC on May 21st

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
um the other thing they showed is there's

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
gonna be this Team Sonic Racing

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Overdrive cartoon

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
that's gonna be coming out now

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
when they say cartoon

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
not necessarily like on TV

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
cartoon but it's more of like a

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
web series or something that they're gonna do

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
um which you know makes sense

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
they've done something similar

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
with like say

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
um Angry Birds have like

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
a little web series and stuff that they did as well

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
which actually ended up on Netflix at some point

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I know cause I've seen it

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
several times thanks to my kids but they're doing

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
something similar to this there's not actually

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
any spoken dialogue in the show

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
but it's just kind of like

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
grunts and whatever

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
it's just I don't know it's very

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
basic so that they can release

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
it globally without having to localize it

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
um so there's that

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
and I guess that'll be around the time

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
that the game comes out so we'll have to

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
see but the game's being developed by Sumo

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Digital so

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I think they were the ones that did um

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
weren't they the ones that did the

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
ModNation Racers and stuff like that

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
the name sounds familiar I just can't remember what

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
else they developed off the top of my head I know that name

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
that name sounds very familiar but it looked neat

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
it looked neat so I'll check it out when

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
it comes out

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
cool and then um

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
D'Artasuya thinks it was Outrun by the way the new Outrun that they did

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
oh maybe

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
um and then of course um

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Game Pass we talk about that

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
quite a bit uh new game that's gonna be

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
coming well not new game but a new

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
game to the service is coming out

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
April 4th will be Minecraft

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
will be added to Games Pass so you'll

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
be able to jump into Minecraft if you haven't

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
already I mean

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
geez it's like 2019

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
um but you'll be able to do that for free

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
well free on top

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
with excluding of course the

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
$10 a month fee for Game Pass

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
but it's an additional

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
piece that you get with that yeah when's the 4k

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
graphics pack by the way

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
whatever happened to that didn't they announce that at E3 2017

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
where's that 4k graphics pack

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
well I know I'm crazy

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
4k graphics for Minecraft but the stuff they were

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
like the weather and all that stuff is really good

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
like I'm like well if you want to do that it's already

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
available on PC now you just have to

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
do with mods yeah

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
of course of course Java version

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
alright um I don't know how I got

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
the story on Mortal Kombat 11 but how about

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
that um so there's more information

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
on Mortal Kombat 11 came out this

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
week and um

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
apparently they're mentioning that

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
NetherRealm is talking about how player data

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
shows that and this is interesting because

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Jamie you kind of brought this up earlier about how you prefer

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
to play games but the player data they're getting

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
shows that single player mode is one of the most

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
popular ways for people to access

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
and experience the game so

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
that's why NetherRealm was kind of putting

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
as much for a fighting game which you

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
typically think of as two player this is why NetherRealm

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
puts as much as they do into single player because

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
their data shows a lot of people are playing it that way

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
and Mortal Kombat does have

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
kind of a rich you know compared to other fighting games

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
especially the newer Mortal Kombat

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
games really do have a very rich story

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
to them so I'm not terribly surprised

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
to hear that more people are

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
experiencing it as a result

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
um also believe it or not

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
some fatalities were too over the top

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
and not really functional so they were yanked

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
or redesigned what

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
how about that uh they are not commenting

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
on other characters from other

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
properties so all this

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
BS about Shaggy or any

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
uh IP that is not there

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Shaggy in Mortal Kombat I mean they could

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
make it happen it is Warner

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
it's not gonna happen but it

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
but Velma on the other hand she came

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
to kick some ass no I'm just kidding they're not

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
putting cartoon characters in a fucking game

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
uh you know no just like Joker

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
no I was gonna say you'd have better

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
luck going for the Injustice series

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I was gonna say they're not gonna put

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
but they had Ninja Turtles well I was in

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Justice as well I was in Justice as well so

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
yeah you you should find Shaggy for

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Injustice 3 take your Shaggy

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
it would be an Injustice not to put

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
him in there

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
and Scooby Doo and

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
OLR is cancelled forever good night and Scrappy

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
in fact Scrappy can just be like one of those

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
bonus games now I know this is

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
this is not necessarily in the same

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
series but you know much like they have

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
and uh Capcom

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Street Fighter series you know where you destroy the car

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
you can destroy Scrappy

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
mmhmm

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
alright um let's see

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
the story is roughly 8 hours long

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
what? $60 for an 8 hour game?

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
uh

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
nevermind it's a fighting game

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
it's a fighting game exactly um

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
the crypt is back but they're saying

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
a nice surprise for players when you see

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
the direction it's taken uh

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
and let's see features will be added to the game

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
after launch even in the first few months

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
uh and Kronika's mission

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
is in the story involves

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
finding time and starting all over

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
so merging the timeline so that

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
the past meets the present

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
so that could be because Mortal Kombat has a very

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I don't know if you guys know but Mortal Kombat has like a whole like

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Prime and Kelvin thing going on

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
the newer games are in the Kelvin universe

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I'm referencing Star Trek obviously

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
but the newer games are in like a different universe because of what happened

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
in the reboot Mortal Kombat 9

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
mmhmm so interesting

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
it'll be interesting to see how that all goes down universal shenanigans

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
yes so uh

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
anyway that's Mortal Kombat and quickly let me also

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
mention that uh the other story I had here is about

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
the uh indie game The Messenger

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
and I have to admit I didn't know a lot about

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
this game until I was uh scavenging

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
for the news this week and then I kind of watched a trailer

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
and this looks really cool because

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
The Messenger it's kind of like a it's a Metroidvania

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
type of game I know we hear that a lot

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
but it kind of seems a little bit like Ninja

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Ninja Gaiden kind of

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
but like uh amped up

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
a little bit and um

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
it's um something where you

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
can actually switch between

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
8-bit and 16-bit mode

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
by hitting a certain

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
type of like marker

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
on the like you've hit an orb and like

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
it changes it from 8-bit to 16-bit

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
and that kind of it's a time bubble is what

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
it is and it flips it between it and it changes

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
the graphics and the sound with it and it

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
changes the mechanics as well so I think that's kind

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
of kind of neat anyway

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
it's coming to PlayStation 4 on

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
March 19th so this coming week

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
so maybe it'll be a great time for me

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
to check it out uh

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
but anyway Dark Sakura

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
um I don't know how many people in chat

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
have played Dragon's Dogma I started it

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
and didn't like it um

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
but they are going to be doing

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
a uh anime

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
that will be out on Netflix

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
produced by Sublimation

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
and um basically I mean in the game

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
you fight a dragon and

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
it steals your heart and you die and then you come back

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
to life and so you're trying to

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
get revenge on it well that's the story the

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
plot of the anime

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
um but it was said by um

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Koishikawa Atsushi

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
who is the representative director

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
of Sublimation they're really looking

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
forward on it and the last line is what

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
gets me we're excited to bring our

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
unique cel-shaded animation that carries

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
hand-drawn textures to anime

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
fans around the world

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
so I think it should look interesting

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
um but anyway

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
uh other news there has been

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
another unearthing apart from ECW

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Wrestling which everybody fucking knew

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
existed um

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
there was an Alien vs.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Predator football game

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
for the Sega Genesis

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
at least there was going to be one

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
like football football or as an American

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
football as in not real football

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
yep we got

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
we're gonna settle our differences

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
on the 50 yard line yep

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
that would have made a better movie I think than

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
the Alien vs. Predator movie and it was just

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
a concept it was actually just on

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
like you know uh

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
a flyer and it was

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
called like Alien vs.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Predator Hardball no Cosmic

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Hardball and

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
yeah it looks pretty stupid but

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
but let's be

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
real some of the greatest video games are

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
really really stupid I think I

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
would have actually enjoyed this

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
um but

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I mean this would be this is like the best video game

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
never made that's why I gave this story to you

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
because even though I know you're not a big football fan I'm like

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
but I bet she would have played this

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I would have I like

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I also like super high impact that's true

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
and I like Tecmo Bowl so even

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
people who aren't into sports games there's always

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
something there's always something that brings you in

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
but the thing that's funny about the tweets about it

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
is people arguing if the Xenomorph would wear a

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
football helmet

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
well for safety they have those big

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
long armored heads I want to see this

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
done as a movie

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
but done in the style of Space Jam

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
did you see Alien vs. Predator

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
where you took the head off of one and used it as a

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
shield no I don't

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I don't really watch I saw

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
that that movie was rad I've seen

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I actually think I've seen most of the aliens

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
movies at this point I saw Alien resurrection

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
in the theater with Winona Ryder I needed

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
to see that only because I wanted to

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
listen to what it could have been

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
yeah I don't I didn't

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
know anything about the controversy or any of that stuff I just

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
it was written by it was written by

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Joss it was changed up a lot and

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
while I am very very very very

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
very disappointed in the person he turned out to be

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
at the time I was like should I need

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
to see this and then I

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
heard they ruined it so I never saw it

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Cia Tiberi in chat says Freddy vs. Jason vs.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Alien vs. Predator Ultimate Football

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
why did you leave out Ash though? I'm just kidding

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
well because he would just own them all with his chainsaw

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
hand and Michael

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Myers come on Cia Tiberi

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
jeez

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
and now doing seriously on that one I don't

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
think that those are series that could be

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
combined because the slasher

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
movies are different than the creature horror

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
right but Mortal Kombat

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
10 brought or I guess

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
you are supposed to say Mortal Kombat X in that one

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
but it did bring over

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
because Predator is in

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
that right and but it's mostly humanoid

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
yeah I guess that's true so it would work

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
in that and they do have some kind

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
of creature people magic

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
it wasn't one of the Call of Duty

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
games didn't they have like you know

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
this whole thing with like Predator in there and

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I thought like they also had

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I don't know I feel like

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
these horror movie icons just randomly pop

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
up in all your favorite video games like I'm waiting

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
for like Hello Kitty world featuring

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
you know yes yes

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
predator I'm done

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I'm down with let's see that

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Hello Kitty vs. Predator Team Sonic

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Racing you know who you need

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
to be in those carts predator

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
the predator why not

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
it's canon because

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
you know we saw in the trailer or something

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
some sort of video we saw that the predator

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
was driving a tank so there you go

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
ok Dar Sacro what video

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
game do you want to insert the predator in to make better

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
DDR

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
dance or die

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
dance or die well could you just

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I mean I'm sure they've done a skin

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
for like a dancer being the predator

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
but I would just jam with the predator

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
as my avatar on the screen

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
I like dance or die

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
or like 2DX and he would literally scratch

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
the thing

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
and if you lose he like stabs you

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
let's see

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I want the predator to show up at Mario Party

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
when my friends

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
piss me off Smash Brothers

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
is an assist

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
pulls out Mario's spine

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
let's travel around the world

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
and check out some

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
actual video games that are coming out around

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
starting in the US Loki

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
we don't have a whole lot coming out this week

um good evening everyone

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
so Rob as per our brief discussion

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
ABC is bringing back Card Sharks

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
and Press Your Luck

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
have you thought about streaming on Twitch yourself

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
playing game show video games

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I think that would be pretty fun

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
yes I

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
well okay yes and no

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
so I have not thought about myself playing

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
game show video games although I think

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
that's a pretty rad idea and I think I'm going to do it

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I think I will play those games it would be fun

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
to play with people online as well

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
have I thought about streaming

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
game show content before

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
yes

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
that's all I'm going to say for now

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
also my next two questions for the entire

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
staff. One, what game show would you

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
love to host? Fuck me

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Press Your Luck, I

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
oh my god without hesitation that would be such a fun show

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
to host and I wanted to be a game show host

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
when I grew up by the way and this is about as close

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
as I get to live out that fantasy so

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
I really wouldn't want to do any except

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
maybe Family Feud because I think

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I could out Steve Harvey, Steve Harvey

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
okay I'm pretty good at

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
looks with the really fake like

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I can't believe they said

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
that he doesn't do an I can't believe

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
they said that he just gives people this look

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
like bitch what

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
which is what I would say

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
okay bitch what no

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
you can't say that on TV go back

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
to your desk

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
uh Sia Tabiri in chat says would you

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
do like a Jackbox games night that actually

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
seems like a really obvious idea that we just haven't done

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
yet I think we'll have to we should plan like a vog

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Jackbox night that'd be fun

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
yeah yeah we gotta get your game show

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Loki my game show

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
what game show do you want to host? I would host

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Double Dare

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
no

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Double Dare is kind of boring

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Bumper Stumpers to come back

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
what? Bumper Stumpers

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
it was like a license plate

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
base game yeah we had to translate the

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
license plate but it was like answering trivia

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
questions with license plates or something like that got it okay

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
um we'll just do like

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
uh I'll say Starrcade

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
yeah well fuck why didn't I say

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
that that should have been my number one pick

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
uh he

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
he put a sandbag on the question

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
by bringing up pressure luck earlier in the email

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
so Starrcade

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
but it's a clue it's a it's a

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
tie both alright two

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
what game show would you like to be on

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Rob we know at Supermarket Sweep so you can't say that one

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
pressure luck

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I would also

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
say Starrcade

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
it's not on TV anymore so I guess

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
you can say Supermarket Sweep I'm the only one forbidden

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
from saying Supermarket Sweep I don't know what things

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
cost at the supermarket anymore

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
honestly I want to be on Jeopardy before

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Alex Trebek dies

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
oh my god Bobby Black Wolf nail on the head

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
The Mole I didn't even think

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
of that as a game show but I guess at its core it is

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
The Mole is the greatest reality

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
show they ever made and it is a crime

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
that it is not on TV because

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
none of you assholes were watching it

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and it was a great like

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Anderson Cooper as a fucking bitch

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
hosting a show was

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
divine

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
it was great I love The Mole it was there was

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
never a better reality show I really like those reality shows

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
like that but it's except for Drag Race

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
it's different it's not

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
it wasn't I don't know

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
I can't explain it but a show like

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
The Mole felt more James Bond

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
than it did Real Housewives of Atlanta

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
if that makes sense

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I mean there was the episode

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
or the revival season where the one

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
chick told the guy I'm gonna kill you in your sleep

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
but that was you know that was

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
just one moment I don't know

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
a good game show would be To Catch a Predator

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
it's not a game show

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
no but I already know

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
prizes but then we could bring the

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
predator in no no no

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
and it's a whole different show then I always

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
feel like the family got

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
something when they caught the shit

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
to catch a predator with the

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
predator well if

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
you see the the the human predator

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
gets stabbed by the predator

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
that would be awesome alright anyway

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
a fifth

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
dream today says Rob should replace

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Julie Chen on Big Brother I

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
really appreciate that comment but first

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I don't know what show would y'all see

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
me on cause I don't really

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
think I would be on a game show

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
truth or consequences

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
focus on the consequences

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
it was a very old show

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
I'm just thinking the consequences part

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
what was the other one with Chuck

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Woolery one of those other USA

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Network ones not Scrabble

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
there was Bumper Stumpers Scrabble

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
and there was

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
he hosted when

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Millionaire was really big he'd agreed

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
this was around the same

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
era in the late 80s

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Love Connection

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Love Connection wasn't the other one I was thinking of

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I would be on Hollywood Squares

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
but I want like what's his

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
face to come back from the dead

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
and be on it with me

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
oh god

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Paul Inn

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
I want to be on there with Paul Inn

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
and Carol Channing

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
if I could do like

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
you would also have to be brought back from the dead

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
you want to do zombie Hollywood Squares

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
no I don't want it to be zombie

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
but you want all these celebrities back from the dead

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
no I want it to be like time travel

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
kidnap Hollywood Squares

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
but somehow

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
drag queens are involved as well

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
and also not only

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
would I have Carol Channing

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I would have Stalker Channing

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
and Channing Tatum so they could be a diagonal

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
this is the weirdest Bill and Ted

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I've ever seen

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
we're kidnapping all of these people

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
from different timelines that put them on the Hollywood

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Squares

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
that should be my comic

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
is the

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
time travel kidnapping Hollywood Squares

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
I don't know why I'm laughing it's so stupid

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
and the top square

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
it's brilliant that's why we need to make it a movie

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
and the bottom square would be the predator

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
it's such a stupid plot

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
but what else are people doing

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
is remaking movies

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
so that's it for now take care

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
and see you all on the flip side

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
oh it was an email of course it was

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
well did you hear how I ended it

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
no I'm sorry I missed it because I was laughing

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
that's it for now take care and see you all on the flip side

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
alright

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
delete and next

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Dear Orange Lounge Radio

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
I hope this email finds you well

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
as I am currently typing it while in the bathroom at work

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
thank you

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
you're listening to KTMI

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
too much information all the time

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
randomly an OLR quote

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
came to mind that had me giggling

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
uh oh I said it too

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
a long time ago Jamie shouted Uranus

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
during an OLR episode

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
to which Rob countered with something along the lines of

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
not having this conversation

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
as host of the show do you have a

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
favorite funny memory of it that comes to mind

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
every so often thanks for eating

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
and I love you guys sincerely Garth Wolf

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
I don't know oh that's a tough one

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I like drinking and

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
seeing the wall

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
kicking and

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
oh god I try to forget that

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
eating half a box of waffles

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
thank you Loki

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
can you imagine if episodes 1 through 100

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
like 1 through 100 would be like

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
the pre podcast era

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
when like there was no

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
structure to this show

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
there was absolutely no structure to this show

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
and it was just like we take a break every now and then

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
it was floppy boobs

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
it was a mess can you imagine if that had been on Twitch

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
like that's why I was saying earlier

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
I don't want 13 million followers cause somebody would find

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
those shows

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
it would be like triple D's with no bra

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
that's what they're like

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
painful and floppy

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I mean but there were some good times there really were some good times

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
in those eras

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
the first thing that comes to mind

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
that I think of regularly

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
and it's still like I'll be in the most

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
random place and I think of it

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
and Deep Fried Rice by Loki

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
it's a Loki moment but it wasn't on the show

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
it was when we were interviewed

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
on the news and the only

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
clip they put in of Loki without

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
even his name on it is just him

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
going oh it's so much fun

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
yeah

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
the greatest thing it's on YouTube

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
somewhere I think on the old ass

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
orange songs radio YouTube channel we haven't touched in like 10 years

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
my old newspaper finally destroyed itself

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
like I had the newspaper I had

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
saved with all that

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
it's all like destroyed

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
mine's very yellow

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
but I have it in like this plastic

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
thing that keeps it kind of straight

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
so where they had a picture of my foot

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
okay real quick

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
for the listeners who haven't heard this story and I apologize

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
cause some of you have heard this several times

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
but many years ago when podcasting

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
was first becoming a thing and like

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
it just got onto iTunes

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
and was getting out there of course everybody

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
wanted to talk about podcasting so our local news

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
station I guess put like

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Sacramento podcast into iTunes

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
and found us so they came out

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
and we did like a fake show for them

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
that they could shoot and then they interviewed

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
each of us about the show and so each of us

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
kind of have a little talking head moment in the

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
clip about it and I think I'm

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
probably saying something about like why

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
L.R. started dark sakura talks

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
about you know why she does it as a

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
hobby or whatever and then the only

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
thing they usually they don't even put his name at the bottom of the

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
screen or whatever it's like it's some type of follow

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
up to a comment it's just him going oh it's

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
so much fun and then that's it

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
and when we

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
saw that back on the news Loki's reaction

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
that was like fucking really

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
there

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
was at least like several

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
minutes of footage and they like took

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
like this fraction of a second that's what

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
it's like to be on reality TV by the way

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
there's just that that whole anyway

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
um but with the new

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
segment which I really now that we are a video show

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
one of these days I need to like clip it and put it on

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
but I just technically it's not ours

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
um but what was the other thing I was

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
gonna say with that um

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
is um oh they

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
never also in the story they

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
never mentioned the name of our show

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
remember that yeah that was stupid

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
they show the dude

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
searching for it so you can see

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000

but they never say it's orange lounge radio

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
which was just

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
kind of the um

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
the the the the

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
topping of the cake yes

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
somebody thank you tiger claw dug up

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
dug up the article and put it in our chat

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
so there it is

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
oh lord

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
SSG100 Matt reminded

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
me of another moment it was

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
peppermint time and mint but that was

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
a that was a horde house joke

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
I'm really

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
just trying to think of stuff

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
cause it's like just little clips just from

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
around the show but maybe not

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
during the show like like the fried

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
you know corn flaked coated

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
rice balls when

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Loki got a deep fryer

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
and waffles

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
and dunk

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
see I don't the funny moments

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
are good and and I

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
I appreciate those as well but I also

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
remember like a lot of like a lot of not to be

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
too sappy but a lot of the serious stuff like

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
jumps out like we

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
did a live broadcast

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
from Pier 39 on the internet

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
before anybody

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
did something like that

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
like we did that and that was what probably

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
would have been the year 2003 that we did that

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
uh that's awesome

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
um some of the great emails

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
that have come through the years

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
you know the part of the motivation that's kept me

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
doing the show where who's become our friends

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
oh god for sure friends that we made

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
people that will email and say um

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I had to help accepting

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
my sexuality because you're out there presenting

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
yourself Rob and I saw some of

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
myself and you and that people telling me to

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
get in the kitchen but that's not a

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
positive thing but you know what

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I positively think those people are morons

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
well you know what though

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
I think despite the fact that that's shitty

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
and I'm not gonna talk positive

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
you know how much of a shit I give about it well I think

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
but it helped you I think in the beginning you

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
were kind of like what the fuck is

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
like you know but it kind of like I think helped you

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
like I cranked the

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
feminism to 11 yes

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
it's like that art project

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
complicit in my own

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
discrimination and then

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
hyper feminist

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
not shutting up

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
uh see it to bury in chat with

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
a newer moment saying I remember that time

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
rob mangled the carlton dance and

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
loki refused to floss see that's something a little bit newer

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
and uh thanks

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
or no thanks to the twitch clip

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
clipping feature which I just saw my earlier

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
laughing fit popped up as a clip

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
around your butt I'm sure now some

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
of these moments are probably gonna be frozen in time

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
so that'll be it'll be interesting to see the

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
the result of that but that's okay

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
great thing is shermy is a part of olr's history

the whole time yeah mom

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000

did read that comment um but uh

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
metal mayhem says I still remember

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
rob's epic diva fit

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
you know that's not a moment I really look back on

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
fondly but and do you that all

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
was on um

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
justin tv yeah that was

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
the time when we were doing this for the first time on justin

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
tv that whole diva fit happened and I

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
remember cause part of what made that so

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
funny slash interesting is that I

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
stormed off and loki just

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
without skipping a beat goes alright

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
then let's go on to the next snake

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
story like uh he's he's trying to be

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
professional in the moment or whatever and then I think

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
he reads the story and then I come back and I'm like I've got something

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
to say well also

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
dj rama s points out that we spawned other

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
shows oh yeah that's

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
that's quite the compliment abs

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
absolutely she hulk misses the fus

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
well

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
but keep in mind that there was a period of time

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
for sure where gamers

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
didn't necessarily need to be associated with negativity

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
if you want fus just read my twitter

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
we

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
can still do them once in a while we haven't done one in a while

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
what are you doing real quick I don't have the music

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
we'll just do a quick one you wanna do a quick fus

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
can we just like insert music here

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
insert music here

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
okay alright so

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
fu goes to

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
capitalism

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
and misogyny

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
your turn uh my fu of the week

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
goes to myself for not going to the gym

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
today because I slept for 10 hours

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
um because I've been so tired today

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
uh and fu to

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
um uh just

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
yeah I think I think today was definitely

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
a crash and burn day I think yesterday and today have

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
both been like just crash and burn days

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
between like Vegas and go go go

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
and all this other stuff like I think I've just

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
like emotionally and physically like

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
crap and then I hosted a show Friday night too so

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
I think I emotionally and physically crashed and

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
burned these past couple days and it's not the best feeling

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
in the world but um

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
doing this show is pepping me up I do have one

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
more cause it's very important alright hurry my uterus

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
for cramps well

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
sorry to hear it okay alright Loki

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
last not least um

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
I guess my fu

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
was uh to

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
my migraine but it's gone now so I don't know

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
I'm glad your migraine is gone

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
you were right the caffeine helped apparently all that

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
caffeine did it along

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
with the other stuff um and that's

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
just for now alright

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
that was it for emails right yes

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
okay then I suppose this video game podcast should

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
get back into some uh video game topics

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
huh let's let's do

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
it back into the gaming news oh uh but please feel

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
free to email us in the future participate at

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
orangesontrader.com but meanwhile Loki

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
so Valve's gonna start cracking down on

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
some of these review bombs that have nothing

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
to do with necessarily

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
um maybe reviewing

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
the games it's more of like

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I guess people using the platform to

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
um

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
attack other

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
things that they don't like

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
like for example I guess

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
would be if

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
said company was coming

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
out with a decision that somebody didn't

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
like so they took you know their previous

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
game they released and review bombed it because they didn't

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
like a certain decision or something like that

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
so what they're gonna do is try to identify

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
those and then remove those

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
uh from the way it calculates

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
uh the review scores

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
based on those types of reviews

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
uh they're saying that the reviews themselves

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
are being left untouched but

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
and if they want if people want to dig into

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
them you'll still be able to do so but

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
they're making it clear that you know

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
the ones that are

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
gonna be I guess highlighted or whatever are gonna be

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
not those ones that are off

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
topic well good

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
I like when I go in to read game reviews

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
I don't need to hear about what people think about the

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
policies of the company or the

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
company or something that was said on Twitter

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
or some comment that somebody affiliated

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
I just want to know is the game good

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
yes or no that's what I

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
want to hear about so I'm glad they're

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
gonna try to do something about it I mean it seems

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
like that's an awfully big undertaking for a store

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
like Steam which is barely managed as

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
it is to undertake but to do anything I

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
know I was like we'll see

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
it's a nice thought

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
did they ever take down the rape game

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
oh sure of course they did good but

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
the you know the fact that

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
it went up in the first place

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
because Steam

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
doesn't really moderate a lot of things so it's

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
interesting to see that Steam is suddenly gonna moderate this

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
this is yeah a little

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
like hmm how's that gonna

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
work I don't know anyway

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
uh Kaijuto in our chat over at

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Twitch TV slash vog network says I don't like

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
the review bombs but I think Valve is making a

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
big mistake you have to let the community

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
police that stuff people are smart

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
they know a bomb review from a normal one

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
they need to not attach the game score

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
to the review I think review

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
uh user review should be unscored

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
for sure I think that would be a great way to

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
start but anyway

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
yeah yeah

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
uh interesting retort by Bobby

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Blackwolf that I think is very succinctly

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
put uh Bobby Blackwolf

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
response to Kaijuto saying a person

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
is smart people are

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
dumb a fucking

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
that is a very succinct

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
good comment

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
gold star comment of the week

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
I can't believe we're gonna

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
keep it in the family so to speak

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
and people will claim that nepotism is coming

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
into play and the fact that he does the show

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
before ours but I think Bobby is deserving of the gold star

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
of the week for that comment

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
alright moving on

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
uh let's move on to uh something that

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
uh ooh it's uh

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
a little rough for the folks involved uh

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
over at Axiom Verge

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
uh it has to do with developer versus publisher

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
uh of course if you haven't

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
played Axiom Verge it's uh really cool

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
it's a little uh super metroid-ish type of game

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
uh it was free on epic store

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
epic game store

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
the epic game store for a little

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
bit um it was free there but

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
not anymore but you could buy it and it would be

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
worth your money if you haven't picked it up one of several

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
other ways um the game is still

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
supposed to get a physical release on Wii U

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
I don't know why you would

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
bother at this point but I guess because they promised

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
it or what have you they're gonna deliver

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
well I think that's through that uh

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
the one company oh limited run? yeah limited run

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
okay so it's a collector release

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
okay that makes a lot more sense uh yes

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
the distributor limited run

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
game and the business manager

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
have said that the publisher Badland

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
game still owes them a quarter million dollars

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
so what happened is that

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
limited run says that Badland owes it

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
$78,000 for physical copies of the game

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
that it never delivered and then Badland

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
did not pay Tom Happ

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
the one man band that made Axiom Verge

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
uh the sum of about $200,000

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
that was also

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
there was supposed to be money that was gonna pay for medical treatments

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
for Tom Happ's kid

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
which I seem to remember has come up with

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
this game before is that you know

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
he's been using the money to pay

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
a lot for medical related things for his

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
kid which you know is obviously

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
you know nobody likes to see a sick kid so a lot of people

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
are happy to support this game to know that that's where

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
some of the money is going uh and so

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
this is you know now it's getting ugly because it's

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
on Twitter and now um let's

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
see uh Adelman who is uh

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
the business manager with limited run

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
the game's Dan Adelman says Badland has

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
literally stolen money from a disabled toddler

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
that's basically what he's saying on Twitter

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
yikes so uh

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
anyhow this is uh very ugly

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
between the two of them nobody was

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
commenting in an article that Kotaku ran earlier

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
this week and uh don't know

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
what this is gonna do if this

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
is gonna impact that Wii U release

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
I don't think it will but um

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
it'll be interesting to see how that whole uh

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
dragging through the mud and all that will

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
possibly change things so they're

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
saying we were still planning on dividing up the proceeds

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
on the original terms

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
so uh 6,000 copies of the Wii U

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
edition were made there's a soundtrack an art book

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
and other extras so it

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
paid Badland oh it's coming on the Wii U

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
yeah I kept thinking Switch

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
it's out on the Switch right man

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
why are you so late on the Wii U? Collectors

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
that's why I said the whole time

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
right so anyway

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
I kept hearing Wii U or like hearing Switch

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
instead of Wii U I was like oh okay Switch that makes sense

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
and it's like Wii U wait what

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
why no

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
alright

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
anyhow

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
oh Bobby is admitting that that quote he said

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
came from some movie but I didn't recognize

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
it cause he's thanking the chat for

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
not saying what movie we may have to revoke the star

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
cause it's not an original quote

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
alright

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
you get a half star alright let's move

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
on uh Dark Sakura what do you have for us

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
we're almost uh to the call segment but not just

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
yet but Dark Sakura well there's been a

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
rash of arrests made um

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
in uh

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Ahmedabad

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Ahmedabad I always

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
mispronounce it but there were

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
people who were arrested across the state

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
after playing PUBG

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
um because um several

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
um the games of actually games

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
of that line online multiplayer games

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
were banned on

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
the grounds that it was leading to

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
violent behavior among children and

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
and younger people they arrested

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
three people in different

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
parts um of the

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
area after they were caught playing the game

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
and um the police

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
commissioner issued a notice

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
banning even more of that

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
uh starting uh it actually started

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
on the 14th so they

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
were booked under section 188

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
the disobedience to

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
fully uh to order

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
duly promulgated by public servant

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
of the Indian Penal Code

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
so stupid but that's

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
what's going on in the world this is like the movie Footloose

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
all of a sudden you can't so you can't

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
play PUBG in public

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
any first person online multiplayer game

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
wow

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
yep interesting cultural

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
differences being discussed tonight

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
that's for sure between March

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
12th and 13th Rajkot

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
City police arrested ten persons

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
including six college students

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
for playing the game despite the ban

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
wow

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
alright I guess uh

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
for all the things we complain about

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
sometimes it sure could be a lot worse

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
we may not even be able to play video games

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
let alone talk about them the way we do

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
here on Orange On Radio

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
arrested for playing is

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Where in the World is Carmen

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
San Diego and you can actually play

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
this for free now thanks to Google

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Earth so if you go to Google Earth

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
um they actually have an option now

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
catch Carmen San Diego

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
and you basically play a little game

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
that's you know Where in the World

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
is Carmen San Diego and follow

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
clues and has it been updated for Modern

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Maps? Well it's a great

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
advertisement tie-in for

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
the new Netflix series is what it is

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
yeah so it's pretty

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
awesome and you get clues and you go

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
off to find Carmen

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
San Diego and

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
yeah that's pretty cool

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
I think that's a cute modernization

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
I mean you know using Google

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Earth but still at the core

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
having uh Carmen San Diego

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
be about you know learning about these different cities

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
and the the artifacts and the

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
uh museums and the places

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
of interest that are in these cities and kind of learning

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
what's where what's the capital of what I mean

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
that's you know that's what those games are all about

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
I'm surprised that's not a thing that's

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
like a Niantic game

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
you know like not necessarily

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
world traveling but like within

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
your area within your neighborhood like trying

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
to find Carmen San Diego

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
or one of her henchmen or something like

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
that um I don't think Niantic hasn't done anything

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
like that like you know and maybe they're

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
worried about flooding

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
where in your hood is Cory Santiago

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
yeah I don't know yeah where in your neighborhood

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
where in your neighborhood is this

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I have heard about live event

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
producers so it's been this article that's

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
been floating around my Facebook um because

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
people think of me when they think of Clue the movie

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
which I appreciate it is my all time favorite movie

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
um but I guess they're doing like

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
a live Clue event here locally

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
like it's like some type of late but it's not

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
it's not really the board game Clue it's just like a murder

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
mystery thing that's like themed on Clue I guess

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
but my point is I think

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
they use a phone app that

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
you like you pay money to play

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
this event and then you get all the updates through the phone

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
app and I've heard of this being a thing

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
lately because this isn't the first thing that I heard of

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I also remember seeing something for like

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
an amazing race

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
style thing but it's

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
all through the phone but here's what they do

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
like they offer like a big prize to the winner

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
but they let like thousands of people

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
sign up for like 20 bucks a pop

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
and like the winner gets maybe like $10,000

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
so it sounds like a lot of money but it's not nearly

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
as much as these guys are making off it so

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
they give that prize and then not only that

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
but like if you get stumped along the way and some

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
of the clues are like really hard you have to pay

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
for more clues oh that's lame get it

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
so pay to win

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
that's a thing but that isn't

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
keep an eye on that stuff because

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
somebody's making money

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
off these live event games

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
not Niantic but definitely these like

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
neighborhood event

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
day type of things

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
so that's a thing you probably see you probably

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
seen these advertised on Facebook in your neighborhood as well

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
so anyhow

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
alright is that

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
hmm I have regrets

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
oh from eating that donut that you were showing off

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
amazing but like there's a few

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
foods that will always make me sick and I know

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
better and I don't give a shit

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
ice cream

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
and donuts

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
it's like me and coffee my doctor told me to stop

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
drinking coffee and I was like we're gonna have to negotiate this

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
cause you and I both know it's not gonna happen

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
so we negotiated

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
anyway

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
one more story and this is about

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Snapchat cause I'm sure

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
lots of you guys here in studio use Snapchat

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
right

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I don't know I guess

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I've used Snapchat it's very

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
similar to Instagram has the stories

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
which they kind of stole from Snapchat

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
but Snapchat is another way

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
and Snapchat is also kind of like

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
a lot of people associate

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
it with like people

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
sending nudes to each other because they're supposed to

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
self destruct in 24 hours or whatever

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
so this is of course you know

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
cause that's how the internet works

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
that's how anything works right we've talked about the whole

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
time to penis before so of course

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
they put a thing like Snapchat out where it's like

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
the picture self destruct in 24 hours

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
you know that

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
it's supposed to tell you when a screenshot is taken

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
but there's all sorts of ways

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
nothing you send is

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
truly that type of private

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
but whatever

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
oh it's that type of private alright

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I left myself wide open with that joke

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
alright anyway my point with this

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
is Snapchat they are trying to get away

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
from being known as the app where you send nude pics

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
they're trying to do more event based things

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
and stories like on Instagram

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
and maybe this is something they want to do as well

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
supposedly Snap is going to be launching

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
a gaming platform

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
as well it's

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
it's a rumor right now it's apparently

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
code named Project Cognac

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
within the Snapchat walls

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
externally developed games

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
that will work inside the Snapchat app

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
they are saying that it will be similar to like

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Facebook's games in the messenger

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
which I think I've talked about and then

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
never played in messenger

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
on the phone like I know it's a thing I did the

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Pacman thing like once that's it

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
but supposedly Snapchat would be something like that

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
it'd be like an instant game so I guess you could

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
like play it against friends it may also involve

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
streaming of eSports events

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
you know around the world which you know that's

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
a little more like that is one part of

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Snapchat that's interesting that I don't think

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
I think Instagram

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
does this but it's harder but on

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Snapchat there's like a big map of the world

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
and if somebody's made their story public

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
you can watch public stories

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
so you can go to places of interest like

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
museums and stuff and see

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
people in real time like submitting Snaps

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
from these places of interest and I think that's

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
one of the cooler features of it

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
but anyway they want to put gaming into it

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
so because Snap has been

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
struggling to increase their user growth

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
probably because Instagram

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
is offering a very similar thing but Instagram

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
is also owned by Facebook

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
which is a whole other thing so anyway

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
it should be noted that Snap had recently

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
acquired an Australian gaming company

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
called Pretty Great

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
and also a web based startup

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
called Play Canvas

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
so they think the unveil

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
could be around April 4th

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
which is when Snap has a

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
developer conference scheduled in Los Angeles

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
but it's certainly possible that

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
something could come up around

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
GDC as well but it seems like

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Snap may decide to

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
keep that for their own conference

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
that they are having on

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
April 4th so there it is

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
with that

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
that is the last scheduled story we have for tonight

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
so I think we're going to go to some listener

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
calls and participation

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
if you want to ask us a question in chat over

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
twitch.tv slash vog network you sure can

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
but we also want to talk

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
to some of our listeners and take some calls

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
and then we'll get last minute stories as well

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
so I see a call sitting on the

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
line and they've mentioned what they want to talk about

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
and this sounds like a topic I would like to hear

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
about so let's get to it. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Hey this is Marcus

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
or PixelPakas

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
it's so great to hear from you

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
we see you all the time in chat but not

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
as often on the phone it's great to hear from you

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
what's on your mind tonight PixelPakas?

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Not much

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
I just sort of wanted to talk about this event

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
I went to this weekend

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
called Arcade Expo

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
and it is

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
a convention or whatever basically

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
where they have

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
over 1000

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
pinball machines

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
and arcade machines

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
it's one of these type of things

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
like we have it like California Extreme

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
and I know Bobby

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
really loves the Southern Fried Game Room Expo

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
they do in Atlanta. Where is this expo?

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
So

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
it's in Southern California

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
kind of in the middle of nowhere

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
if you know where Banning is

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
I do because I saw an

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
ad for this on Facebook because I was looking

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
into going to it but I didn't

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
because I had a conflict on Friday night

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
yeah so

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
it's there where there's basically nothing else

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
except for I guess

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
this is actually a

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
museum of pinball where they hosted it

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
which I had never heard of before either

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
at least that one I know there's one in like Vegas

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
but I think they're totally separate

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
either way it was like

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
tons of

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
games

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
open for hours you know from like

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
11 to 2 AM

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
and it was just kind of

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
awesome how much

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
there was and

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
it actually wasn't super crowded basically

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
if you wanted to play a game you wouldn't have to wait

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
in a long line for the most part except for like a

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
couple new pinball machines like were super

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
crowded everything else is

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
you'd be able to either just walk up and stop playing

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
or you would just wait for one person to

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
like finish their game and then you could jump in

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
so

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
it was really great

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
they had a bunch of other stuff you know

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
it wasn't just the

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
pinball and arcade machines they had

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
some panels

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
some like movies that they were

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
showing you know all gaming related

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
chiptune artists were there as

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
well playing music at night

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
they had some arcade machines outside

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
so you could play like Under the Stars

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
or whatever lots of food

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
themed food

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
they had tater tots shaped like

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
tetrominoes

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
so it was

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
just a really cool fun event

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
that I had never heard of before

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
until like this week and

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
decided to go to it

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
well that sounds like a lot of fun

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
it definitely sounds just very similar to

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
the California Extreme event that happens

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
up here Santa Clara

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
right? It was at the same hotel where

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
GamerX4 was at right?

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
right next to the convention center near the stadium

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
I think that Hyatt is where they have it

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
and yeah it's a very

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
similar thing except I thought the gaming

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
out Under the Stars that's unique that sounds

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
really cool

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
now I know like when I go to these types of events

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I'm like oh my gosh I've never got to play this

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
before and now I did and that's awesome

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
like was there a game that you like had

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
never played before that you got to play at this event

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
that made you excited?

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
yeah so probably

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
the most interesting thing was

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
that I got to play Computer Space

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
which is one of like the oldest

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
arcade games

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
right?

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
and I had seen that

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
online the pictures of that like

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
crazy looking cabinet and stuff

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
but I'd never had the opportunity to actually put my hands

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
on it and play it so that was really cool

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
and then there was just a bunch of like

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
old pinball machines

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
I've never played anything

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
particularly old in the pinball

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
scene so this is like

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
the stuff where they don't have

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
all the fancy audio and graphics

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
going on it was just sort of like

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
a board with some lights and then they just

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
have like dinging bell noises when you hit stuff

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
yeah with the scores

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
on the wheels instead of an LED

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
display yeah old school

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
like 60's style you know we own one like that

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Spanish eyes oh I didn't know you owned one

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
we loaned it out to somebody but

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
when I was at the Vegas Hall of Fame and I didn't

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
include this in the video last week but there was like a little like

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
ice skaters table that was kind of cute

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
that was like that

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
remember the Buggles?

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
based off the Beatles?

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
really? no I don't remember that one

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
that's one of those 60's ones

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
like if you go to these pinball halls of fame

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
and there's another one

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
I think you can see one in Alameda

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
that I've yet to go to and I really need to

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
I think Dark Soccer and I need to do a road trip out there someday

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
and

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
yeah it's always neat because usually

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
there'll be like one row for tables

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
from the 60's and 70's that are these like

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
old older styles and they're really neat

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
yeah

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
there was a whole bunch of the older style ones

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
and no one was really on them so

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
it was like me and

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
a bunch of them just like ringing

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
bell noise you know constantly

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
in this corner of the hall but it was fun

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
I really enjoyed

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
the whole thing apparently

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
they do other events at

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
this Museum of Pinball

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
so even if you missed it on this one

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
there's going to be something else later this year I think

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
where they have another sort of similar event

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
so I would definitely recommend it to anyone

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
who's anywhere

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
near to Southern California

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
it was a blabber

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
if there's something that you think would interest us

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
here at O.R. you know my Twitter and all that

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
because I mean we're far but we're not

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
that far so like

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
you know for an event like that if I had not

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
already been committed to hosting an event on Friday

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
night which I was I

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
would have seriously considered coming down for that

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
because I saw the ads on Facebook and I

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
looked into it and I was like oh this just sounds like

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
California Extreme but it's in LA

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
ish I know it's like out there but

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
you know us in Northern California

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
we call everything like past

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
the grapevine is LA

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
so

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
so it sounded

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
it sounded really neat I would have gone

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
yeah it's definitely worth it

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
so I just wanted to sort of share that with anyone

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
I was considering

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
doing one of those listener

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
video things but then I was like

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
tired and slept too late so I didn't do it

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
alright that's okay next time next time

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
but yeah I mean a lot

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
of big cities or metro

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
areas have an event like

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
this and you know the size of it

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
probably depends on the size of where you are I just

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
mentioned a moment ago you know Bobby has

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
worked a lot with one in the Atlanta area the Southern

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Friday game room gaming I always say

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
game room they changed the name gaming

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
so Southern Friday gaming expo

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
and actually vog network

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
sponsors that and if I am not mistaking

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
we'll be doing so again this year

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
so and I know he's a big

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
proponent of that and I would love to go if I didn't already

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
do one like week long trip

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
to Atlanta every year I'd love

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
to go to that event it sounds like a lot of fun but

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
a lot of areas I'm sure there's one in

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
the New York area I'm sure there's one

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
in Chicago somewhere

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
I mean all the big cities have to have something like

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
this I'm sure

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
yeah but that's all I just wanted to let

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
everyone know so thanks for taking my call

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
I appreciate it thanks so much and please

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
keep us in the loop of anything else that space

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
might be doing that we should be interested in

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
for sure alright take care buddy

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
I just had a

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
follow up call to

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
um let's also

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
stay wild and listen

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
uh sure

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry if I'm sounding slow

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
or look confused your audio

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
sounds distant tonight I don't know what

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
is weird but try to get your

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
question or comment out we'll do our best

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
um

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
well if you remember last week

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I called in about

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
possibly buying Diablo

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I do

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
remember that yes because we had

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
spotlighted that in the little break segment

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
last week so what happened

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
I well

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
two two things I well I

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
bought it on Thursday

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
this is something I

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
rarely ever say

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
I if a I paid

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
full price

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
which is not

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
full price really for when the

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
game first came out but sure

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
well full price is

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
opposed to what they normally charge

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
you know I charge for the game

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
on the platform

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
which is rarely for me because

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
I usually 99.9%

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
of the time I wait

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
for sales so

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
me paying full price is like

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
extremely

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
okay yes and I do remember we were talking

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
about this and I said you know weigh the pros and the cons

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
and blah blah blah so you jumped in

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
and so uh the question

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I would have is was it was it

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
worth it though

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
yes you know let's put it this way I've been

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
playing it more than Magic the Galar

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
so

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
I know whoa

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
are you never even

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
my fellow

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
you're not like a secretly a clone are you

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
you know that's something

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
uh

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
that's something I always never

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
say I mean you know I think

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
from like breaks

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
to take care of like IRL

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
stuff I've been playing that

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
constantly so for me

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
you know there's a little bit of a difference

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
between you know the PC

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
version versus uh

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
the PS1 version

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
that I remember from way

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
back in the day

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
you know I'm

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
I'm loving it you know

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
so

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
one thing I would recommend is

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
that you know for

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
people that

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
the game back in the

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
day you know be it the

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
PC version or the PlayStation

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
1 version

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
it's you know it's

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
available again and it works

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
on modern machines

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
are definitely worth recommending

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
idiots you know granted yeah

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
it's you know

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
like the 20 plus year old game and

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
it's not like the latest greatest game

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
it's now

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
you know high risk graphics

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
or anything like that but still it's

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
fun to sell a game it's

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
definitely well worth the price point

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
you know you can't go wrong

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
god

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
you know so

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
well I mean you're cutting out a little bit so I

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
want to jump in just because uh it's it's a

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
little hard to um understand and some folks

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
in chat are confirming it's not just me

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
but it sounds like you know you are

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
uh rediscovering this I still

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
I'm still a little puzzled as to why

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Blizzard didn't just do it through their own

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
app it seems like a really weird missed

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
opportunity but um okay

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
I mean uh maybe this

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
will convince them to make Diablo 4 a little

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
faster uh as opposed to a

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
Diablo uh mobile phone experience

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
which would be just lovely if they would

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
uh get on that so

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
alright well um uh

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
Metal Mayhem I'm gonna let you go uh just because

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
we're having a little hard time understanding you but thank you so much for the call

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
take care and uh have fun gaming

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
alright

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
uh don't see anybody else in the green

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
room right now so let me

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
see if we have any other

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
uh

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
stories last minute stories yeah to make our show roll

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
but uh No Man's Sky beyond

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
oh my god how did I not get this in show roll

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
yes this is kind of a big deal they announced

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
um so basically it's the next

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
free update that's gonna be coming to No Man's

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Sky and it's gonna have a ton of stuff

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
to it it looks like they're kind of turning

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
it into a No Man's Sky

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
MMO type of thing

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
um so

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
yeah they basically said we

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
don't consider No Man's Sky to be an MMO

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
it won't require a subscription it won't contain

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
microtransactions and will be free

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
to all existing players

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
um but yeah it's definitely

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
teased and it's a new big significant

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
update that they're gonna be doing

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
and it's gonna be coming out uh around the summer

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
so

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
um it's part of

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
uh yeah and that's just apparently

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
one part of um

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
I guess beyond which is gonna be

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
three different updates

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
so

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
looks pretty cool

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
it's pretty amazing that they're

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
still continuing to support that game as strong

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
as they are especially after such

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
a backlash that that game had they kind of

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
stayed committed to the game that they envisioned

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
putting out and you know I

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
think many folks have been happy with the more

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
recent you know uh changes that were

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
done I know I did some streams a while back

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
as did Bobby uh when the the last

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
No Man's Sky Next or whatever they called

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
that uh the first time it was out came out and you

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
know I think a lot of people were kind of happy with that game

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
and where that's at but to hear that they're going

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
even further is is

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
is so cool I love it

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
looks pretty cool yeah I'll be curious to see how that

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
works as an MMO though I'm not I'm not

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
too sure about it but we'll see we'll see

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
so um

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Kaijuto says yikes

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
I hope the game can be played offline

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
that's all I care about

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
can't it I don't think No Man's

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Sky can be played offline can it be played I

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
well cause you can lose connection to the server and you

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
still keep going so I think the game will

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
try to put itself online cause it's for the database

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
of what all the planets are named and the species and things

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
like that even in the earliest versions of the game

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
you weren't necessarily interacting with other people or whatever

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
but like I think the game will

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
function when offline

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
it just won't download

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
the database of what everything is

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
named and so forth and you may have

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
conflicts with names and all okay

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Kaijuto says yes you can play offline I do it all the time

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
I don't know why they would suddenly shut that off then

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
yeah I don't see why

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
and then there's a new game coming out from

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Avalanche uh Generation

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Zero which is like a survival game

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
a co-op survival game it's

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
um similar to I guess a little bit

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
like um Horizon Zero Dawn

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
but you're

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
it takes place in the 80's

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
and you're like these kids that come back from vacation

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
and everybody's gone and there's

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
these like robots hunting people down

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
and it's about you surviving

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
so they said you can play the game single player

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
but it's going to be incredibly hard because it's

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
scaled for you know four player co-op but

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
um it looked interesting

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
uh very similar like the

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
robots you kind of go against look

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
very similar to like Horizon Zero Dawn

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
um but different

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
obviously and that's coming

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
out on the 26th as

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
part of an early access thing

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
I think it's only on PC though

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
doesn't say if it's console but

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
and then finally

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
uh Paxis is right around the corner

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
oh gosh and

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
with Paxis I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened already

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
I thought it was in February when I went

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
no March 28th

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
no the snow was going really late in the year

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
the year I went yeah March 28th

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
in Boston and Gearbox

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
already has a nice little teaser on

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
their official Twitter

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
showing it says March 28th Boston

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
in Massachusetts it's

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
fucking Borderlands 3 or it's

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
another Borderlands thing because it's

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
it's what it looks like somebody pointed out

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
it's Exit 3 on the little

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
teaser image so it's uh yeah

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
it's Borderlands 3 which

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
is anyone surprised that Gearbox is

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
I'm not surprised and I'm excited

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
excellent so alright

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
well I don't see any other um calls in our

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
green room waiting to go um I don't know

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
if you had anything else last minute to bring up Dark

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Saga but no

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
alright then I think we might be at the point

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
we're ready to wrap it up so um

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000

everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap this

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
up for the night uh Loki your final thought we'll

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
start with you my final thought is I'm

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
gonna keep working on

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
game development it's

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
really hard but finally

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
I don't know I'm just

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
I'm trying to stick with something

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
uh my final thought

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
is I wanna keep going with this routine

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
that I've set for myself but I also

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
wanna make sure I get in some gaming time

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
um this week cause I haven't

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
really been playing enough single player games

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
uh so I'll try to work on that this week

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
last but certainly not least dark soccer

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
your final thought I want a nap

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
I'll just go to bed

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
except reasons

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
you should come over and play DDR

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
I I would be happy to

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
I need to I need to work that out I really

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
know what I was talking about but now especially now

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
the weather is less shitty and before it gets too hot

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
yes we need to make that happen yes absolutely

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
okay well that's it

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
I feel like I'm about to
