00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week, Microsoft may be starting their diskless transition either because of or in order to boost the popularity of Game Pass. Optical Media's death knell beckons.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one rumor in a night of gaming news. Stay tuned on this Marchio evening for the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.000 --> 00:50.000
Live tonight with episode number 767 for this March the 10th of 2019 or Mar 10 Mario with what is actually take 2 of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
So for those that are watching live, yes you are living a little deja vu right now.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Thanks Thor.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Anyway, I'll explain that in a moment. Welcome back DarkSakura Jamie Summers.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yo.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
How are you doing?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Orange C.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes, hey look and she's on the camera a little bit.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
A little bit.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
She's at an angle where she can kind of choose.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Now I'm Dr. Claw.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, she can kind of choose.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I can pinch heads.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
When she wants to be on cam or not.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Your head's harder to get now.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Is your mic on? Because I can't even see the chat.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I had it on.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, it's weird. I don't know.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Fuck you Mike.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Hey, my name's Mike and I don't like your attitude.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
No, I'm just kidding.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I can't see chat right now.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
So here's what's going on.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Also joining us.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I will look at the chat.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Techmaster Loki.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm here as well.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Surprise.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Things are a little crazy tonight because we just got through about 5 minutes of show

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
and then a power surge took out the show completely.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Which, you know, have been there done that right?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Gosh, Rob, won't you get your stupid...

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
God, the back of my head's all messed up.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
What do you call the thing they keep telling me to buy?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
It's the UPS.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
The UPS.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
God, Rob, when are you going to get your UPS?

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I don't think a UPS would have stopped that whole thing because we have too much stuff

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
wired up.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
It's on two separate outlets.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
So yeah, I don't even think that would have saved us.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
But here we are back for take two of our show this evening.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
So I was talking to Dark Sakura about welcoming her back after I know she's been on a bit

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
of a hiatus and we've had a special show here and there.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
But it's nice to have you back in studio with us.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
What did we miss while you were gone?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Bullshit.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Fair enough.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Fair enough.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
We had a death in the family last week.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
We were all thinking of you guys last week as well.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Thank you.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I would prefer being thought of in the form of money or donuts.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Fair enough.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
But not pheromone.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
I really was just doing a lot of work and now my schedule has changed.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I work four tens now.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
So I get three days off a week.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Nice.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
I get off my lunch in time to go to the cafeteria at work where they serve really good food

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
and seven dollar pizza.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
I actually in that last few months I've dropped about 10 pounds.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Congrats.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
So thank you.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
I the schedule changed because I got the position at work I wanted.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
So yay.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
And I'm sorry we have some chat ception here.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
So let me let me set the stage real quick too because what I was talking about before

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
we got zapped the first time was that I was mentioning for the folks that do watch live

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
on Twitch or if you are watching in the archives because you're a subscriber over at VOG Network

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
after the Bobby Blackwell show at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
You can subscribe and get the video on demand or of course the podcast which is what this

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
is all is anyway is going to be free like it always has been for the past 15 plus years

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
we're doing it.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
But if you are watching the video you're going to notice the angle is very different tonight

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
because we wanted to be able to work dark soccer in but in a way where she can be on

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
camera when she feels like I'm still a little camera shy.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah that's fair.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
But I do like the idea you were talking about about using wigs and your hair looks fantastic

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
tonight.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Well thank you.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
This is yeah this is my new dye job.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yes.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Why did no one tell me the back of my head was messy.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
But it is flamingo on the roots and orange and peach.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
All right.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Fair enough.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
It was expensive.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
All right.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Well look.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I got to look good for Dracon.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Our show got cut so abruptly the first time that I didn't even get to introduce in studio

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
here.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
And you can't even see it.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
But why are we all playing up to the video.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It's a podcast.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
We're playing up to the video.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
This is makes good for good weather podcasting.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Oh we're weather.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Oh is that a weather map you're trying to show.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I was just trying to.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You can't see it because video.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah it doesn't work well.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
But as you see there's a giant red thing.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I see.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
There's one of those big red cells that's right over the neighborhood right now.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
That's fantastic.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It looks like a little.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Why does this always happen Sunday night at six o'clock.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Just in time for.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh and for the record I have coffee.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
OK.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
My of my own.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I also want to introduce.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
She's not on camera because she's camera shy and we respect that people don't have to be

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
on camera if they don't want to be.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
But it's always a pleasure to have her in studio.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
It's been a long time since we've seen you misty.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Oh L.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Are joining us tonight all the way from St. Louis Missouri.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And yes I would have called last week to warn you all myself.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
But considering things were going weird with the weather then it was threatening to snow.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
I decided to just pull an all nighter at the airport before I flew out into ultimately San Diego.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Well it's a pleasure to have you here.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Even if the travel plans were a little you know on the fly.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
But even though Misty isn't on camera I did notice she put her little mascot on camera for us all to see with her with her travel transit card.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
So it's a little hard to see on camera.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
But for those of you that are watching on Twitch you can see a little piece of Misty on the camera.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
So Misty it is fantastic to have you here.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
You've been listening to all our long time right.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yep.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
What was your first episode?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
If I'm remembering accurately 91.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
91 ok so you've been listening a very long time.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Probably the only person listening longer than you is Dartitsuya.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Maybe a couple other people in chat.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
What do you think about and I'm not to put you on the spot or anything.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
But what do you think about this whole move to Twitch that we did recently.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Are you kind of are you into it or you think you think it wasn't a good move for us or what.

06:20.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm still evaluating but also I'm kind of also mentally comparing back to the days when I would do Twitch as part of somebody's rock band stream.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Fair enough ok.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Although to be fair some of those times I was having a few drinks.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So that made me give less fucks.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You know Twitch sings is a thing.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
And I have thought about what kind of fundraiser we could do to get Loki to participate with Twitch sings.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
There's no fundraiser.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Well we'll see. Maybe in the future I can talk him into it. We'll see.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
That would probably involve a lot of money.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
So are you still playing stuff like rock band and all that stuff.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Or is that kind of in the past now since those games have kind of faded away.

07:03.000 --> 07:10.000
It depends. There's only really one TV in the house these days and I don't usually have access to it.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
So that cuts my rock band time down dramatically.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
That's fair.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
We'll check in on your other gaming week in a little bit here after we get past our kickoff topic.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
But one other thing I did kind of want to point out with the whole transition to video.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Because you've been to this show before when we were just like audio you know and all that.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Isn't it weird now how we have to actually like pay attention to a camera.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
And like how we when you were at the shows before we just all be multitasking kind of off in our own world.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
And now it's like oh shoot we can't we can't get away with that illusion anymore now that the camera is on.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Although that is a bonus to me not being on camera.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
That's true. You can multitask all you want. That's fine.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
All right. And hello to our chatters of course over at Twitch TV slash vog network where again I'll say it one more time.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
We do tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show when the weather cooperates.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
But hey we stuck through it. We made it through round two. Knock on wood.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I think that weather cells finally passed though. Not hearing.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah it's weird though because like I was looking at the map it actually is going the opposite direction than normally is.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Normally we come from the coast and kind of goes towards the east.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
But you know yeah yeah it's going the other way. Oh interesting. Yeah so weird.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
OK well hopefully it doesn't come back. We'll see. Anyway I do want to get into our kickoff topic tonight which has to do with the day.

08:21.000 --> 08:30.000
So a lot of people of course are talking about it's Mario Day or Mar 10 March 10th not Mar 10 from Belgium who emails us.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Although he should have a day as well. But this is March 10th or Mario when you write it out.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
And of course because we had the power failure all the questions I had prepared just got taken away.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
So I'm going to have to do this off the cusp. But let's talk a little bit about Mario and I open this up to chat as well.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
First off the question you got to get asked when we talk about Mario. What's your favorite like Mario game.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
What's your favorite experience playing a Mario title.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
My favorite Mario game is probably the first one for Super Mario Brothers. The very first one for Super Mario Brothers.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah because that's kind of what I remember like being introduced to like Nintendo is just playing the original Super Mario Brothers.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah. Although you know when we talk about the original time I know it was around before that but I get it.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah the original Super Mario Brothers not Mario Brothers. Fair enough. Dark soccer. What about you.

09:16.000 --> 09:26.000
I'm going to probably say Super Mario World just because I really for me it's something I love to made it better with different challenges.

09:26.000 --> 09:37.000
And I remember being so excited by the commercials and really it was having that and a link to the past is what made me lean back toward Super Nintendo when my mom put the decision in front of me.

09:37.000 --> 09:48.000
What do we get. An NES or a Genesis. And I did bring up. Can I get a turbo graphics. And she said no. So because of course you did. Of course I did.

09:48.000 --> 09:59.000
I actually ended up though playing so much Super Mario World that and linked to the past that my poor brothers hardly touched the machine. It was mine.

09:59.000 --> 10:09.000
I would actually say my favorite Mario memory was probably Super Mario 2 which I know is a weird one to pick because we all know that was not originally a Mario game it was a different game in Japan.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
It did get released in Japan. Oh Super Mario USA.

10:12.000 --> 10:22.000
Yes. And it's on their virtual not virtual console. The NES switch online library. They actually got that game as Super Mario USA so you can go play it if you have the Japanese client.

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
But I would say doki doki panic was a pain in the ass. Yeah. You know they made some quality like things. And as a kid come on when I first played that game I was probably like 11.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
So like you didn't know this whole history. You know we didn't have back in my day we didn't have the Internet or that stuff. It was what we would read about a magazine.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
So they kind of were pretty good about keeping the secret that this was a completely different game in Japan that they had relabeled. So I didn't know any of that.

10:45.000 --> 10:54.000
So I just I do consider Super Mario to a Mario game and especially because it's certainly part of the canon because we've seen shy guys show up in other games.

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
I feel like kind of Mario 2 now exists in that same canon as like the Yoshi side games which kind of ties into my world to kind of like a lot of that kind of comes from there.

11:03.000 --> 11:18.000
But it was the music and I think it was the how the graphics really looked like I was playing a cartoon. Y'all remember like the ending to Mario 2 the first time you saw it with with him taking a nap with Mario taking a nap and it's like that kind of looked like a cartoon.

11:18.000 --> 11:26.000
You know it was because the graphics were extremely simple but it was it was really stunning at the time I think as a kid. I don't know that was that was what I really remember about it.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
Misty what about you. Do you have a favorite Mario title.

11:31.000 --> 11:48.000
Actually I don't have the game on me but I'm thinking more long lines of Super Mario Land 2 6 golden coins because all the way back when I was like in fifth or sixth grade there were a few people that somehow we got to take our game boys to school with us.

11:48.000 --> 11:56.000
And eventually I ended it was originally some other kids game but I eventually ended up with it I still have it to this day.

11:56.000 --> 12:07.000
You know it's funny because I bet some people would say that's a more obscure Mario pick but like knowing you and like the way that you game you play a lot of portable stuff you because you're a big transit gal.

12:07.000 --> 12:16.000
You like to go on these trips to take the trains to take the light rails you know and go on and rail and stuff which I think is super cool because my dad was a railroad guy until he retired.

12:16.000 --> 12:28.000
So you're kind of doing the consumer side of that I suppose but you can play I remember one time the last time you were here I think we took the train up to Reno and you were playing Pokemon yellow on the way and it's kind of like I can chill out play my game.

12:28.000 --> 12:37.000
Watch the scenery go by you know and do that so it like totally doesn't surprise me to hear that like a portable Mario game ended up being your choice.

12:37.000 --> 12:52.000
So I like that anyway. Let's see going to our chat over at twitch TV slash vog network Tiger class as I remember the ending to Mario to everything that happened was all just a dream it never happened or did it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Is that why we don't have Wharton smash.

12:56.000 --> 13:04.000
Wart for smash. Come on. When are we going to get that anywhere. Any of the characters from what would he do just barf vegetables at you. Hell yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
No he doesn't barf vegetables he barfs gut.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
If we could turn piranha plant into a smash character we can turn anybody into a smash character. Mario 2 had a great soundtrack and I love that.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
That end boss theme when you're fighting war that you know what's funny about that game though this is awesome.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
It's just that the game was a big advert for a television station.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Well originally but originally 11 year old came out of it. Yeah that's true.

13:30.000 --> 13:39.000
That's true. And it's funny is because I really think Nintendo doesn't want that associated with Doki Doki anymore because that's not the game Japan got and probably licensing and things like that you know play into it.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
You know you're probably just never going to see Doki Doki panic again unless ROMs emulation of course ever drive. Yeah.

13:46.000 --> 14:01.000
Which funny enough the ever drive will play the the disk games with no problem but Doki Doki panic is like I think that Mario Mario 2 is a vast improvement over Doki Doki panic.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
Oh it is. It's like the quality of life improvements you know like you don't have to beat it with every character.

14:07.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah exactly. You have you have the size thing you have the ability to run the ability to run makes that game. Yeah for sure.

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
It's annoying to play without it. Yeah I think it's one of those things where like I think a hipster a gamer hipster be like well Doki Doki panic was it's like no it was not a better game.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
It was not. I mean it was it was more challenging. It was niche. Sure it was more challenging. It's a fun like party trick.

14:31.000 --> 14:46.000
But at the end of the day they made improvements and that's what Mario 2 is the design gave us what we have now going to chat for some of the other comments there is some several folks talking about one of the other memorable bosses in that game.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Kaijuto says the bomb mouse should be in smash.

14:50.000 --> 15:01.000
Mouser. That's right Mouser and I think actually. Yeah. Somebody else said that in chat. Yeah see Tabiri said hashtag Mouser for Smash. So yeah I was really cool. I would go for that. Yeah for sure.

15:01.000 --> 15:11.000
Or at the very least Mario maker too. Oh yeah. They still need like not just the Bowser kids but like the Mario bosses would be awesome.

15:11.000 --> 15:22.000
Well OK. I didn't mean for this whole thing to become a Mario 2 discussion but let me ask this question. I think this might be a tougher question. Why Mario as the mascot that stuck around all this time.

15:22.000 --> 15:33.000
You know why is this you know oversized Italian plumber dude. You know why is he the guy that stuck around this whole time.

15:33.000 --> 15:41.000
Because before that the mascots I mean there was really a mascot of like video games Pac-Man I guess. I mean there wasn't a whole lot of there was a there was a.

15:41.000 --> 15:51.000
I mean Pac-Man branding was pretty crazy. There was a Pac-Man cartoon as Pac-Man board game. We Hubert had a lot to plush animals. You know I had a plush Pac-Man when I was a little kid.

15:51.000 --> 15:59.000
I still have a plush ghost monster that I went out of a crane game. Yeah but nobody says happy Pac-Man day. I mean I think I certainly think people look back on Pac-Man remember it fondly.

15:59.000 --> 16:13.000
Pac-Man is a strong brand. Pac-Man got in Smash which is you know cracks me up. But as far as Mario why is Mario stood the test of time. I mean the first Mario game what was was when he was Jumpman and Donkey Kong was what 82.

16:13.000 --> 16:25.000
So we're talking like a long time ago but there was also a lot of Donkey Kong merchandise too. I think what it is is it came out with the generation that started with the NES or at least had more memories of the NES because it was marketed more more.

16:25.000 --> 16:40.000
I mean we started off I'd say with our age we truly started off with like say the Atari 2600. That was our big thing and so when we got crappy arcade games that were out at the same time that's where our brains went to.

16:40.000 --> 16:48.000
But when we were teenagers younger teenagers and new kids coming up and gaming really started taking off again.

16:49.000 --> 17:00.000
That's why I'm smiling because at least if nothing else your hand gestures get picked up by Twitch but it's great. I love it. Don't touch that.

17:00.000 --> 17:09.000
This is a family show. Why is she fingering Pikachu? We are not a family show Rob. We are a dysfunctional family show.

17:09.000 --> 17:24.000
Anyway. Anyway. No I please continue fun and dysfunction. I agree with you generational generational thing. But apart from that too it really came around when Nintendo decided to make Super Mario Brothers a pack in game.

17:24.000 --> 17:37.000
That is what did it. It was among the first of games to be a true pack in because I don't think that hardly any of the other games came in any earlier systems came in with a pack in combat combat for the 27.

17:37.000 --> 17:49.000
It was in a good game. And it didn't like it didn't have a mascot. I didn't have the mass. I didn't have a character. It was just exactly. Yeah. The two tanks bone each other out when I was going around playing on my clique vision.

17:49.000 --> 18:05.000
It was Donkey Kong was what I first thought of with my clique vision or venture. It was the little circle head with the arrow you know which was by the way the best home version Avenger just saying but we had an identifiable character.

18:05.000 --> 18:19.000
Who was in millions of homes that every kid knew that because every kid with the system had it. I'm only gonna but there's one tiny exception technicality.

18:19.000 --> 18:31.000
The Rob the robot system came with Duck Hunt and gyro might not have more. I am saying Mario was not originally a pack in game. You bought it separately. Right. And that was that one that went for all that money to remember.

18:31.000 --> 18:46.000
That's true. Yes. Just a couple weeks ago. But it was when they saw that having a good pack in game for the action series and not everyone got the the what was the Rob series called the the the robot series fucking weird.

18:46.000 --> 19:07.000
It didn't sell as well. Yeah. There's my shoe. But the whole point of it was that we had an identifiable character sent in with all of the systems. It was who everybody's first association with the NES. The majority of people's first association with the NES was also with Mario.

19:07.000 --> 19:34.000
I think you're spot on. I think there's like a generational thing to it. I think like you know like somewhere that bridge kind of between Gen X and millennial and really kind of like both generations I think a little bit like we grew up with Mario because just about 90 percent of the people probably more than that 95 percent of the people that had a Nintendo in their homes had Super Mario Brothers because it was just that quintessential NES game that everybody had to play and had to have you know.

19:34.000 --> 19:50.000
And also don't don't forget to you know it ended up setting a precedent for having a mascot game released with a system. Yes. Interesting. It was interesting to see other systems try to copy that because Sega didn't come out the gate with Sonic. Sonic was not a pack in.

19:51.000 --> 20:10.000
Sega was using trying to use Alex Kidd. Yeah. At first but it's curious that Alex Kidd didn't stick. It's just interesting they didn't use in the same way. Very good comment I think in our chat at Twitch TV VOG Network. Miramews in chat said because Nintendo won't let us forget Mario.

20:10.000 --> 20:31.000
That's a very interesting perspective too is that it's it's not just that Mario might be the first. It's that Nintendo has kind of like never let go of them. Nintendo adopted Mario as the mascot in many ways and and like just about every pack in has involved Mario or every quintessential game has involved Mario up until a little more recently.

20:31.000 --> 20:46.000
I mean the GameCube obviously was kind of an anomaly because Super Mario Sunshine didn't come out till later Luigi. Well the Wii. I guess it's true I guess. Yeah now I'm thinking about it. You know you have Mario 64 you had you had Super Mario World but Nintendo land.

20:46.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah we you and it didn't really do the Mario thing but maybe by that time it wasn't needed. Mario was something that you looked forward to. You knew there would be a Mario game. We have to have our pack in game that's really just tech demos that were packaging as a game.

21:00.000 --> 21:17.000
Well not to get too far off topic though but that was so important as to why the Wii sold as well as it did. Yeah people didn't buy it. I've said this before on the show people didn't buy the Wii for the Wii. People bought the Wii for Wii Tennis and Wii Sports but really it was Wii Tennis. That was the thing that sold millions of those systems.

21:17.000 --> 21:33.000
Who thought tennis would sell twice. Well and in a way I mean to bring it back to the top it's all Pong again for March 10th Super Mario Brothers was the game that really sold the NES to many people. People didn't buy the NES for Hogan's Alley as great as that game was.

21:33.000 --> 21:49.000
Are you trying to tell me that people didn't purchase a switch for one to switch. Are you saying that that is a complete oversight of Nintendo. The Zelda game was a little stronger and people but it had switch in the title.

21:49.000 --> 22:09.000
Okay more comments in chat. VG Realness says I think the big reason why Mario is still around is because Nintendo keeps making Mario relevant and interesting. Changing how his games are played. Mega Man could still be around but Capcom gave up. Sonic is lost because Sega doesn't know what to do with him.

22:09.000 --> 22:29.000
Oh they know what to do with him. They turn him into a movie. Well we'll get to that later in the show. But I think with Sonic. I think. I don't think. I think Sonic is a strong brand. I don't think Sega has really made a mistake with Sonic. I think the only thing that maybe Sega has maybe miscalculated a little bit with Sonic is that Sonic should be in everything. But then again.

22:29.000 --> 22:42.000
Before y'all jump in there. Mario's kind of. Mario plays tennis. Mario has an RPG. Mario kind of. Mario is missing. You know Mario. Sonic's in Smash now so. I guess I guess. So he's made it right.

22:42.000 --> 22:54.000
Cia Tabiri in chat says I think that Mario is partially all about that brand and that basic idea that is universal. It is the stamp of approval as well. Mario is on this. It's going to be a decent game.

22:54.000 --> 23:06.000
Let me ask one more question here and then we'll move on with the rest of our show. Especially since we're getting a late start tonight because of the freak weather and Take Two. But with Mario and all that and branding and everything else.

23:06.000 --> 23:22.000
And talking about maybe Microsoft for a minute. You know we look at the Xbox. Microsoft doesn't have Mario. Microsoft doesn't have anything like Mario. I mean Master Chief. I guess we could debate this a little bit.

23:22.000 --> 23:39.000
It's cheap you. Microsoft Master Chef over Master Chief. Microsoft doesn't have a Mario. Would they be in a better place if they did. And I open that up to our chatters as well. Yes. But the Sony have a Mario.

23:39.000 --> 23:54.000
No. And I suppose that they tried with Sackboy and then that didn't really go anywhere. They tried with Ratchet and Clank. That didn't really go anywhere. Microsoft just has their name. True. And they have their computing background of shitty computers.

23:54.000 --> 24:08.000
They have Clippy. So I guess that's you know if they would just do a Clippy game. It would be over. Yes it would be over. But I actually think that would be kind of fun. Like if somebody were to make like a Clippy game like official Microsoft Clippy game.

24:08.000 --> 24:23.000
And look I'm not I'm not trying to shade Microsoft or say they make that. I will. Will you stop. But I'm just trying to say that you know they don't have that strong brand sense that Nintendo has with Mario or that even that Sega has with Sonic.

24:23.000 --> 24:33.000
But I suppose you're right. Sony doesn't really have one either. But I will say what Sony has. Sony definitely has you think Uncharted. You think God of War. You think Last of Us. They have some strong franchises.

24:33.000 --> 24:47.000
Microsoft has a few of those two for sure. Halo. Forza. All those things are very important certainly. But you know they don't really have that face. I don't know. I know I've just took a moment to check out the app store on my computer here.

24:47.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm looking at Civ 6. Divinity Original Sin. I'm looking at a bunch of games that you know we wouldn't have had over here an age ago I think there's a lot more development going on.

25:00.000 --> 25:08.000
I have Let Go of the Incredibles. I have a bunch of really good stuff on here. You know Borderlands came out. Total War Warhammer.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
Tyreclaw asks what's Activision's mascot. Greed.

25:14.000 --> 25:25.000
DLC packs. SS 200 Matt says Crash Bandicoot and Spyro were Sony's mascot early on. Only difference is that Sony's mascots aren't as iconic as Mario and Sonic.

25:25.000 --> 25:35.000
Lots of people in chat love and the Clippy thing. Bobby in chat says Microsoft originally wanted Blinks to be their Mario. So.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
So anyway.

25:36.000 --> 25:50.000
Potential and I guess as you mentioned the little robots now are kind of Sony's mascot. Yeah but they have the VR game that's supposed to be pretty good but they don't really have anything else that's outside of that.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
But yeah the robots are cool.

25:52.000 --> 26:03.000
You know I think I think at the end of the day I think part of why people love Mario so much I think it does definitely tie into something you were hitting there on Jamie early on is it's that it's that thing the generation grew up with.

26:03.000 --> 26:11.000
It's that thing people remember playing first off and the first thing that they ever kind of you know played. I think that's a big reason why.

26:11.000 --> 26:22.000
And then Nintendo kind of kept reinforcing Mario which is very important too. Like you know and in new and different ways you know Mario Odyssey is very different game than the original Super Mario Brothers and I think that's very important too.

26:22.000 --> 26:32.000
I think with that earlier chat comment that Mega Man was kind of the same thing over and over and they they kind of tried to do new things with Mega Man but like when it didn't sell millions and millions they just gave up.

26:33.000 --> 26:44.000
You know and that's why I think Mega Man as much as a lot of people remember Mega Man fondly it didn't end up being as strong of a brand until maybe you know the recent resurgence with Smash and Mega Man 11 and all that stuff.

26:44.000 --> 26:55.000
So I definitely think the whole like thing that when we were kids has a lot to do with it. You know huge movie at the box office this weekend Captain Marvel.

26:55.000 --> 27:05.000
I haven't seen it yet. That's no shade. I just hardly ever get to the movies but I understand that a lot of 90s nostalgia and Captain Marvel apparently.

27:05.000 --> 27:13.000
And this is the type of thing that people think is really awesome is like I saw Bobby nitpick in some blockbuster scene because he worked as a trailer.

27:13.000 --> 27:24.000
Yeah I was in the trailer whatever. But anyway like just people and not in about I'm just saying that people the music I saw somebody also my my friends list was like oh man I put together this playlist with all this awesome 90s music that was in Captain Marvel and stuff.

27:24.000 --> 27:36.000
I think there's just there's a soft spot a lot of people have for nostalgia and like whereas when we were kids video games was something that adults didn't always understand. We are the adults now.

27:36.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah. So anyway, I'm reminded of that scene in the craft when they get off the bus and she says we are the crazy people anyway.

27:45.000 --> 28:01.000
Let's see going into chat for some other comments here as 200 points out the ferret was O.L. ours mascot. I have the ferret at home. Let's see Tiger Claw chat says Rob I love how much you I love how much you love cats and you will love Captain Marvel.

28:01.000 --> 28:11.000
I'm sure I will. Maybe I'll get to see it eventually. I just I so rarely I'm going to go probably see it after work tomorrow. I'm kind of surprised you hadn't seen it yet because I've been dealing with things.

28:11.000 --> 28:23.000
Well fair enough. Fair enough. But I know you're a big Captain Marvel fan so I'm sure you're excited to see. Although my brain still sometimes you know wants to call her Miss Marvel because back she was Miss Marvel before the new one.

28:23.000 --> 28:37.000
And so I still see like they even made a nod in one of the recent Jessica Jones graphic novels. They made a nod to Miss Marvel's old costume the bathing suit by putting Jessica in it when someone captured her.

28:37.000 --> 28:53.000
It was pretty funny. OK. But yeah but yeah I know that's all I was a Carol Danvers fan back when she was binary and hanging out with the X-Men in space. So I'm I'm super super excited. I just need time.

28:53.000 --> 29:06.000
Sure. I understand. And not too many crowds at work. Well I don't want to get too far off base here with a movie talk. Let's get into more gaming talk by talking about our gaming weeks and how was your gaming week and dark soccer.

29:06.000 --> 29:17.000
We can finally come back to you to start it off. How was your time to get my pictures because I take pictures of everything I play. OK. Because Tuesday Dan's mom canceled out on us so she could have soup.

29:17.000 --> 29:33.000
So we went to the launch party for the Munsters pinball which is pretty freakin sweet. This is a coin up. So what I played that day is I did start off with the Munsters. I played Deadpool pinball. I played a lot of Deadpool pinball.

29:33.000 --> 29:54.000
I played Tron. I played Dig Dug. I played oh that's more beer. I played Ghostbusters which I own one now. We just got it. That's right. I played Street Fighter 2 on a broken one P controller. I played Tetris in the arcade. See I took pictures of everything that's Tetris.

29:55.000 --> 30:09.000
Galaga I played Galaga really well when I'm drunk. So you were having kind of Donkey Kong old school games and pinball night. I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I played more Deadpool. I took a lot of pictures of Deadpool.

30:10.000 --> 30:29.000
And then I've also we did some more Resident Evil 2. I'm borrowing Horizon right now for PS4. So I'll be starting that soon. We also were talking about nabbing Kingdom Hearts 3 but we've still got so much else in the backlog right now.

30:29.000 --> 30:50.000
Just that a lot of pinball and a lot of classic gaming and Dan and I are trying to work out the logistics of if we're going to hook up one of the classic systems to the current TV because of the input lag from the old systems or if we're going to hook up the old systems on the CRT and play in our very stuffed office right now.

30:51.000 --> 31:06.000
For we're thinking about doing like a he plays she plays. Oh you know I'm still going to do cheat to win. I just have to figure out you know how to get everything set up the way I want to in the office because I actually have to have somewhere to sit in the office to play.

31:06.000 --> 31:20.000
And right now the TV is way too low from where my chair is. So we'll see. All right. But I I'm going to actually I've decided that when I do that I'm going to play Eddie Guerrero's entrance music because that was this whole thing cheat to win.

31:21.000 --> 31:35.000
Rest in peace Eddie Guerrero. So there you go. All right. Loki how about you. How was your gaming week. I didn't play a whole ton of stuff this week. I mainly I've been trying to get back in the whole swing of like actually doing programming and stuff.

31:35.000 --> 31:43.000
So that's what I've been mainly doing this week. I did play some stuff yesterday because we went over to John's incredible pizza.

31:43.000 --> 31:54.000
And so I ended up playing mainly I had to drag my kids around and they played stuff but I got to play Dances Revolution supernova. So I did play that a little bit.

31:55.000 --> 32:05.000
And that was fun. But they didn't have all the songs unlocked and that made me sad because there's stuff I wanted to play and there was like a stupid barbers missing and like I know it was on there because it was in the credits where it shows all the songs.

32:05.000 --> 32:21.000
I'm like I see it. It's not here though. And unless there's like some hidden like all songs options but I was selecting it under like you know expert difficulty or whatever because you can select your difficulty in the very beginning before you select your songs.

32:21.000 --> 32:35.000
And it wasn't on there at all. So unless it's just some stupid sorting hidden option crap where I had to find some hidden all music mode or some bullshit it just wasn't unlocked which is weird.

32:36.000 --> 32:49.000
But yeah I played that. All right. That's it. All right. No other guy is dude at a place that I haven't been to the John's Pizza or whatever in years but is it is it anything besides like do they have actual arcade games.

32:49.000 --> 32:58.000
Oh yeah they got tons arcade games actually. They have quite a few arcade games. There's a bunch of big stand up things. They have one of these like tiny rooms where you get the Dodge like lasers.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
You have to crawl through the laser maze type thing. That's kind of cool. My kids wouldn't do it though they don't understand what's going on.

33:04.000 --> 33:14.000
Entrapment. Haven't you ever seen entrapment. Yes. Yeah. Show the kids entrapment. I don't want to show them entrapment but no. So they had that. They've got like they actually had another music game there.

33:15.000 --> 33:30.000
I don't remember what some percussion thing they had there. Then all your big like kind of shooter like cockpit games. So they had the Jurassic Park when they had some transformers game some pirates one.

33:30.000 --> 33:39.000
My kids love the Jurassic Park one. That's like my youngest son's favorite game. We played every place that has it.

33:40.000 --> 33:51.000
And then of course John's incredible pizza for those are not aware because I don't know if they're a nationwide chain but they have they have carnival rides inside of there as well.

33:51.000 --> 34:00.000
So it's arcade games and then they have like inside this one they've got a giant thing called the twister. So it's a giant carnival ride. They have bumper cars a bowling alley places are huge.

34:00.000 --> 34:10.000
This one is the former Sam's Club or something right. I don't know what it used to be but yeah it's it's something but like I remember their pizza not being very good but it was actually pretty good.

34:10.000 --> 34:21.000
Although they do have some pretty exotic like pizza flavors like they had one as a spicy paint a spicy peanut butter pizza. So it's basically all the components of a pepperoni pizza but with peanut butter sauce.

34:22.000 --> 34:31.000
It's tasted like peanut butter when I bit into it but they have like other stuff too that's not so weird. OK. Loki's food to review. Let's go. All right. That's it. All right.

34:31.000 --> 34:41.000
Misty what have you been playing these days. First that pizza sounds like I'll definitely take a pass on it but most especially considered in the past week.

34:41.000 --> 34:53.000
Mostly DDR I. I went to Dave and Busters in L.A. I went to the one in Daly City both of course to play tomorrow. I hope I better wake up early enough to add Roseville to that list.

34:53.000 --> 35:02.000
Nice. And you can tell us how terrible the Dave and Busters in Roseville is because it's so small and they don't have like anything there. It's unfortunate.

35:02.000 --> 35:14.000
What's your favorite a song to play. Sorry we're playing. We're actually doing entrapment in the studio right now as dark soccer crawls around a microphone cord. Sorry.

35:14.000 --> 35:30.000
What's your favorite song to play. And as usual I can't really pick one but some some of my favorites are shut up and dance over. Oh there's one I found recently because I'm on my phone term music player.

35:30.000 --> 35:39.000
I do have a lot of DVR stuff. I've one that caught my attention recently was somehow you found me and it is on a machine so I can play it.

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
Awesome. I'm going into our chat at Twitch TV slash vlog network. I darted to you giving a tip for low QL.

35:45.000 --> 35:56.000
If you keep scrolling down all songs is at the very bottom. Supernova arcade is weird. So used to very bottom of what like the difficulties like I kept pushing down.

35:56.000 --> 36:06.000
That was I guess. OK. I don't remember. That's dumb. OK. If I should put it if I put it on expert it should have all those songs because I'm playing an expert level.

36:06.000 --> 36:16.000
They shouldn't have another. Oh sorry. This is for the people that want to play. I don't know. Whatever. Yes it's weird. It's a very weird machine. All right.

36:16.000 --> 36:24.000
Anyway if Misty's all done with her gaming week I will talk a little bit about mine. So for my gaming week so I was on a trip this week I went to Las Vegas.

36:24.000 --> 36:36.000
So I didn't get to play a lot of games because I was on my way to Las Vegas because I got tickets for my birthday to see the Gwen Stefani resident show which I know this isn't a concert review show but I will say it was very good.

36:36.000 --> 36:47.000
That's the first time I've ever seen a residency show and part of what made that show really good. I mean not just the fact that Gwen's a good performer she's got a lot of great energy and you know she has a rich catalog because of course she did all the no doubt stuff too.

36:47.000 --> 36:56.000
But just the fact that like the stage and the costumes and everything can be tailored because you're doing the same show over and over again you're not having to pack it up and take it somewhere else.

36:56.000 --> 37:08.000
So the stage stuff ends up being very elaborate and it's really cool. Like some of like just the custom way they would shoot stuff for some of her performances were just amazing.

37:08.000 --> 37:19.000
So yeah I had a great time at the show so if you're in the Vegas area I would recommend it or honestly now I'm like I want to go see more residency shows like I can't fucking believe I missed Brittany in this because Gwen's playing at the theater.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
I would love to see Janet but you know who else is going to be there? Christina.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I'd rather see Janet.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah I would love Janet too honestly.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
As long as she's not you know caping for her brother.

37:31.000 --> 37:40.000
Well that's complex yes. But anyway so I had a good time in Vegas. However there is one very important thing I did get to do in Las Vegas.

37:40.000 --> 37:48.000
Finally I've only been there like four or five times and I finally went to and I actually have some b-roll for those of you on Twitch. I went to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
So I actually so I had a very a very similar week to Dark Sakura where I played some pinball and some classic games.

37:54.000 --> 38:03.000
So for those who are listening on the podcast feed we're looking at some of the shots of the Pinball Hall of Fame and you can see this is just a it's a place that's just full of various pinball machines.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
It's kind of like going to California extreme.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I went to their old location before they moved.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Oh did you? I didn't even know they had a second location.

38:11.000 --> 38:18.000
But they have a lot of like old classic games as well and those that are watching on Twitch can see some classic games that are on display as well.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
I thought this figure ice skating game this ice review is really cute.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
See they have the classic tables but they have that mixed in with some newer tables as well including and stuff from the 80s.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
The minute I saw the Elvira party monsters machine I had to play it.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
So I was like oh that was the first machine I played.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
There's someone selling a scared stiff by the way for under a grand I think.

38:38.000 --> 38:44.000
I played this Adams family that has the color replacement monitor which I thought was really cool.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Adams family is like a classic table.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
The term you're looking for is a color DMD.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Thank you. And then they have classic arcade games as well.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
So it wasn't just pinball they had classic arcades stuff as well.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Things like Tron and so forth.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
I figured some folks out there like Brad might appreciate the Doctor Who table so I had to get a picture of that too.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Which also had the DRD color thing.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
DM DMD sorry.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
This was weird too.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
So this was a machine you put in four dollars.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
This has to be from the 50s or 60s.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
And it actually injects all this plastic and makes a mold right in front of you of Donald Duck.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
That is actually made for you right there while you're watching.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
And you can actually pick it up there.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Melody couldn't figure out where the door was and then I had to point at where it was.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
And this machine is so old Donald Duck came out without an eye.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
But it was still pretty cool.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
And it smelled like burnt plastic all in that area.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
So yeah it was kind of neat.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I didn't even know that was a thing they had.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
But I guess this machine you've probably seen this before the Pinball Circus.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Only one of two ever made.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
Because it's like multiple layers on this thing.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Like you have pinballs that go up to a different track and all this other crazy stuff.

39:50.000 --> 40:00.000
Pinball Circus was one of those tables that was released when Bally and Midway were really trying to expand out of the standard pinball.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
That's actually the precursor to what became Pinball 2000.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Ah okay.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Because Pinball 2000 was the one that incorporated video and that.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And this was like right before that era of pinball.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Yeah. So anyway.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
I didn't really get a chance to shoot everything that I played there.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
But I wanted to bring back some footage for you guys.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Because I had a good time at the museum.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
It was kind of like going to a classic game festival.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
But just in the middle of Las Vegas.

40:22.000 --> 40:29.000
So I guess in some ways you can go to the strip to see classic performers doing their residency show.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
And you can go off strip to see classic arcade setups.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
One last thing about that. The original location, the one that I went to, was right across the street from the Liberace Museum.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Oh.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
So I didn't go to the Liberace Museum though. I'm sad.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
This was next door to a place that sold video games.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
And the guy that ran it was really nice.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
He was talking to Melody and I and he actually let us kind of peek in his office.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Because he had a bunch of collectibles that were in there as well.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
And he's trying to sell some games and stuff.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
He had some cabinets in that place as well.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
And the thing that cracked me up the most though was that there was something under construction right next to it.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
Because there was a giant tarp and it had written on it, I assure you were open.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
Just like the movie Clerks. I was dying.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
So that made me happy.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
So yeah. I had a good time.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
So that ended up being pretty much my gaming week.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Because obviously unless we want to talk about slot machines.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Which I don't think we do.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Technically they're video games Konami makes.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
I was going to say if we want to talk about Konami we can talk about slot machines.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Because I played a lot of them.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
And I will say I set a $200 gambling budget for my Vegas trip.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Because that's the rule. You've got to set yourself a budget.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
And I will say I stayed even.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I only ended up $20 under.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Which for a $200 budget isn't bad.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Yeah. And for the entertainment I got.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
So. Anyway.

41:43.000 --> 41:49.000
But still based on the video this does give me another excuse to go back to Vegas.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
Because granted the way my flights worked out I ended up connecting in Vegas.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
But of course I didn't leave McCarran because of that.

41:57.000 --> 42:03.000
But Vegas was where my original partner and shenanigans my grandpa and grandpa would drive us there.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Me and my grandpa and him.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Oh good. Because I was going to say the Pinball Hall of Fame it's not on the strip by any means.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
It's a ways away.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
Oh still this is a more valid excuse thing than go wander the strip in half fields.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah. But we were taking Lyft everywhere.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Just because thanks to. I will say this.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Because Bobby will get a kick out of this. He's listening.

42:23.000 --> 42:29.000
Thanks to all these years of Dragon Con and the VoG suite and the reward points that come with that suite.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
This Vegas hotel was free.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Gotta work some points.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Yeah exactly. Exactly. Not gonna.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
But it's funny that like one year of Dragon Con can pay for two nights in Vegas in reward points.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
So thank you Bobby. You helped with that.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
But I brought back some B-roll for VoG so at least I could say it was a working trip.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
But also going back to the Uber and Lyft thing.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
I don't blame you for doing that. You didn't have me to help you get around.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
That's true. That's true. No we didn't.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
Yeah. We're just you know especially after we've had a little after after mimosas at brunch.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
It's a little harder to navigate the transit system that's for sure.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
All right. Anyway that's enough for our game. We need to get in some gaming news because we're getting a really late start tonight unfortunately.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.000
So we may actually run through some of this news a little faster just because we have lost time because of the power outage at the beginning of the show.

43:16.000 --> 43:24.000
So Bobby's like where's my free nights in Vegas. Bobby you pick the residency show and the days and we'll make it happen.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
And depending on the show I might crash this party too. There you go.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And how is Hell's Kitchen.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
OK. Yes. All right. So you don't just go to Vegas for the shows.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
You go for the food which cannot be bought with reward points and that's where a lot of the budget went.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
So we actually went to at Caesar's Palace Gordon Ramsay has an official Hell's Kitchen restaurant.

43:44.000 --> 43:51.000
And so we actually ate there one night and I had the beef Wellington because you have you have to get something that's like their specialty.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
So you can get lobster risotto which I didn't. Yeah I don't really care for that. Yeah.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
But I got the beef Wellington. Oh my God.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
That is one of the best meals I've had in my entire life. Like really. Seriously. Like you know I paid for it.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
It was an expensive dinner but it was it was worth it.

44:08.000 --> 44:14.000
So Wellington is a bitch to prepare. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why you have to make a puff pastry. You have to. Oh God.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
I want to cook it though. That's why it's a classic. I've made it before and they're delicious. Yeah.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
I also had these scallops but they were like of course they were bacon infused somehow.

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
But yeah I think really good because why not. But I'll tell you this one more one more foodie thing and then we'll get into video game news I promise.

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
The thing that really blew my mind was that you could order like a smoked whiskey or smoked bourbon.

44:35.000 --> 44:43.000
The smoked bourbon. They actually bring it to you in a lantern case with smoke in it that when they open it you could like smell this because the people at the table next to us got it.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
And like even the cocktails were so extra as fuck. I loved it. If there's actually a channel called cocktail chemistry.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
And this guy is amazing. He tells you how to infuse alcohol smoke into alcohol using a whipped cream container.

44:56.000 --> 45:03.000
It's actually well not like a store bought one but like the one like the professional whipped cream things like they have at Starbucks.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
But he talks about how to use this to infuse quick infuse flavors into alcohols.

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
Yeah I will crazy. I will say a lot of people associate Vegas with gambling and shows but you can not forget about the food.

45:15.000 --> 45:24.000
Like if you go to Vegas you need to you need to set the money aside and do some nice and I'm not talking about space and for that we did go to for space but I didn't buy anything sadly.

45:24.000 --> 45:34.000
Okay. I hope I'm saying this name right in our chat J's unknown in our chat says OMG stop. I'm stuck here with cheese balls.

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
Don't feel bad. Cheese balls are rad to OK. I go for some cheese balls.

45:40.000 --> 45:49.000
When I if I do pull Vegas out of my behind pretty soon I'll be doing the buffets and dedicating my money to other shenanigans.

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
All right. Let's get let's go on. We got to get into some news. We got it. Let's get into some of the headlines for the week.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
Loki once you start us off. So E.A. once again is not going to be at E3.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Remember E.A. kind of does their own thing across the street.

46:02.000 --> 46:18.000
Well the difference this year is also not going to have a conference which good riddance because I don't need to see any more of that goddamn FIFA nonsense that they waste all the time with having actual like you know football players they're talking about shit and just dragging it out.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
But instead what they're going to do is kind of like the Nintendo treehouse.

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
They're going to be displaying gameplay through a very extended period of time over the course of a couple of days.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
So that may end up working out better for them anyways.

46:31.000 --> 46:42.000
Are you saying that another video game company has decided there just isn't much point to spending all this money to get a booth at E3 when they can just take their message through the power of the Internet directly to the gamers.

46:42.000 --> 46:49.000
Well they've done that. They've done it before like it been across the street but like yeah they're not they're not going to do their press conference.

46:49.000 --> 46:57.000
They're just going to do the thing over the course of a few days which is fine because then I think that they could I think that they also still like did that last year.

46:57.000 --> 47:03.000
They're just not going to do. I don't know. I don't really know what they have. It's going to be really unique and new.

47:03.000 --> 47:12.000
I mean they pretty much announced the same damn games every year. It's always it's always Battlefield, FIFA, Madden, NHL and NBA Live.

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
There's your lineup. I mean like it's the same fucking games every year.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
So I mean so Bobby of course is ribbing you a little bit in chat like he usually does.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Oh and UFC I'm sorry.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
Saying I don't need to see them talk about the most popular sports game in the world. Nobody cares.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
But you're kind of saying.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
No I'm not talking about the like the game. They could talk about the game all they want. I'm talking about when they take us.

47:33.000 --> 47:41.000
They're like OK here's our press conference but hold on let's stop showing the game. Let's talk to this football player for a good fucking 15 minutes.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
That's what I'm having a problem with.

47:43.000 --> 47:54.000
They could show me the game and all the cool shit that they're done with it but when they stop the whole event to have this one on one interview because people they like you know football games are going to like this interview.

47:54.000 --> 48:01.000
Fuck that. You know what. If I want to watch your interview you put that up on an own separate video on your own channel and I can go watch that shit later on.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
You don't need to interrupt my fucking you know press conference for this shit. That's my problem.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Your press conference.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
I'm watching it's my fucking press conference. They'll put it on the fucking internet if you don't want me to see it.

48:12.000 --> 48:21.000
Oh my God the entitled gamer vibe is so strong right now but I get it. I get it. Like you know I get that maybe they spend a lot of time on game.

48:21.000 --> 48:31.000
I think it's the same with Sony. I gave Sony the same ship for their musical interlude. I didn't need that shit but I think it's that the thing for you if I'm not mistaken is that like OK.

48:31.000 --> 48:40.000
Of course we know a FIFA game is coming. Of course we know it's going to be better graphics better more better soccer more rosters.

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
Yes all that stuff right. It's going to be the definitive version because it's the version that didn't exist a year ago.

48:45.000 --> 48:57.000
We know all that. So you're kind of like since this is a given game do we really have to spend 15 minutes talking to a soccer legend that really has nothing to do with the game itself besides the fact maybe their names on it.

48:57.000 --> 49:09.000
Maybe they're on the box or yes. I kind of I kind of see where you're going with that though. So anyway S.S.U. 100 map says hold up FIFA had a really innovative story mode in a sports game.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
They spent time talking with players to make this story mode.

49:13.000 --> 49:21.000
OK. Then show the story but not the interview. You had had all that extra time instead of doing the interview to show the story mode.

49:21.000 --> 49:36.000
Since it's so innovative and new that they focus so much on it. Ben said no we had a goddamn interview. All right. I've tried to title him a little bit. I have I have very low patience for wasting time.

49:36.000 --> 49:54.000
And I feel when you do like stuff that's wasting time and this could be anything is a lot of it is tied to having celebrities come up and wasting time with the celebrities that have nothing to do with the fucking game or very little to do the fucking and musical interludes and this can be anything from you know instrumental music.

49:54.000 --> 50:08.000
It could be like here's Eminem to come out and do some rap shit for whatever like Call of Duty gamer like I don't remember who was they had like a rap song that was in like the end of black ops or some shit and they had like the guy come out and perform this.

50:08.000 --> 50:20.000
I don't fucking care. That's in the goddamn credits. That's not. I mean stop wasting time. You can you know what you claim in my time or claiming my time. Exactly.

50:21.000 --> 50:33.000
Because like seriously like even like even with Nintendo Direct for example where they haven't allotted like say 30 minutes or so that they're going to be showing off stuff.

50:33.000 --> 50:43.000
It's like oh well we didn't have time to show this very large announcement because we were focused on this stuff when we have EA which maybe doesn't have as many of announcements to make.

50:43.000 --> 50:52.000
It seems like OK well you spent all this time doing this but you could also been talking about like this other indie game that you're publishing or this other thing or this other thing.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
I just think time better spent.

50:55.000 --> 51:02.000
I want to look at the other side of it for a minute here because here's the other Twitter clickbait sensation thing. Is E3 dead.

51:02.000 --> 51:19.000
No because they saw the public paying for it now. So it's just going to transform into some other thing. Is E3 as important as it used to be as far as getting the relationships with your vendors and their relationships with the press.

51:19.000 --> 51:28.000
No it's not as important anymore. Did one of you ladies have a thought. Is E3 dead. I thought I saw. Sorry I was about to jump in there. To be fair I never really gave a shit about E3 to begin with.

51:28.000 --> 51:37.000
That's a strong statement. Why is that. Well just considering I do know this show I put more stock in your guys's opinions.

51:37.000 --> 51:48.000
That's a very sweet thing to say. But are you saying. So let me let me try to translate what you're saying there is that you realize that E3 and this is kind of like I don't want to put words in your mouth so please correct me if I'm wrong.

51:48.000 --> 52:03.000
But I think what you're saying is that you find a very diluted message E3 a very we're sticking to the script a very like press release on a conference floor at E3 and you would rather hear what real people touch in those games.

52:03.000 --> 52:13.000
Looks sounds like looks and sounds like basically. OK. OK. I kind of felt that's where you're going with it because to be fair that's that's where a lot of my frustrations with E3 ended up being as well as that I felt like what's the point of me going.

52:13.000 --> 52:21.000
Nobody goes off script here. No developer wants to talk about anything that's not a very we're not an influencer enough to be all even if they were.

52:21.000 --> 52:31.000
Look at the influencers the people to do all those interviews E3. They don't go off. Oh actually that's one of the things. No offense to the influencers that they had on their on their show.

52:32.000 --> 52:42.000
But I think sometimes influencers aren't necessarily presenters of a large event. You know it's kind of they're not really used to that type of thing.

52:42.000 --> 52:57.000
Like I'll be honest if I was set to present an event like that I would probably be all fucked up and nervous as well. So I mean it's I think that also the feedback that they probably got from some of those press events wasn't exactly positive.

52:57.000 --> 53:07.000
And I think doing something a little bit more intimate where they have you know kind of the gameplay basically the Nintendo Treehouse shit I think is more effective because you got more attention on that stuff.

53:07.000 --> 53:15.000
You can spend more time talking about stuff and hell if you want to do your stupid 15 minute interview by all means you've got two days to do it. So why not.

53:16.000 --> 53:29.000
All right. Let's move on. I would love to spend more time talking about it but we're running long time tonight so let's move on and talk about a sequel of sorts to a very large game on the Nintendo Switch.

53:29.000 --> 53:39.000
This last year Octopath Traveler is getting a brand new segment to the story shall we say. But here's the twist. It's coming out for mobile phones.

53:39.000 --> 53:55.000
That's right. It is an Android and iOS game. So Octopath Traveler Champions of the Continent was announced this week and it will have that same look and feel to it because Octopath Traveler for the switch was probably originally going to be a cell phone game anyway.

53:55.000 --> 54:06.000
So this is kind of back in the wheelhouse where it was probably coming from. But it is important to point out this is not a it's not a port of excuse me Octopath Traveler.

54:06.000 --> 54:16.000
I don't think it's truly a sequel either. I think they're saying it's actually a bit of a prequel. Japanese mobile app stores should be getting this game at some point later in 2019.

54:16.000 --> 54:27.000
You can apply starting this week for access to an early demo. No word on the international release but I don't see how that won't happen considering how well the sales were here.

54:27.000 --> 54:35.000
There's not a lot on the plot but apparently there will be a mode in this game where you can play all eight people at once. That's going to be pretty cool.

54:35.000 --> 54:42.000
So yeah curious to see how that plays out. I think it's supposed to be like a prequel or something that's like taking place in the same universe at the same time.

54:42.000 --> 54:52.000
Kind of like Final Fantasy 15 was started as the 13 versus or whatever that whole type of thing. But yeah it's something else in that I guess realm.

54:52.000 --> 54:59.000
But also should be noted is that the official Twitter account for Octopath Traveler did mention this in a tweet.

54:59.000 --> 55:08.000
For those of you waiting for a new console game we apologize but we'll need more time for production. So in the meantime we hope you'll enjoy this.

55:08.000 --> 55:16.000
Which is the response to smartphone game. So if you want to read between the lines maybe it's the whole the smartphone game is 2019.

55:16.000 --> 55:27.000
Octopath Traveler 2 or whatever they call the sequel will be a 2020 type of release. I guess that's kind of what I'm reading into it is the whole you know this isn't the sequel but it's something to hold you over until the sequel is ready.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
I mean don't you guys have phones?

55:30.000 --> 55:37.000
No no not that same type of announcement. So anyway. All right let's move on.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
Dar Sakura you also have some pretty big news from this week right?

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
I do and people are already shitting one way or another about it.

55:45.000 --> 55:54.000
But Nintendo announced the Labo VR kit for Switch which I'm like looking at it like that looks like virtual boy levels of pain right there.

55:54.000 --> 56:01.000
But it is a neat idea the way they're going to do it. I'd really need to reserve my true judgment for actually seeing it.

56:01.000 --> 56:09.000
But looking at the box having like a camera attachment is kind of neat and all the educational you know things that could go into it.

56:09.000 --> 56:18.000
Of course there's also like a bazooka blaster thing and then looks like a elephant.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
I was like words I can't make words or you can look in a bird's ass.

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
So that's very proctologist the game is going to be pretty amazing.

56:27.000 --> 56:33.000
But there are it's going to go by Nintendo Labo VR kit as two versions which is a full set for 80 bucks.

56:33.000 --> 56:42.000
That's the software goggles and five cardboard designs and a smaller one that has the goggles and the designs.

56:42.000 --> 56:51.000
You can get the blaster rifle one. I mean honestly the camera one would be more interesting to me but it's pretty pretty neat.

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
I mean it could be bigger than it is you know.

56:57.000 --> 57:04.000
But at the same time I don't know if it's going to come off as well in execution as it sounds in theory.

57:04.000 --> 57:10.000
I think it looks neat. I mean they better call that gun though the super scope because I mean it's a goddamn super scope.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
Well you know and I think here's the thing I think we just have to set our expectations appropriately for this VR.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
There is no strap there is no head helmet thing.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
So this is meant to be something you're going to hold up and especially for a child you're going to hold this up short term.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
So whatever experiences are going to be in this VR are going to be meant to be short term.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
And when Bobby was on tonight talking about this topic I kind of compared it to the Viewmaster 3D.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
You remember those things like 70s and 80s maybe because you're too young but you remember.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
They still have Viewmaster.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Oh that's right Viewmaster still is a brand huh.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
It's actually a VR brand now.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
Oh well that doesn't surprise me but you know how that was a very like you look through the thing and you see like a picture you move.

57:46.000 --> 57:54.000
Now obviously I'm not saying literally that but I'm saying like OK like when you saw the 3DS Nintendo might have these little 3D movies.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
These little 3D animations that you could see and experience for a short time and then that was it.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
Like you're not going to see like this does not mean Breath of the Wild VR thanks to Labo.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
That's not what's going to happen.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
I'm sure it'll be fun. They wouldn't make a game if it wasn't fun.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
So I'm sure it'll be fun.

58:10.000 --> 58:21.000
I just think I don't know. I just I wish it could do more because you know the potential for like Nintendo games in a VR environment that were good.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
That would be really amazing but this is not going to be that.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
It's just I don't know.

58:28.000 --> 58:36.000
Well let me let me ask this question because I would be super curious to know about this genuinely because you know Dark Sakura previously on the show you've expressed when it comes to VR.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
There's a lot of you know hesitations and things that you don't like about the VR platform.

58:41.000 --> 58:49.000
But the way Nintendo is approaching this with the more short term thing in mind where it's maybe less like attached to you two.

58:49.000 --> 58:55.000
Does this seem maybe a little more like I could I could try this I could dip my toe in this or you know kind of like no.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
OK so no no.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Not interested.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
OK.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I mean it was a fair question to ask.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
It's a neat idea but I'm not interested in it personally.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
So OK.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
What else.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
What else.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
All right.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
But but for those of us that are cool beans enjoy your headaches.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
All right.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
All right.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Well let's move on.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Loki what else do we have from this week.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Well let's talk a little bit about PlayStation.

59:18.000 --> 59:33.000
So PlayStation had a brand new firmware update six point five that brings remote play to iOS so you can use your iPhones and iPads to be able to play as a second screen kind of like you can on that console.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
The Vita that no one ever talks about anymore.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
To be fair the Vita was our kickoff topic on last week's episode.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
I don't know if you recall.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
I know that's the joke.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Oh OK.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
We pretend.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Whatever.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Anyways.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
So you can actually do that.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The only issue though right now is that they don't really have a way to pair like a PlayStation 4 controller to it.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So you either have to use another brand Bluetooth controller that is compatible with it or the on screen controls.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I've got a chance to actually try this because I don't have an iOS device that can actually do this.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
But you know it's a neat thing that I like how they are supporting more devices.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I hope they support Android soon.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That would be pretty cool.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Although I don't really want to play on my phone but it would be neat just to see more support for that type of stuff.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And then this is kind of cool.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:46.000
So in Asia regions previously you know for us in North America and other regions we use the X button as our select button for mainly everything.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Whereas in Asian regions they use the circle button as their select button.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Well now we can have parity across all regions because you have the ability now to switch that for X to be confirmed and O to be back.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So you can decide to do that if you want.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
That's pretty awesome.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Couldn't you do that before with the accessibility options?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
The accessibility options you can but I think this is just strictly just to have the menu select options as something different.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But yeah you could with this accessibility do that.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Sounds like same feature in new packaging type of thing.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Maybe a little quicker to flip it around.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Yeah or so you don't have to completely like I maybe they have it set up for menus so that like in game it's not all backwards because I've done that before.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Where like my my younger son when he was playing games he had trouble like with the controls like how to drive a car in like Lego games.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So I had to switch his acceleration from the triggers to the X button.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And so that way he could use that easier for him because his hands are really small.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
So that's worked in the past.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But then I like and we played another game later on like what was this all back.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Oh that's right. I switched that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I completely forgot about that.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Yeah so it's nice to have that separate where it's just in menus.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Okay that's fair. I get it now. Cool.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
All right. Well I have to download you know since I'm an iPhone person I'll have to download that and check that out.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Although I just I feel like the only thing I'm going to really be able to do with that is like I'm not going to play games.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You're really going to be able to do nothing with that I think.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Well here's the thing I would think like oh I could watch Twitch on my PS4.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Wait why would I do that? I have a Twitch app on my phone.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Okay I could watch Netflix.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Wait why would I do that? I have a Netflix app on my phone.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
So I'm kind of like well what everything kind of feels redundant.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I guess maybe if there's like a low intensity game that doesn't really use the controllers as much or something maybe there's something to play there.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
But I just I don't. I think realistic.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Tetris Effect. No.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I it depends on that latency.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I think the latency will probably be too bad to do it.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
But you know I guess Tetris Effect would be something you could play.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
But anyway.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Alright let's move on and talk a little bit about some updates for Sonic.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
So Sonic is going to be at South by Southwest.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And if you can't be there the live panel will be streamed.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
So there's going to be a panel on what is it it's the 16th of March.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And there's going to be some guests there on the panel that have to do with Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I do not believe this is about Sonic the movie necessarily.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Although there's a good chance maybe this is when the trailer finally hits.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Is this panel right.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I suppose.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Yeah because they actually have what they have like Takashi Iizuka and folks that are at this.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So I don't I think it's probably about the games the journey of Sonic and everything but not necessarily the movie until maybe the end will probably be like and here's that worldwide debut trailer right here at South by Southwest.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Maybe I don't know.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I'm still holding that hope that it's not crap.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.000
All right. Well speaking of the trailer many people are talking this week and this is more of a visual so I can't really get I mean yes I could put the B roll.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
But where is that beautiful B roll footage.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Remember it is a podcast over the audio folks I don't want to be like look at this.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
But if you do go to Google and the different websites and take a look at you know this this leaked Sonic picture or what have you.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
There's a pretty good idea of what Sonic looks like in the movies at this point.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Or you go to you go to our discord because Tiger Claw has been posting all the latest updates on the Sonic movie there.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Or you imagine a smurf that's taking crack kind of and is running.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
So anyway some of the materials are out there increasingly garbage looks like branded materials.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I don't know. You know what. I just I need to see the trailer.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I just I'm going to reserve judgment until I see an emotion.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's a little bit like this is a departure.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Like imagine like imagine if we had just some of the stills from the Pokemon Detective Pikachu trailer like some of like the more like lick tongue and shit like that.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Everyone would be like oh my God what the fuck have they done to this shit.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You know that's surprisingly a good point from you Loki.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But I have a feeling that we're just going to see this shit in motion and it's just going to be shit anyways.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But Jim Carrey's in it so you'll see it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I am going to see it no matter how garbage it is.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Okay. Jason1 in our chat wants to know what's worse Sonic or the Genie.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Honestly truly the Genie.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
The Genie.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
The Genie.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
It just it doesn't look right.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Easily the Genie.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I don't have a problem with Will Smith as the Genie whatsoever.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Nothing is ever going to be Robin Williams and that's the first thing you got to accept.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
But the way they projected the face it didn't look right.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It's like fucking Scorpion King bad.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Like I mean it's pretty bad.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Like they should have just made him made the Genie just the Genie.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Don't make it fucking Will Smith.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Just make it a Genie that he's voicing the character of.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Why did they make it look like goddamn Will Smith.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
They didn't make the Genie look like Robin Williams.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I mean I don't understand why they couldn't have just made it its unique character and he does the voice.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
What's the problem with that.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Yeah.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Wait wait.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I want to see it in motion until I really make a decision one way or the other.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Alright.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Um.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Let's see.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Let's move on.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I think that's all I want to say about Sonic for now.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Until we have a trailer.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Um.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Let's talk about some classic.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Not the classic of the week but some other classics.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Right Dark Sakura?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Yes.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Well.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
SNK is going to be doing monthly collections of some of their classic arcade soundtracks.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So if you want that old school Neo Geo ear bleeding synthesizer you can have it.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Boy do I.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It will be.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Volume one will be launching in Japan on April 24th for 3200 yen.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
About 28 bucks US.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Um.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It will have.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Actually.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Um.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Each volume of the SNK arcade sound digital collection will be available to preorder from City Connections Clary store.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Um.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I can put a link to that in the chat.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
But.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Um.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I'm trying to see what's going to be on the first series of them.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Okay.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Volume one will have Beast Busters Chopper 1.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Bermuda Triangle and Prehistoric Island 1930.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Which.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Not super popular games but.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I want to say those are some deep cuts.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Like.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Where's Crystalis?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
As a.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
In the chat Quest Buster says Magician Lord.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
That's a good one too.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Right.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Or um.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Fatal Fury.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Fatal Fury had some sweet.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Background music.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Baseball stars.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Yeah.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
So.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Alright.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
But I understand.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
SNK did have a very rich.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Especially in the arcade.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
There's a lot of games that came out.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Like in Japan.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
That maybe there was a couple of machines here.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I want a Last Blade soundtrack.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Yeah.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Something fierce.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I wonder if they will do.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Um.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Like.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
You know.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Capcom's all over Spotify now.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So I wonder if um.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And I assume they're on the.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The Apple platform and.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Yeah.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I've got a bunch of.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Pandora's and all.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
You know.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
The comparable stuff.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Um.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000

Yeah.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:49.960
Just witnessing that section on the right.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.960
Yeah.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Yes

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Mm hmm.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000

Mm hmm.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Mm hmm.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Yes.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Mm hmm.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.000
Uh.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.500
I'm writing the fanfic and yeah right now where you know they're gonna get up there on the stage and be like we have a

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.940
$99 system in store today and a partnership with Nintendo whack like that is well

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:18.780
And they're saying that the the pre-orders are gonna open mid-april is the rumor right now so pre-orders in April for what a June launch

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.780
maybe I

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.620
Just

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:28.160
Man Microsoft made that this this is this is the year where they're gonna go for it

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.760
You know to make up for what happened to them at e3 a few years ago

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:37.440
And if they can put a $99 so when's their next system launching though is my question though is if you're gonna do this

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.920
Then you launch your next system

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:45.620
But haven't haven't they said since the beginning the new system will still or the old system will still play the new systems games

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.440
They've said that from the beginning

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:52.580
It'll just be that it might have a shitty framerate and stuff, but it will play the new system

01:11:52.820 --> 01:12:00.540
Well they also have well if I remember correctly they also supposed to have their Xbox cloud

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.580
Thing that they're gonna be the cloud streaming service that they're supposed to be introducing as well

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:09.500
So maybe that's the way they're gonna get these newer games on these older systems is basically

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:16.080
Running everything in the cloud, and it's gonna. You know kind of like how we do with Assassin's Creed Odyssey and like the switch

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:19.860
Okay, I'm being corrected in chat to be fair that the Xbox one is still

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.220
249

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.740
Detiorama s predicts without the optical drive and the three terabyte drive

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:30.740
I could see it going for 199 you are all making a point that the drive inside

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:35.940
It could be something that you know maybe makes it not able to be $99 cuz there's gonna have to be a pretty beefy

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.300
hard drive in that thing

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:43.660
But maybe 149 is still a pretty sweet price to go for but can I just if they could do it again?

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.180
You know set your expectations that may be like 199

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:50.660
But can you imagine if Microsoft could do it if they could say we've figured out a way to get the cost and we're gonna

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:56.560
Put out for 99 bucks, and if you want to expand the storage you just plug in your own hard drive in the back here

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.860
Maybe that's how they do it

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:03.100
they say it's got a really crappy little hard drive in it you know, but you could just plug in your own into the back and

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.980
You're good to go hard. There's no very expensive nowadays. That's true. That's true. We'll see

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.740
anyway

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:15.340
Other comments in chat here Deidre my ass is convinced. They can't do it for 99 bucks

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:21.020
Yeah, 99 it's a bit that's a bit of a stretch, but I would see like $200 they could do

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.820
I wish it was lower. I mean never obviously lower the better. I think but yeah, whatever

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:29.880
You know if they could I don't know it will be interesting to see what they do

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:35.700
It sure will so we'll see what happens. I mean we were all going off kind of rumors right now, but these are

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.820
We've kind of seen that this is where Microsoft wants to go

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.660
We kind of already saw this with the original Xbox one in some of their direction

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.100
Good deal, I just wish it was on PC

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.660
Jason one says subsidized consoles super low-cost all digital version

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:57.620
Microsoft is pulling a lot of moves to get you into their ecosystem

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:02.620
I would feel safe betting on this being their generation. You know what there's there it is

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.620
I think Jason one just said it. That's how they say $99

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.500
$99 with one-year agreement

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:15.100
Mmm, how about that? How about that? They could they could and then they're still saying

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.420
$99

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.620
You know and that's gonna be a big deal if they can do that, but I've and that could that could be it

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:26.020
It'll be nine out with one year agreement. I know I'm so fixated on this 99 thing

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.980
I won't let it go, but it just it just sounds so good

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.060
It's it is because it's undercutting everybody by a lot

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:35.460
And I think that's just the way to do it because you're looking at like you know late in the week's life

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.900
The Wii was going for 99 late in the cycle any like you're looking at the switch

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:44.500
So I mean like think about your you're talking about buying your switch for your switch or an Xbox and you know for your kids

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:50.220
You're like, okay. Well, you can have this but then you get this full library of games that's included for like 10 bucks a month

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.860
Okay, anyway

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.500
We'll think it's actually been an ongoing trend though with different developers

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:01.340
Like remember the PlayStation the very first models of PlayStation how?

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.380
They would take stuff out and the price would go down they take stuff out the price would go down

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.340
Until the finally we had just the most bare bones of systems and then we had the ps1. Mm-hmm

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.100
It's the same thing and I really do think that

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:19.640
Either 99 or 129 are gonna be the price points. Those tend to be averages

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.860
I don't know why they pick ending in 9 as a number instead of just something even it's like how they sell gas

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.780
It's just that whole that it sounds cheaper

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:34.260
99 cents sounds cheaper than a dollar. Where do you go shopping dollar tree or 99 cent store?

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.460
dollar tree

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.620
Unless I really want obscure me. Oh, she's different unless I want obscure Mexican sodas

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.020
Then I go to or the guava soda

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.860
then I go to 99 second I got weird shit look look I

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:56.980
We I I'm saying it so much that I'm setting an expectation there and I don't want to do that

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.860
I want to give Microsoft a fair shot and see what they can pull but I don't I I

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.180
Just feel like if they if they could just really undercut and I mean on it

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:05.460
But you know

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.780
I've been I've been having this fanfic if you've been listening to all our for any length of time

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:14.140
I have had a Microsoft fanfic her up for a long time that if anybody is gonna do something big and crazy

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.380
I really feel like it's gonna be Microsoft

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:20.780
You know, how long have I been saying Microsoft's gonna be the first one to come out and say, you know

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.860
We've been making you pay for gold for all the player all these years

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:29.100
Not anymore gold is free and that they're gonna shift their payment system to the their things like game pass

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.100
It's gonna be what what carries them. They're not gonna

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.400
It would be amazing. But no, but that has been fanfic

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.420
I've been saying on the show for five years and have you as yet to come true. So it's it's fine

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:45.680
Anyway fanfics are meant to be a fantasy. That's right. You live yours. That's right. I will I'm feeling my fantasy right now

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.860
Ignore the reality Valentina

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.660
Alright red M&Ms only

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.300
Let's move on and talk about a fantasy a lot of feelings

01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.620
Let's talk about a fantasy. A lot of people are feeling right now Tetris 99, right?

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:06.520
It's like who knew that a battle royale game without guns would do so flippin well

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:10.700
But people are going crazy about Tetris 99. I'm actually really sad. I didn't get to do this

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.720
So sadly this event is over now, but I just want to talk about the fact that it happened

01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:16.640
So I was in Vegas the whole time

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.500
I don't know if any of you guys checked it out, but from March 8th through March 10th

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.540
So actually is it still going right now today's yeah, today's the 10th

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:26.060
So actually technically it's still going on for a few hours

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.920
So if you're listening live you can get it in and out you can go into this

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:34.800
Maximus Cup and when you get first place you get Tetris Maximus on the screen the top

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:40.380
999 players with the most Tetris Maximus is will get

01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:44.700
999 gold points that be maxim ease or maximize

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:48.420
It's just Maximus. I don't know anyway, but

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:53.100
999 gold points is basically nine dollars and ninety nine cents. I mean

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.880
Give it I mean because you can't you have like a max number of gold points

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.460
You can apply towards a game, but if you're buying a brand new see star game

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:04.560
You can take ten dollars off essentially. That's what that's what this is doing cool. I know it's me hey

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.620
I just think it's rad that Nintendo is getting into this kind of competition

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:17.140
For like real shit. You know even if it's like okay. It's just gold point. Hey, you know what I used gold points

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:23.100
Last time I bought something digital a free game. You're getting free stuff on top of the free game. It's well

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:28.340
Well, yeah, I know you have to pay asterisk little footnote little footnote. Yeah, you do have to be an online subscriber

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:32.680
But technically there's other games though that you have to pay for and then you have to pay for the service

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:37.120
So it technically is a free game that you have to have the service for but whatever

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.080
Get them have the console too. I mean so technically it's ever free dark Tetsuya

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.500
I kind of hate you for this comment, but I don't isn't that kind of what one versus 100 did

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.500
Yeah

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:54.780
Gave away something for nothing. Yeah, I miss that game. That's the battle royale game. We deserve

01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:01.820
Game room go back. I know I know y'all are making me cry here. Can you imagine if Microsoft came out and said?

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:06.620
$99 yeah, we're bringing game room back. I wonder is this 100

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.620
and Ridge Racer

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:15.860
We're big fans of orange lounge radio here at Microsoft. We're gonna give those fools everything they give them all of the things

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.380
We even know who you are we're granting wishes

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.440
We remember you you had an icon on our service

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.780
You're not nobody's to us

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.140
Yay, somebody cares alright

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:38.020
Let's let's take a trip down memory lane to some classics that we certainly care about

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:40.020
It's the classic game of the week

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:45.940
Every week dark soccer goes into the gaming vault and finds a game ten years or older that she thinks hey

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:50.240
You brats you should be playing this game to put put down your fortnight's

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:57.480
Yeah, fuck night, and you're Tetris now now. They haven't made that game yet, and you're four skins

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:03.980
And pick this up instead yeah, and actually I don't for this week's particular choice

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:07.860
I think you you didn't have to go into the vault you just reach in your pocket right I did all right

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.900
What is the classic game of the week no B no B boy

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.220
Remember how we were all kind of minorly obsessed with this weird shit

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.940
Well you but yes

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.820
Someone else in this room was playing it on the console

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.860
I didn't play it as much as you know we know we know it. No we know we know it. No we know B

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.660
boy for smash

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:30.620
Right in any rate. It's a weird fucking game. Can I just say first?

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:35.180
This is ten years old because I very vividly remember chats about this game on

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.940
Olr because katamari namashi guy made a new game

01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:44.500
He also is working on another game coming out right now, but it's due later this year Chad is having the same reaction right now

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:48.220
This is over ten years old fuck damn. I'm old

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:53.720
Those were all different comments by the way fuck damn. I'm old. I don't know I made all those in one in my head

01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.400
Anyway, so the game no B. No B boy. It's it's a weird one is by Takahashi Keita

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:06.880
It was published by Namco Bandai, and it came out in Japan on February 19th

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.640
2009

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:15.520
That's for ps3 the iOS version came out February 18th 2010 which is when I played the most of

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:21.760
But in the game you play a character named boy who can stretch his body one of the meanings of no B

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.960
Is stretch no B. No B. Also means carefree, so it's kind of a pun

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.700
You know which many many neat games are named after a pun

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.760
So anyway, he's he's kind of a worm character who has four legs

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:43.280
And you use the controller the left analog stick for is the front of boy and the right?

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.600
Analog stick is the back of boy

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.200
and so you move them in opposite directions to try to get boy's body to stretch and

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.240
Then you maneuver boy around his environment and he can eat stuff

01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:00.920
And there's also like barnyard animals and shit hanging around and people and weird things

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:07.400
Is that a person riding on a bear anyway? It's a guy riding unicycle with chicken on his head

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:14.120
anyway, you accumulate points by how much you stretch in the game and you

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.800
Transmit these points online via a character called Sun to know the character called girl and

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360
So basically all

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:32.440
All the cumulative this is everybody playing the game all these points that boy played by everybody transmits to girl

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.640
causes girl to stretch and get new levels and so

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:42.680
You know you start on earth, and then girl will stretch to the moon and Mars and Jupiter etc

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.480
Until she's strings back around to earth and you get other environments that way, too

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.440
Maybe someday we'll get a sequel and she'll simply be known as girl girl

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.320
Girl girl what you been?

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.020
It's like she expanded out into outer space this time anyway

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.200
So they expected

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:12.360
It to take between one to two weeks to reach the moon it took four days

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.560
so

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:23.920
As of December from the week of December 25th to December 31st 2011 they reached Uranus or Uranus

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.360
So basically it took girl a

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:39.400
Full loop around the solar system girl. She's loopy. She got around okay girl

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:44.520
She gets around and so she got she's been around Uranus

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:49.320
She got back to earth on December 14th 2015 so that's a good solid

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:56.280
Six years of play a little bit longer, maybe and then after

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:03.160
2489 days of playing girl reached the Sun and everyone died no

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.200
But that's actually the end of the game that girls on fire

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.240
Step that pussy up on fire

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.840
anyway

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.320
There were also look you pick a weird game like no B. No B. Boy you get a weird segment

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.440
Can't you eat your own ass in this game?

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.880
That makes no B. No B. Boy the Ouroboros

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.880
Anyway

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:39.940
Anyway there were lucky weeks that went on where a random number was chosen and every time the player reported

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.560
Their length, but not their girth

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.360
It was multiplied by that number so the first one was May 11th to May 22nd on

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:55.360
2009 and then there were different ones and he basically Keita would write about lucky week

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.280
Thanks to everyone's effort girl has managed to stretch out a lot

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.520
So long way to go and reaching Mars, but we will see you in June for the time being so he kept going like that

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.120
There was one multiplier that increased to two hundred two million

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.600
15 and

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.040
That finished girl. That was the one that finished girl's journey

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.960
So it is a weird game and basically the announcement of the game started by Takahashi

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.040
Holding out a stretch hose with two pink balls on the end

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:35.720
Remember that though we saw that he said it wasn't a controller, but a visual to help display the game, and then they showed boy

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:42.600
The playable prototype was at game city 2007 international interactive entertainment festival fuck that song

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.720
Where it was delivered as the

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:52.040
festivals vision statement of the year and it had three boys that were interacting with the animals and doing stuff and

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.680
and tangle their boys

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.640
So it was originally developed on Xbox on an Xbox 360 development kit

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:06.680
but was ported to PlayStation 3 and that was because

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.820
Takahashi stated that the symmetrical design of the analog six on the ps3

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:13.380
offered better control

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.220
and then

01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:17.620
It had on April 29 2009

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:25.460
it was updated to include an offline player mode for up to four players where all the boys could play and stretch their things and

01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.820
You know play with each other's boys

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:34.060
But it got pretty good ratings it on Metacritic was 75 out of 100

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.580
and IGN

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:41.020
Stated that the game was unique it could have been played on the ps1 and as of May

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:44.300
2009 it sold about a hundred thousand units and

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:50.220
But Takahashi himself said he was not completely satisfied with the game. What girl?

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:57.460
There also is a website at o dash dash o dot JP

01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:02.580
Which I guess is supposed to be boys body so you can play with boys body online

01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:05.420
You

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.820
Can stretch them out is that it that's it

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:12.420
Thank you, but thank you for that memorable class to give it a wee segment

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.220
They're getting out of the new window your classic game of the week

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.980
No be no be boy

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:22.140
Which I remember being a mobile phone thing cuz I played it mostly on the play most on the phone you would talk about it

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:25.740
Every week on the show be like how is your gaming week? Well? I played nobody boy

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.780
Girl girls gone around

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:34.500
Pluto yeah, so good pick. I can't believe that game is over ten years old. It's crazy. Yeah, I mean

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:42.460
It just is such a crazy little freaky game, but technically they reached endgame, so good job girl. Good job boy

01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.380
All right

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:50.740
Nobody nobody boy is your classic game of the week girls got goals. She's going places, and you know what?

01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:57.620
The boy is the support character. It's really the girl story. Where's she going all right for our next story?

01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:00.380
We're gonna go to this pre-recorded segment from earlier today

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.580
Okay hello from a streaming studio, and this is pretty cool

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:11.540
We're taking a look tonight at Diablo not Diablo 3 or unfortunately not a new Diablo

01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:16.820
But the old-school Diablo this is actually Diablo 1 in all its glorious

01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:19.140
You're kind of limited to moving in eight directions

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:22.660
The graphics are a little bit subpar glory

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:27.420
But you know this game is what well over what like 20 years old at this point

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:33.840
And it just the reason why it's in the news this week is because it just recently was released on GOG or good old games

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:36.340
not through battle net

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:40.680
Activision Blizzard's own client, but actually released with a partnership with

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.040
GOG or you know I still call them good old games even though

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.460
I think everybody is supposed to be calling them GOG.com at this point, but anyway

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:55.340
It's just the way I remember with the giant subtitles when you talk to people and everything

01:28:55.340 --> 01:29:01.540
Let me see if I can make my way over to the church. I'm playing a sorcerer here, which of course I named mr.

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.540
Smoosh after

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.900
My cat I

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:11.100
Think the church is up here in the corner. It's interesting because you don't even have a map in the town

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.000
When you go back and play an old game like this you really realize the types of quality of life

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:21.900
Improvements that you've got oh yeah, something's going on here. This isn't good. They got a wounded guy there listen to me

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:28.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we gotta go kill things come on, so let's see if I can get down here into the dungeon

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:30.700
Oh my gosh

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.920
Have problems just moving around

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.120
Here's the chest this is what Diablo used to be

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:47.420
Before the game that probably more people know about now there we go killing some of the skeletons here anyway

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:54.900
So yeah, I guess there's some type of partnership now between Blizzard and good old games in fact

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:59.760
There was a press release that came out where the vice president of executive producer over at Blizzard Rob

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.680
Bridenbecker said that you know they were bummed that these games weren't available for their players

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.280
So they've kind of worked out a partnership to make them possible

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.640
You actually have to click to collect the gold in the old Diablo games

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.280
So you notice I'm just kind of killing some mobs here using my staff although

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.360
I think if I remember right it wasn't left. Oh, no you can right-click, okay?

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.440
I thought you always had to push s to actually cast the spell

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:32.560
But that'll do that I can set these other guys on fire, but anyway the game is gonna run

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.640
Yeah, $9.99 if you decide to pick it up on good old games

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:44.760
No word yet on like when other old Blizzard games may come out if any I think they have talked about

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:50.960
Warcraft orcs and humans and Warcraft 2 also coming to the service. That would be kind of neat if that happened

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:56.800
I would imagine Warcraft 3 probably not gonna happen anytime soon because they have that remaster coming out

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.800
How do I get in this room there we go?

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.360
Boy these guys are like taking away my health

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.680
There we go, maybe a new new item here

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.640
That yeah

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.320
When you see the original Diablo like this you see just how different this is

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.840
Versus when they did that event in Diablo 3 that just kind of put like an old-school skin on

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:27.040
Diablo 3 and it just it just plays Diablo 3, but this is definitely the old-school experience and oh

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.680
No, I died I forgot how weak this guy is

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:37.280
So that's it cuz you're in hardcore mode when you play in the original Diablo. So now I have to

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.960
Let's see. I guess that's it. I gotta start a new game

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:45.160
All right. Well, maybe I could go back to the hero. I was on I

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:50.520
Gotta cast more of my spells or I'm gonna die more often. I guess yikes. That wasn't good

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.440
Does that make me not a real gamer since I died in the dungeon?

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.160
Is that like dying in the tutorial level and cuphead? I don't know

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:01.720
I guess I'm just too used to all the conveniences that come with Diablo 3 including a

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.840
Little bit of an easier difficulty and the fact that you know

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:10.680
If you play a wizard, you probably shouldn't be up there in the fray. I really should be standing back and casting spells. I

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:17.680
Also kind of wonder if my loot is gonna be where I died there previously if I can like oh no

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.780
Oh, no, it was rearranged

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.240
Those good old random dungeons

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:28.860
Do let's see I gotta I gotta actually pick my spell again. There we go

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:39.220
Yeah this time there we go now I can kill these guys from a distance and it's gonna work a little better

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.900
So when you first launched the game in the

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.840
GOG launcher or whatever you

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:53.280
It's called you actually get a little pop-up window that allows you to pick between two different versions of Diablo

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.560
You can get the original with the old school graphics

01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:02.540
Like what was it like 320 pixel resolution like it's it's really old and scaled back

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.660
But I believe that's the version it'll actually still work with battle net if you

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:13.320
You know want to be able to play with friends and all that stuff or you can do the souped up version of the game

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.520
Oh, I ran out of mana

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.520
You could do the souped up version of the game

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:21.000
Which is what I'm playing now that allows you to play up to like 4k resolution

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:27.820
Which is kind of it again, they didn't go back and oh god, I called out too many mobs. I'm gonna get killed again

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:36.680
Trying to talk and concentrate on the game it's very difficult. Anyway, there we go now I'm frying some of these guys from a distance

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.640
But you can still do land mode even with the

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.680
Souped up graphics. Oh, I'm out of mana. I'm gonna have to get it. Oh, no. Oh, no

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.380
Wow, look at that I died twice

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.920
I'm really good at this old-school Diablo

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.360
well

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.560
There you have it a look at the original Diablo if you want to go back to like, you know

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.640
when Diablo was

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:07.840
Probably like Dark Souls hard or at least maybe I shouldn't be trying to play a wizard if I want to get up there and close

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.220
In combat, maybe I need to partner up with somebody through land mode actually play with somebody else

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.040
To help getting through the dungeon a little bit easier

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.000
But if you want to go back and play this game when it's a you know

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.040
A little more difficult you can do that now thanks to the partnership between Blizzard and good old games. And again, it's good cost

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.760
$9.99 and

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.200
Warcraft and Warcraft 2 likely on the way soon, except we don't know when so

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:37.880
Look forward to me being really bad at those games too in the very new future. Anyway for now back to the studio

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.760
Alright so yeah, I almost didn't want to air that because of how bad

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:50.320
I did playing Diablo, but you know, it's funny. That wasn't even the first take that was because the very first I was like

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.440
Oh, I'm just gonna jump into a blind, you know, cuz you can just kind of pick up Diablo 3 and go

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.720
So I'm just gonna jump into this Diablo 1 bride blind and see what I can remember you bringing mr

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:04.440
Smoosh on for a cameo the twitch people are gonna love that. Although I don't know if smoosh likes being held that long. Ah

01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:08.980
He's probably just all curious there anyway, oh he's

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.280
He's he's ready to take a break. Oh

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:20.240
You might want to make sure he gets down, okay, I don't think he's gonna like trying to get up from there. Yeah. Anyway, um, so

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
No, mr. Smoosh don't knock over the camera, please

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.160
Thank you for the distraction dark saga, that's alright it was a worthwhile one, um

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.880
I'm sure somebody's clipping that as we speak anyway, um, but as far as the Diablo goes

01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:40.920
I I couldn't remember where the church was and there's no like map or anything

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.040
I was like do I have to pick up a quest?

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.680
Like what do I have to like it took a minute for me to get oriented for him?

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:51.120
So let's do I couldn't like just jump in and play so it does kind of say something about like oh, yeah

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.160
Like it's not necessarily the games got easier

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.460
I mean they did a little bit but also I think to some extent just like the quality and the

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.800
accessibility is the right word in this context

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:09.520
But just the ease of jumping it right into the game has certainly improved quite a bit and then obviously like in the video

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.920
I I clearly should not have just started out with a sorcerer and I didn't go around town trying to buy things

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:19.280
There's probably I should I probably should try to buy armor because I'm sure you said get started with a little gold

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:22.560
You know try to buy something to help me out in that story would have helped a little bit

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.560
But you live you learn and that's how you did it back in those days

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:33.280
I've only ever played the demo. So, you know, it came with PC gamer. Oh, really? So I never got that far. Ah

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.140
All right. Well, I thought I thought the partnership was very interesting, too

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:40.300
I just I'm really surprised that Blizzard didn't do it themselves

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:46.980
When they have the infrastructure set up to do that, so just really surprised me. So anyway, alright, well, let's move on

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:54.260
We're gonna travel around and check out some rapid-fire news and some other quick hit stories for the night. So you're free epic game

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:59.920
This mother free game on the Epic Game Store is slime rancher. So you should definitely go check that out

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.920
It's a pretty fun little indie game

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:07.920
And it's free until March 21st, and then the next game is gonna be oxen free

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.680
So pick it up while you can and I recommend you do that because it is a pretty good game

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.680
It's been on my steam wish list for a while

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.080
Now I don't have to

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.960
And then this is pretty cool. Sadly. We don't have the footage of it, but

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.800
apparently the

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:31.160
DuckTales, you know, they have the new DuckTales cartoons. So they had an episode with Della duck and

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.000
It was called, you know, I think I don't remember the episode name

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.600
I don't know if it was called whatever happened to Della duck, but basically

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.160
she is

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.680
consoling some

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:48.720
Like space aliens and she says oh, well, I'm I'm gonna sing you a song. I used to sing to my kids and

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.440
ends up being the

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.120
Moon theme from the DuckTales game and it's pretty awesome

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.920
so

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.880
Pretty sweet, I would definitely worth checking out the episode, but it's a neat little kind of

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.200
Thing they have there you can try to pull it up

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:09.240
I was gonna say usually I don't I don't do this because of copyright things

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.040
But I guess if I don't show the video, I just play the audio which I think I can do

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:16.680
I think I'll be alright, but have you heard this dark Sakura? This is now now it's no Brental floss

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.640
But I will say Brental floss has acknowledged this and said I think he can yeah

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.240
He's the only appointed he gave it kudos

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:26.840
But um, so let's see if I can actually so I sadly I'm not gonna pump the video through but I will do the audio

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.120
I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit here

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.720
Look to the stars my darling baby boys

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.680
Life is strange and vast

01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.120
Filled with wonders and joys

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.940
So they see each new son

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.240
I mean, I really like the way they did this right? It's pretty cool

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:59.080
Like, you know, just the the way they did like that throwback to the original moon theme is really rad. So

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.400
Anyway, I know this new DuckTales series getting a lot of cool. No, it's it's it's great

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:08.200
Like I've I've seen some of the episodes for it and it's it's solid

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:13.280
I mean, I when the whole thing that they're gonna read like do DuckTales series and stuff

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.080
I kind of was hesitant, but it's it's been good. So

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.240
Pretty cool just to throw that in there just for like fans of the game

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.720
Because I think not a lot of kids probably watching they're gonna pick up on that so pretty cool

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.820
But now if they go back and play the game because of course not only do you have the old-school DuckTales

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.820
But you have DuckTales remastered was right. Yeah, not that long ago

01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:38.760
So if they go back and play that it'll be like, oh, I recognize this from the cartoon. Yeah, exactly

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.860
So yeah, it's kind of funny how that works out. So a lot of folks in chat

01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:49.700
First off some folks saying dammit Rob wipes tears. That's from Rama and then act-def says DuckTales is freaking awesome

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.940
As 200 Matt says I wish I could catch it more. We need a full song

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:56.100
I think yeah, a lot of people saying that would be really cool if they kind of

01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.820
Put that out in like a full song. We'll probably get a lot of streams

01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:04.600
Anyway, um, let's talk about something a little bit old-school like the quake engine

01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:10.660
That's right a brand new game coming out from 3d realms called wrath a on of ruin

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:16.160
It's actually something that's tapping into the quake engine, which is pretty cool

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:20.000
So, of course as you know quake was the follow-up to doom and so forth

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.180
So what happened is the one of the designers that was I think on the original doom

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:32.520
Or one of the yeah, I'm sorry one of the designers that works on levels for like quake like modding still to this day

01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:37.280
His name is kill pixel and he's made a full-fledged game. It's called wrath a on a rune

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.600
It's kind of built on the actual quake engine. So that's pretty cool

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.880
And they're saying it's an authentic 90 shooter

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.480
Not just something that's pretending to be and so it's it's pretty much

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:52.200
The game it's not recognizable as quake. They've turned it into something completely different, but it runs in that engine

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:58.280
I guess kind of like hexen was kind of cool. I can it'll get some high frame rates on my computer then you're right

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.240
All right. Anyway, um

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.480
As you may or may not be aware on International Women's Day was this past week

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:12.480
Which I believe was Friday if I have my calendar right in my head and a Sony PlayStation actually put out a PlayStation 4 theme

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:19.840
To celebrate International Women's Day. So it's something that actually has characters from various games. So it has

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.120
Am I saying his name right alloy from I alloy?

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:23.360
Yeah

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:24.800
I like from horizon zero dawn

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.380
Kara from Detroit become human and Chloe and Nadine from uncharted as well as cat from gravity rush

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.840
so some of their it's also got I don't know that the

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:37.320
From the paper a tearaway. I don't know a toy

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.760
But

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.680
Yeah, at oh I a toy a toy. Yeah, so

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:48.440
Sat girls there too. So there's just you know, there's some of Sony's girl power showing up there in the theme. So very cool

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:53.200
I haven't heard that there is a deadline to download it or anything. It's just something that they released

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:59.160
So I imagine if you haven't got it yet and you want some girl power on your PlayStation 4 you can go get it

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:05.100
Let's get some girl power on olr with some headlines from dark Sakura. Oh, this one makes me particularly happy

01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.860
We have the return of Sega Tucson Shiro

01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:13.940
Well kind of um, he's gun. He's gonna be returning for Sega fest

01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:16.660
Even though he's dead in Canon

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.940
Well remember cuz he sacrificed himself riding a rocket ship to save the dreamcast

01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:23.940
Because right? Yeah

01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:29.780
Talked about this on the show before I didn't really true mascot of Sega. He was at least the mascot of the Sega Saturn

01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:32.140
at any rate

01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:35.420
He was portrayed by Fujioka Hiroshi

01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:39.540
And he was memorable. He even had his own game

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:46.220
So anyway, he's going to be headlining for a Sega fest and that's March 30 30 through 31st

01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:48.980
and hopefully he won't get blasted off on another rocket and

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:55.300
Then blood-stained curse of the moon will have a physical release through limited run

01:42:55.820 --> 01:43:00.340
so it is going to be March 15th 2019 and

01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:03.540
It's going to start at 10 o'clock Eastern

01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:10.440
It doesn't say if it's p.m. Or a.m. So I will assume a.m. Because maybe they would have done military time otherwise

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:18.820
But at any rate it is they sell out like that. So you want it you be ready for it. I

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:26.900
Like what this company does they do this for a lot of you know, kind of like in strong indie titles will say and yeah

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:31.820
They're they're limited runs go very very strongly. So there's one for to jam and Earl on pre-order right now

01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:37.480
Yeah, but I was gonna see if they had it up on a pre-order win jammers for switch. Holy crap

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:45.400
Yeah, that game had a resurgence not that long ago because some popular youtuber other. Yeah, it was gaming with sacks. Yeah

01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:50.700
Which is the game sack guys? Yeah. Yeah. So alright. Well, that's it for rapid-fire news

01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:54.140
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates some things that are coming to you real soon

01:43:54.140 --> 01:44:01.620
It's a bit of a slower week this week. We've got the Caligula effect overdose on PC switch and PlayStation 4

01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:07.980
one-piece world seeker on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and finally

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:14.300
Tom Clancy's the division 2 on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one. That's probably the big release for us this week

01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:18.400
Oh, yeah, all right traveling over to Japan. It's a little busier than it was last week

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:22.940
I remember last week was kind of not as many releases, but we do have this week speaking of Sega

01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:28.700
They're releasing on the PlayStation 4 blade Arcus rebellion from shining is coming out in a regular and premium edition

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:34.820
Sengoku musu for DX and a regular and 15th anniversary box. So I guess that's some type of

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.680
Remaster of that game because I think that already I'll be dying Sengoku musu's dynasty warriors, right?

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:47.220
Yeah, so it's a I think a remaster for the PlayStation 4 of the fourth one in that series. So anyway

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:51.220
So that is out this week as well as a game called lover in Japan

01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:54.340
Destiny connect is also out in Japan this week

01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:58.900
Alias carnival sacrament plus in regular and limited edition and

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:06.180
Kemco RPG selection volume 2 is out this week. So this is like a greatest hits. I'm trying to see what's in this

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.060
revenant dogma

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:15.620
Alastair chronicles as divine hearts 2 and ferns gate and those are some deep cut JRPGs, you know

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:21.200
But if you're a fan of those you're probably very excited to hear that's coming out on a PlayStation 4 in a box set this

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.640
Week, that's pretty cool

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.160
Taking a look real quick at the switch to see if they have anything there

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:30.800
Yeah, destiny connect to blade Arcus rebellion from shining Sengoku musu for all of that also on the switch as well

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:38.320
Also a game called Harukanaru Toki no naka de 6 DX in a regular treasure and to the future box

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:41.520
One other game on the switch this week, you know

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:49.400

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:16.180
So this is the part of the show where we would usually go to the mailbag where you guys can send your emails to participate

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:20.460
At orange lounge radio.com and last week. We had quite a few emails to read on the show

01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:23.500
But did you read one from Rama? Uh, yes, I did last week

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:29.940
So unfortunately in this week's mailbag didn't delete any of its well, you know how it goes in this week's mailbag

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.460
I believe it's empty. It is empty

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:34.940
So dark soccer must have told you all not to email so she didn't have to work tonight. So

01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.020
shit

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.260
She wants a vacation on her first night back now, right? Hopefully we'll get some emails for next week

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.300
so participate at orange entree calm, but

01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:50.100
Y'all what's the punishment when we don't get any emails? Guess what dark Sakura drag race talk?

01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:51.540
Yeah

01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:54.260
Some water. Are you okay quickly who you're reading for on season?

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:56.420
I haven't seen the last episode yet anyway, cuz I was in Vegas

01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:02.300
So just oddly one who are you reading for in season 11 Edie Ali Evie oddly and maybe Nina flowers

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:05.740
Okay, well need Nina flowers isn't on this season girl

01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:11.800
Why does he Nina flowers because that's Evie oddly is like drag sister or something like that. No, Nina not Nina flowers

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:18.520
Nina West, you know West. There you go. Okay. Yes, because I was voting for I was reading for soju

01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:25.380
But soju was terrible and I'm so glad I called that bitch out on getting a wish outfit

01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:30.900
I'm like girl. No. No, I will find this and post in the chat. I believe I was like

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:36.220
You it's like a little while Lolita kimono and I bought one just to see what they look like

01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:39.760
So I'm not saying anything. I had worn it cuz it didn't fit at the time. It might fit now

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:44.620
but this bitch got it on wish cuz it's the only place you can get this shit and

01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:50.740
I commented and she's like, yeah, I did it. I'm sorry. She oh she commented. Yeah

01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:58.540
So what she got dressed on wish who cares not about but it's bad Bob the drag queen won a challenge in a Tron outfit

01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:02.580
That she bought on Amazon's and somebody was like, here's the Amazon listing for that outfit. She's

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:07.860
Yeah, right. I need that. Look it up. I'm actually when I get when I do Disney bounding

01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:13.300
I have that Tron shirt now. It's got the the identity disc on the back and everything. Yeah

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:19.060
I'm good. I might order the Quora one though. That'd be sweet. Um so far Evie oddly is my favorite, too

01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:24.140
I really wanted to like silky but that is annoying as fuck that first episode

01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:27.620
I just want a big girl to win already. Damn it. Okay silky

01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:31.500
I'm sending it because my Apple watch it's fine. Stand up silky

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:34.260
makes me think of

01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:39.580
Jiggly Caliente Snooki except nothing but an entire episode of that fucking shit

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:40.580
All right

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:41.220
anyway

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.220
If you would like to send us an email

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:49.240
Participate at orange lounge radio.com or we will further the drag race talk next week when I catch up on the show one more thing

01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:51.820
Scarlet envy I can't stand that heifer

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:53.220
Okay

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:57.140
Moving on let's get back into some video game. Loki's just sitting here this whole time going

01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:59.140
It's like it's like they're speaking a foreign language. All right

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.660
All right

01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:08.660
Loki what do you have next for us? So there was issues with amp. I think it's still going on issues with anthem crashing

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:11.540
PlayStation 4s

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:14.540
To the point where I believe a patch came out over the weekend

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:15.020
Okay

01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:15.300
well

01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:18.300
originally it was crashing them to the point where you had to actually

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:22.320
They would shut the console off and you'd have to rebuild the file system

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.600
Which is bad, but apparently I guess they have

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.080
Patched it out. So that's good. But really shouldn't have been doing that in the first place

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:36.040
But yeah, I know that there was a scare for a while that actually it was bricking consoles

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.800
But thankfully once people found out that they could boot in the safe mode and rebuild their file system

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.400
Then everything was which is what happens when your PlayStation 4 shuts down unexpectedly anyway

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.100
But it was doing it like it wasn't allowing you even to just close out the application. It was also kind of

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:54.940
Breaking stuff in that sense Oh quest buster and chat is correcting me saying the patch doesn't cover the crashes

01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:59.420
Only some of the loot issues and a few other things. Oh, I thought this is a fix for that. Okay

01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.420
Well, I say fucking good

01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:07.380
People are liking it. I'm just I I've put out the reasons why I'm way karma

01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:14.420
Put out the reasons why I'm waiting if y'all are enjoying it have fun, you know fire were fucked over there good fans. So whatever

01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:16.420
You

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.180
Do you I guess I

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:23.660
Don't want to keep shitting on this game. I just want to move on with our lives. So

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:25.820
Okay

01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.820
Well, let's just move on. All right

01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.100
then

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:34.560
X link in chat says it's still crashing systems and the patch is out later this week

01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:40.240
Shad Leland Shane is in chat saying as much as I'm enjoying anthem. I can't defend that issue

01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:45.880
Talking about the breaking and so forth quest buster does reiterate it's not breaking them

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:52.760
It just forcibly shuts the game down and made me think it bricked my PlayStation 4 so and act F points out

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:56.360
It's not great when the people that want to like anthem are giving it a truly

01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:01.520
It's also like if it's it's doing it's shutting your system down in a way that needs to rebuild the file system

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.160
Because it won't start up

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:10.080
Normally, there is a risk for data loss or data corruption because of that so it may not be doing

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.720
It yet, but it it's not a good thing

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:17.040
All right. Well, let's move on somewhere out there McCrea saying it's high noon

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:23.120
And this is a story about Pokemon go and what's gonna happen at high noon on March 13th from 12 p.m

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:27.360
To 1 p.m. In your local time zone, so it's not based on you know

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:32.280
Everything is central is centralized on Pacific time or you know, the Asia Pacific all has one time

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:38.440
It's 12 to 1 in your time zone. The number of raids in Pokemon go will be increased

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:45.240
So they're actually calling this an experiment with lunch hour raid battles and they're saying if the one-day trial runs

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.000
Well, if we sell a lot of raid passes

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:51.900
Then this might be a regular thing to look forward to now

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:59.440
I don't really get to do this at my work because where my work is is not really a very commercial office building area

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:02.680
This is I'm like I work at the one random office building in the area

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:07.440
So I don't think I'll really get to benefit from this but I definitely know people and if Shane still

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:11.520
Watching he can protest this because I know he used to play with the group

01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:18.480
Over here in Rancho Cordova more in your neck of the woods where they actually go out on lunchtime raids and they you know

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:22.660
They're like, okay, we see that there's a five star over here and a five star over here and they actually plan their route

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.840
So I'm thinking for those guys man

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:29.220
They're gonna have a field day that day because there's gonna be stuff spawning. I imagine every go to the park

01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:31.840
Yeah by my work this guy like a few

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:33.840
I

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:40.780
Ex raid there's ex raid and there's usually another one they do raids on I'm just trying to grind raids right now just to

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.120
Because I'm doing the melt and thing and I got it in ten raids

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:47.920
So what I've been doing because I don't like actually doing the raids as I go there

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:51.840
Go into it my free raid pass get the credit for it and quit out

01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:58.520
Yeah, but you can you can do one in two stars on yourself

01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.520
These are all five

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:07.080
A lot of three stars are very scalable. Yeah, so but that knew that new one legendary dialga

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:11.480
I don't know if I'm saying the name, right? He is he's he's more useful than the ones we've had previously

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:16.880
He's he's worth having at least one of and apparently I don't think you need a ton of people to take him down

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.720
So I got very lucky

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:25.600
Like the first one that spawned in all of Sacramento happened to spawn right by my work and I caught him on the first ball

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.640
So I was like great I'm done for this month and he was a pretty decent appraisal

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:35.240
So I'm like, wow, the Pokemon gods are smiling on me today. I'm done. So that was that no

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:40.020
I'll probably still try to go catch more especially if Alan, you know, cuz if Alan can't get one now that there's trading

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:45.700
In fact, I think I think he missed reg ice and I got one today in my little bonus box

01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:50.560
So I'm gonna give it to Alan if he doesn't have one already. He's missed. I know he's missing one of the regs

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.560
I think might be red rock though

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.180
Anyway, let's see other comments in chat

01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:00.720
Act F says Palkia is also useful. Dialga is doable if you have really good Machamps or grudons

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:07.360
Shane is saying I was getting ready for Rayquaza this weekend and spent 1.1 million stardust to power up my Pokemon for it

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.640
Since my husband and our friends are not as high a level as me and I'll be doing the heavy lifting

01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:14.600
There were requires of things coming up next weekend though, right?

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:19.240
That's not that it I didn't miss it when I was in Vegas did I might have I don't know

01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:23.200
I think it's next weekend when that all goes down. So do you do Pokemon rating misty?

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.880
Not really, especially considering

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:31.740
well one I'm usually working during raid times and and I'm also

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:38.580
In a when I am at work and at home. I'm not in a very stop slash gym dense area. So

01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:40.720
You know and that is a good point

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:46.560
Is that you know 12 to 1 might be your standard lunch, but there's a lot of people out there who don't work standard hours

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:49.960
We even have in chat as Joe and Hunter Matt saying I won't be able to do this

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.400
I'm a supervisor at my job

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.880
So I can't leave and let the inmates run the asylum for me to raid

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:56.360
Fair point and you know

01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:03.920
There's plenty of industries where you don't get to work the standard again nine to five noon to one on March the 13th

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:08.920
Which would be today's the 10th. So Monday Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be at work

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:13.600
So yeah, so not everybody can do it, but I guess they just note that well, it'll be there

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:16.380
That's why they're trying it. Maybe there's trying to see what's the engagement like

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:21.600
So hmm, I would love if I if I'm able to get away from my desk for an amount of time

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.760
I would love to try to find some raids and you know just for fun, especially if

01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:29.400
They put out some super I think it would they would really draw people out

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.100
They put out some surprises like not just Dialga

01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:37.200
But maybe you know, some of the shiny variants coming back or something. We kind of neat. We'll see

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.320
yeah, I hope this does turn out to be a successful experiment because

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:48.360
Granted they get in scheduling patterns with me, but Wednesday seems to usually be one of my days off. All right

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:54.040
Well, you never know. All right. Anyway, so we'll see. Yeah, we'll see how that goes for those of you that are playing Pokemon

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:59.520
Go, I'm sure we'll hear about it this next week because not every Pokemon go event always goes swimmingly

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.920
There was that whole Phoebus event they did that was kind of a nightmare

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:05.600
But then they improved on it when they did clam pearl so, you know

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.200
Things are fixable anyhow speaking of fixing things dark Sakura

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.200
well

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:16.840
This one I was a little bit confused about this one because I thought it had already been

01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:18.800
settled

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:22.000
but Alfonso Ribeiro filed to drop a suit against

01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:26.860
The fortnight creators over the Carlton dance being in the game

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.840
Which I thought that it had been thrown out already. I can clarify a little bit

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:34.720
What happened is that he tried to get a copyright on it?

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:36.720
And that was the thing that was denied

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:40.640
Previously is the copy they based at the office came back and said it's a very simple dance

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:45.240
You're denied and I think when we heard that we kind of saw this coming

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.400
But now it's it it's here. He just yeah, he

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:54.980
Withdirected it. Yeah withdrew is his filing and said he was gonna drop the case

01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:02.140
So there you go. Everyone get your Carlton dance on and on top of that. He doesn't own the dance anyway, because it's owned by

01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.020
By ABC

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:12.320
NBC NBC, but no whatever BC well actually copyright says no one owns it. No, so Carlton all you want. Here we go

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:15.700
Just kidding. I'm not doing it again. Um, I did that on the first

01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:20.860
I did it on the first stream. I'm not doing that again. Somebody gift it and I'm like, oh boy

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:25.700
I learned my lesson about what to do and what not to do on stream. Um, but anyway, I

01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:30.740
Don't I think it was all the folks that were suing got thrown out

01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:35.460
Right because the same lawyer was representing everybody right like backpack kid and all that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know man

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.460
I think they all got thrown out

01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:40.220
so yeah, I just

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:44.300
It seems like it's a money grab. Yeah. All right

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:47.300
You know an attempt to you know

01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:51.700
Relevancy well, yeah, and I think for somebody like, you know

01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:59.700
Alfonso Ribera who's who's known for that like that is playing that role really defined his career and he worked it into dancing with the

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:03.660
Stars and everything like, you know that I think was important to his brand

01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:08.060
So for him to lose that probably sucks, but at the same time like I kind of think, you know

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:10.260
Having seen Alfonso Ribera on

01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:11.700
Dancing with the Stars

01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:17.380
He's much more than just like he's capable do more and now he's turned that into more hosting gigs and things like that and like

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:17.780
You know

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:23.740
We'd love to see a good 90s personality show up as a host every now and then and so I feel like the dude's gonna have

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:26.980
a career that he doesn't have to own that dance to have a very

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:30.860
Great career that a lot of us would be gifted to have so

01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:36.860
Maybe there's a point where he even said, you know what? I just I don't want to be known as the guy that shut down

01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:38.860
fortnight, I mean

01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:44.800
Just think about it. You might be able to turn that gig into a CG genie someday. No

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:49.380
Alright moving on just a few more stories for you guys Loki

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:55.860
Alright, so this is kind of cool. I mean it just came out and I haven't picked it up because I saw him played through the

01:59:57.260 --> 02:00:04.100
The third one, but apparently just cause four is already included in Xbox game pass

02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:10.980
So you can go ahead and check that out with your $10 a month subscription and that just came out. Yep. Yeah

02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:12.980
December

02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:14.980
So that's pretty quick

02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:18.460
But I mean, I guess it's not as quick as like say so in the first party game

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.100
So this is notable just because it's a third party game

02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:25.580
But you know usually like stuff is day and date with like crackdown stuff

02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:28.220
But it's a pretty good game from what I hear

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:33.060
I just I can't see myself diving into it because I still haven't played the third one

02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:39.820
Which I own and bought and there's plenty other games that are still in backlog Kingdom Hearts 3 Final Fantasy 15

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:42.340
that I haven't

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:47.400
Gotten chance to play it. So I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to hold off on more Square Enix games at this time

02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:50.020
All right, then

02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:53.780
Alright and one more story for you guys tonight before we open up our discord

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:58.680

We'll try take your call a little later on in the show

02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:12.700
If you want to increase your chances getting picked first you want to say in the orange ounce radio channel what it is you want?

02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:14.700
To call in about tonight

02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:20.340
Meanwhile before we get there, let's talk about this is pretty exciting a new NES game was unearthed

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:24.580
So a brand new wrestling game for the NES it was called

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.500
UWC which is probably some type of like

02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:29.960
Universal United Wrestling

02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:36.140
Conspiracy, I don't know but it was a game that was made by Sada and it was discovered recently on a review cartridge

02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:40.080
So the game was near completion, but for whatever reason was not released

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:45.140
Maybe it was just something that was came out in the the late in the lifespan of the NES and they just decided it

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.300
Wouldn't be worth it

02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:47.620
So anyway

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:54.620
This thing was discovered and I guess it was it's going to the classic archive that they've been putting it that

02:01:54.740 --> 02:02:00.700
Classic video gaming museum and they're trying to get it all deconstructed and I believe we're planning on releasing the ROM soon

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:05.120
So more people can enjoy that, you know, if you want to check out a little piece of history, so

02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:12.360
There you go. UWC a brand new NES game unearthed this week that just never happened

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:16.120
Dark to see you in chat saying I think this was like the precursor to

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:23.460
WCW at least what I read looking into this story. Yeah, probably so, you know and obviously, you know

02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:29.160
It wrestling is a sports standard that always has video games that come out like this is all and you know

02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:34.360
even back in the NES days we had that really awesome WrestleMania game that had like Hulk Hogan and

02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:36.360
Andre the giant was in it

02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:40.840
like all all the faves we grew up with were in that WrestleMania 8-bit game and of course like

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:46.320
You know if you want to go on to the switch online library pro wrestling which probably isn't as good

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:51.040
But it's still you know, it's a wrestling game and it's it's competent and you can play it and have a little fun for a few

02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:53.040
Minutes, so pretty cool. Anyway

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:59.940
Dark to see a also confirming in chat. I do know the ROM should be out there soon. Yeah, so alright

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:04.980
Well, let's head on into our listener roundtable where we're gonna open it up for some

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:10.980
Calls via our discord or if you would prefer you can also just jump in and

02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.100
Anything you want to ask in our chat room?

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:14.440
You can go ahead and do that

02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:17.340
You can jump in our chat room and anything you want to ask us

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:18.780
You can do that in there as well

02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:22.180
If you're feeling too shy to call in and want to participate still with us one way or the other

02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:26.620
You can do that there. So I think we do already have a call on the line

02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:33.540
I'm just not set up because again that freaking power outage from earlier screwed us up

02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:38.540
But anyway, let's get to it and we'll let's start with this call. Hi you are on orange on radio. Who's this?

02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:41.220
Yeah, this is metal man. Yeah

02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:44.020
Hey good metal mayhem. How you doing?

02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:46.820
Pretty good. Can't complain

02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:48.640
well since

02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:50.640
you mentioned

02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:55.220
Gable earlier during the show as I talked about since it's relevant

02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:01.520
Yeah, bear in mind back in the 90s. I was not a PC gamer or strictly console

02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:08.020
I gave up a PlayStation 1 and there was a ps1 port of Diablo

02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:12.420
There was respect that to say Diablo was on consoles. Yes

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:18.900
Along with Warcraft 2, but I'll see you there. Sorry for no show

02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.720
Yeah, I played the ever-loving half of Diablo

02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:32.580
Unfortunately, I never got a chance to play the PC version because I didn't have a PC back then PC gaming was too expensive for me

02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:34.460
back then but

02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:37.900
you know if what I've been told, you know told if I were they

02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:45.220
Somehow come across a box copy of Diablo. It would not run on modern machines for one reason or another

02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:46.940
so

02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:49.940
When I heard that the elbow was re-released

02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:54.460
And they got working on modern PCs. I like

02:04:56.220 --> 02:05:01.460
We haven't had the ps1 version of the game in years I've been wanting

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:04.720
You know to play the original Diablo again

02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:10.020
you know be able to that's my first PC game, but

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:16.860
So be able but at the same time a little conflict is

02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:19.980
The

02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:25.940
Before you probably remember there's a thing a little bit of a brouhaha a few months back

02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:28.700
regarding dog in the

02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:32.780
You know, you know, you know CD project right that you know red and

02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:38.380
One of their other companies, I guess they you know, so the branch that was working on

02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:40.340
cyberpunk

02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:48.320
2077 yes, I'm I'm well aware of that and it's it's one of those things where this this news of a partnership with

02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:50.420
Blizzard is is really too big to ignore

02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:58.520
and also, I think we've heard of a lot of really dumb fuck moves by PR people lately and I hope the

02:05:59.060 --> 02:05:59.980
entire

02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:02.800
PR industry is really evaluating some of their

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:07.140
Edgy things that they do out there and I I'd prefer to leave it at that

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:11.660
Yeah, you know, so, you know all that being said, you know

02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:19.060
You know, I've been kind of like for lack of a bear in the LD kind of like it here stuck in the headlights, you know

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.420
You like buy the game that I really want to play do I not?

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:25.420
Well

02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:26.940
Here's the thing

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:30.700
Here's the thing rage nator. It's probably harder than you remember for one

02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:35.900
I mean take a look at that clip that I just did earlier where I died twice now if I really kind of sat down

02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:41.100
And like forced myself to get good so to speak I could probably remember like oh, these are the things that I'm doing wrong

02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:45.980
maybe I'd have to consult a walkthrough or something to kind of help me out a little bit and kind of jumpstart my brain as

02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:51.100
To what we were kind of doing back in the day with those games which to be fair you on BBS's and stuff

02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:54.580
We were trading the same, you know knowledge and the internet was still in its early days

02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:58.460
So, you know game facts did exist and in earlier forms and so forth

02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:04.380
So, you know you can kind of pick up what you're supposed to be doing in Diablo and and and get it that way

02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:06.500
But you know at the same time

02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:13.580
It may you kind of may go back and go to it and you like oh shit when I play something like Diablo 3

02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:16.060
I really do have all these quality of life

02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:20.660
Improvements that I sometimes forget about because Diablo 3 really got shit on when it first came out

02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:22.580
I mean, it's a fine game now

02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:27.700
But you still you kind of start to realize like oh in a game like Diablo 3 you really kind of good

02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:32.380
You could just like jump in there and get going whereas then the original Diablo you could you couldn't do that

02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:36.340
Or if you did you kind of ended up like I did in my little sample stream that I did there earlier

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.420
So, you know

02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:42.980
I think as long as you go to it with the right mindset that it may take a bit for your brain to adjust to

02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:44.620
the 90s experience

02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:47.020
Then I don't think it's necessarily a waste of money

02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:50.300
Especially if it's a game you enjoyed just because it's old doesn't make it bad

02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:54.420
But some of the conveniences of new are gonna be lost if that makes sense

02:07:55.500 --> 02:08:01.980
Exactly, you know that but admittedly, you know, I have bought some other rupture games, you know

02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:03.980
I'm God in the past

02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:08.300
Yeah, we're available and like Dan 64 like for example

02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:14.460
the two rock games and shadows of the Empire and at least with those

02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:21.420
You know, you know, I'll start them off, you know play for maybe I know if I came in and say oh, yeah

02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:25.260
I remember this level. I'll remember that sounds fact. I remember that weapon

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:28.780
Yeah, all right. I've gone out, you know go play something else now

02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:36.140
So then the question would be how much is ten bucks worth you is ten ten bucks worth a five-minute thrill and something to have

02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:41.180
In your library, or do you think you're really gonna sit down and spend the three four hours?

02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:47.920
Whatever your time is worth to you to really make that ten dollars valuable that's something unfortunately buddy. I can't answer for you

02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:50.100
You know

02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:56.620
You know if I can't find some people to play with the game with either online or land or whatever

02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:02.820
Then and then really bring the character to the point where he's so overpowered

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:05.060
ridiculously

02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:07.120
Turn on friendly fire and like

02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:13.000
I'll kill you. Sorry. Yeah, just kind of like totally troll it

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:21.080
Well until you got to the trolling part I was thinking that that was you know, you could easily find a group either

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.440
You know on different web forums out there. Maybe you'll find some like-minded vog people on our discord

02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:30.520
But even if not there, you know a social media places like Twitter or Facebook or so forth

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:33.520
I bet you could find some other people to play through with and maybe have fun

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:37.040
But you know, it's funny because we're talking about these old games from the 90s being new again

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:41.740
You know, you can team up with friends and anything's more fun with friends. Diablo will be fun with friends

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:46.360
What was something I was talking about last week on the show was Phantasy Star online, you know

02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:51.640
I recently rediscovered that playing blue burst with my buddy Delvin over at VG realness and and Bobby joined in for some too

02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:54.840
And I think Shane joined in at least for some of the chat and that was great

02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:59.140
I mean even though that game has some ways that it shows its age as well

02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:05.400
You know, there's a lot that especially playing with friends makes a game like that more fun

02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:09.700
So I think that's something else to consider maybe if you could find the friends to play with

02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:14.340
It's gonna make the Diablo experience even though it's something old-school that much sweeter

02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:19.860
But certainly and as being said in chat to just because something is old doesn't mean it's bad. So but anyway, uh

02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:22.460
Metal mayhem I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls

02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:25.980
But thank you so much and take care and I want to know if you end up getting it or not

02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:29.260
Yeah, the very earliest I can get is

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:35.260
At the earliest just the 15th. I'm literally penniless until then bud. All right

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.980
Well, keep us posted keep us posted on if you get the game or not. All right

02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:46.500
Take care. All right. That was a metal mayhem here on orange launch radio. We've it's our lobbies filling up here

02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:50.860
Let's get to another call and get somebody else here on the line. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:52.860
Nope

02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:58.940
No, they're gone that person dropped out loud no, no you were in the green room you're coming on the show

02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:02.020
Let's try that one more time. Hi, you're on our songs radio. Who's this?

02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:10.340
Book this is excellent. Hey, that's alright. I know it's it's a new way of doing it. It's it's not Skype anymore

02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:12.180
How what's on your mind, buddy?

02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:17.140
Nothing much. I'm sorry. I haven't pushed the talk on so that's probably reason why no worry

02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:21.600
No for a minute you went back to the other channel and I was like no you get back here

02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:29.060
What's on your mind tonight, so so anyways, I got done being Kingdom Hearts 3

02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:33.420
I'm not gonna give any spoilers or anything. I just want to say it was worth the wait

02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:38.820
Though I had a lot of questions, but it was definitely worth the play through

02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:43.920
Let me put it that way and I'm glad nothing happened. It didn't break my console or didn't do anything crazy

02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.640
So I was really happy with the purchases

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:52.780
That's that's I'm glad to hear you how many hours would you say you dumped in the game Oh

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:56.720
Probably a little over 30

02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:03.440
So at 30 35 hours is still a pretty it's a you know, I was just talking to a metal mayhem

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.360
I always want to say his old name

02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:06.440
I was just talking to metal mayhem about you know

02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:11.480
The value of like $10 for a game like Diablo and how many hours you get out of it, but that's that's not bad

02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:13.080
That's about 50 cents an hour

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.420
for

02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:17.180
Kingdom Hearts, that's a pretty good value. So cool

02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.440
What do you think about this story about the DLC?

02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.640
They're thinking to do it because I think that was on last week

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:27.960
Yeah, we talked a little bit about the DLC. That was do you think there's room for DLC again?

02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:32.900
Please keep it spoiler free. You know that but what do you think there's room for DLC and what they could do? I

02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:39.960
Think we lost oh we did we lost him he alright he dropped out

02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:44.840
Well, maybe he can speak up in chat on his thoughts there. Unfortunately, he dropped off a discord

02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:45.720
I don't know what happened there

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:50.440
Maybe the lightning in his neck of the woods took him out just like it took out our show earlier there

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:54.040
So well bummer because I would have liked to have heard his thoughts from somebody that beat it

02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:59.240
But maybe he can get that in our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network in the meantime

02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:01.920
I am gonna move on to the next call. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's this?

02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:06.920
Hey Rama, hey doing buddy

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:09.900
I'm just enjoying the warmer weather here. Finally

02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.720
I'm I'm enjoying the change of pace here too, but I'm also I get my mood is affected by the weather

02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.960
So I'm just I'm I'm thankful to have a break from the rain or supposedly until six o'clock tonight

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.160
I thought we were gonna break from the rain. But yeah, I find the rain relaxing in a stress atlas

02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:30.380
Yeah, but it's if you have certain season effective things

02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:36.040
It can definitely take its toll on you after the summer is what stresses me out. Hmm. Interesting. Anyway, what's on your mind Rama?

02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.560
You also gotta say we got a bless the rains down in Africa

02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:45.600
But I don't I don't live there I live in California Rama

02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:53.960
Okay, it's California dreamin on a winter's day remember or anyway

02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:56.800
Touche, okay

02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:02.000
Be on my merry little way, so I watched an episode of DuckTales and yes

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:08.600
I found myself tearing up a bit not just because of the nostalgia of the music the fact that she's saying that as a

02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:12.480
Lullaby to that one creature in the episode. I was like, this is too much for me

02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:15.320
Did you know that it was coming or did it was it a surprise?

02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:21.080
It was a surprise cuz a friend of mine was watching it and she just made a screen cap

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:24.520
I was like wait what so I watched it and I believe

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:31.800
She they played it three times in the episode the first time she was singing it like she was fighting the creature the first time

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:39.840
The second time it was like in a background music. And the third time was when she actually sang it as a lullaby. Oh, that's cool

02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:46.600
There are moon mites

02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:55.960
I actually from the little clip. I thought she was on the moon but to be I haven't she was on the motion

02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:58.840
Okay, I haven't watched the new DuckTales. Sorry. I I

02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:01.520
Was in Vegas for God's sake

02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:06.840
She is on the moon. Basically. Gotcha. She's trying to get back home to her kids

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:13.480
Well, yeah, so it looks in that thing just a larva of the bigger creature

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.560
The child of the bigger creature. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what I said a larva

02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:24.300
Spoilers y'all spoilers. Did it make you want to go back and play DuckTales?

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:30.780
Well, you know, I mean I do have remastered for ps3, so yeah, I'm

02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:37.220
That was a free or you know free game for PlayStation Plus at one point wasn't one of those gave it away

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:42.820
It might have been the Microsoft platform. They gave away somebody made away. I don't know. It could be my backlog. Who knows?

02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:46.500
Yeah, it's hey, the remaster is pretty solid. I think it's a fun one to go through

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:49.380
They change a little bit, but it's fun. I

02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:57.100
Would love to see DLC for the game where it's using updated graphics and voices from the current get from the current series

02:15:57.140 --> 02:16:01.100
That would be kind of cool. Mmm. That would be cool. That would be very cool

02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:04.680
Well, I'm anything else on your mind tonight Rama besides DuckTales

02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:08.980
Mario Day, I have a funny story

02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:15.340
This story is several years old. But here's the thing when I was living back in my old town

02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:20.380
I had other roommates and we would sit there and play Super Nintendo all the time that were in 64

02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:27.020
My roommate said that he had the highest score in the house of Super Mario World and nobody could beat him

02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:30.100
And he's just talking about like he is the king of Super Mario World

02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:34.780
So one Saturday morning, I said, you know what? I'm going to shut him up

02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:41.520
So I went out got some soda and some chips turn the TV on turn on the Super Nintendo and sat there

02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:49.360
And I went through the entire levels of the game now he's watching me and he's going you're not going to beat my score I

02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:56.800
Ignore him as I'm going through all the levels and once I unlock Bowser's castle, I stopped I go back

02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:58.920
I open up the star road. I

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:02.560
Open that up and get the special zone. I

02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:07.160
Opened that up and I go to the inverted Super Mario World

02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:11.240
Beat Bowser look at him hand in the controller and walk out the living room

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:13.860
I

02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:19.860
Perfect. Sometimes a spite is a wonderful motivator. That's how I live my life

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:34.280
Well, thank you for the Mario memory we love a good spiteful revenge story for a Mario memory Rama

02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:39.160
I'm gonna let you go though so we can wrap up but take care and I'm sure maybe we'll hear more about DuckTales on Tuesday

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:40.720
an anime jam session

02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:46.200
We might just cuz me and mako-chan were here watching it. So we definitely may talk about it. Sounds good. Take care, buddy

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:51.660
Awesome. Take care y'all later. All right, I think that's gonna do it for a discord stuff tonight

02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:57.480
but I did want to respond to some of the stuff that was in our chat over at twitch TV slash vog network and

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:01.640
They were talking about Pokemon go and where was that? Oh, yes

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:10.120
Shane had said my go hype is wearing down now that sword and shield were announced all my Pokemon thoughts are directed towards those games

02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:15.580
Why not both though? That's why can't you like both? I mean, I don't know that's kind of where I'm wondering

02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:20.540
There's gonna be a different sword shield, but I'm still gonna play go any inner connectivity between let's go and

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:26.860
The new one well, oh you mean you mean between let's go and sort of show or between sword and shield and go because I could

02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:30.800
See that I either there'll be connectivity like they had and let's go

02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:36.300
Not that like you'd be able to send a Pokemon over but maybe it will unlock kind of like how

02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:43.200
Meltan you get I wouldn't be able to send Pokemon over well, maybe you will maybe because I mean, it's Gen 8

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:46.480
It should all be in there. Yeah, maybe I don't know well because

02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:54.760
Because I'm you too, but there's a big difference between catching them and go and catching them in the role-playing game format

02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:58.920
I mean, I don't know it I guess if that's what they want to do they can but I'm not gonna expect that

02:18:59.080 --> 02:18:59.560
Yeah

02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:04.800
So but I I would think there's gonna be some type of functionality between the two just to encourage

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:09.000
Fans of one to get the other and fans of the other to get the one and so forth

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.820
You know that this would be a lost opportunity

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:14.040
Otherwise, I wonder if they're gonna re-release let's go like they do

02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:17.500
You know how they do like a yellow version or something like that where they have

02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:23.480
You know all this stuff combined in the one. Mm-hmm. I wonder if they'll do that. Who knows?

02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.320
Let's see

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.840
Shane does continue in chat

02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:32.580
I can like both but I won't care as much about go when I have sword and shield but what if then okay

02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.320
But isn't like gen 5 is not your favorite starter coming up

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.800
So, I mean at some point, you know

02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:42.680
The new sort of shield will come out and then you know people are gonna be focused on that for you know

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:50.520
A couple months but then couldn't go just suddenly say guess what gen 5 is out. Come get your oshwat, right and

02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:57.060
Shane I you might change your tone. I don't know because I would think gen 5 is gonna be next so I don't know

02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:01.220
Right. Am I right my way of thinking? Yeah. Yeah, so, uh, let's see

02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:08.240
Shane does say let's be real gen 5 won't be in go until like 2026. I I don't think you're right on that

02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:15.800
Let's see act deaf does say I do need a let's go expansion with the Johto region. I bet that'll happen

02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:20.200
I bet there will be a let's go for gen 2 that I think that game did well enough

02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:25.560
That may be in the off year. So next year, I bet we were maybe the year after we'll get a let's go for gen 2

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:30.140
It just seems it's it seems like maybe that's where the remakes are now, you know

02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:33.360
It used to be that the remakes were always kind of like a few gens behind now

02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:38.520
Maybe that's you know where the remakes are gonna be is in the let's go series. Who knows who knows?

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:45.160
Anyhow tiger class says they will probably do a let's go but with a different Pokemon

02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:47.080
Well, of course, it would have to be a gen 2 Pokemon

02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:50.440
But what iconic gen 2 pokemons could they pick?

02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:58.260
Because there isn't anything like Pikachu and Eevee unless they did like Espeon and Umbreon or something that I think that might be the way

02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:03.100
To do it over the shins over the starters. Oh and well, but you had three three

02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:03.580
Yeah

02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:10.940
And remember when it was like the color games when it was Pokemon silver and gold that didn't affect the starter pokemons

02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:17.160
It just affected what you would encounter in the wild. So your starter Pokemon still end up being let's see. That was Chikorita

02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:23.780
Water was the toad dial right the little crocodile thing and then

02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:26.300
fire was

02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:32.500
Cyndaquil I got it Cyndaquil. So those were those were your gen 2 starters, but I just don't say thank you for the applause

02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:38.380
I just don't see them doing three separate games. You know, I mean, yeah, so we'll see

02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:46.100
I see a Tiberius thinks Snubbull and Meryl would be the ones who know I don't know. It's hard to say so

02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:49.100
Sentret and

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:50.900
What are the ones that are just everywhere?

02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:55.880
What are the ones that are just like that just the shitty Mon that ever wish Sentret and the little spider dudes

02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:57.620
um

02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:03.340
What am I thinking of spinner X? Yeah spinner axe. That's it. Anyway

02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:09.080
All right, but doof said no, but doof is gen 4 they better do it. Let's go, but doof

02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:15.860
That would be fucking badass. I'd love that. All right. Anyway, um, all right. Well, that's gonna do Pokemon rusty

02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:22.540
That's gonna do it for the calls tonight and we're going to start to wrap up the show tonight as we start to get into

02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:23.780
final thoughts

02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:29.300
First off I want to say misty. Well, actually I should ask are there any last-minute stories? Yes. I have a couple actually

02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:31.760
All right. All right, go there's been some

02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:35.500
Images leaked online

02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:37.500
from the patent for

02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:44.120
Google's new handheld Chromecast device and we have a picture what the controller might look like and it looks like a

02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:46.500
PlayStation controller except kind of

02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:52.820
Flat and it's like halfway PlayStation halfway. Oh, yeah, and I hate the oh, yeah part of that but you see this coming week

02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:59.260
No, but yeah, maybe I know it's coming up. But the Google announcements supposed to be on the 19th

02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:01.260
So that's a couple weeks

02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:04.100
so there's that and then

02:23:05.180 --> 02:23:09.180
Apparently the trend nowadays is to remake Star Wars games in Unreal 4

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:13.100
so we have someone that's remade when the levels of pod racer and

02:23:13.580 --> 02:23:20.980
Unreal 4 and then someone that's now working on a recreating Star Wars dark forces in Unreal 4 and you can actually download

02:23:20.980 --> 02:23:23.460
Both of those so I will link them in chat

02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:25.420
neat

02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:27.420
That's it. That's it. All right

02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:31.500
Misty, thank you for being here. I hope you had a good time tonight. Thanks for being on the show great

02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:33.700
It's always great to have you here you come such a long way

02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:34.820
I know you've been a

02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:39.660
Hardcore fan of this show for a very long time and your support really means the world and I say that to all the fans

02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:41.660
Out there. So thank you so much for

02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:45.060
Taking the time out to be all the way out here with us in studio. It's great

02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:49.380
I love it when the the the fan I always feel weird saying fans the listeners

02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:53.300
Can part the participants that was always a good word that we use with vogner where the participants?

02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:57.420
I love in our participants can kind of come to the table and actually be at the table with us

02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:59.220
It's always a great feeling so

02:23:59.220 --> 02:24:02.300
But Missy, you know, I'm gonna ask you any final thoughts for our listeners tonight

02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:10.100
I'm already sort of thinking about next time I come out. I do I do still need to cover some Bay Area trains

02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:12.100
So I'm gonna spend a few days there

02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:16.940
Considering some other stuff I want to do. I'm gonna spend a couple days in San Jose, I think next time

02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:19.040
Oh, yeah, good. Good call go to round one

02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:25.420
Well, actually round one will be here by this time next year. So but I do already have a round one card for San Jose

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:30.520
But if if you know my Twitter if you know have me on Facebook

02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:34.880
And if you have ideas or want to meet up and you have permission to poke me wherever you know me

02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:37.940
Well, that's that's quite generous permission misty

02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:39.940
Okay

02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:42.140
That's also

02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:45.700
Considering that's why I'm saying if you already know the correct info. Ah, gotcha

02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:46.380
All right

02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:52.200
Let me ask this real quick because I don't I don't get to indulge your your deep knowledge of transit and your travels

02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:58.580
But what would you say is like, you know of all the cities that you've gone to in the world and you know experience

02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:04.980
They're they're trans and so forth. What is like the the train ride you need to go on in the u.s

02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:06.980
What is the train ride you need to experience?

02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:09.940
I

02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:15.900
Even with how am checks and sort of seems to be falling apart if if you could if you could go

02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:17.860
on the

02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:23.260
Accela runs between Washington and Boston don't have to necessarily go the whole route

02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:27.620
But I would recommend that especially in first class because that is the closest thing

02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:35.180
We have to real a high-speed rail and even remotely empower with international trains. Okay, are you mean Washington State or Washington DC DC?

02:25:35.180 --> 02:25:38.300
That's my figure. Okay, so DC to Boston. Okay, very cool. All right. Thank you

02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:43.400
All right, we'll see you next time and they'll see you in chat in the mean in the interim. So, all right

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:49.460
Let's see act Efton chat saying I wish misty and I could have met up this time around but sadly my schedule couldn't let me

02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:53.260
And it wasn't easy for me to make the trip to where it would have been convenient to meet up

02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:55.820
So, but he says again

02:25:56.340 --> 02:26:02.540
Maybe we'll work. Maybe we can work the logistics up because while I don't tolerate flights

02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:06.540
I was half-poking on Greyhound a

02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:10.540
Flight would be tolerable to the to the buses in this case

02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:16.500
Sometimes sometimes an hour up and down. It ain't so bad as yeah also considering

02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:23.480
If even with my very little grasp of languages, I know more Japanese than I do Spanish

02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:28.460
So it's like well fuck I might as well just not deal with transferring in a foreign city

02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:30.460
No better way to learn than immersion

02:26:30.980 --> 02:26:34.340
Or so I hear anyway, thank you for being here misty

02:26:37.340 --> 02:26:41.100
All right, let's go around and get our other final thoughts I'll save Jamie for later

02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:44.880
So this is our first show back in a bit. So Loki I'll go to you. What's your final thought final thought is?

02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:47.780
Maybe I'll play games this week

02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:52.500
That would be a good idea to come to a video game podcast to talk about the things I'm working on

02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:55.300
my final thought this week is

02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:58.540
cross your fingers and send me your

02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:01.380
Motivational vibes I guess because

02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:03.520
Thanks to Alan's new job

02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:09.500
We have a gym membership again, and so I need to it's time to turn this a jigglypuff into wigglytuff

02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:15.220
So that's gonna be the upcoming plan. So there's that sex. I didn't I didn't invent that that's on a shirt

02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:25.160
Well sadly I have to work, but you know I'd love to otherwise and last but certainly not least dark soccer

02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:27.300
It's great to have you back here permanently

02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:30.300
What's your final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:33.540
I

02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:35.780
Love acupuncture a lot

02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:40.260
but don't go to someone who does distal acupuncture make sure it is direct and

02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:43.020
Then be prepared to be really lightheaded

02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:50.380
That's it all right a life tip from dark soccer. That's gonna do it for us here in studio. Have a wonderful week everybody

02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:56.140
We'll see you in seven days right back here on Twitch for a special st. Patrick's Day edition of olr
