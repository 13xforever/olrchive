00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week, gaming continues its new era of pivot, Microsoft is ditching exclusivity,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Nintendo is both mobile and big screen, and Sony officially ends its handheld gaming machine.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't know where gaming will end up, but we'll explain where it is.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This, along with the rest of the gaming news, starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
live tonight with episode number 766 for this March 3rd of 2019.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as he does every week here on the show is Techmaster Loki.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm here.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm multitasking.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You are multitasking.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're having to kind of make some arrangements on the fly tonight.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, not joining us tonight, unfortunately, is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I do know this was supposed to be the first week that she was back with the show.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Unfortunately, guys, I was just informed a couple hours ago, there's been a death in her family.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Unfortunately, her husband's stepdad, and they were close, passed away.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, obviously, a lot of our thoughts and well wishes to DarkSakura, and I've let her know.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Anything we can do to help, we will do, but sometimes in situations like these,

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
you just need some time to do, process, think, and do all of that.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, that is exactly what we're going to let DarkSakura do.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, we'll hold down the fort with just myself and Loki tonight,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and if she's ready to come back next week, then we'll be all ready for that.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But joining us adjacent to the studio is Mr. Smoosh, making a ruckus of noise here.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, I apologize if that gets picked up by the mic.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know why he's bonkers crazy tonight.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, he's fed. We take excellent care of him here. I think he just gets bored.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think he wants another cat, but I'm like, ugh.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't get me wrong, I want another cat.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I just don't want to deal with all the landlord stuff that comes with having another cat.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But soon, soon, we'll figure all that out.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Anyhow, you guys, of course, can join us live, because we do tape live every Sunday night,

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but broadcasting live on Twitch, at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
right after our pal, The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bobby Black Wolf and his show.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And, yes, thank you guys in chat. I see all the love pouring out from our chat room.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Definitely will pass that along to Miss Summers.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Anyhow, DarkSakura in chat says,

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sounds like my wife, she was thinking of getting another cat to keep hers company.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think it's the only thing that'll calm some cats down.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And Mr. Smoosh is such a social cat that I'm sure he wants somebody else.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But then you have to deal with the whole, you got to bring, you know, he's already,

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
when we rescued him, he was three years old, so now he's going on four years old.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So he's kind of already, you know, at a certain age, it's kind of hard to mix cats together sometimes.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You have to make sure it's going to be a good fit.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The whole reason we got Mr. Smoosh in the first place is that the person who originally rescued him,

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
because somebody, the original owners, just left him outside, which is really tragic, obviously.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But the original person who rescued him tried to bring him in,

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but the existing cat that she had was not having it.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, you know, it's kind of a big risk in that regard.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It kind of helps if they're already together when they're littler.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But anyway, I don't mean to turn it into a cat discussion show.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
After all, I just saw one of those shows on Netflix this past week.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There's a cat discussion show?

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, it was, well, like a cat rescue show. It looked like it was Rescue 911 for cats.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Rescue Cats?

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think that's what it was. Something like that.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know, it was definitely a British show.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now, is it the cats rescuing people? Because that would be more interesting.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No, it was the people.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, I don't know what the actual is. Somebody in chat will shout it out.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There was a show all about cats.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But there's also a cat fashion show one, or something.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Like best in show, you remember that movie?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Like a documentary on that stuff for cats? For real?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So it's like with cats, except they're trying to get them to do the obstacle course,

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and the cat's like, I'm not doing that.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But there's another one. There's another cat documentary that just hit Netflix as well.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, what can you do?

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, we finally picked up Hulu, so now I'm going through the entire series of

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Good choice.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because that's awesome.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And then I needed to do the same with South Park, because I'm several seasons behind in South Park.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In fact, I'm feeling that tonight. Does your cat make too much noise?

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Anyways, that's my favorite episode of Always Sunny.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, actually my favorite episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is the night man and the day man.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Everybody knows that episode if you've ever seen.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's the best one. But anyway.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We could be a TV discussion show, I suppose, but we're actually here to talk about video games.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's gaming culture!

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It is. It is gaming culture.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If I-

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's It's Always Sunny.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Listen, they have all of these shows have memorabilia in GameStop. GameStop is a game store.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Therefore, this is perfectly fine.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, fine. Alright.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But let's get into the kickoff topic tonight, which is a little bit depressing.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I mean, it's one of those things we've kind of been talking about for a little while.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We knew it was coming, but official this week.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Officially done this week, right, Loki?

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sure, it's officially done. The Vita. It's no more.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They've ended the-

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They were down to like, I think last week when we reported on, they were down to two of the SKUs that were still available.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And now those are done.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So the Vita is no longer being sold by Sony any longer.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And they have no plans for another portable system as of yet that we're aware of.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I bet you anything Switch does really well.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everybody likes to copy Nintendo, so we'll see.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What do you think, and I'm going to open this up to our chatters as well in our Twitch TV chat room at VOG Network.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What do you guys think were the good moments of the PlayStation Vita and the bad moments of the PlayStation Vita?

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Like why it's not continuing when the 3DS still has game releases coming out in the coming months with Luigi's Mansion and all that.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What were the good things about the Vita?

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because we're not going to be one of those podcasts that's only negative about games.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So what were the good things, and then what were the not so good things that Sony could have done better?

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm going to open this to chat to them.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The good things were, I would say, the hardware was nice.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean it was a nice system altogether.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They tried to pull like that back tap thing, which was not- that wasn't working out.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think some of the games that they had released on it were really nice.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It was a powerful system as far as being able to play PlayStation 1 games, PSP games, the PlayStation Mobile stuff, the indies.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They had the Vita TV, which was also- it was cool, but no one really picked it up.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know, I think overall it was a pretty decent system.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, I think the Vita was a really nice piece of hardware, like it really was.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It was a solid system, it was good to look at, very beautiful screen, great for like watching Netflix and things like that.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And they did some cool things like originally with it, but I don't know if it like- because I sold my Vita pretty quickly.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I had picked one up at one time, and then I was like, I'm just not playing this, and so I ended up selling it for something.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't remember what it was, I just ended up getting rid of it.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And one of the things I remember it doing was kind of like showing you players that were nearby, like locally.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Like it would just say, hey, this person's interested in this, or you can like exchange things between people.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It was almost like kind of a spot pass for 3DS, but not quite. I don't really know how to describe it.

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I think that while you're on that, that was one of the big negatives on the PlayStation Vita for me, was that things like that didn't make sense.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sony never did a really good job explaining some of these features and why some of these features were needed.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I think the biggest example of that, Loki, was 3G. Do you remember that the PlayStation Vita had 3G?

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So here was PlayStation Vita 3G. Does 3G allow you to play multiplayer over a cell phone connection? No, it does not.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, so what does it do?

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I don't think there was ever like a real, no, no, you're stream did not just die. I don't think there was ever a real answer.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No, it didn't really do anything. It was just, it was too...

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Doesn't that scream missed opportunity? Like there should have been a Sony developed game that was capable of playing over 3G.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I realized maybe because of the unreliability of the cell networks or whatever, maybe like a first person shooter type of game at the time would not have been it.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No, no, no. You remember, there are some games that allowed you to play over 3G.

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And this is where the whole asynchronous multiplayer bullshit came into play.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, what? Because I'm forgetting.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's like taking turns or ghost data or some shit like that.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, I was going to say like a card game or a board game. Eye of Judgment for Vita would have been great because it would have...

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Had Eye of Judgment for Vita.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Maybe I want to correct the record, but you know what I mean? Like those types of games, like as much as you say, you know, the A secret, you know, if again, if they had maybe marketed that a little more, you know, because Nintendo has a way of being able to market those kinds of games and make you understand why you need them like clubhouse games.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Can you imagine if Nintendo's clubhouse games was like a Vita?

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And it also had, I think, a front and rear camera on the thing too, which...

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It did, which also never really made sense.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But they have that on the DS and stuff as well, so that didn't make any sense.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know. There's just a lot of tech in there that like, like the back touch sensor, I never understood the need for that.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Aside from there's a couple games that use it, but it's kind of gimmicky.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Some Sony things are hit and miss sometimes, like 6-axis didn't end up being a thing, but DualShock, like now you can't imagine life without it.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The tilt sensor stuff, they still use that in some games. A lot of people don't really care for it, but they use it sometimes.

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's get some comments from chat over at VOG Network over on Twitch.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
YYR comments, I still own the 3G Vita, and if it could have been used as a phone, I would still be using it as my smartphone.

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It was my first portable internet-enabled device. I used it for Twitter, Foursquare, and web browsing.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, I mean, yes, it could do all those things, but, you know, Sony never really, at least in this country, you know, it's hard for me to say...

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I really think that they could come out with a new portable system.

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think so, too. I think Sony should try again.

157
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And actually, like, just, you know, get a decent, you know, cell processor in there so you can actually do, like, 4G, you know, calling and data or whatever.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think if Sony were to try this again, though, I think one thing I would really want to advise them to do is don't have a one-year plan.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do not have a one-year plan on what this console is going to do.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, that's the other thing, too.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Have a three-year plan. Because it feels like Sony, like, completely abandoned it.

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, no, no, no. I remember now, the 3G thing, too, about that. You were locked with AT&T, and they had cell phone plans with that as well, and they were expensive.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes, but I don't... I'm not going to fault Sony as hard for that because iPhone was in the first situation.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Remember, iPhone was AT&T exclusive for the longest time, and it still managed to be okay.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So, I mean, that's something that could have grown as time went on.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Maybe they had an agreement where AT&T was going to push the Vita in their own stores, and that's why they signed onto it.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's why these companies make those types of agreements sometimes.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Just like why an indie game would sign onto PlayStation exclusive in the first place.

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because, like, a game like No Man's Sky, because Sony was going to help them market and help push them for better or for worse than that particular case.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And it was also a great device for remote play as well.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

172
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know, they used to do that pretty well.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, and I just feel like this device was capable of so much more than Sony really ever did a good job of communicating,

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
or really had the faith in pushing forward with their first-party games.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Because, you know, again, one thing Nintendo always does well is that they really sell it with their first-party games.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They kind of... I know some of the games that they put out on it were pretty good, but like the ones you would...

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that was it.

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No, but the ones that were supposed to be really good, like Killzone, or I think they had a Call of Duty game on there,

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
they were like outsourced to third parties to do that.

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And not even saying like the Call of Duty one was outsourced to the normal Call of Duty teams.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It was like outsourced to some smaller company to put these games together, and they weren't that great.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And that was kind of the problem.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's like these big games that you really want to draw people in for, they just didn't really have them.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Going to chat for some more comments.

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Kaijuto disagrees and says, no, Sony, don't do another portable.

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
PSVR. Work on getting a flippin' theater app for PSVR.

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
As Joe 100 Matt says, I'm with Kaijuto, actually, they should never do another handheld and just focus more on PSVR.

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And storage. They're proprietary memory cards.

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That was a choice.

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That was probably a bad call.

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's see, and then YYR also said in chat, anyone releasing a dedicated portable at this point is suicidal.

192
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Interesting.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't think that's necessarily true.

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I mean, is it because phones, I'd like to kind of dissect that comment a little bit.

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Is it because phones are more and more becoming like that's the only device you need and it plays games?

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No.

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because are tablets even selling, because I would say, but tablets, people are still buying tablets.

198
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But are they? Because iPads, you don't hear about those.

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, iPads are expensive.

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
iPads are trying to sell those as almost like computer laptop replacements or something like that.

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, but Android tablets too. I don't really hear about those selling like they did five years ago.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Right. I don't think necessarily because, you know, a lot of people still have their tablets from five years ago.

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's the problem with a tablet like that. You don't really need to, like, my kids have cheap ass tablets.

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I mean, they were like $70 tablets that they have and they're just fine.

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean, those things can't do shit. They can't play anything.

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I mean, they can play some things. They play Minecraft and Roblox, but they can't play shit.

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So, granted, we could upgrade to a better tablet or, you know, for less money than buying an Android tablet,

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
we can buy a Nintendo Switch or a 3DS, you know, or something like that.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you think the answer is for PlayStation 5 to look like a Nintendo Switch where you can play it on your TV and it's portable?

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, that would certainly help me in the situations where I don't have access to my TV.

211
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't think it's necessary.

212
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, it would be a little weird to see Sony and Microsoft, like, go full-on.

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's just go full-on bizarre. Let's just do that it's all AR. It's just an AR headset to play that shit.

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I think it would be smarter for these companies to adapt Switch-like technology and something that could beam to your cell phones.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Like, you could play, like, on your iPhone, you know, they just, or Android, whatever, both devices.

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's just an app that allows you to do the remote play on your app.

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Although, granted, like, obviously, I don't think PlayStation games will play very well on a touch-only screen as well.

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like, you really need a controller. But maybe there's some things you could do through your, you know, Box, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Next, whatever it is,

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that, you know, you could beam over to your iPhone.

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I just think they should stop introducing new tech, or new, like, not necessarily new tech, new gimmicks to the hardware,

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
like new control schemes and stuff like that, unless they have some good uses for it.

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like, don't, you know, even with, like, the 3D stuff. The 3D stuff with the 3DS is pretty awesome, but no one ended up using it.

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It was kind of a gimmick. And then, and it wasn't really a gimmick, it was because of the stupid health warnings.

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Because they're like, oh, it's gonna hurt people's eyes! The young children are gonna go blind!

225
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And then, it's that bullshit that fucking ruined the 3D stuff. That's what it was, it's that bullshit. Otherwise, it would've been cool.

226
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And then, um, the rear touch thing, they have a front touch and rear touch on it, that's a little stupid.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I, I get the front touch screen, the rear touch, is that, that's just a fucking gimmick.

228
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
A little bit. It just, maybe they just didn't have the game that really sold you on the concept.

229
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Because I can understand, and somebody in chat had said it, I'm sorry, I forget who.

230
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But that, like, when you're using front touch, your fingers are getting in the way of the screen.

231
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
When you're using back touch, you can still see the entire screen, and yet, you know, be using your fingers in the back.

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I just don't think they really had the game to really show that strongly.

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Again, you would think that Sony would develop that game, but Sony and Nintendo don't really design games the same way.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And are able to show off the hardware, and I think that's one big place where Sony, Vita, you know, kind of didn't do us well here.

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But then again, you know, one thing we have to remember, in Japan, this is a very different story.

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The Vita continued to do well over there for quite some time, uh, still being, I think even still today, there's still some Vita games coming out.

237
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But it's gonna, it's gonna dry up pretty quick now that...

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But why is that?

239
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if I know the answer to that.

240
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Is it because, uh, you know, I think it, is it because the fact that a lot of their pop...

241
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Maybe they explained it better there?

242
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
A lot of their population is using mass transit, so like portable devices are more popular.

243
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Sure, sure.

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Or the fact that, you know, maybe, you know, a home theater setup might be a little bit more rare because of spacing issues.

245
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know what the case may be, but whatever that was, the messaging wasn't over here.

246
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't think they really pushed it that hard over here either.

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think you're more on to something with the fact that there's more, there's a bigger market for portable gaming in Japan because, you know, everything, you know, people can more walk to a point or they take mass transit.

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's not, you know, quite the same culture 100% as it is here from getting from point A to point B for many people.

249
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know.

250
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah. So, anyway, um, let's see, YYR says in our chat, Japanese developers supported the Vita much, much better.

251
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And that's another thing that it kind of comes down to is that, you know, those types of games that we don't see as much of here, like visual novels and, you know, those sorts of things.

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Those continue to have a strong life on the Vita and, you know, those types of games just don't really have the same market here as they do in Japan.

253
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Um, let's see, uh, and YYR says, if you look at the games released in North America for Vita over the last few years, it's Indies and Japanese games.

254
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And yeah, that's pretty much all that's been carrying the Vita for a while is those Japanese games do get translated and Indies because, you know what, if I'm not mistaken, Unity had like a Vita output type of feature.

255
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So, I mean, it's, you know, as long as the door's been open for Indies to be able to publish their stuff on Vita, of course, they're going to keep doing it because, you know, if I'm an indie developer, I just want to get my game out there just as many places as possible.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And so the Vita has always kind of been, I think, an attractive, you know, option.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah. So, uh, for sure. Um, let's see, uh, Sia Tabiri pointing out that also the mini disc had a huge life in Japan.

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So, you know, some things just, I think sometimes not always explainably do better over there than they do over here for whatever reason.

259
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Um, let's see, Kaijuto saying the Vita doesn't have an R3 or L3, so the back touch was needed.

260
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Uh, that kind of took the place of the clicking, uh, the, the analytics.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, it doesn't have an R2, yeah.

262
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Uh, oh, maybe that's what, yeah.

263
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
R2, yeah, it's R2, L2. It did have the clicking on the, the controller.

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I think you tapped, you tapped the top for one and the bottom for another. Like, I think you...

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You couldn't push in the, oh, maybe you couldn't push in the LX. I don't know, it's been a long time.

266
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think, I think you tapped the top for two and the bottom for three or something like that. I think that's how it worked.

267
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Um, if our, it's been a little bit, obviously, but, uh, if you were doing remote play, you kind of had to do that.

268
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That would stand in for some of those buttons that was missing on the, uh, Vita otherwise versus a PlayStation 4.

269
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm just so surprised that they didn't push the Vita TV or even, like, rebrand the...

270
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I mean, honestly, like, the Vita TV, they could have pushed that with...

271
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I think that was a huge mistake, too.

272
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Like a PlayStation, like a PlayStation Classic, because the PlayStation Classic is like $99.99.

273
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Just throw in a fucking DualShock in the PlayStation TV and, like, change up how they store it.

274
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I mean, maybe USB storage or something to it and you have a solid device that can not only play PlayStation Classic games,

275
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
but, oh, hey, look, there's this library of Vita titles.

276
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hugely missed opportunity. They should have just rebranded the Vita TV as a PlayStation Classic, loaded it with 20 pre-done games,

277
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and then sold it for $99.99. I think that was a huge missed opportunity.

278
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Uh, granted, it could have come a year sooner, because I think the Vita was already on its way out the door

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
at the time PlayStation, the actual PlayStation Classic, got out the door.

280
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Speaking of PlayStation Classic, I want to make sure I get this comment from Bobby, who says,

281
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
as far as the Vita, it was my Suikoden and Final Fantasy PlayStation 1 machine.

282
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It made a great PlayStation Classic.

283
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So, um, yeah, and it made a great PSP player, too, because you could download things that,

284
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
as long as you bought it digitally on PSP, you could download it on Vita as well, or, you know, they did sales and things like that.

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So, like, I remember my Vita had that Final Fantasy IV remake they did on PSP that's great.

286
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like, that version doesn't exist anywhere else but the PSP, because they went the 3D route when they did it for the DS,

287
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and then they made that version, the one that they sold on Steam and PC and all the other places, on tablets and stuff.

288
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So, like, that 2D remake of Final Fantasy IV, which includes the After Years stuff, too,

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that's only on PSP and Vita, thanks to the PSP compatibility.

290
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So, yeah, what a bummer.

291
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah.

292
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So, alright, well, you know, just some memories of the Vita.

293
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I just, man, you just think if they'd just done a couple other things differently, it might have gone a lot further,

294
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and it'll always kind of baffle the mind why they didn't maybe just try to put a little more in it.

295
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know if it would have ever outsold the 3DS, but I think, you know, the Vita could have been a bigger brand than it was,

296
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and I think that example of the PlayStation Classic piggybacking on existing Vita technology is a great example.

297
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Which is why I think with the technology being where it is, I don't think it's impossible for them to come out with another handheld device.

298
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I mean, I don't know. They may not do that. They don't want to take risks.

299
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
YYR in chat says, the other reason PlayStation TV was a failure, where were the streaming apps?

300
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
No, Netflix was a huge blow.

301
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And SSG100Matt, with a very interesting comment that follows that up, they were too busy trying to develop the Vue at the time,

302
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and PlayStation Vue does very, very well still.

303
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Interesting thought on that is that maybe Sony's desire, because by the nature, Sony is not just a gaming company.

304
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We know that, right? Sony is a TV building company. They are a movie-making studio. Sony Pictures, right?

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sony does a lot more than games, and maybe sometimes the desire to keep everything Sony, Sony, Sony, maybe works against them in some of these places.

306
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Which, that's a very, very fair thought, is that maybe they didn't want to do Netflix or Hulu because Sony was trying to push their own thing,

307
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and that it ended up working so well because that's not always what the market wants.

308
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Sometimes it works in their favor. Blu-ray worked out for them.

309
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Beta versus VHS didn't work out so well for them, right? Because they were the beta team, wasn't Sony the beta team?

310
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, I think so.

311
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah, and I think beta was still used in broadcast news for a long time, but that's about, you know, even now, that's all digital, and that beta and VHS are long gone,

312
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,000
but that brief period of time when I was interning at a news station, they were using beta tapes for sure, so that's a very niche thing.

313
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So, anyway, let's see, a couple other comments in chat, and then we're going to move on to our gaming weeks here.

314
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's see, Bobby Bockel says, Vita had a YouTube app, but took it offline when YouTube upped the API. Interesting.

315
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And YYR says, I feel like it was missing a lot of popular video apps.

316
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
PodCulture saying, Vita did have a Netflix app. So, and yeah, just maybe it took a little time to come out,

317
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
but you know what else doesn't have a Netflix app and seems to be doing very well for itself? The Switch.

318
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Still no Netflix app on the Switch. It has Hulu, but no Netflix, and still seems to be doing okay.

319
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But of course, obviously, you can't really one for one the Switch and the Vita because it's just different stuff.

320
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The whole fact that you can take it with you, you know, it's a console and a portable, and just the fact that, you know,

321
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Nintendo making the strong, strong first party libraries that you can only play, you know, you can only play Breath of the Wild on a Nintendo product.

322
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You know, because technically you can play it on the Wii U, but we know most people playing on the Switch, right?

323
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You can only play Mario Kart 8 and Mario Maker and stuff on a Nintendo product.

324
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You can't play any of those.

325
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Officially.

326
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Well, yes, officially, of course. All right. Anyway. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about what we've been doing with our gaming weeks.

327
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Maybe we've been playing the Vita or maybe not. Well, how was your gaming week, Loki? What have you been playing this week?

328
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I haven't played much of anything, to be honest. I played a little bit of Pokemon Go this week.

329
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I haven't really been playing any games this week. I've been trying to get back into programming again.

330
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So I was going through, like, one course online just to kind of a code log thing, and then I got bored with it really fast because it was just too basic stuff.

331
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I really had to skip ahead on it, and I was like, nah, no, I'm not going to waste my time on this. I'm just going to do something else.

332
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So that's what I'm going to do is I'm doing something else. But I was messing with that for a while.

333
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And then what else did I play? I played... I downloaded the LEGO Movie 2 game, which is actually very different than the other LEGO games that they have out right now.

334
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's more like open world. It's kind of similar to LEGO Worlds versus any of the other LEGO games.

335
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So I haven't gotten a chance to dive into too much of that because my kid's been hogging the Switch.

336
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He was playing LEGO Movie 2, and then he got bored with that too. Or got frustrated with it, I should say, and he's been still playing through LEGO Incredibles.

337
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So I've been doing that. Haven't played any DDR this week. I've been really bad about that.

338
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
The problem is at work I've been so busy I've been skipping lunches, and so I'm under my calorie count just without the exercise.

339
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And also this week has been crazy with the rain and everything. So I've been under my calories exercise-wise, or without exercise, and then when I come home I end up having to cook or do something.

340
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So all my time is gone at that point.

341
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So I haven't played any DDR this week, unfortunately, but I've been meaning to get back to it.

342
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Eventually it'll happen.

343
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Anyone else? I did play a little bit of Crackdown 3. Just still grinding out the last few bits of my skill points I need.

344
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And then, yeah, that's pretty much it for right now. I mean, I'm hopefully getting to maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 at some point.

345
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Or I'll just completely forget about the game. You know, that may happen too.

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Don't do that. I mean, you've still got a good, what, 12 years until you do another game.

347
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Well, Final Fantasy XV too. I still haven't even-

348
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh my god, get on that. It's a fun game.

349
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Most of that. So I don't know.

350
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Anyway, let's see, my gaming week. So I'll kind of follow up your calorie chat and what to do when it's raining and stuff,

351
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
because I've actually found this week I kind of got sucked into PlayStation VR, which I think you'll be happy with.

352
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You know, because I, for whatever reason, just I was kind of waiting for that killer app that I wanted on VR,

353
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and now I've been playing more and more Beat Saber on PlayStation VR.

354
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I did a little stream on Tuesday where I was playing it, and one thing that I've noticed as I've been playing more Beat Saber

355
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
is that I'm actually getting exercise, and I'm burning calories, and it's counting on my watch for all the calories burned.

356
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
My heart rate is getting up. I'm hurting my back like crazy because I'm probably not stretching properly before I play,

357
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and I don't know if it's something about the motion of swiping when you play Beat Saber or whatever,

358
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
but it's been a good workout, so that's been something to do when it's been raining to still get a little bit of exercise.

359
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I've been playing more PlayStation VR. Beat Saber specifically, I'm up to, I think I've cleared three expert level songs now,

360
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
so it's kind of like, wow, I'm progressing in a music game that I have a lot of enthusiasm about.

361
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I haven't felt this since, like, back when I played DDR regularly, you know?

362
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Well, maybe like Rock Band. I don't know. When I played Rock Band pretty hard, I think I,

363
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
there's a lot of stuff in those games I really wanted to clear out, but yeah, it's been nice to get up and moving.

364
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Another kind of like exercise related game, I actually put like a question on my Twitter.

365
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I was like, hey, what other types of like exercise games or what other VR games give you a really good workout,

366
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
because I'm really loving this idea that like I'm playing, you know, Beat Saber and I'm getting,

367
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and don't say just dance, give me like some games I haven't heard of.

368
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So somebody on Twitter recommended to me, I play a game called Sprint Vector.

369
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So I downloaded that as well, and I've been playing that a little bit, and that one's really interesting too,

370
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
because you, it's like a racing game, but not with cars. You're like, I guess I would compare it to like skiing.

371
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's kind of like, or like rollerblading is kind of like what you're doing in that game.

372
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Like futuristic, but like what you do is you use, like you're holding the controllers

373
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and you do this motion like left, right, and like alternating.

374
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Like imagine like you're kind of like skiing or something. You're on like a Stairmaster or something

375
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
where you're going back and forth with the different move controllers.

376
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And that's kind of how you control the character, and then which way you look kind of depends on which way you drive.

377
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And you can get a really cool, like you can hit both center buttons to like jump,

378
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and it's a really kind of cool sensation in VR. And yeah, I've been enjoying that.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I ran into a few issues, especially, and you could see this when I was live streaming,

380
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
a cheap plug for my personal channel, Rob Roberts, when I was doing my personal stream earlier this week.

381
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
One problem I was running into is like, I thought I was going the wrong direction on the course

382
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
because all these arrows showed up saying, hey idiot, go this way.

383
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And it took me a little bit to figure out what the reason why that error was showing up

384
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
is because I turned to the right. So I'd started to look this way because I was going this way.

385
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But what was happening is that the camera couldn't see the VR headset anymore.

386
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So it was saying you need to turn and look at the camera so I can see which way you're going

387
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
because I should have been using the quick turn buttons to actually do the turn.

388
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So my only complaint about Sprint Vector is I don't think that mixing of the real turning with your head

389
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and the quick turning, I don't think that works as well as the developers intended.

390
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It wasn't as intuitive. And the fact that it took me a long time to figure out

391
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
why is the game yelling at me like it should have said out of camera range

392
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
or it should have had some type of error or something, they came up to tell me

393
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and I would have figured that out a lot faster. So I feel like that was one place where I was like,

394
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
ooh, this Sprint Vector could have, maybe the tutorials could have been a little better in the beginning

395
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
to tell me about that type of stuff. In all fairness, I did not play as far as the intermediate tutorials

396
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
but I kind of felt like I didn't need to to beat the first couple courses.

397
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
If I need to go that far in tutorials, then maybe the tutorials are too long

398
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and that's something else that should be because the tutorials I did do were kind of,

399
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
but it takes a little bit to explain. It's like, push the button, then release,

400
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and I got it, but obviously I was still having problems.

401
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But otherwise, that little complaint aside, I do enjoy the real, I think that idea of how to control it

402
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
is a great idea for an exercise type game and it feels great to play.

403
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I love the sensation of jumping and coasting and there are some levels where you fall down a hole

404
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and it's kind of like, whoa, it almost kind of makes you, like, if you're a motion sick type of person,

405
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
you ain't going to have a good time playing it, but if you're able to stomach it,

406
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
okay, I think it's a lot of fun, actually. So, again, that's Sprint Vectors.

407
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's another VR game I checked out this week.

408
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Other games I've been playing, I've been continuing my adventures in Phantasy Star online.

409
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
If you, again, have been watching my first channel.

410
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The original one?

411
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, the original, Blueburst.

412
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay.

413
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We're playing on a private server that exists out there and it's very, just go to Google, y'all.

414
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You'll probably find the same one we're playing on.

415
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But, you know, Sega doesn't really care about Blueburst anymore.

416
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So is Blueburst the same as, like, the Dreamcast Phantasy Star?

417
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Pretty much, it has Episode 4.

418
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh, okay.

419
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And it was the PC one.

420
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I thought it was a sequel or something.

421
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, it's, PSO Blueburst is just the PC version of PSO.

422
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So, and it was the last version they put out, I think.

423
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It was after GameCube, for sure, I know that, and probably Xbox as well.

424
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So that's where the private servers are.

425
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So my buddy Delvin over at VG Realness.

426
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, I see them, I see the notifications every time we stream.

427
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah, well, because it's been a few times.

428
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We were streaming last week and then we did a couple nights this week.

429
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And that's been fun because he's been like, oh no, you're gonna beat this game.

430
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm in it, you never beat games, you're beating this.

431
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So we've been having a good time just getting through the story.

432
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And it's good because, you know, it's not a very complicated game.

433
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So it's fun to just sit there and be adventuring together and just talk about other stuff.

434
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And that's what usually happens, is that thanks to chat,

435
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
thanks to other people that will randomly join the stream,

436
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
like Bobby was with us one night, Shane was on Discord with us one night.

437
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And so we would just talk about other random stuff.

438
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And I think it makes for great streams.

439
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I don't, I don't, hopefully you guys agree.

440
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But for those of you that have watched, hopefully you guys have been enjoying those streams.

441
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Because it's not even like just about PSO, but just, you know, having fun.

442
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Kicking back and playing a game and talking a little smack.

443
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So yeah, that's been a big part of my week as well.

444
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And then, I'm trying to think, I've still been playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV as well.

445
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I had to log in to save my house.

446
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Otherwise, I can't think of a lot of like new stuff I've really been playing.

447
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I did do the new raid boss in Pokémon GO since you brought that up.

448
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I did that.

449
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And I was having, I was on a field day in Pokémon GO the other day.

450
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What's really funny is that one of my long time Pokémon GO playing friends

451
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
just got into Ingress finally after all these years and started playing that.

452
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And like right at that same time, I was like, I want to play more Pokémon GO and get more gold gym badges.

453
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Because I've been ignoring the gym game in that game for so long outside of raids.

454
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And like as far as Ingress goes, and I mentioned this on a previous episode.

455
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm just kind of, I'm really bored.

456
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The day-to-day game in Ingress hasn't changed in like four years.

457
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Despite the prime client.

458
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So I'm kind of like just bored of it.

459
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Because, you know, again, how do you defeat that? Which has no life.

460
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And that's what it boils down to.

461
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But the live events are a lot of fun. So I still do the live events.

462
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But that's kind of it for me in that game right now.

463
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So anyway, that's pretty much it.

464
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That's what I've been playing for my gaming weeks.

465
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So I guess we'll move on.

466
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yes.

467
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
A little bit of housekeeping tonight.

468
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
DarkSakura, as I mentioned, she's not here tonight because she had a family emergency.

469
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And we do hope the best for her and Dan.

470
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But please bear with us a little bit because since we did just find that out a couple hours ago.

471
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So everything was planned for there to be three hosts tonight.

472
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And now there are two. So if things feel a little bit disorganized, sorry about that.

473
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But we're trying to fix things on the go.

474
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That being said, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

475
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Also, we would appreciate follows at our Twitch channel.

476
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network is where you can find us on Sunday nights.

477
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And we really appreciate, again, those of you that have been given the biddies and the subscriptions as well.

478
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
To see the video on demand.

479
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I've been very, very flattered and thankful to those of you that have been contributing in that forum.

480
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Thank you so much.

481
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Let's get to some news.

482
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news.

483
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yes. So apparently there is going to be Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC.

484
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Because, you know, they're a company and they have to make a lot of money.

485
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And they need to make more money than just selling the game.

486
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So how else to do that?

487
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Well, you develop DLC for it.

488
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So that's going to be a mix of kind of free and paid DLC.

489
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm not really sure exactly what's going to be available.

490
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But they said, you know, they're going to add some free DLC over time.

491
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And a paid DLC with several elements in one batch.

492
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And this is according to an article in Dengeki Online.

493
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Where Tetsuya Nomura was talking about the DLC and whether there's going to be a re-released final mix edition.

494
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And how they're going to do that.

495
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So I guess we'll wait and see what they add to it.

496
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Maybe New Worlds. Maybe more Cup Noodle sponsorship.

497
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Who knows?

498
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
A New World would be quite the undertaking.

499
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I would see maybe...

500
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
A lot of people have been asking where are the Final Fantasy characters in Kingdom Hearts 3.

501
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I mean, yes, the Moogles are there.

502
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But like, as far as like, you remember in the original Kingdom Hearts games, you had like, you know...

503
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Cloud.

504
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Cloud was there.

505
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And I don't know why they didn't call him Squall.

506
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They called him Leon.

507
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Aerith was there.

508
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And yeah, they changed his name for whatever reason.

509
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Which it does play into the Final Fantasy VIII story.

510
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But it is weird that we called him Squall there.

511
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Anyway.

512
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And then Sephiroth. Remember Lance Bass as Sephiroth in the original Kingdom Hearts?

513
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's missing from Kingdom Hearts 3 as well.

514
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So you would think it would be a little bit easier maybe for Square to develop on a Final Fantasy themed story.

515
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Then maybe having to go back to the table with Disney and negotiate for whatever else.

516
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Although I would think if I was Disney and I had a new movie coming out that I really wanted to promote.

517
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Maybe I would allow a new world to be made for it.

518
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But then again, what's the big Disney movie this winter?

519
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's live action remake world.

520
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh, there is that.

521
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But I was thinking Frozen 2 was the big thing they were pushing this holiday.

522
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But we already had Frozen, so I don't know if it really makes sense to do it again.

523
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But it's live action remake world where it's the same as the old worlds.

524
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's just done with live actors now.

525
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That's right, because we're getting Lion King this year.

526
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Is Aladdin this year too?

527
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Or is Aladdin next year?

528
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, I think Aladdin's this year.

529
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Wow, okay.

530
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Isn't there another one too?

531
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I know Little Mermaid is something they're talking about.

532
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Because didn't they already cast Zendaya for Ariel?

533
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Am I crazy on that?

534
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Fuck if I remember.

535
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't know.

536
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But anyway, I think that's something.

537
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, but Little Mermaid is probably next year.

538
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But yeah, they're revisiting all the 90s.

539
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We're running out of ideas.

540
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Remake all the...

541
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
If we're reviving 90s ideas, how about Kingdom Hearts goes to the 90s Lion King game from the Genesis.

542
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
How about that?

543
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
How about Kingdom Hearts goes to the 90s Disney Afternoon lineup?

544
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh, like Gummy Bears and stuff?

545
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Gummy Bears, Darkwing Duck.

546
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
There's the Gummy Ship.

547
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah, there you go.

548
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Darkwing Duck, DuckTales.

549
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Hell, even the new DuckTales is pretty good.

550
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Okay, act deft with all the receipts and chat.

551
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Aladdin is May, Lion King is July, Dumbo is this month.

552
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I knew there was another one.

553
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Dumbo is happening too.

554
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah.

555
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Anyway, let's see.

556
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
At least that one is like, you know, it's Tim Burton, so it's a little bit different.

557
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
A Marvel idea, of course.

558
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This is Joe 100 Matt says, how long will DLC take though?

559
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
They will be deep into Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 4 when it finally comes out, but certainly the Marvel.

560
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But again, that's all going to be agreements and signing.

561
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And does Marvel want to be involved in a Kingdom Hearts world when we know that there is a secret Marvel game project being worked on?

562
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Over at Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics, right?

563
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Crystal Dynamics, Tomb Raider is doing that game.

564
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah, so they're developing that game and you would think, based on the Tomb Raider reboot, that this Marvel game they're doing is probably going to be a more gritty, realistic type of game.

565
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That, I mean, we don't know.

566
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
We're just guessing based on, you know, what Tomb Raider looked like.

567
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Would they want to be in Kingdom Hearts at the same time? Maybe not. I don't know.

568
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Let's see, Act F pointing out that Scrooge McDuck does appear in Kingdom Hearts 3.

569
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That's right, he's the owner of the cafe, right?

570
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Where Ratatouille cooks all the dishes.

571
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I haven't played the game, so I don't know.

572
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You should get on that. Alright.

573
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And then see a Tiberian chat that suggests things like Lizzie McGuire and That's So Raven.

574
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
There you go.

575
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I mean, Raven Simonie is only, what, like in her 40s now, so it'd be really funny to see her come back and play that.

576
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Or like they could do, you know, I don't know. There's a lot of things that they could do.

577
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
None of which are good, but you know.

578
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We'll see, we'll see.

579
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Let's see. Oh, excuse me, Act F is saying at the top of his lungs in chat, Remi, the name of the rat is Remi.

580
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Sorry, that's one of the few Pixar movies I actually didn't see.

581
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I have not seen Ratatouille as well.

582
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I haven't either, it's just the one I missed. So, it happens.

583
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That and Brave. I haven't seen that or Brave.

584
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But Bobby, in our defense, saying the game does never name him, he's just the chef.

585
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
They never give him a name, he's just the chef.

586
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I thought that was the case.

587
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That they just give him a very vague name. Anyway.

588
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Alright, let's move on to some more news.

589
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Some big announcements this week out of Nintendo as they have unveiled Pokémon Generation 8.

590
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield is the new Pokémon 8th generation of games as they announced in a very brief 7 minute Nintendo Direct this week.

591
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Not Pokémon Gun, as some magazines in other countries have picked up and run with what the Twitterverse has done.

592
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Or there was a whole lot of parodies that were shown on our VOG Network Discord at vognetwork.com.

593
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Somebody posted a compilation.

594
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Journalism, what's that?

595
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I know, right? My favorite that I saw on Facebook was Pokémon Chonkala.

596
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Where the, uh, you know.

597
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I saw Pokémon Trebuchet.

598
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Okay. Right, or Catapult.

599
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Pokémon Aero I saw as well, which would kind of fit in with the Sword and Shield theme.

600
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But anyway, we got to see a little glimpse at the world, which appears to be a little more like, I think they're saying Scottish.

601
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Some are saying, kind of somewhere in there. Something like an old, Old Kingdom sort of look there.

602
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Um, to the games. I thought they looked really nice.

603
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But I did notice what a lot of y'all noticed, where the random encounter Pokémon seem to be back.

604
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Where you don't see them on the overworld like you would in the Go games.

605
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You still are back to random encounters. So some people kind of dissecting what could that all mean and all this.

606
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Of course, there's seven minutes of Pokémon Direct, which leads to the two hour discussion of the seven minute direct.

607
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Not that, I mean, we're a three hour weekly podcast on games, so I really have no reason, no room whatsoever to talk smack.

608
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But it is interesting how much dissection you can find on these, uh, little trailers.

609
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So anyway, and of course, there were brand new Pokémon unveiled, the starter Pokémon.

610
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Which is customary when they unveil a Pokémon generation, they say, and these are the three new Pokémon.

611
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
These are the Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle.

612
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's always the same three types too. It's always a water plant and fire.

613
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It is, I think that's part of the tradition, but when they evolve, they usually get a second typing.

614
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Like Blaziken was a fire fighting type. So, and the reason why I bring that up specifically is a lot of people are wondering.

615
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Is this new fire type that we have in this game, uh, Scorbunny, who's a little bunny that's a fire bunny.

616
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Is he a fire fighting type as well? And I don't, we don't know.

617
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Because we haven't seen what the evolutions look like.

618
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That hasn't stopped very creative artists out there from coming up with their own ideas on what the evolutions could look like.

619
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But we really won't know until Nintendo unveils all of that in a later Direct.

620
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Maybe at E3, but the Pokémon games really have always tended to do their own thing on their own timetable.

621
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
They don't follow any type of normal announcement standard with the rest of Nintendo.

622
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So, you know what? They will show the evolutions and all that when they're damn good and ready.

623
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But the other starters, a shout out for Grookey, which is the little grass monkey.

624
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Which is adorable. Did you see the Photoshop where somebody put a gun in his hand? That made me laugh.

625
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The internet does funny things sometimes.

626
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And, um, let's see, Sobble. If I'm saying that right. Sobble? Sobble? Sobble? Sobble. One of the two.

627
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
A water type lizard Pokémon who hides himself in water and there's a lot of folks talking about, uh,

628
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,000
it's the depression Pokémon and a lot of DATME over on Twitter and looking at that Pokémon, which I'm sure.

629
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Is there a typing of the three that you prefer, Loki? Is there one of these that is jumping out at you as one that you want to pick?

630
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
No. I don't want any of them.

631
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Are you not going to pick up Pokémon Gen 8?

632
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
No, I will. I don't know none of them. Probably the fire bunny.

633
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Uh, I would say, I'm on Team Grass Monkey.

634
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Grass Monkey. That funky monkey.

635
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yes, but it depends on what the evolutions look like. That's going to really sway me one way or the other, I think.

636
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I really want to know what the evolutions look like because if they're ridiculous, um, like, you know, I was not the biggest fan of, um, this guy's final evolution in the last series of games.

637
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So if it looks like that again, uh, then, you know, I might pick something else. Obviously I went for Litten last gen because I'm going to pick Firecat, of course.

638
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But, we'll see. We'll see what the, uh, maybe they'll come out with more plushies.

639
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Oh, what? Them merchandise? Never!

640
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
My kids have the socks, by the way.

641
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Um, s2100matt says, that Beastie Boys reference flew over Rob's head. No, it didn't. I've just heard it 5,000 times this week.

642
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Bobby Blackwell says, for the podcast audience, who is that guy? Oh, I'm sorry. This is Popplio. I'm sorry. Thank you.

643
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Sorry, podcasters. I was doing a visual there. Popplio is the, um, Pokemon I was holding up there and then Litten was the one I was saying, oh, this is the, this is the one that I, uh, uh, ended up choosing at the end of the day.

644
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Though the, um, Rowlet is super cute too. So, um, let's see.

645
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Siya Tiberian Chat says, you just need to start buying Pokemon Loafs. Don't I have enough Pokemon shit in this house? Like, you can already see it. This isn't even everything. I have other stuff too that's not, uh, displayed on the Twitch stream.

646
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I see several Pokemon already.

647
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah, right? So, uh, it's enough.

648
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Uh, Tyre Colin Chat says, you think he'll show up in the movie? Of course, there'll be 500 Pokemon movies. There's a Pokemon movie every year and the new starters will show up in the movie as well at some point.

649
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Of course, of course there will be.

650
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Alright, anyway, uh, that's the early stuff on Pokemon Sword and Shield and, uh, I'm, I'm happy they moved to Switch. I know there's some people that are, like, feeling kind of negative about the graphics and the changes and stuff, but I don't, I think it's way too early to make a snap judgment on the game.

651
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Like, there's gonna be plenty more directs over the coming months that show us more and more details. Pokemon games are always full of things to do. In fact, one of my criticisms about Pokemon, I sometimes get overwhelmed with that there is too much shit to do.

652
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And I'm left feeling, like, I don't know what to do because, because there's Pokemon Fashion Show as, like, a side thing that you're supposed to do and it's, like, I don't, I don't have time for this or, or growing the trees and all this stuff.

653
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Which apparently you don't have to do any of that stuff, but I, I feel like, I don't, I just can't not do it when it's there. It's too much to do. Anyway.

654
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So we'll see. We'll see, uh, what they announce more for Pokemon in the coming directs, uh, in the coming months.

655
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
In the meantime, uh, Loki, you got this next one, right?

656
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes. So PUBG is getting a parental lock on the game, basically, that requires, uh, children under the age of 13 to unlock it, uh, with the help of their parents. Of course, this is not in all regions.

657
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
This is mainly just in, uh, it's being piloted for Chinese versions of the game. Um, they're actually doing this with, uh, PUBG Mobile and Honor of the Kings.

658
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And so with this, they have, I guess, a way for your parents to basically go and sign in, uh, with, like, a parental code or something like that to unlock the game so that, you know, give your children permission to be able to play it.

659
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Because, you know, games are horrible and will cause your children to become stupid.

660
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Well, I think this is more like when the kid, and maybe your kids aren't quite at that age yet, but they're going to be there pretty soon.

661
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:38,000
When the kid takes the tablet to bed with them and they're up all night playing games on the tablet. I know this is a struggle I've heard from other parents that have kids of a certain age.

662
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's like they take their phone to bed with them and they're up all night on the fucking phone. So there should be a way to, like, shut down the game so they can't do that stuff after a certain hour.

663
00:48:47,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah, and along with that, you know, it's basically saying that the new controls, um, it limits whether they can be played online, um, they have rules to reduce screen time, um, different ways to kind of curb that stuff, so.

664
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You know what doesn't have, uh, parental locks? Books. So you could take a book to bed and read it.

665
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
That's just an actual lock. Just put it in a safe. Can't read it through the safe.

666
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But yeah, um, interesting that they're rolling this out in China, although I think there's laws and governance in China that have come into play with why they've chosen to do it there first.

667
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Um, but I think one interesting thing, if they do end up rolling out a feature like this in America, which wouldn't be a big deal. I mean, many of the folks listening to this show and watching the show on Twitch, you're not using these types of lock features and stuff like that because you want to play all the games you want.

668
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:51,000
If you want to stay up all night playing Fortnite on your phone, then you're an adult and you've earned it. But so many of you probably just don't use parental locks, but things like the Switch and stuff have parental locks that are very similar.

669
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Um, it's just a matter of, do the parents know how to use them? Because I don't know, you know, I come from a certain generation as do probably many of y'all were like, my parents didn't know how to use those locks or use the setting on the TV that would prevent me from watching Cinemax after 9pm. If you know what I mean, right? Like our parents didn't know how to use those locks.

670
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Well, right. And I don't think for me, like I know how to use that stuff, but I don't think it's necessary because I just, you know, they don't have the game system with them and we can tell when they have screens on.

671
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So it's just, it's not needed, I guess. But I mean, if, if you're letting them have the device in the room and keep it, you know, and it is an issue, then I guess you could do the parental locks if you need to.

672
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Or I just do what I do. And since my, you know, internet is all based on Mac address filtering, I just take them out of the filter and then they can't connect to the internet. Oh, darn. That breaks everything.

673
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Okay. That's a good thought. Uh, let's see. And some comments in chat. I love this VG realness and chat says, Oh my God, take their fucking phones away. LOL. Sorry to be an old man, but we didn't have that in our day.

674
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So back in my day, we didn't have Fortnite on phones. So I don't know why kids under 13 are going to bed with a phone, let alone having one. And Bobby Blackwell says, isn't it past your bedtime?

675
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Well, if 1980 cinema supposed to teach me anything and I didn't have this when I was growing up, but back then children had their walkie talkies that they would talk to each other with.

676
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You know, back in, you know, we did back in my day, you're ready for all the crazy shit we got into as kids. Okay. You know what we did back in my day? We left the house after bedtime.

677
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That's what we did. Like when it was like, you know, or can I, I'm going to bed, you know, you go to bed and then you'd hear when your parents go to bed. And then it's like, you know, your friend and you had agreed that you were going to meet at like 11 o'clock somewhere.

678
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So you snuck out of the damn house and you went and met, met up and got into the trouble the kids got into, uh, at that age. And then went and played with your phones out there.

679
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We didn't have phones then we had, uh, we had, um, I don't know, TPing people's houses or whatever we did back in the day. We had vandalism.

680
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:21,000
This is so much better than, you know, staying up late and sometimes it wasn't necessarily that you were doing anything at all, except the thing that your parents didn't want you to do. Right.

681
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Whatever you do, no vandalism. Now that you're in bed, don't worry mother. I will not do vandalism in bed.

682
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Little does she know I am going to sneak out and do all of the vandalism. Bobby and Chad says we did actual illegal shit.

683
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We burn things. Kids today that do completely legal things. What a bunch of lame-os.

684
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Oh God. Um, SSG100Matt says every damn kid had a beeper in middle school. I didn't have a fucking beeper in middle school. Why did kids, I don't know, forget it.

685
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Anyway, we're getting into old man stuff. Let's move on and talk about, speaking of old man stuff, here's this new fangled game.

686
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Who's calling you in the middle of school day? Like on the pay phone, you know, they call you like, hey, give me a call. That doesn't make any sense.

687
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I only knew how to call with 1-800-COLLECT. Anyway, next story, Loki.

688
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Anyways, so Anthem is apparently working on their loot system, which some consider broken because it's frustrating with the balance of what they drop towards the end game stuff.

689
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So some of the fixes that they're going to be doing include common and uncommon equipment are no longer going to be dropped during end game activities.

690
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Which apparently is, you know, having an issue with, people are having an issue before where they're just ending up with all of a sudden they keep grinding at it.

691
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:07,000
The resources needed to craft certain masterwork items from blueprints will be reduced from 25 masterwork embers to 15. Wow, that's 10 less.

692
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And none of this makes any goddamn sense to me because I don't play this game. And then they said many inscriptions.

693
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The grinding has been reduced.

694
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But the details. The audience needs the details of this game that they're probably not playing.

695
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah, so they're making it less grindy so people aren't pissed off so that people will drop more money on their game and they'll make more money because they're EA and that's what they want to do.

696
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Because remember, if you support EA and buying all those microtransactions, then BioWare gets to live another day.

697
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So yeah. Other fun stuff about Anthem is, unfortunately with the whole loot stuff, not only is that an issue, but overall it hasn't done that great.

698
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,000
In fact, Anthem's physical sales are half of that of Mass Effect Andromeda, which I think was not even that great compared to...

699
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
In Europe, I believe.

700
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
In Europe.

701
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But this is a snapshot though.

702
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Is the pendulum really going to swing that hard in America versus Europe?

703
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah, and it's physical sales. Granted, digital sales are up, so there's that.

704
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But are they up that much in two years since Andromeda?

705
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:33,000
No, and I want to say they were looking at also, they're saying that Anthem sold roughly a quarter of Destiny 2's week one physical sales as well from back in September of 2017.

706
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They were also comparing the physical sales were both lower from Kingdom Hearts 3 and Resident Evil 2, which are recent games as well, so you can kind of compare the physical sales of that.

707
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So... I don't know. It's not off to a good start.

708
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
We'll see when the numbers come out. I mean, EA is going to have to...

709
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
They're not going to share the numbers if the numbers are bad.

710
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
They have to answer to their investors, so we're either going to see some numbers or we're going to see some real interesting wordsmithing happening.

711
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
We'll see some numbers of people being laid off.

712
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Let's hope not. I would be very sad about that. I don't want to see BioWare go under, but...

713
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And I don't want to turn into the dog pile on Anthem Show, because I know some people are having fun playing it.

714
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Questbuster in chat says,

715
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And I know most people I know that are playing the game are saying the combat is really fun, but it does sound like there's just, you know...

716
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Again, I can't help but get the sense, yet again, it's a game that wasn't fully baked before it came out of the oven.

717
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And unfortunately, this is a reoccurring theme with a lot of EA things, except for somehow Apex Legends.

718
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But in some ways, Apex Legends isn't exactly a fully-fledged game either.

719
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There's only, like, eight characters in Apex Legends. It's not that many characters for a game in 2019, right?

720
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Right.

721
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
For that game, it does not seem to matter.

722
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You know? And I'm not hating on Apex Legends.

723
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
What did Overwatch start with?

724
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's fun.

725
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Overwatch just got its 30th hero this week, I think.

726
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So they probably had, like, 16 at least.

727
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
No, it was more than that. It was probably 24, I want to say.

728
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We had what? We had Ana, Sombra, Orisa, Brigitte, Moira, and now Baptiste.

729
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I think 24, unless I'm missing somebody that came out. I think it's 24.

730
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So...

731
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And YYR points out if EA does have to do layoffs, which, again, we hope they don't, because there's been plenty of layoff news already,

732
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
they'll have to share those numbers. They kind of have a legal obligation to their shareholders and everything with that.

733
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Questbuster says, the combat is great. I just wish it was wrapped in a better game.

734
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
S2100matt says, I just started playing Apex Legends yesterday. It's really cool.

735
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Although I feel bad for the people I'm teamed up with each game because I'm still learning it.

736
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
YYR says, Overwatch had 21 heroes when the game launched.

737
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So I completely left out three people in what I was counting right there.

738
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
But that happens. I don't have everything.

739
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh yeah, I left out. I did leave out because I forgot Doomfist was one of them as well.

740
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So yeah, there's some I forgot. Sorry!

741
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So anyway, but yes, I know Batista's Hero 30 because I was just talking about it earlier today.

742
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So there you go.

743
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Anyway, let's move on.

744
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Let's talk about some news regarding Final Fantasy XII and some of the changes that you're going to see with Final Fantasy XII,

745
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
the Zodiac Age, when it comes out on the Switch and on the Xbox One.

746
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Because, you know, the game already came out on PlayStation 4 and PC a little while ago.

747
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So for those people that are thinking about double dipping, especially when it comes to the Switch and the portability,

748
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
what's kind of new? What are they bringing to the table that hasn't been done before?

749
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
There's going to be a license reset function. This is needed. I'm very happy to hear this.

750
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You can talk to Mont Blanc, the clan's interior leader in Rabanastre.

751
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You can reset and change your party member's jobs, allowing you to customize the jobs of the party that you want.

752
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So if you feel like you screwed up in building your characters, you don't have to start all over or reload in old state. You can reset.

753
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I think that alone is a badly, like, in saying it out loud, I'm like, God, this was needed.

754
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I'm surprised this wasn't here before. So a reset will be very nice.

755
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Also additional, more than one Gambit set. This is pretty cool.

756
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Gambits are how you kind of program the AI, because you control one character, but the other two kind of do things based on a logic system known as Gambits.

757
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But you're kind of locked into whatever you design. If you want to change it, you need to go in there and change it.

758
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Well, now there's going to be extra Gambit sets. So you can do three unique sets to kind of switch between sets for different situations.

759
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
That's a great idea, because maybe you don't want your other party members using big spells unless it's a boss.

760
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You know, things like that. So that's really smart. That's going to be neat.

761
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And then they're also talking about an improved New Game Plus, where you'll be able to have party members at level 90 and carry over items like weapons, magic, and gil.

762
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And then specific on the Xbox One X version, 60 frames a second. You'll be able to play at that.

763
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Nice.

764
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Yeah, very cool. I thought you could do that on PC version.

765
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You should be able to. It's a PC.

766
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I think that's a new console feature, but still a pretty cool one at that.

767
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Let's see. This would be if I were to buy Final Fantasy 12 on Switch, which I'm going to admit, Loki, I'm thinking about it.

768
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It would be my fourth time buying Final Fantasy 12 because I had the original, I bought it on PS4, I bought it on PC during a sale.

769
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So this would be the fourth time. But now I can have it portable and I can reset characters and kind of, I don't know.

770
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I don't know, Loki. What do you think?

771
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
You should do it.

772
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Do you even own it one time?

773
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Nope.

774
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
All right. I'm going to chat over at twitch.tv slash Evaga Network.

775
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Some love in the chat.

776
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Oh, VG Realness says Doomfist, Ash, the cowgirl, and Hamster Hammond were the heroes I forgot.

777
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Thank you. Wow, that was a fun game.

778
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Who is Rob too old to remember?

779
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Let's see.

780
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Also in chat.

781
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
darktoothy says last time I tried to beat 12, it did not go well.

782
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Probably going to skip the Switch one.

783
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh, well.

784
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Bobby Blackwolf says I liked it.

785
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh, that's about Final Fantasy 9.

786
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
They're on a tangent on Final Fantasy 9 because that also came out on Switch very recently.

787
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So some folks in chat are talking about that as well.

788
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
ActDeftInChat says Rob, you're saying that like you haven't done it before.

789
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That's the whole joke. I'm notorious for buying a game multiple times.

790
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Again, let's recall, how many times did I buy Mass Effect 3?

791
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It was the PC, the Xbox trilogy, the PlayStation trilogy, and the Wii U.

792
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So I bought that game four times.

793
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And that wasn't even a remaster.

794
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That was just the original Mass Effect.

795
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
If they do a remaster, I'll buy it again, for sure.

796
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Anyway.

797
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Enough about me. Stop trying to do an intervention.

798
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Let's go to a new story. Loki.

799
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yes, so this is kind of an interesting bit of trivia,

800
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
but apparently one of the producers on the new Toejam and Earl game,

801
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
which actually just got released, I think.

802
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Oh yeah, I forgot they were bringing that back. That's cute.

803
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yeah, I know we mentioned that last week during releases,

804
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
but Macaulay Culkin, yes, of Home Alone fame,

805
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and now he's doing a lot more stuff,

806
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
but apparently he is quite the retro game nerd,

807
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and he is one of the executive producers on the game,

808
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
because he was a huge fan of the original game,

809
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
mentions that he used to play competitive,

810
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
or he turned it into a competitive game with his friends,

811
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
because he used to troll each other in the game,

812
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and they even made a drinking game out of it.

813
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But apparently, you know, he met with the developers,

814
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and has he actually done real work on this game,

815
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
or is it more like a ceremonial type of title,

816
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
where it's like, we're just going to call you a producer

817
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
to get that little celebrity, to have stories like this

818
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
around the internet that get the knowledge of our game out there.

819
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Did he actually do stuff on the game?

820
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
You know, basically, he...

821
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Gave feedback.

822
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
He gave feedback, yeah.

823
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
So he met with the developers in their office,

824
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and he got to play the game.

825
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
He had the beta for a few days, he got to play that.

826
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
He said he beat it, and he talked about some of the glitches

827
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
that him and his friends had discovered in the original game,

828
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
and they said including a move that granted players infinite rocket skates,

829
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
and in return, they showed him some concept art and stuff like that.

830
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So I don't think he actually contributed anything to the game, per se.

831
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Besides his feedback.

832
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah, it was more of just kind of a fun thing to do.

833
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
SG100Matt says, the ToeJam in our old game looks good.

834
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah, I hear it's actually getting pretty good reviews

835
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
as far as retro revival type things go.

836
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I think it's doing pretty well for itself, so that's pretty exciting.

837
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
SG100Matt says, executive producer in title implies

838
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
that he helped fund it in some way.

839
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Maybe he did.

840
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Well, maybe. Maybe. We don't know.

841
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I mean, they don't. Who knows?

842
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Let's see.

843
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Dartitsuya says, never got into ToeJam in our old,

844
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
but I have the Genesis collection on Switch, so maybe I'll check it out.

845
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And Questbuster says, definitely one of the weirdest games

846
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I've played on the Genesis.

847
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Well, ToeJam in our old was kind of like a roguelike on the Genesis, wasn't it?

848
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So for that to be coming back is, you know, it's timely.

849
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So I guess he started off helping out the campaign

850
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
with his social media following to, you know, help promote the game,

851
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
is one of the things, too, that kind of got his attention.

852
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So he helped fund it by promoting it, I guess.

853
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So it's kind of like what Kylie Jenner did for Fyre Festival,

854
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
is what Macaulay Cokin did.

855
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Except this actually came out.

856
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It is actually pretty decent.

857
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It's actually decent.

858
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I did that for Bobby, who mentioned in chat that he watched

859
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the Fyre documentary this weekend on Netflix, which I still haven't seen.

860
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah, I haven't watched it either.

861
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
My wife watched it without me, which I was disappointed.

862
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But have you in the way?

863
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I don't mean to tangent here, but a cheap plug for if you're not aware,

864
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
my one of my spinoff shows, Shaking and Crying with Aria Snark is back.

865
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We were on hiatus for a little bit, but it's back.

866
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
There's been three new episodes since we came back.

867
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And one of the hot topics has come up there that's worth asking about here

868
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
is the documentary Abducted in Plain Sight.

869
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I did not watch it. My wife watched it.

870
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You really need to see Abducted in Plain Sight.

871
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
She explained the whole thing to me.

872
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It sounded ridiculous.

873
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I watched part of the last episode, but I wasn't really into it.

874
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I'm sure it would be funny from the beginning, but...

875
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It's not really funny, actually.

876
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It's kind of disturbing.

877
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Funny as in, like, just...

878
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Shock and horror, yes.

879
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
The hell?

880
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah, the hell, exactly.

881
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Alright, anyway.

882
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
VeeGee Realness saying, oh my god, you guys need to watch it,

883
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
is insane. I will at some point.

884
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Maybe that's what I'll watch before the next episode. We'll see.

885
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Anyway, let's move on to another one of your favorite topics,

886
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Loki Mods and Skyrim.

887
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Yes, Skyrim.

888
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And this is also kind of tying a little bit in with Fallout 76, I guess.

889
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
So, there's a mod that's been worked on for a while now

890
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
called Skyrim Together.

891
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That's basically a co-op mod for Skyrim.

892
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
They'll allow you to play Skyrim up to, I think, it was like four to eight people.

893
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So, but there's a little bit of drama going on behind the scenes

894
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
because apparently the people that put together the team

895
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
behind the Skyrim Script Extender

896
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
have been claiming that the Skyrim Together people

897
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
are stealing their code for this project.

898
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And so, because of that, you know,

899
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
they've even written in a code license for Skyrim Script Extender.

900
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Due to continued intentional copyright infringement

901
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
and total disrespect for moderate etiquette,

902
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
the Skyrim Online team is explicitly disallowed

903
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
from using any of these files for any purpose.

904
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You know, and this project's getting, you know,

905
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
they've got, you know, $33,000 a month

906
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
from their Patreon backers to help fund this project.

907
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That's a lot of money.

908
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And basically...

909
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
A fan project.

910
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yeah, and so, you know, in response, I guess,

911
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
there was a Skyrim Together team member

912
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
that posted a comment in Reddit talking about, you know,

913
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
the Skyrim Script Extender drama and says,

914
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
We've had disagreements with the SKSE folks in the past,

915
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and I've tried to communicate with them,

916
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
but they've never replied, so we stopped using their code.

917
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
There may be some leftover code from them that was overlooked.

918
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
When we removed it, it isn't as simple as deleting a folder.

919
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Mainly our fault is because we rushed some parts of the code.

920
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Anyways, we're gonna make sure to remove

921
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
what might have slipped through the cracks for our next patch.

922
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And to be clear, you know, things they said,

923
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
you know, of course, the SKSE members replied, you know.

924
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So to be clear, you started using our code,

925
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
asked for permission, never got permission,

926
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
continued using it, eventually removed part of it,

927
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
yet somehow left some of it in there,

928
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
continued the charge for access the entire time,

929
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
promised to totally clean up a now licensed tainted project.

930
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Okay?

931
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So there's still drama is basically what's coming out of the end of the day.

932
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
My TLDR is, I don't give a shit what's going on behind these things,

933
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I just want to play this mod,

934
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
whatever you got to do to get this shit finished,

935
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I don't care whose code you're in.

936
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And how much money are you contributing?

937
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'm contributing zero.

938
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And that's exactly how much money I'm going to contribute to this.

939
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But I still want to play it.

940
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So can we make that happen?

941
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I want something for free.

942
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Exactly.

943
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Alright.

944
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Well, I hope they can work all their dramas out

945
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
for the betterness of the player base.

946
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I mean, can't both sides to some extent admit,

947
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
but we didn't make Skyrim.

948
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
We wouldn't have had to put so much goddamn code into it

949
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
if it wasn't so fucking buggy anyways.

950
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Bethesda.

951
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Alright.

952
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Something that I actually logged into Fortnite today

953
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
to take a look at this,

954
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
because the band Weezer,

955
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
you know Weezer, right?

956
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Yes.

957
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Say it ain't so.

958
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Alright, yeah.

959
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Weezer made a new island in Fortnite to promote their new album.

960
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
So the new album that just came out is the Black Album,

961
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
although I think more people are talking about,

962
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
was it the Teal Album or something?

963
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
That has their cover.

964
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It's like an All Covers album.

965
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It has their cover of Africa, which has been on the radio.

966
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
No Scrubs is on it.

967
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So I think more people are talking about the Teal Album.

968
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
They're talking about the Black Album.

969
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
But anyway, maybe this is why they need to go to Fortnite.

970
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So you can go to Weezer World,

971
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
but it's in creative mode.

972
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And I think a lot of people,

973
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
when they're reading these headlines

974
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
and making their snap judgments on these,

975
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
they're thinking,

976
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
oh, you do battle in Weezer World now.

977
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
No, it's this expansion, you may not be aware,

978
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
but Fortnite doesn't just have the one versus 100 mode

979
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and some of the other, you know, the team modes and things,

980
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
but you can actually have a creative mode.

981
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So they kind of tried to do a Minecraft-esque type of mode in the game.

982
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, they also have a PvE mode too now.

983
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It's like battle...

984
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Well, you know what's funny?

985
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
That was always supposed to be Fortnite.

986
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Right, yeah.

987
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That was supposed to be the fucking game.

988
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
No, I know that.

989
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Yeah.

990
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I remember when it was before the battle.

991
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Battle Royale was just like the afterthought type of thing.

992
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
So anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

993
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
there's a part of me that wants to check out Fortnite creative mode,

994
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
but that would require me playing Fortnite.

995
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It's free.

996
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I did.

997
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I checked it out and you can just go in there and mess around.

998
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And I took a look at the Weezer World.

999
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And yeah, so it actually plays songs from the album.

1000
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That's the one reason I didn't do it as a clip here.

1001
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I actually went into it intending to record a clip for this.

1002
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And then I realized,

1003
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
oh, that's a bad idea because it has all this Weezer music here.

1004
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And that's going to be copyright.

1005
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Strip the audio out.

1006
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Strip the audio out.

1007
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
So sorry.

1008
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's why I did not do B-roll for that tonight.

1009
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So you'll just have to look at it yourself, I suppose.

1010
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Or there's plenty of YouTubes and things like that.

1011
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Maybe other people on Twitch that are streaming it as well.

1012
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
But that's, I mean, it's a very clever marketing idea,

1013
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I suppose, to team up with this mega popular video game

1014
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
to kind of get your album out there.

1015
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I mean, I'm sure there's lots of artists

1016
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
that would love to get more promotion like this.

1017
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
But, you know, Weezer is of a certain level.

1018
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
So it's a very interesting combination there.

1019
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So anyway, it is part of the Season 8 update.

1020
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
So you do want to make sure you're updated

1021
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
to the latest version of Fortnite,

1022
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
which has a bunch of new creative maps.

1023
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Weezer's just one of many new maps that are in there,

1024
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
which is also, yeah, I noticed when I went in there,

1025
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I was like, oh, Weezer World's like this first one of like,

1026
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
there's like seven of different worlds up here on the platform.

1027
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That you can go visit.

1028
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So, yeah, kind of one way that Fortnite is trying to expand itself a little bit

1029
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
is to tap into a little bit more of the Minecraft-esque side of things.

1030
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Very interesting.

1031
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Vidpower573 in chat says,

1032
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Weezer World sounds like a place Cheech and Chong would go to...

1033
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Bobby Blackwolf also continues and says,

1034
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
yes, but I can be snobbish and say,

1035
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I've never played Fortnite,

1036
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
just like how I can say I've never played WoW.

1037
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I like to at least try everything once, especially, you know,

1038
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
because I do know that a ton of people are playing Fortnite.

1039
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I've even tried playing League of Legends, even though I'm not very good.

1040
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
That's why I went into Apex Legends as well,

1041
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
because these are all very big ranking games on Twitch,

1042
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and I know lots of games that people are talking about.

1043
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So, I want to at least have a base understanding

1044
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
of what these games are all about, even if I fully admit,

1045
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
but I don't really have time to sink all the hours into it myself,

1046
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
because I'd rather be playing XYZ,

1047
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
which I think is also perfectly acceptable.

1048
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I would say maybe the one place where I failed to do this is

1049
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I haven't played a Madden game in a very long time.

1050
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I have before, but it's been a very long time.

1051
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm not going to drop 60 bucks to try out Madden.

1052
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Apex, Fortnite, League of Legends, those are all free games.

1053
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So, they're very easy to jump in there and try.

1054
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
You know, very, very minimal stuff,

1055
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
but I'm not going to drop 60 bucks on a game just to try it for that sake.

1056
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So, anyway.

1057
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Let's move on.

1058
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I think we're going to go and now visit the classic game of the week.

1059
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So, we're going to take a trip into the gaming vault

1060
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
and find a game that we think,

1061
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
hey, you guys should be checking out the game this week.

1062
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Dark Soccer, obviously not here tonight.

1063
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
She had picked a game.

1064
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We're going to roll that over to a future week.

1065
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So, I hastily got some footage together for a substitute game for tonight,

1066
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
which is one that I fondly remember,

1067
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
and we're going to talk about tonight.

1068
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
We are going to talk about the game Super Adventure Island,

1069
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
is what we're going to talk about tonight,

1070
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
and I think, yes, we have some footage of this game.

1071
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
So, this is the classic game of the week, Super Adventure Island,

1072
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
which, of course, was for the Super Nintendo.

1073
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So, Super Adventure Island was released on the Super Nintendo,

1074
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and part of the reason that I remember this game

1075
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
and love this game so much was that the music is amazing.

1076
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I don't know how well you can hear it in the background there,

1077
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
but it was done by Yuzo Koshiro,

1078
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and it's one of his final soundtracks that he did, yeah.

1079
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
This game was released in Japan in January of 92,

1080
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and it was released in North America in April of 92.

1081
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
In Japan, it was called Master Takahashi's Great Adventure Island.

1082
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It also was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2011,

1083
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and it was the starter of a Super Adventure Island series

1084
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
because there was a Super Adventure Island 2 that came out later.

1085
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
There were three of the regular Adventure Island games on the regular NES.

1086
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
There was also a mobile phone game called Super Adventure Island,

1087
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
but it is not the same game, so it is not what I'm talking about here tonight.

1088
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So, the plot of the game is that you are trying to find Tina,

1089
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
even though they mistranslated, I guess, the name to Genie Jungle

1090
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
in English materials.

1091
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
That's kind of interesting that the name completely changed

1092
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
based on translation issues.

1093
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So, it's kind of your very typical 90s save the princess

1094
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
from disaster type of games.

1095
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
That whole, you know, I think we've seen this many times before.

1096
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
But anyway, an evil sorcerer plans to turn Tina into a stone statue for eternity,

1097
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and you're not going to let that happen.

1098
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
You're going to venture through five stages, four areas in each stage

1099
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
for a total of 20 levels to make sure that doesn't happen.

1100
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
In the first three areas, you go through like an obstacle course,

1101
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
which is what's happening in the video that we're seeing right now.

1102
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And then the final area is a boss battle,

1103
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
which we should see one of those coming up here in a little bit.

1104
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Obviously, some of the differences between this Adventure Island

1105
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and the Adventure Island on the NES that made it very different

1106
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
was much improved visuals.

1107
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I mean, this game looks phenomenal, especially considering it's kind of early on

1108
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
in the Super Nintendo's life.

1109
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Like, the sound especially, and again, I call that out,

1110
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
the sound is so good, and it's not just Yuzo Koshiro.

1111
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I mean, that's a huge part of it.

1112
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But just like the sampling and kind of what they did

1113
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
with the Super Nintendo's built-in hardware is really great,

1114
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and it's really something you should check out.

1115
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So in the game, much like before, you can use an axe,

1116
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
but you also get fireballs as you upgrade your weapon.

1117
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
You also get a boomerang.

1118
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So you can either throw an axe that moves in like an arc-type pattern,

1119
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
or you can throw a boomerang.

1120
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And you're trying to collect fruit that fills up a life bar

1121
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
that slowly counts down as you move through the level.

1122
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You can think of it kind of like a built-in timer.

1123
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And the fruit helps restore on that timer.

1124
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
There is a score in the game as well.

1125
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
So as you grab fruit, kill enemies and things like that,

1126
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
you increase your score.

1127
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
So if you want to play for score, that is something you can do as well.

1128
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So yeah, that's a little bit about Super Adventure Island.

1129
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I guess it is also one of the games that is featured in a manga

1130
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
that was called Cyber Boy that came out between 1991 and 1993.

1131
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So I think we're just about to get into one of the boss battles

1132
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
here on the video that we're looking at on our Twitch stream.

1133
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Yeah, so you can kind of see.

1134
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And again, another thing that really set this game apart,

1135
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
being that it's on the Super Nintendo hardware versus the Nintendo hardware,

1136
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
is that these bosses are gigantic.

1137
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
They were pretty big on the Nintendo version, taking up multiple sprites.

1138
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But these bosses were definitely bigger.

1139
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
You had these transparent ghost things,

1140
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
and the head and the hand kind of are all moving separately.

1141
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's pretty intricate and pretty awesome.

1142
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
And as far as me, one place that I remember this game

1143
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
is I remember this was one of the very first Super Nintendo games

1144
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
that I rented, right?

1145
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Because you could actually rent stuff in the video store.

1146
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And I have fond memories of renting this game.

1147
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And again, a lot of it was just kind of after the first time I rented it,

1148
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I remember renting it again because I wanted to hear the soundtrack

1149
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
because it was so awesome.

1150
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So years later, when I put together like, oh, it was Yuzuru Koshiro

1151
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
that did this.

1152
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And of course, Yuzuru Koshiro did what, like Streets of Rage.

1153
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
He did a lot of the Midnight Maximum Tune racing games.

1154
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You know, he's a great composer.

1155
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So, I mean, I just I'm a big fan of his work.

1156
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
So I'm not surprised at all that a game like Super Adventure Island

1157
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
was something that kind of caught my eye and ears

1158
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
because he was a part of that.

1159
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So there it is.

1160
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Did you ever play this game?

1161
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah, I did.

1162
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Yeah. What'd you think?

1163
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It was all right. I liked it.

1164
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Yeah. It was a fun game.

1165
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So, I mean, the game itself, you know, it's not Mario World

1166
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
or some of the must have Super Nintendo games of its time.

1167
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
But I think it's fun enough.

1168
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It still holds up.

1169
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, it still holds up.

1170
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And it looks really good.

1171
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
You know, it's still, as far as like graphics and stuff like that,

1172
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
it really holds up after all this time.

1173
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
So there it is, your classic game of the week,

1174
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Super Adventure Island for the Super Nintendo.

1175
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And I'm looking in our chat over at twitch.tv slash fog network.

1176
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Dark Tetsuya points out, I know he did the soundtrack

1177
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
to Dungeons and Dragons, Eye of the Beholder,

1178
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
the Sega CD version.

1179
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Fantaz points out Skateboard Boy.

1180
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Oh, yes, there are those parts of the game where he gets on a skateboard

1181
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
and he's kind of like automatically moving.

1182
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And in those parts, your life isn't draining.

1183
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So that's part of like the trade off is that if you kind of move

1184
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
into a constant state of motion, you don't get the penalty

1185
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
of your life slowly draining away.

1186
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
VidPower573 in chat says, I wish they would revisit

1187
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
the Adventure Island series, whoever owns the IP.

1188
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Well, I know the developer of this game, let's see, was Hudson Soft.

1189
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Wasn't it Hudson?

1190
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
That's Konami.

1191
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Konami.

1192
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
So there will not be any more Adventure Island games,

1193
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
but there might be a pachinko machine in the near future.

1194
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
You can always scratch your fingers.

1195
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
OK, obviously, I'm being a little bit silly, but well,

1196
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
fruit and slaughter machines.

1197
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Yeah, right.

1198
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Or am I?

1199
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
All right.

1200
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Anyhow, we're going to go to our next story,

1201
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
which was something that I actually taped a little segment

1202
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
about earlier today.

1203
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
OK, so also in the news this week, Overwatch unveiled their 30th hero

1204
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
that they're planning on adding to the game.

1205
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
So as you can see in the background here, we're taking a look

1206
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
at Overwatch and this is Batiste, who is the brand new hero

1207
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
that they're adding to Overwatch.

1208
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
So the way I'm able to actually look at Batiste right now,

1209
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
you may not know this depending on what platform you play Overwatch on,

1210
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
but on the PC, there's this version of the game called

1211
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
the Public Test Region, where you can actually log in

1212
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
and take a look at new characters as they're being developed.

1213
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
This is probably a good way for the Overwatch development team

1214
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
to actually see, you know, how are they performing in a game,

1215
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
you know, are they too strong, are they overpowered,

1216
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
do they need to be rebalanced, and that sort of thing.

1217
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And that's the kind of thing you can really only tell probably

1218
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
from doing live play.

1219
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
They can do all the stuff they want in the office,

1220
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
but this is, you know, really a good way to figure it out.

1221
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But it's neat because it actually gives the rest of us

1222
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
kind of a way to get a sneak peek at the hero

1223
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
and see everything that they're doing.

1224
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
This is not something that you can actually do on the PlayStation 4

1225
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
or the Xbox One version of the games, at least not today,

1226
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
not to say that it'll never ever be the case moving forward,

1227
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
but we'll see in the future.

1228
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
So anyways, you can actually, you know, see they have them

1229
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
in the hero gallery and you can kind of get a little closer look at them,

1230
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
except they don't actually have everything here in the test region yet,

1231
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
they just have some of the basic things, like you can see, you know,

1232
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
some heroic type emotes here for when they win matches and stuff.

1233
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
You can also, let's see, the little highlight intros,

1234
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
which are, you know, always kind of fun to watch,

1235
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
but these are the very basic things.

1236
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
They're not going to show you, give you a real sneak peek at the advanced stuff,

1237
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
like what kind of skins might Batiste kind of have extra for, you know,

1238
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
in matches and winning match poses and things like that.

1239
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
They're not going to really add that until probably, you know,

1240
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
about another week or two when they get a little closer

1241
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
to actually putting him in the full game.

1242
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
So let's actually take a look.

1243
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
We can actually go into a training match,

1244
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
which is a good way to kind of get a taste of the character for the first time.

1245
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I know I use this practice range a lot to try to just get the feel

1246
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
for characters I'm not very familiar with.

1247
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
CLC Batiste is over here with the support classes,

1248
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
and he can actually go into the match,

1249
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
and you can actually kind of get to use him a little bit here.

1250
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
You can see that he has a gun there, a very loud gun,

1251
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
that I can shoot these little training bots with.

1252
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
That's one thing to do with it.

1253
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
So his left click, and I'm going to be speaking in PC terms

1254
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
just because that's the way I'm used to playing the game,

1255
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
although I'm sure, you know, it's very easy to figure out what this would map to

1256
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
if you're a PS4 or you're an Xbox One person.

1257
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
But the left click is going to be that button that attacks other robots,

1258
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
but the right click is actually this kind of like, it's like a bomb type of thing.

1259
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It kind of reminds me of like maybe what Junkrat would use with his weapon,

1260
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
but it's actually like a heal bomb.

1261
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
So when you use that, it's actually like heal bombing these friendly bots,

1262
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
so you can see those little tiny graphs are actually increasing their health a little bit.

1263
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And then of course, when I run out of heal bombs,

1264
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
or if I run out of the little regular ammunition to attack guys with,

1265
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
he's actually going to go into his reload animation,

1266
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
which he can also trigger at any time by hitting the reload button or pressing R.

1267
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Now, some of the real fun stuff would be some of the other abilities that he has access to.

1268
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
So I'm going to wait for these little bots that died to come back.

1269
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
But I will mention that you can always at any time see the abilities.

1270
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I think it's, is it F1 or F12?

1271
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I can't remember what it is on PC all of a sudden.

1272
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Oh yeah, you hold down F1, and you can actually see what some of the different abilities are,

1273
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
and it kind of gives you a little recap.

1274
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Oh, these are going to do, you know, if you hit shift, it's going to do this.

1275
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And again, I'm pretty sure PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have similar features as well.

1276
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
So you'll notice the shift key, which is kind of like, I guess his first ability,

1277
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
is like a regenerative sort of aura.

1278
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So if I hit that button, you'll notice the bots suddenly start to increase health very slowly,

1279
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
and it lasts for a few seconds.

1280
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So it was able to absorb some of the hits that were coming in from the bots,

1281
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and you can see it kind of heals.

1282
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And I'll do it one more time here.

1283
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
If they don't die, you can really get a sense of how much they heal.

1284
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
You can also see he kind of threw out a little bit of an aura there,

1285
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
so you can get a sense for the range.

1286
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I notice it doesn't draw on the ground what the range looks like.

1287
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Like, say, if you were playing Lucio, and you can actually really see the range of heals and so forth,

1288
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
it would actually show there, but it doesn't show with that.

1289
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Now, some of the other abilities that he has,

1290
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
this E key is actually going to do an ability that they call the immortality field,

1291
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and it's actually going to prevent these bots altogether from dying.

1292
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So, oops, I did that too soon.

1293
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I thought I had a chance to place it.

1294
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
That's part of the reason why you do the test realm,

1295
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
because you get to know your different abilities there.

1296
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So he actually just threw it.

1297
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I thought I would actually get to place it first.

1298
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So now I've got to wait for that ability to recharge,

1299
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
which will only be a couple more seconds here.

1300
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So you see a little cool down there, which will give those guys time to...

1301
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So this bot on the right here is getting very close to death.

1302
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,000
So when he gets very close to death, what I'm going to do is throw down that immortality field.

1303
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Okay, so now watch.

1304
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Next time he gets shot, his health is not going to drop past a certain point,

1305
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
because that immortality field is up,

1306
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
so it'll give me a chance to heal him up, do whatever I need to do,

1307
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
once that field is down, because obviously it's not going to last forever.

1308
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Immortality is kind of a very powerful ability.

1309
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,000
But it'll give me a chance to drop that field, heal up, do what I need to do,

1310
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
especially if there's another support character.

1311
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,000
If there's a Mercy or something, you could really use that immortality field to heal somebody up to full,

1312
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,000
so that it'll take a long time to get them killed again.

1313
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Alright, so that's just about all the abilities, except he does have a jumping kind of ability.

1314
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:20,000
If you use this control, he can kind of hold down control, and it actually lets him fly up.

1315
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So he can't really fly, but it's kind of neat that he has this high jump ability

1316
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
that you can kind of charge with control, and then you can kind of get up to these higher platforms

1317
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
that most characters wouldn't be able to do.

1318
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So that's just kind of a neat little extra thing.

1319
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
High jump boots, if you will.

1320
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And then of course, lastly, is his ultimate ability, which is kind of a little different.

1321
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I like it. It's something you're really going to have to pair with other abilities.

1322
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
But the Q ability for his ultimate is the amplification matrix.

1323
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So that's going to do a matrix, and it's going to double damage, but also healing effects,

1324
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
depending on what's passing through the matrix where.

1325
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
So for example, if I put the matrix down, and this is the one you actually get to place.

1326
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
This is how I got confused earlier.

1327
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
But let me show you. I'm going to kill this bot on the left.

1328
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And you can see, it took about three hits to do him in.

1329
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
But with this field, look at that. It just took one.

1330
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And if I go to the other side and do my heals, look how much healing he got as that passes through that field.

1331
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And you'll notice it doesn't last long at all.

1332
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So that's going to be interesting to see how that works,

1333
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
because you're really going to have to take coordination to make the most out of that thing.

1334
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Just imagine a Bastion turret on the other side of it or something like that

1335
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
that's going to really shred the heck out of the other team if it's timed right.

1336
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
So it'll be interesting to see if Batiste has a place in the competitive mode.

1337
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It's something you're going to see in the Overwatch League.

1338
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Not all heroes seem to get equal representation in the Overwatch League,

1339
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
so I know it's something the developers are probably working a little bit on balancing.

1340
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But I know it's just a matter of time before Batiste makes it to the game.

1341
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I know I love to play support characters. I like to play Mercy, Lucio.

1342
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Not so good with Ana, because I'm not a very good sniper, but I do like to play support characters.

1343
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And I also like playing Junkrat as DPS, so just this heal bomb thing.

1344
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
This is going to be awesome and a lot of fun to play.

1345
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So I'm definitely looking forward to Batiste hitting live realms very soon.

1346
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
So there you go, a little sneak peek at Batiste, the 30th hero coming to Overwatch,

1347
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
announced by the team this week.

1348
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And now we'll go back to the show live in the studio.

1349
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
All right, we are back here live in the studio with episode number 766 of our show,

1350
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
already in progress for tonight, March 3rd of 2019.

1351
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I can't believe it is already March.

1352
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Yep.

1353
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Wow. I don't know how much of that clip you saw there of the Batiste in Overwatch.

1354
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You don't really play Overwatch at all, do you?

1355
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
No, I have it, but I don't play it.

1356
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's yet another one of those games you just have.

1357
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
My co-worker, he peer pressured me into buying it.

1358
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And then I played it a little bit and I was like,

1359
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I can't really dedicate a ton of time to this, so I'm not going to play it anymore.

1360
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It's one of those things I play obviously very casually.

1361
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I never get into the competitive stuff.

1362
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I know season 15 just started in Overwatch,

1363
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
so there's a lot of people really getting into the competitive stuff right now

1364
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and talking about placement matches and stuff.

1365
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
That's never really been my thing in Overwatch,

1366
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but at least in a while I enjoy a casual match, especially with friends.

1367
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Again, that's another one of those games that's kind of fun to stream with friends

1368
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
or just get online and play multiplayer with friends.

1369
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
But it is a bummer that things are so split up,

1370
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
like I have some friends on PC,

1371
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
but I have other friends that only play on PlayStation 4,

1372
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and then yet others that play on Xbox.

1373
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I really understand why Blizzard didn't want to pull that all together,

1374
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
especially when it comes to mouse and keyboard versus controller,

1375
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
because the games are actually tuned separately because of that.

1376
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But did they have PlayStation and Xbox, though?

1377
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Do they have cross-play with those?

1378
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
No, not yet.

1379
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Maybe it won't be that way forever, but that'll be up to them.

1380
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But anyway, I'm excited about the new hero.

1381
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I think he's got a lot of very interesting moves

1382
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
and looks like somebody that I could actually enjoy playing,

1383
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
although I'm sure for the first couple weeks that he's out,

1384
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
everybody is going to be playing,

1385
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
because that's always what happens with the new heroes,

1386
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
that everybody picks them.

1387
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And you can only pick a hero one time in a match

1388
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
unless you're doing that special mode, the no-limits mode in the arcade.

1389
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Then you can pick as many as you want.

1390
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
But for the most part, you can only do the one.

1391
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So anyway, let's move on with some rapid-fire news

1392
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
and talk about some other things happening around our industry

1393
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
a little quicker tonight.

1394
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Let's talk a little bit about what we're going to be getting

1395
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
for our free games for the month of March.

1396
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
So starting off on the Xbox side of the house,

1397
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
we've got Adventure Time Pirates of the Enchiridin.

1398
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I don't know how you pronounce that,

1399
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
but that's going to be coming out for the month of March.

1400
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,000
And then for the second half of March through the middle of April,

1401
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
we have Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2.

1402
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And then for the first half of March for the Xbox 360

1403
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
backwards compatible games, Star Wars Republic Commando.

1404
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And then for the second half, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

1405
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
So that's pretty nice, four games there.

1406
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
On the PlayStation side of the house,

1407
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
this is the first month that they're not giving away games

1408
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
for other systems aside from PlayStation 4.

1409
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Well, when you just killed one of them.

1410
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So the only games you get this month,

1411
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
you get Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered,

1412
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
which is pretty great, and The Witness.

1413
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Ooh, that's one of those games I never got around to playing

1414
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
that everybody's like, you need to play The Witness,

1415
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and I just never did, so that's cool.

1416
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
So those will be available starting March 8th.

1417
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
So, cool. I mean, I still, though, as a contrast,

1418
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I understand that Call of Duty, that's a pretty decent game.

1419
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:57,000
But in contrast to just reading four games on the Xbox platform

1420
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:06,000
versus the two, you know, it doesn't skew it in their favor, I should say.

1421
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Okay, fair enough. Let's travel over to some news about Evo.

1422
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Hey, hey, hold on.

1423
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Oh, do you have one more?

1424
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
We got one more thing to talk about,

1425
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:20,000
and very important news regarding a very popular adventure game franchise,

1426
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
the Leisure Suit Larry franchise.

1427
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
So we have Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams, Don't Dry.

1428
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
That's rated now for the PlayStation 4 and the Switch,

1429
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and should be coming out at some point,

1430
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
but we don't know much about it aside from the fact that, you know.

1431
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And new people are doing this now.

1432
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I think there's new people involved in making this.

1433
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I don't think it's the developers that did that last game that didn't do so well.

1434
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
No, it's not.

1435
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
And based on the screenshot, it looks pretty decent.

1436
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
It kind of has a 90's Sierra aesthetic look to it.

1437
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'm into it.

1438
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I'll check it out.

1439
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I even played the shitty ones.

1440
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I mean, it's fine.

1441
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Well, Magna Cum Laude, that was the one that was not great, right?

1442
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Wasn't that the name of it?

1443
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
There was one that had a funny dialogue system that you were talking to women

1444
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
in your little sperm and you had to dodge stuff,

1445
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and that was funny, but the game was not good.

1446
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out, I'm pretty sure Al Lowe still isn't involved.

1447
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
It's probably a safe bet that this, you know, it's now just about the IP

1448
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and trying to sell games just based on the strength of the name,

1449
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Leisure Suit Larry, and what that means about the type of raunchy humor

1450
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
you're going to get in a game.

1451
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
It means absolutely nothing to the people that were probably, you know,

1452
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
buying the games nowadays.

1453
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Anyway, now I'll talk about Evo 2019.

1454
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
The official lineup for Evo has been announced,

1455
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
and the games that will be a part of it,

1456
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
including Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Dragon Fighters, Dragon Fighter Z,

1457
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
if you will, Street Fighter V, Tekken 7, Mortal Kombat 11,

1458
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Soul Calibur VI, Samurai Showdown.

1459
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Did you know that they're making a new Samurai Showdown?

1460
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
No.

1461
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
This is not the old school Neo Jewel.

1462
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I mean, it is still, it's like that series,

1463
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
but now they're doing like a new one.

1464
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So, yeah, it looks pretty good.

1465
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
There was some other news that I don't think many of our show wrote tonight,

1466
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
but, yeah, I'll mention it now.

1467
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
There's a new Samurai Showdown coming.

1468
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
It looked kind of neat, so that's going to be a part of it.

1469
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
But it's not what's a part of the lineup that people are talking about.

1470
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
It's what's not a part of the lineup, because guess what got bumped this year?

1471
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Melee.

1472
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So, Super Smash Brothers Melee is no longer in the top nine,

1473
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
the main games that are in contention there.

1474
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And there's many people that are saying, finally,

1475
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
but, you know, there's other people that are like, but, but, but, you know.

1476
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
But I kind of think now that you have Smash Brothers Ultimate,

1477
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I'm not hearing a lot of, like, it's bad or I don't like Ultimate.

1478
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Like, I do feel like most people accept Ultimate as kind of like the definitive edition,

1479
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
because it does have every character.

1480
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And, sure, there's always going to be people that want their retro throwbacks.

1481
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Right.

1482
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah, there's always going to, I understand, I respect that,

1483
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
but, you know, as far as, you know.

1484
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
That's why you don't see like Street Fighter II on there.

1485
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I mean, you have five.

1486
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It's true.

1487
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So, anyway, it is the year 2019.

1488
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
So, this is the first time Melee will not be featured since 2012,

1489
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:11,000
because there was another, I think it did take a hiatus at another point,

1490
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
not long after the game came out before the competitive scene kind of built itself back up.

1491
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So, there you go.

1492
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It is not happening there.

1493
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Let's see.

1494
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Some folks in chat.

1495
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
YYR says, still, Melee was fun to watch.

1496
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Act F says, finally.

1497
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, the people that still like Melee is because they found glitches that were never intended,

1498
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
and that's why they own everyone else in Melee, and Ultimate doesn't have said glitches.

1499
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Well, I mean, it's not like the Melee community suddenly can't exist simply because they're not in EVO.

1500
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I bet somebody is streaming that game on Twitch right now, and go for it.

1501
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And there's still going to be tournaments, and it will be part of, it's just not going to be on the EVO stage this year.

1502
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
So, that doesn't mean the game, you know what else isn't on the stage?

1503
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Dance Dance Revolution.

1504
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
But I still know people to this day that don't shut up about that game, and that is just fine, too.

1505
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
So, it's not going to kill the community just because it isn't there.

1506
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Unfortunately, this story is not loading for me, but I think I know the gist of what this was about.

1507
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
There's a Sega Mega Drive Mini that's happening.

1508
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So, they're doing another one of those mini consoles.

1509
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
This is for the Mega Drive, and they want you to vote.

1510
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
What do you want?

1511
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Which Sonic the Hedgehog, which Puyo Puyo, or which Shining Force title do you want to make sure is in this?

1512
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And I would think the correct answer would be all of them, but for some reason Sega is looking at limiting this.

1513
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
I don't know why they want to do that.

1514
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Because those ROM file sizes are so huge!

1515
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
We can only fit so much onto one console.

1516
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Fucking dumb.

1517
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I know, I know. Anything, I saw you got the story.

1518
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Is there anything important that I missed in that?

1519
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
No, it's just basically they have three poles right now.

1520
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Sonic the Hedgehog, or Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

1521
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Puyo Puyo.

1522
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
It's this or that.

1523
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Yeah, Puyo Puyo, or Puyo Puyo Sue.

1524
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And then they have Shining Force Legacy of the Great Intention, or Shining Force 2.

1525
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Porque no los dos, if I can call up a famous gif that's out there.

1526
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Why not both, as for all those questions.

1527
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Alright, anyway.

1528
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:16,000
If you have not picked up Final Fantasy Dissidia, or Dissidia Final Fantasy NT if you will.

1529
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,000
A free version of the game is coming out for Playstation 4 and PC on March 12th.

1530
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
But of course since it's free, you can't play everybody.

1531
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
You will only get a rotating weekly roster of heroes and villains.

1532
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
But of course, you can purchase characters if you'd like.

1533
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And you can buy more weapons a la carte as well.

1534
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:40,000
If you are already playing the game, this should be breathing new life into the multiplayer section of the game.

1535
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And giving this game a second chance.

1536
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Because I'm not sure, I don't know where the financials are at for this game.

1537
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,000
But I gotta admit, I played the demo that they put out and I had to file it in the I don't get it category.

1538
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Like sorry, maybe if you're a Dissidia fan out there, put together one of those seven things that explains the game to me.

1539
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
The original Dissidia, I was kinda like that too.

1540
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I was like okay, so I slide around on these things sometimes and then I hit people and stuff is happening and I'm not really sure.

1541
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
But granted, the original Dissidia was back on the Playstation portals.

1542
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
So, I don't know.

1543
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I think it was the PSP or was it the Vita? Jesus, I don't even remember.

1544
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
The original was the PSP.

1545
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Okay, so it was the PSP.

1546
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
So we actually had it as a classic game not that long ago actually, funny enough.

1547
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
But you know what?

1548
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Despite all sales shade aside, what a great new way.

1549
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I mean the game has been out for a little bit now.

1550
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It's been out for several months.

1551
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So I think all the people that were gonna buy it at face value have probably done it at this point.

1552
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
So what a good way to breathe like a second life into the game by doing a free version.

1553
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And you know what?

1554
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Maybe now I can give it another shot.

1555
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Maybe something didn't click for me in the demo, but it will in the full game.

1556
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
But at the price of free, I could go in and take that risk and check it out.

1557
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
So, we'll see.

1558
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1559
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Some other things that are coming out this week.

1560
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Loki.

1561
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Well, this week we've got a game, Alien League, that's out on PC.

1562
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Dead or Alive 6 coming out on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

1563
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Actually, I'm sorry, this is the first.

1564
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
That would have already come out.

1565
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Okay, let's do this week.

1566
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Not much, actually.

1567
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Left Alive on PC and Playstation 4.

1568
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Devil May Cry 5 coming out on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

1569
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
And then Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn on the 3DS.

1570
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Alright, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases over there.

1571
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Not a lot, a lot of stuff.

1572
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
We have just a couple games on the Playstation 4.

1573
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Flowers, Les Quatre Cezanne.

1574
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I think it's got a French name, but it's a Japanese release.

1575
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
That game is out this week on March the 7th, but I think the big game is Devil May Cry 5,

1576
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
which is the same day.

1577
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:58,000
It's a worldwide release, so it's the same day we're getting it in the US as well as, spoiler alert, sorry, Europe.

1578
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
So that's the big one on the Playstation 4 this week.

1579
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Playstation Vita's obviously starting to slow down a little bit, but it's not dead yet.

1580
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
They've got a release on March 14th, but I guess I'll get to that next week.

1581
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Quickly checking the Nintendo Switch to see if they've got anything big coming out there.

1582
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
No, it's a slow week.

1583
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I mean, Devil May Cry 5 is obviously the big release and kind of taking the attention,

1584
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
but not a very competitive week in Japan this week.

1585
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
That's it.

1586
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
How about Europe?

1587
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Europe, you have a few games coming out, so starting off with Left Alive.

1588
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
That's going to be out on Playstation 4.

1589
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
The Occupation on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

1590
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn on 3DS.

1591
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And Devil May Cry 5 on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

1592
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
That's it.

1593
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Any titles in the next week or anytime soon that you're looking at picking up, Loki?

1594
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Do you have your backlog of things you won't play?

1595
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Actually, I was thinking about maybe picking up Trials,

1596
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
because they had a new Trials game that came out this week.

1597
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
But I'm not sure if I'm going to play that right away.

1598
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I actually went back and was looking at playing the last Trials game,

1599
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
because I still have that.

1600
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I don't remember what they called it.

1601
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
They had that spin-off Trials game.

1602
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Well, they had Trials of the Blood Dragon that I checked out.

1603
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
It was kind of lame, but it was just okay.

1604
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And then they had the Trials, and they had the extra special Trials

1605
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
with the unicorn and the flaming cat.

1606
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
It was crazy stuff, so I need to go back and play that.

1607
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
But the new Trials game looks alright.

1608
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I don't know if I want to pick it up right now.

1609
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I may wait for a sale for that.

1610
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Alright. Well, let's go to the mailbag.

1611
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Every week, we invite your emails.

1612
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Participate at orangeloundtrader.com.

1613
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
It's the place to send emails,

1614
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show.

1615
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Actually, we got a great response to mailbag last week.

1616
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
We have four emails.

1617
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Sweet!

1618
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Yeah, we got a lot to talk about tonight, so let's get into it.

1619
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
So we're going to do our first email tonight,

1620
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
which comes to us from Meermuse, is the one that sent in this email,

1621
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
saying, Dear OLR, I've been listening for 12 years

1622
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
at my factory job here in Baltimore.

1623
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
That's a long time. Thank you very much.

1624
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It helps pass the time, but I was always half-listening in a very passive way.

1625
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Some info was missed. Sorry, because work came first.

1626
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
You got nothing to apologize for.

1627
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Sorry, I half-listened the show, too, so it's fine.

1628
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
We're fine being background noise. It's all good.

1629
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And especially if you're trying to listen to us at work,

1630
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I completely understand if work comes first.

1631
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Yeah, but like Loki jokes.

1632
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I mean, he jokes, but sometimes, you know,

1633
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
as we're trying to do a live show, other things are going on.

1634
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Like, we might have to completely adjust what we're doing on the fly

1635
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
because, you know, we unexpectedly had a host out.

1636
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Or my cat will be causing terror in the other room,

1637
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
and I've got to go tend to it.

1638
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
So sometimes we have to multitask as well. It's all good.

1639
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Anyway, Meermuse continues.

1640
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Now with Twitch, I watch what I can live.

1641
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I love reading the chat scroll, and if I ever think of something to add,

1642
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I can on the spot.

1643
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Better yet, when I finish watching on the archives,

1644
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
my husband is often right next to me,

1645
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
and we watch and talk together about the gaming news.

1646
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Let's be honest. The only news that really matters. LOL.

1647
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Bottom line is I think the Twitch move was fantastic.

1648
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I feel more connected, more interactive, and more represented.

1649
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I've told more friends about the show because they don't listen to podcasts,

1650
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
but do watch Twitch streams.

1651
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Keep up the good work.

1652
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Meermuse, whose name is noted there, is Emily.

1653
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So thank you. Thank you so much for that.

1654
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I mean, we were always a live show with the audio part of it,

1655
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
but I do think there's something about the Twitch community

1656
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
and being able to see the chat on demand, which you couldn't do before.

1657
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I mean, you could be in chat if you're there live,

1658
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
but if you weren't able to be there live.

1659
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But a lot of people are kind of watching the live experience

1660
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
when they can during the week,

1661
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
because if you are a subscriber at VOG Network,

1662
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
which you can use your free Twitch Prime if you're so inclined,

1663
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
to subscribe to VOG Network, you get the chat stuff and the video side by side.

1664
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Although I will caution you, chat only saves for like two weeks, I think,

1665
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
because you could watch any episode since we moved to Twitch.

1666
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
So you could go all the way back to the December episodes,

1667
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
but chat's no longer there.

1668
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And that's a Twitch decision, not us.

1669
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
They only save the chat scrolls for like two weeks.

1670
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
So you don't want to watch it.

1671
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
We'll just have to incorporate it in the bottom somewhere.

1672
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
You can add to the chat, too, if you feel so inclined.

1673
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So even though it won't be there live, we actually see the comments later.

1674
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
So, you know, especially if you have something really profound

1675
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
or something you want to say, like, you know, if it's something that catches my eye,

1676
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I'll bring it up on a later show.

1677
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Like, maybe you play a game like Dissidia,

1678
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and so you want to leave a comment about it as to what we're all missing out on.

1679
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
The trailer looked cool.

1680
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It did.

1681
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
It's just the game.

1682
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I just don't understand.

1683
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I thought it would just be a fighting game, and it's kind of not that.

1684
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000
All right. Anyway, let's see.

1685
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
There's a P.S. to this.

1686
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I'm a very sick person, so I have a few ideas for your starting panels.

1687
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Oh, those little things we do at the beginning of the show.

1688
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Again, that's part of the Twitch thing, but the little will not be seen tonight.

1689
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So I'm not going to read those, because I might.

1690
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
There's actually one of these that's really, oh, wait, they're all good.

1691
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
But one of them is like, I'm going to use it next week, because it's timely good.

1692
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Well, I thought for sure we would have one with,

1693
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
oh, what the hell is the meme, the trolly thing that's going around?

1694
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Oh, my God, the kids.

1695
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Oh, Momo?

1696
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
The Momo challenge.

1697
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I swear, I thought they were going to have a moment.

1698
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I got one for, I'll just say it now, and then you all act surprised

1699
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
so you see it later, cooking Momo.

1700
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
How about that? You like that?

1701
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
We'll do it.

1702
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
That would have been a good one for tonight.

1703
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I wish I thought of that.

1704
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Maybe in a future week.

1705
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
We'll do cooking Momo in a future week.

1706
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
All right.

1707
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
All right.

1708
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
All right.

1709
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Moving on.

1710
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Don't worry.

1711
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Momo will fix it.

1712
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Let's get to an email from Flaco Jones, who said,

1713
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
just wanted to clarify something that came up on the last show about Ninja.

1714
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
While I do take some issues with the guy, he seems like an overall entertaining strainer,

1715
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,000
but he has not, as Loki said last week, dropped the homophobic F-word on stream.

1716
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Perhaps Loki was thinking of the recent story

1717
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
where the DJ Deadmau5 dropped that slur on his Twitch stream

1718
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
than just non-apology apologized for it.

1719
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I can't remember who the hell is dropping the F-bomb everywhere.

1720
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I mean, Jesus Christ.

1721
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Too many people that need to stop, that's for sure.

1722
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
But I do think last week when he said that, I said,

1723
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I don't know if that's true, Loki.

1724
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So I'm glad Flaco Jones is here to correct it

1725
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
because we shouldn't attribute shitty things

1726
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
if somebody didn't actually say those things.

1727
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
So our apologies on that.

1728
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
But otherwise, everything else we said I think still holds true.

1729
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Which I don't remember what we said.

1730
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Anyway, Flaco Jones continues,

1731
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Oh, and I also wanted to answer Metal Mayhem's question from the call last week

1732
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
about what critically panned game do you love?

1733
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
My favorite critically panned game is Game & Wario for the Wii U.

1734
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
It's one of my favorite Wii U party games, despite its 61 on Metacritic.

1735
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Now, that's mostly because I love the Pictionary-style sketch game,

1736
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
but I even found a lot of the other included minigames quite fun.

1737
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Way better than the 61 score would have you believe, at least.

1738
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Anyway, thanks for the streams, and as always, have a great show, Flaco Jones.

1739
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Well, thank you. I appreciate that because it's a little polite correction,

1740
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
but followed by a participation, so that's good.

1741
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
And I remember Flaco being a fan of Game & Wario

1742
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
because I think that's where I played it, was at his place.

1743
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
So it makes sense to me. Great.

1744
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Alright.

1745
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
ActDeaf does want to point out, 61 isn't bad.

1746
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
It's just average.

1747
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I still think it works as an answer, though, because sometimes, you know, an average.

1748
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
On the Nintendo bell curve, it's probably true.

1749
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
That's true, on the Nintendo bell curve, yeah.

1750
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Alright, we have another email tonight, and this email is from Retertainment,

1751
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
who says, Dear Mr. Smoosh and other people,

1752
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
by now you've probably talked about the decision Apple made

1753
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:12,000
to delist episodes of podcasts that include the episode number of that podcast.

1754
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
If you haven't discussed this decision yet, please feel free to rant.

1755
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Okay, so here's what's up.

1756
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So Apple sent an email to all the podcasters that talked about some good guidelines

1757
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:27,000
and I think some tags that they generally saw that people weren't really using.

1758
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And I don't think the email was worded as well as it could have been

1759
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
because part of the email kind of made it sound like, or gave that impression,

1760
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
that if you're putting episode numbers in your titles because you're not using the tags,

1761
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
we're not going to accept your podcasts on iTunes

1762
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
or we're going to delist your podcasts from iTunes.

1763
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And as you can imagine, a lot of people threw a fucking fit over that

1764
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
because a lot of people put episode numbers in their descriptions.

1765
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Of course, including us at Orange Lounge Radio, but many different shows do that.

1766
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Now it is very important to note, because, you know, before you guys that have been following the news

1767
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
sent me the emails and chat, Apple did reverse course on this decision.

1768
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So they saw the tweets, they got the emails, the calls, or what have you,

1769
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:12,000
and Apple sent out a follow-up email that made it very clear in bold, large font,

1770
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
we will not delist your show if you have your episode number in the title.

1771
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
But then went on to kind of say, we're talking about the tags

1772
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
and we want you guys to explore the tags.

1773
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
And so for the sake of this email, too, because I don't think in the email

1774
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
we ever talk about that Apple did reverse course on the decision,

1775
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I think it is an important thing to put out there.

1776
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,000
But, you know, it does bring up this point that whereas Apple brought podcasting to the forefront,

1777
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,000
you know, podcasting existed before iTunes, but Apple definitely brought that to a huge...

1778
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I mean, our numbers here at Orange Lounge Radio were never bigger than that first month

1779
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,000
that Apple launched iTunes, because we were a gaming podcast that existed beforehand.

1780
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And so we were on iTunes that first week, and so we were doing really, really well.

1781
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Our numbers were, like, higher than they've ever been.

1782
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
But why aren't they still that high? I guess our show sucks. I don't know.

1783
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
All the big websites and all the celebrities and everybody else started getting into it

1784
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
and kind of diluting the pot.

1785
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And, you know, I love indie podcasts and I'm all for more people

1786
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
and more diverse perspectives on games, so I'm not butthurt about it, I swear.

1787
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
But I do think it's important that now at this point in 2019,

1788
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I don't think everybody's getting their podcasts on iTunes.

1789
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
No.

1790
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,000
We have Spotify, we have TuneIn, we have Google has their own,

1791
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
and there's other ones as well.

1792
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And you can listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

1793
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
We're not on Spotify yet, but I am going to correct that.

1794
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
That is merely an intentional problem.

1795
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
It's nothing against Spotify but about an upcoming move,

1796
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
and I don't want to have the Spotify there until the move happens.

1797
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
So there is a reason for that.

1798
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
The only one we intentionally held back on was Stitcher.

1799
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I will not have this show on Stitcher because for way too long,

1800
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Stitcher was not updating this feed and they were not doing anything about it,

1801
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
which caused our listeners to send us emails saying,

1802
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Where is your show? Why aren't you updating the show?

1803
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And so I said, You know what? Fuck it.

1804
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
And I pulled it from Stitcher because if Stitcher can't accurately represent this show,

1805
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
then I'm going to put the listeners somewhere else.

1806
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
And this is what it kind of came down to for me with Apple as well,

1807
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
and I wrote some tweets about this, and I was like,

1808
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
You can't kick all of us off iTunes.

1809
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Like NPR is putting episode numbers.

1810
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
A lot of nonfiction people put episode numbers in there.

1811
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
You know what? Apple cannot kick us all off.

1812
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
They really can't. Let them try.

1813
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
We'll simply advise our listeners to go somewhere else.

1814
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Would you guys be willing to go somewhere else besides iTunes to listen to this show?

1815
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I bet many of you would be happy to be here on Twitch or somewhere else.

1816
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And I'm just saying that I saw way too many people have that gut reaction of,

1817
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Fuck, I've got to go through my entire feed and update everything right now

1818
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
because I don't want to get kicked out of Apple.

1819
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,000
And I was kind of like, I let my cigarette and cross my legs and said,

1820
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Let them fucking come.

1821
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Let them fucking come.

1822
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And I think if more of us would band together like that,

1823
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
any podcasters would stick together.

1824
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And when a website tries to control what the podcasting standard should be,

1825
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
which no company owns,

1826
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I think we do need to band together and put our foot down and say,

1827
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Not on my watch.

1828
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Just because Siri doesn't want to get confused.

1829
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Well, no, it's about the tags.

1830
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
And from their perspective, I get what they were getting at,

1831
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
but they just didn't communicate it right.

1832
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
And so they heard that loud and clear that they didn't.

1833
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
And I think they kind of did a good job fixing that, at least on the back end.

1834
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
So there you go.

1835
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'm trying to think if there's anything else on that whole debacle I need to say.

1836
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I don't think so.

1837
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Anyway, I do want to finish Redertainment's thought, though.

1838
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
It is beyond evident that the decision made by Apple is

1839
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
and was a dumb fucking decision made before anybody fully even bothered

1840
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
to think of the wide-ranging consequences of this dumb fucking decision.

1841
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Can you think of any others?

1842
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I mean, other than the decision 62 million plus people made in 2016.

1843
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Any reasonable person knows that the morally abhorrent racist charlatan

1844
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
is a mistake and has been since its conception.

1845
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I'm just reading the email.

1846
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
That was, again, from Redertainment.

1847
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
So thank you very much for the email.

1848
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
But, yeah, at the end of the day,

1849
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I don't think any one company should control the podcasting standard.

1850
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
And if they try to do it, then we should.

1851
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
We made you, and we can break you just as easily.

1852
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
All right, anyway.

1853
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I'm trying to see if we have any chat comments on that whole thing.

1854
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Yeah, OnlySonic says, just need an RSS feed.

1855
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
That's what podcasting is.

1856
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Podcasting is audio RSS.

1857
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
That's what it is.

1858
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
It's just podcasting was kind of a catchier name for it or what have you.

1859
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
S2100Matt says, I mean, metadata is important in media.

1860
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
It helps things get organized and be seen.

1861
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I get Apple's point, but then again,

1862
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Apple hasn't really updated their tagging system well.

1863
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Swongtong points out, that happened to me with Stitcher.

1864
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I couldn't listen for about a year until I found you again.

1865
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Totally thought you quit podcasting.

1866
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
See, that pissed me off when Stitcher did that.

1867
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
So, I mean, I think they got bought again.

1868
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
And so they're probably under somebody.

1869
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
But I'm sorry.

1870
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
If Stitcher would like to have Orange On Radio on their player,

1871
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
they can come ask for it.

1872
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
That's where I'm at.

1873
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
They're a who?

1874
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Yeah, exactly. I know.

1875
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I know it's not going to happen.

1876
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I know damn well it's not going to happen.

1877
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
But I can, you know, I can sit here and go, you know what?

1878
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
And I'm going to ask, will you update my feed in a timely manner this time?

1879
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
And who, what direct person can I contact if it's out of whack?

1880
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Anyway.

1881
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
TigerCon chat says, even though there are options to stream,

1882
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
the option to listen to podcast,

1883
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I'm very careful at how much data I use.

1884
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
So I download them on iTunes first

1885
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
and then use software to sync them to my Android phone.

1886
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I'm curious, why aren't you using the Google store if you have an Android?

1887
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Because they have podcasting as well.

1888
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
At least I thought they did.

1889
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Google Play has podcasting.

1890
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It's through the Play Music app.

1891
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
That's what I use.

1892
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Yeah, so anyway.

1893
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Yeah, obviously there's tons of, tons of podcasting apps at this point.

1894
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So I don't think anyone can really dictate the standard anymore.

1895
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,000
It is not the year 2005 or 2006.

1896
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Anymore.

1897
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Anyway.

1898
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Let's get to our last email tonight, which is from DJ Rama S.

1899
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Who says, hey everyone, Rama here.

1900
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I've been having this thought lately.

1901
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I've looked at my gaming and anime collections,

1902
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
realizing that at times I'm buying these items more for the sake of having them,

1903
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
as opposed to playing or watching these discs.

1904
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I look at, sorry, I just, I just thought of Loki suddenly.

1905
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I look at my collection and realize that I have not finished most of the series

1906
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
or played through what I've collected.

1907
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
So what I'm asking is this.

1908
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Have you ever looked at your collection

1909
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
and think that you're buying these games more for the sake of collecting them

1910
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
because they'll become hard to find or not?

1911
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Thanks for taking my email.

1912
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Now I'm off to rebuilding my website.

1913
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Hopefully it'll be up and fixed by the time y'all get this email.

1914
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Rama.

1915
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And good luck on the website relaunch there, Rama.

1916
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
So Loki, are you buying games just for the sake of buying them?

1917
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Um, no.

1918
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Sometimes I'll buy them because I'm like, oh, I want to play that.

1919
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
And then I just move on to something else and don't end up playing it.

1920
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Like, um, or usually if it's on sale, like sometimes I'll pick up stuff.

1921
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Like I have Dragon Age Inquisition.

1922
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Still haven't touched that.

1923
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Um, I have Titanfall 2.

1924
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
A lot of EA games, actually.

1925
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And Need for Speed, those are all on deep sales

1926
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
and I purchased them and sold them and played them.

1927
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Wolfenstein, I have probably had such a huge library of games

1928
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
both on the PlayStation Store and through Steam

1929
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
that I have just not played most of them.

1930
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
And yet I'll still keep continuing to buy them

1931
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
and sometimes not even on sale.

1932
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Like in the case of Kingdom Hearts 3, I just bought it

1933
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
because I was like, oh, hey, that'd be fun to stream.

1934
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
And then I didn't play it.

1935
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
You know, I just like to have physical games.

1936
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Um, and maybe part of that is about collecting or so forth.

1937
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
But I always think in my mind, what if I want to sell it back someday?

1938
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I can't tell you the last time I sold a video game.

1939
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
But I can tell you the last time I loaned out video games.

1940
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
And so I know that's a big thing, too, is that, you know,

1941
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
a friend of mine will be like, oh, you're done with that?

1942
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Like one of my friends borrowed Mass Effect recently

1943
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
just to start playing through that, especially with

1944
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
backwards compatible and Xbox One now and everything.

1945
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
So they've been playing that.

1946
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
So, um, I think that's kind of the biggest perk to having digital.

1947
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
But you're right, there's a lot of like,

1948
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
wow, wow, Rob, physical versus digital.

1949
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Um, but, um, yeah, I mean, digital is starting to look more and more,

1950
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
you know, especially when it's like on the case of Xbox.

1951
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Um, if I buy a digital, I can play it on my PC or my Xbox.

1952
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
You know, and I've talked about this before about the whole,

1953
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
like, what's the, you know, value of the game?

1954
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
What's the equity about the disc you hold and so forth?

1955
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
You know, if digital can offset that value,

1956
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
be it through a deep cut sale through.

1957
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
But if something is $60 to buy a digital or $60 to buy a physical,

1958
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
you know what, I'm going to buy a physical.

1959
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Because at least I have the option to loan it out, sell it back.

1960
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I have all of that. I don't have that when it's digital.

1961
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
True. Um, the way I look at it though,

1962
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
like especially when I'm looking at physical and digital,

1963
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
it's normally I'm just purchasing it.

1964
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I'm probably not going to end up selling it back because let's be honest,

1965
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
like if you sell something back, like way down the line,

1966
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
say when you trade in your system or something like that,

1967
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
it's probably not worth anything anyways at that point.

1968
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Um, and you're really not getting much.

1969
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
It takes a space in the house.

1970
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Like for me, I'll decide, Oh, Hey, I want this game.

1971
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I'll download it, you know, or I'll purchase it digitally

1972
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
and I'll set it to download on my system remotely and then come home and play it.

1973
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Maybe that's assuming actually play the game I purchased.

1974
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:56,000
But you know, same, same thought process there is I could do that.

1975
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Um, I, I purchase a lot of games digitally.

1976
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I purchased the Lego game digitally.

1977
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
I mean, um, most of the games I have on the switch are digital.

1978
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I do have some physical games, but those it's, um,

1979
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
sales and getting stuff used usually.

1980
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Um, I don't know.

1981
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I walk into the store all the time,

1982
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
like GameStop when my kids are playing the demo kiosk,

1983
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
because God forbid they play the switch they have at home.

1984
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
They want to play the demo, whatever.

1985
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Um, so I'm actually looking at used games all the time.

1986
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Like I'm like, is there anything I want?

1987
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
And I just kind of like, no, not really.

1988
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I'm not gonna, nothing really stands out like, Oh my God,

1989
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I need to pick this up.

1990
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Um, I don't know.

1991
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I, I just eventually someday when I retire, you know,

1992
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I'll have all these games I can play and then I'll be able to do that.

1993
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
She Hulk in chat says, uh, physical is going away for good someday.

1994
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
No, I don't know if it would be a hundred percent though.

1995
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I get what you're getting at.

1996
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I do think we may see like disc drives go away.

1997
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
We, we thought for a little bit,

1998
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
some of the early rumors about the Xbox one is that there may be a

1999
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
version with no drive.

2000
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Uh, and that could be true, could be true emphasis on could be about

2001
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
PlayStation five of the next Xbox.

2002
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:11,000
But I do think if the system can handle physical media,

2003
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
there's still going to be that.

2004
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And I think there will always be, even if it went a hundred percent digital

2005
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
GameStop or those types of stores would still have like,

2006
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,000
here's this collectible plushie you can get for Pokemon gen eight.

2007
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And it comes with a digital code to get the game online so that there's

2008
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,000
still like a physical something, something integrated with the digital.

2009
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I just bought, funny enough,

2010
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,000
a brand new microphone for my studio computer because I did, uh,

2011
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I did one of those package things. Like I did the overwatch,

2012
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
like I taped that in advance. I did one a couple of weeks ago. I did a, um,

2013
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I did one for a, what was the, I did Tetris 99 a couple of weeks ago.

2014
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
And I was like, God, my audio is fucking horrible on this.

2015
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I'm going to just get a new microphone. So I went and got a new microphone.

2016
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
And guess what? I got a Yeti microphone.

2017
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Guess what it came with? A $50 gift certificate to the Ubisoft store.

2018
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I was going to say,

2019
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I thought it came with Assassin's Creed origins cause they had that originally.

2020
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Close. Okay. So like it's like 50,

2021
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
$50 off a $60 game on the Ubisoft store or whatever that is.

2022
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
So that's the kind of stuff I think you may still see in the future.

2023
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Is that really physical going away though?

2024
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
But maybe the way we think about what physical games are,

2025
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
that could maybe change in the future.

2026
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
But, you know, Loki joked about it earlier in the show,

2027
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,000
but it's still very true, especially when it comes to a series like Pokemon.

2028
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,000
The merchandising, the physical shit, that is all still very important.

2029
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
And I think as video games is more and more a part of our society,

2030
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
that isn't just this underground thing that nerds play.

2031
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,000
As Fortnite has an aisle dedicated to it and Target and things like that,

2032
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,000
there's always going to be some sort of physical manifestation of gaming

2033
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,000
in the world, even if it isn't in the future,

2034
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
a disc that goes in the drive, if that makes sense.

2035
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
So, but good discussion.

2036
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
So great emails tonight. Thank you guys so much for the emails.

2037
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
We hope more of you will send emails.

2038
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Don't be shy. Send your emails for next week.

2039
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Participate at orangelandrater.com is the place to send those emails.

2040
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Let's move on and get to the next story that we have on deck. Loki.

2041
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:32,000
So GOG has quietly let go of a dozen of their staff, apparently, this last week here.

2042
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
They didn't say why the layoffs happened,

2043
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,000
but there was some financial issues that caused the layoff.

2044
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Basically, there is a rep that said that letting people go is never easy.

2045
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:51,000
We have been rearranging certain teams since October 2018,

2046
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
affecting in the closure of around a dozen positions last week.

2047
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,000
The same time since the process started, we have welcomed nearly twice as many new members

2048
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
and currently hold 20 open positions.

2049
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
So it just sounds like restructuring right now.

2050
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Still not the best thing to hear about.

2051
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I feel like every week, literally every week since this year started,

2052
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
maybe two weeks into the year, we've had some story about layoffs.

2053
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
And they were saying that there was a staffer that had been, I think, let go,

2054
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,000
and they said that it was about 10% of the staff that was affected by layoffs.

2055
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:30,000
I don't know. Whatever. I mean, it's restructuring.

2056
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
So, I don't know. This isn't as big as a software company or something.

2057
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I mean, it's still a platform, people being let out.

2058
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Aren't they still kind of trying to come out and say,

2059
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:45,000
because of this increased competition with game makers getting a larger share of the profits,

2060
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:50,000
which we all know the Epic Store came in and kind of took a swing at that whole thing.

2061
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Isn't that kind of all stuff they're trying to blame for why they're just going to have to scale back?

2062
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Because they have to give more money to the game developers to be competitive.

2063
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Well, competition's hard, so that's going to be an issue that they have to do,

2064
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
give people a larger cut of their profits.

2065
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I'm disappointed that GOG kind of left the retro stuff behind.

2066
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I know it's still there.

2067
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Because everybody in chat is going to scream it out, I know.

2068
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
The retro stuff just isn't as lucrative. You don't make as much money.

2069
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
You're selling it for less money.

2070
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:24,000
It doesn't mean I don't miss it and that there's so many things that I feel like are missing.

2071
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
But rights, et cetera, I get that I can't just have my dream list of games

2072
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
and that that's going to suddenly happen on GOG.

2073
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
But it is just a bummer that more of that couldn't have been fleshed out.

2074
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
But obviously, they had to get into the newer stuff to stay competitive.

2075
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Yeah.

2076
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
And it's competitive, and so we're starting to see.

2077
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:49,000
But maybe the silver lining is that, OK, so unfortunately, GOG had to let 12 people go,

2078
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,000
but maybe something like the Epic Store is going to have to hire 12 people because it's getting bigger.

2079
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Well, they just said they let go of 12 positions, but they are hiring for 20.

2080
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,000
It's just that those positions, they're restructuring.

2081
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:07,000
So 12 of the positions that they had, say they were customer service or something,

2082
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
maybe they need 20 positions to fill in development of a new platform

2083
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
or enhancements to their online platform or whatever.

2084
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Yeah, it's just needed in different parts.

2085
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
They can't just shuffle some of those people.

2086
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Maybe the skill sets didn't quite line up with what they needed for those other positions.

2087
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
So I don't know.

2088
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Sg100Matt in our chat says, well, PR-wise, GOG didn't do themselves any favors last year.

2089
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I'll just leave it at that.

2090
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:36,000
You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but since you said it, I just didn't want to be tacky about,

2091
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
you know, maybe this was the PR department that had to.

2092
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:50,000
But since you said it, unfortunately, companies really need to watch it when it comes to their PR

2093
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,000
and who represents them because all that stuff can have a repercussion on the rest of the company

2094
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:01,000
and people that maybe had nothing to do, hardworking artists and programmers

2095
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:08,000
and people that had nothing to do with those types of discussions on how to be edgy or cool or things like that.

2096
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:17,000
So PR companies really need to, and PR divisions and departments and so forth, really need to watch themselves.

2097
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
And that's all I'm going to say about this week as well as last year.

2098
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So let's move on, shall we, to our next story, which has to do with a Konami 50th Anniversary Collection

2099
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Arcade Classics rating that showed up.

2100
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Nothing's been officially announced by Konami, but the game was rated recently in Australia

2101
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,000
and isn't that how a lot of these games seem to leak all the time?

2102
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Yes, they leak with, usually like ratings boards and stuff showing like some sort of rating,

2103
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
like either a PEGI rating or something like that.

2104
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Now, this has many people saying, ooh, Konami made things like Metal Gear and so that could,

2105
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:05,000
well, hold up, if it's Konami Arcade Collection, I wouldn't get too crazy about what you're going to see in this.

2106
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:10,000
If you want an idea about what to see in this, look at the types of Konami games that have been released

2107
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:15,000
on places like Xbox Live, Arcade, the game room.

2108
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Believe it or not, there was a lot of Konami stuff in that game room when that was still a thing.

2109
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
God, I miss that service.

2110
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:25,000
And, you know, Konami's kind of released stuff from their 80s catalog.

2111
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,000
If you need an idea what that looks like, I would, and again, we don't know what's in it,

2112
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:34,000
but I'm just hypothesizing you might want to be thinking a little less Metal Gear Castlevania

2113
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:40,000
and the things they're known for on console and maybe be thinking a little more about things like Scramble,

2114
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Jungler, Frogger, maybe, although Frogger's a weird one because Sega actually released it.

2115
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
They'll throw in Frogger.

2116
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
They throw in Frogger all the fucking time.

2117
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Time Pilot.

2118
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
When no one wants it.

2119
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I love Time Pilot. I would love to see that.

2120
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Maybe Tutankham, I'd love that, but again, some of these were like co-pilot, like Stern was involved with that too.

2121
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Jairus, I love that game, so I'd be there for that.

2122
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Track and Field was an 80s arcade classic as well.

2123
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And then, you know, Yara Kung Fu was like an original fighting game classic.

2124
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,000
But there was Gradius in the arcade, so you never know.

2125
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Salamander in that whole series, you might see some of that.

2126
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Technically, there was a Castlevania game in the arcade, so we might get lucky and see Haunted Castle could show up.

2127
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
And I would say if you guys get really lucky, maybe stuff like Sunset Riders, you know, when you get into the later Konami years.

2128
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I doubt the Ninja Turtles game, because Konami did at least the second game, didn't they do the first one?

2129
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Yeah, they did. They did the first and second Ninja Turtles arcade game.

2130
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,000
But then you get into licensing, da-pa-da-pa-da.

2131
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Simpsons arcade game never happened.

2132
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I don't know if that, yeah.

2133
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:45,000
So, I mean, those things only happened, like the Simpsons arcade game did come out as a download, as did the Ninja Turtles.

2134
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:51,000
But that was like through new partnerships, so like Ubisoft, EA, or whoever had the current rights at the time.

2135
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Those came out.

2136
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:58,000
So, I don't know. But also, you know what, maybe, if we're really lucky, here's the one I would be crossing my fingers and toes for,

2137
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
is that in 1992, they made the X-Men arcade game.

2138
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:07,000
So, again, license, it's com- if they could get all that worked out, I know I'd love to see that.

2139
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
So, we'll see.

2140
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Oh, DJ Rama S also chimed in chat with that. I swear I said it first.

2141
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
DJ Rama S also suggests Bucky O'Hare.

2142
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Let's see, some folks in chat.

2143
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Blades of Steel, Double Dribble.

2144
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Uh, Dartesia pointing out, technically, Castlevania was in the arcade, but the original game had its issues.

2145
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Uh, Sjoerdundermatt says Russian Attack, probably.

2146
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Yeah, you guys in chat, you guys are naming the, uh, the right stuff there.

2147
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
YYR said Ninja Turtles, Simpsons, X-Men did all come out on Xbox Live Arcade, so it's not impossible.

2148
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
You're right, it's not impossible, but it may be a little trickier if it's in a collection,

2149
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
or it's gonna be harder to make sure the rights holders-

2150
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It's less lucrative for them to re-license that, you know, to, it's not the first of the value add to it.

2151
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I just don't think that they would go that far to get some of this stuff in there.

2152
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Now, I guess it's worth asking, cause I do see it in chat, Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution.

2153
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I wish, but no.

2154
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I wish, but I just, I don't, how would DDR work on the Switch anyway?

2155
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Like, I guess you could do with arrows.

2156
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Beatmania could do the five key like you used to do on the Playstation if you downloaded the controller.

2157
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I would love it, don't get me wrong, but I just don't.

2158
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:21,000
It would be awesome if Konami would put them in as like secret things, or like Easter eggs,

2159
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
but they're just, why would they? Why would they do that?

2160
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:30,000
This is, you know, but prove me wrong, Konami, I dare you, I would love that.

2161
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Moving on, uh, Loki, you got something for us, right?

2162
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Yes, and so this is kind of a silly add to the game, but there's this game called Plague Inc.

2163
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:45,000
where you design your own, like, super viruses and watch them take over the world and stuff like that.

2164
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:54,000
So, now they have a scenario, thanks to fan demand, that involves anti-vaxxers.

2165
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:01,000
And so, apparently they had a petition out there that says if this petition gets 10,000,

2166
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
we will add a specific new anti-vaxxer scenario into Plague Inc.

2167
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,000
And of course, over 20,000 people signed it, so they are going to be doing that.

2168
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
So, that's kind of funny.

2169
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Dude, is there actually anybody anti-vaxxer still left?

2170
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I feel like it's one of those things that everybody jokes and makes jokes about and so forth,

2171
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
but like, nobody actually confesses to actually being an anti-vaxxer anymore.

2172
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I think that there still are.

2173
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Ugh, get with it, people.

2174
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Well, I guess, okay, yeah, as I'm saying this aloud, and I'm sure before you all scream at me in chat,

2175
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
and I'm going to, believe me, I am on the side of kids ought to be vaccinated,

2176
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,000
and I work for a company that says that and puts that out there as well.

2177
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
It's stupid not to be vaccinated.

2178
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
And I'm thinking about, there's the whole measles thing that just happened in Washington, so you're right.

2179
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
There are still morons out there that are...

2180
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
It's just the problem...

2181
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,000
It's Facebook's fault. It is all Facebook's fault.

2182
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Nobody would have heard what Jenny McCarthy had to say if they hadn't shared it on Facebook.

2183
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Facebook should have shut that down when they had the chance, but free speech.

2184
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
So, anyway.

2185
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I liked Jenny McCarthy when she was set dressing, but, you know, now she has opinions.

2186
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Alright, well, everybody in chat, I knew that happened, everybody in chat, there's many anti-vaxxers.

2187
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I know people that are anti-vaxxers.

2188
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:22,000
But hey, you know what, though, to balance the universe out with all this pro-vaccination stuff,

2189
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,000
we're going to give Goop a new Netflix series, so that's a thing.

2190
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Alright, anyway, vaccinate your fucking kids.

2191
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I work with medical professionals, and they all agree.

2192
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Vaccinate your fucking kids.

2193
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
And yourself, honestly.

2194
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Alright, anyway.

2195
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Moving on. Something a little more lighthearted.

2196
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Yes, so this is kind of cool.

2197
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I remember actually getting this within a box of cereal, but...

2198
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:56,000
You may remember a while back, especially if you were a kid in the 90s, that there was, you know, a game called Doom,

2199
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:03,000
and then there was a famous mod, or total conversion of Doom, that was free with a box of Chex cereal.

2200
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
And that game was called Chex Quest.

2201
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And Chex Quest was a kid-friendly, non-violent Doom total conversion that you could play,

2202
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
and it came with your box of cereal.

2203
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Well, guess what? It's getting an HD remake.

2204
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Why?

2205
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Because it's fun.

2206
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So, Chex Quest HD is apparently a passion project of a guy named Chuck Jacoby.

2207
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Nobody's getting paid for it.

2208
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:37,000
And him and volunteers have created, with permission from General Mills, so it is endorsed,

2209
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
that they have fully committed to...

2210
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Somebody at General Mills was like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?

2211
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Alright, sure, free advertising for Chex, sure, why not?

2212
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Yeah, so they're remaking the whole game, including the five-level single-player shooter.

2213
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:58,000
So, neat that it's a thing that's gonna be coming out.

2214
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,000
When is somebody gonna remake Sneak King and all these other great advertisement games?

2215
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I want that shit re-released, because that was fucking brilliant.

2216
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,000
And they promised more, they were supposed to be making more games, but it hasn't happened yet.

2217
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I need more.

2218
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I need more.

2219
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,000
But, if you would like to follow the progress of Chex Quest HD,

2220
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
they don't really have an official page aside from their Facebook group,

2221
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
so facebook.com slash chexquesthd.

2222
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Alright, fair enough.

2223
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
You can go follow the progress of Chex Quest HD.

2224
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
When's Chex Mix Quest HD, because I prefer Chex Mix.

2225
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I wanna see a version of Chex Quest built into the new Doom game.

2226
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:43,000
The frenetic action that is of the modern Doom.

2227
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Oh man, I love it.

2228
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
It's gonna be awesome.

2229
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Alright, and one more story for you guys tonight about a website where you can go on adventures.

2230
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:59,000
It's a site called Noclip, and it's at the URL noclip.website.

2231
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Not a .com or a .website.

2232
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Because, you know, they expanded the .domains layer.

2233
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:11,000
So there's noclip.website, which has levels stripped out of existing Nintendo games.

2234
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Things like Ocarina of Time, Luigi's Mansion, Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine.

2235
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
And what do you do?

2236
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
You just go flying around looking wherever the hell you want.

2237
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It's just an exploration.

2238
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
That's why it's noclipping, because you can go through walls.

2239
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
You can fly anywhere.

2240
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,000
So you can explore worlds beyond maybe what the original games would let you explore.

2241
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
And I know some of you eat that stuff up.

2242
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Jamie loves this stuff.

2243
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
She has a whole Mass Effect.

2244
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I wish she was here tonight, because she has that whole Mass Effect Tumblr that was dedicated to finding stuff hidden in the Mass Effect games through mods like this that would let you clip through Mass Effect.

2245
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,000
So people like to do this stuff, you know, breaking down the Nintendo files and all that stuff.

2246
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I mess around with some of the Mario Kart maps.

2247
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It was pretty neat.

2248
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Did you?

2249
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Yeah.

2250
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
And I noticed there's like gifs and little videos where you can go through fast.

2251
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Yeah, it's pretty fast.

2252
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
You do a Mario Kart course and you have zero speed.

2253
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I did try. They have a few experimental things in there.

2254
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,000
So they have some non-Nintendo games.

2255
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
They also have Super Mario Odyssey.

2256
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Although that really wasn't loading fast, so I didn't do that.

2257
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,000
But the Mario Kart maps.

2258
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:24,000
And I did Super Paper Mario, which isn't too exciting to look at, because to me it's Paper Mario.

2259
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
But it was neat.

2260
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:31,000
All right, and some folks in chat, of course, that got linked in chat, thank you, from Matt.

2261
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
And some folks are saying, fantastic chats.

2262
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Holy crap, this Noclip website is dope.

2263
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Yeah, one of those things that's kind of fun to explore, especially because I know a lot of y'all have a soft spot for Nintendo games.

2264
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
And this is just really cool that it kind of just lets you explore them in a different way.

2265
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
So it's like, what was behind that house?

2266
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
What was in that place?

2267
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
What was on top of the hill that I couldn't get to?

2268
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
This website kind of lets you do that.

2269
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
So pretty cool.

2270
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I like that type of exploration stuff.

2271
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I wish I'd had the time tonight.

2272
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I was going to throw together some B-roll, but with all the changes we had to do last minute, I ran out of time.

2273
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
So you'll just have to go adventure and look at it yourself over at the Noclip.website.

2274
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:13,000
So vidpower573 in chat says, I see myself spending hours on this website.

2275
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I understand.

2276
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I understand the struggle, that's for sure.

2277
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Anyway, now is the part of the show where we're going to go to the listener roundtable where you can participate,

2278
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
ask us a question in the chat room, or if you'd like to head on over to Discord in our green room,

2279
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,000
you can actually call into the show as well.

2280
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I did want to, I promised last week that we would incorporate tweets back into the show in this segment as well.

2281
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So I wanted to go over to twitter.com slash o-l-r and actually look at some of the tweets that came in this week,

2282
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
because there were a few of you that tweeted.

2283
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:49,000
And I do want to say very nice words to people like Spyro557 who wrote a tweet that was like,

2284
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:53,000
everybody should listen to Bobby and OLR tonight at 8 o'clock Eastern.

2285
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I just want to give you a gold star listener recognition there,

2286
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:04,000
because we say at the end of the show, help us spread the word and get your friends to listen,

2287
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
and Spyro definitely did that with the tweet this week, so thank you so much for that.

2288
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:14,000
But we did get a tweet from M. Colburn on Twitter who was answering the guilty pleasure question.

2289
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
A lot of you guys liked that question.

2290
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:23,000
So M. Colburn tweeted us saying, my guilty pleasure crap game was Winx Club on the DS,

2291
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:28,000
which Shane, that's one of his too, because I don't know if that was the one he worked on.

2292
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
He was.

2293
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:34,000
It was one of those Winx games, and Flocko I think to some extent also considers that a guilty pleasure game.

2294
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:42,000
So sometimes those games that are like silly things for kids, like sometimes people get into them.

2295
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I guess one guilty pleasure game that I played, but only because it was so bad, was Driver 3.

2296
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Oh yeah.

2297
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Drive 3.

2298
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:57,000
I was just thinking one I didn't mention last week, Spice World on PlayStation.

2299
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2300
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Let's put another girl through her paces.

2301
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Yeah, that doesn't really have the same connotation as...

2302
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:11,000
I know, I know. I loved the Spice World game that was so stupid, but I loved it.

2303
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Anyway, do we have any last minute stories, Loki, before I get...

2304
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
If you guys have any questions in chat, you can feel free to ask them.

2305
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I don't know, did you see the new trailer for Detective Pikachu? That looked pretty awesome.

2306
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Oh, I did. It did look awesome, you're right.

2307
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Yeah, so I want to definitely check that out still even more so than before.

2308
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:36,000
There's a rumor that Sony is offering refunds on Anthem, no questions asked, so that may be a thing.

2309
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
You're looking to get a refund.

2310
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Is that an exploit though?

2311
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I don't know.

2312
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Alright, well let's get to a Discord chat, because we do get folks that want to talk to us on Discord,

2313
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
so I want to get to the first of those calls tonight.

2314
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2315
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Hello, it's Delvin from Video Game Realness.

2316
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,000
It is so good to hear from you, my streaming buddy Delvin. How are you doing tonight?

2317
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Good, I'm of course a long time listener, but first time caller.

2318
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Is this really your first time on the show?

2319
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
First time calling, yes.

2320
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Wow, well, you know why I'm confused? Because you were here.

2321
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Yes, I was on the show, but this is my first time calling into the show.

2322
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Okay, I will accept that. To what do we owe this call tonight? What's on your mind?

2323
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Well, I wanted to talk about something that happened with one of my friends,

2324
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:30,000
and then it made me get into thinking about online, on consoles, and paying.

2325
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:36,000
So basically, he wanted to try Anthem, because there's all the hubbub about Anthem,

2326
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:42,000
so he rented the game. So he rented the game from, I can't remember what service,

2327
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:48,000
and got it home, but he doesn't have PS Online, so he couldn't play the game.

2328
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:53,000
So in order to play the game, you had to play at least one month minimum to play this game,

2329
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:58,000
which there's no way to play the game unless you have online.

2330
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I didn't even think about that. You're right, a game like Anthem is always online,

2331
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,000
there's really nothing to do single player. Well, I thought you kind of,

2332
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I remember in the demo that I played of Anthem, you kind of could do a single player,

2333
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,000
but it was like, are you sure? Are you sure? You sure you don't want to play with other people?

2334
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,000
But then now that I think about it, it's still like putting your progress in the cloud,

2335
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:25,000
and you're still online whether you're playing with other people or not. So, interesting. Huh.

2336
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Correct. So he could not play at all unless he had paid for online.

2337
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
So it got me thinking, you know, when Xbox Live came out,

2338
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:41,000
it was a luxury to play online with your friends, to play Halo online with your friends and other games.

2339
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:47,000
But now in 2019, where many more games require online,

2340
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Overwatch, Fortnite, Apex, now Anthem,

2341
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:59,000
is it valid for consoles to still charge you for online gaming

2342
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:05,000
when now the games require it as a basic necessity to even play the game?

2343
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Well, obviously, I was wondering what your guys' opinion was on that.

2344
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:14,000
The easy answer is no. Especially when you consider PC, right?

2345
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,000
You don't have to pay to play online on PC. Correct. You're able to do that there.

2346
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
So the easy answer is no. But the reality, Delvin, is that people are still paying for it.

2347
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
So as long as people are paying for it, they're going to keep charging for it.

2348
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:34,000
But this is going to put Microsoft in a very interesting position in the very new future.

2349
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,000
And this is what I've been saying, Delvin, on the show for like the past two years.

2350
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
One of my E3 predictions has always been,

2351
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Microsoft's going to announce that they no longer are going to charge for multiplayer online

2352
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:49,000
because why are they doing it when they release the same games on PC

2353
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
and you don't have to pay for online?

2354
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Instead, the Xbox Live Gold monthly thing is going to turn into

2355
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,000
this Game Pass thing that they've been wanting to sell you anyway.

2356
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Like, why don't they just bait and switch Xbox Live Gold

2357
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,000
with the Netflix thing they want you to have anyway?

2358
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Because the Netflix thing, they charge more for it,

2359
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
and so I don't think that they're going to want to get both of that.

2360
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
They're just going to get money wherever they can.

2361
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I just don't think in the long run, especially when they, you know,

2362
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:24,000
when they start to blur the line between PC and console more and more,

2363
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,000
I'm not sure that strategy is going to sustain itself.

2364
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
So they're milking it while they still can.

2365
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
But I would, you know, I'm going to again foolishly predict,

2366
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
as I have for the past couple years, within the next few years,

2367
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Microsoft's going to be the one to drop it first and everyone will cheer,

2368
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
and then it's going to peer pressure Sony into doing the same thing.

2369
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Nintendo will cling to it, because they were late to the party,

2370
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
and they're going to say, Nintendo Online,

2371
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
all these other things that they do.

2372
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
That is my crazy ass.

2373
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
If Michael Patrick can make predictions, so can I.

2374
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Do you guys not like your free Nintendo games each month?

2375
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I mean, all right.

2376
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,000
My thing is that I think it should, like, as you mentioned,

2377
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,000
you can have the premium service and get the free games.

2378
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:13,000
That's fine, but I think for basic online, playing with your friends,

2379
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:17,000
or even just being able to play Fortnite, Apex, Anthem,

2380
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:23,000
these games that require online, you cannot play the game unless you have online.

2381
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,000
That should not be charged for anymore going forward.

2382
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Now, let me give you another perspective here,

2383
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
because YYR in our chat is, you know, who has made games

2384
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
and done things for things like Steam,

2385
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,000
is giving us another perspective here I think is important to weigh.

2386
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,000
So YYR in chat says, once again, I'll make this case,

2387
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
because I believe we've had a similar discussion before,

2388
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
but probably every time I make my dumb prediction.

2389
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,000
The platform owners offer functionality to developers,

2390
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,000
including matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements, et cetera,

2391
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
as well as run all of the servers to back that up,

2392
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
and it costs the developers nothing.

2393
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Someone has to pay for it, and they ask the gamers to do that.

2394
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:04,000
This strategy back in the OG Xbox in early 360 days

2395
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,000
led to most games having multiplayer features

2396
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
that otherwise would not have had them.

2397
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
So that's an excellent perspective, YYR,

2398
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
and I don't want to discount that perspective.

2399
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:18,000
However, the reality is, what rules the talk of the gaming world?

2400
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Perception. Perception is going to rule everything.

2401
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,000
And the issue is, is that the perception is,

2402
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:29,000
on PC I get to play it for free because EA is absorbing all that content.

2403
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
You get to play it for free, but you have to do it through Origin,

2404
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,000
because EA has eaten that cost to get you to use Origin, right?

2405
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:40,000
But the perception is, it's free, but it's not free the other places.

2406
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:44,000
So I definitely don't want to invalidate your point or say it's not valid.

2407
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
It is, but I still think that perception,

2408
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,000
and I think there is, you say the gamers are eating the cost.

2409
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I still think there's a possibility Microsoft may be willing to eat that cost

2410
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:04,000
to try to win people into its PC and all-in-one kind of ecosystem.

2411
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,000
They may be willing to take that risk.

2412
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:11,000
What do you think about the comments I just read from YYR, Delvin?

2413
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I think that it made sense before.

2414
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I just think going forward now, the way that the infrastructure is there,

2415
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,000
it's been built, once upon a time it didn't exist,

2416
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
so yes, we had the gamers pay for it,

2417
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
but now the infrastructure is there.

2418
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Let's be real, this does not cost Microsoft or Sony

2419
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
a large amount of money to run servers for online.

2420
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
It doesn't in the grand scheme of things.

2421
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,000
So I think the infrastructure is there now.

2422
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
They don't need to continue charging for it.

2423
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Just charge for your premium service, your game streaming, your free games.

2424
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
I think that's the best thing going forward.

2425
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I just thought of something too that is going to bring this issue to a head

2426
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:56,000
maybe sooner rather than later, and that is those rumors,

2427
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:00,000
big neon sign rumors, the best Fleetwood Mac album rumors

2428
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,000
that came up last week on the show about this fact that

2429
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Nintendo and Microsoft may very soon have a

2430
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
we're getting in bed together type of arrangement.

2431
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
So how's that going to work?

2432
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:17,000
If I have a game like, let's say, what were the games that were rumored?

2433
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Ori and the Blind Forest was one. Well, that's mostly single player.

2434
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
What else did they rumor for the Switch?

2435
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Cuphead, right? Which I guess has two player mode.

2436
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,000
But I mean, let's say that Microsoft puts one of their more multiplayer games

2437
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
on the Nintendo Switch. How's that going to work?

2438
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Am I going to need a Nintendo system?

2439
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Am I going to need a Microsoft system?

2440
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Here's how it works with PC.

2441
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
When you're playing cross platform for Forza Horizon or something like that,

2442
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I don't need to pay for gold in order to play online

2443
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
because I'm on PC.

2444
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Whereas if someone has an Xbox, they have to play for gold

2445
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
in order to get online.

2446
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
So wouldn't it be weird that if I play Forza or whatever,

2447
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
and again, this is all rumor anyway,

2448
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
so this may just be a whole bunch of smoke and mirrors,

2449
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
and that's fine too, but to think this through a little further,

2450
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,000
what's going to happen if that ends up being the case?

2451
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
That these Microsoft games are playable on Nintendo's console,

2452
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
so they will let you play for free?

2453
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Again, I think that adds to the list of why Microsoft is,

2454
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,000
sooner rather than later, just going to eat the cost of gold.

2455
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:20,000
I don't know. We'll see. I don't know.

2456
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
VG Realness, I think it's an excellent question,

2457
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:26,000
and I think it's a thing to watch at this E3 for sure,

2458
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
but again, obviously as the consumer, I want to sit here and say,

2459
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,000
no, they should get rid of it, but the reality is,

2460
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,000
but will they when people are still paying for it,

2461
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
but as the industry is changing in front of our eyes,

2462
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
as we're moving from physical to digital,

2463
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
is this going to be reevaluated too?

2464
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
And I think it will be. I think this whole online system

2465
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,000
and who's paying for it and all that will be reevaluated. We'll see.

2466
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Let's hope so.

2467
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Well, thank you so much for the call. It's so good to hear from you.

2468
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
All right. Bye.

2469
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Hey, wait. Plug your Twitch real fast. Plug your Twitch.

2470
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Oh, come follow me at twitch.tv slash VG Realness.

2471
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Excellent. Thank you. I will.

2472
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
All right. Bye.

2473
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
All right. Let's get to another call here.

2474
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
We have a few people waiting. I want to try to get to everybody.

2475
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Let's get to this next call here.

2476
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2477
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Hey, what's up, guys? This is Kaijuto.

2478
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Great to hear from you, Kaijuto. What's on your mind tonight?

2479
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:20,000
I just want to recommend some VR games for you because I know you said

2480
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,000
earlier you wanted some games that would like work you out like Beat Saber.

2481
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Yes, please. I would love to hear it.

2482
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Number one game you got to get and I hope it's still on the market because

2483
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
the company that made it, they went under.

2484
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
So they're no longer like updating the game. Well, I think they're fixing bugs.

2485
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,000
But, you know, like they're not responsible for doing any more with the games.

2486
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Hopefully it's still there. But that's Spark.

2487
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:45,000
That's the main one you have to get. That's like it's like a combination of everything.

2488
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
It's like tennis, fencing, boxing.

2489
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I remember you. You've talked about this before.

2490
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,000
You're a fan. I know. I remember this one.

2491
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,000
And it will it will work you out. And it's not you know, it's not like the

2492
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
what was the running game that you were playing where you just like constantly

2493
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:04,000
swinging your arms and you have to run around the map like you're just standing

2494
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
in one spot. But the workout that it gives you is like your arms and everything.

2495
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
You swing in, you're dodging the ball, all that stuff.

2496
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
But you're basically standing in one spot, which I think is like ideal for like

2497
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
a lot of VR sports games. You know, I really don't like the games where you're

2498
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
like kind of like trying to traverse a map because that gets really confusing.

2499
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,000
So, yeah, definitely get that one. Then there's the Creed boxing game,

2500
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:28,000
which is another game where you're kind of like standing there boxing a guy.

2501
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,000
And then there's another boxing game. And then there's Rec Room,

2502
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:36,000
which is a free game that you can download. And that's like that's a community

2503
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,000
thing where you're like, you know, you're playing laser tag with people.

2504
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,000
There's a dodgeball game that really doesn't work that well.

2505
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
And there's other activities that you have like a battle royale game in there as well.

2506
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Rec Room is a is a PC game, though, right? Not PlayStation.

2507
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:53,000
No, it's PlayStation. Oh, it is. Yeah, it's free.

2508
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Yes, of course. So, well, should be playing with.

2509
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Yeah. All right. That's one of the great things about VR is that there's a lot of

2510
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,000
cross platform play in a lot of the VR games.

2511
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:07,000
So you're always playing with somebody on Rift or now you got the Oculus Go.

2512
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Does everybody playing together? So definitely check those out.

2513
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
That's all I want to do is recommend those games. Hey, I love it.

2514
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I love the recommendations, you know, and somebody there was another game that was

2515
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:18,000
recommended to me by Bobby that I looked at on the store.

2516
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
I just didn't get around to it. It's not really an exercise game,

2517
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
but it was basically F-Zero and in VR, something like Radial G or something.

2518
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I don't remember the name. You know, Wipeout. Have you done Wipeout?

2519
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I can't find my disk for Wipeout. I think I loaned it out.

2520
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Oh, so there's the downside of your physical games, by the way.

2521
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:38,000
And I will I will let you digital people have your field day.

2522
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
There is your downside. I loaned it out.

2523
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I can't remember who I loaned it out to and now I can't play the fucking game in VR.

2524
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
But yes, Wipeout is certainly there, too.

2525
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Yeah, we buy it. It's cheap, man. Super cheap.

2526
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I know. It's true. It's true. All right.

2527
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Well, thanks for the recommendations, my friend. I'm going to look into it.

2528
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:56,000
All right. Take care, buddy.

2529
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
All right. Let's get to at least one more call here.

2530
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:02,000
If you want to call into the show, though, join our green room over on Discord,

2531
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
vognetwork.com slash Discord. But we do have at least one more call tonight.

2532
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Hi, you are on orange on radio. Who's this?

2533
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Hey, this is Deft.

2534
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Hey, Deft. It's great to hear from you. What's on your mind?

2535
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Well, let's talk about the beta.

2536
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Let's.

2537
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
You first.

2538
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Okay.

2539
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Well, basically, one of the things the beta did right,

2540
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:32,000
it was a really great PlayStation classic without being the PlayStation classic.

2541
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,000
The first of all.

2542
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:43,000
And really, like it wasn't like really that expensive to to get most of the games you wanted.

2543
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:47,000
And it's like really, really easy to play.

2544
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:52,000
And even on the PlayStation TV, because you could do that, too.

2545
02:31:52,000 --> 02:32:01,000
And probably not not as cheap or probably not as bad as the PlayStation classic was.

2546
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
The PlayStation.

2547
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:15,000
That's one of the things I really, really I'm baffled that Sony like really did good in this or did well on that on the beta and pretty much screwed up on the PlayStation classic.

2548
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I will say the PlayStation Vita was an excellent example of Sony knowing how to do backwards compatibility.

2549
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:29,000
The PSP stuff worked very well, especially considering that, you know, the Vita didn't have a disk drive, so you couldn't just like actually physically put in the disk.

2550
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
But it supported stuff that you had on the marketplace.

2551
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,000
They opened up the PSP catalog to be able to rebuy things.

2552
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
And it worked out very well.

2553
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,000
The Vita was great in that regard for the compatibility.

2554
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:44,000
And then, of course, as you say, the PS1 games and being able to experience all that all over again.

2555
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
That was great.

2556
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
And yeah, it was definitely a strong point for the Vita.

2557
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:52,000
And I think the reason why a lot of people are going, but why not PlayStation 4?

2558
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,000
But, you know, that's that's a whole nother dialogue.

2559
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:05,000
And even then, it had the remote play on PlayStation 4 and you could actually use it as a controller, as you mentioned earlier in the show.

2560
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
So it really was a really great system.

2561
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Don't know why Sony didn't like focus or marketed that like really well, because I remember them mentioned it, but it was like, oh, it can do this and nothing more.

2562
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:28,000
They really needed to market the Vita more because it was a really, really great console.

2563
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Agreed.

2564
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:39,000
And I wonder if in five years we won't get an interesting post-mortem on the Vita and maybe get some insider info as to what really happened on the insider.

2565
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I don't know. Maybe it'll forever be a secret because, you know, this is a very large company with very strong contracts and things of that sort.

2566
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
So we may never really, truly know the answer.

2567
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:54,000
But these things have a way of coming out as people move on to other jobs and get asked about them in interviews and so forth.

2568
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,000
You know, we're getting all the dirt on the Atari and television days now.

2569
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Those guys go to the different conferences and, you know, some of them are very open about the drug use that was around back then and things that you didn't hear about in the 80s.

2570
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
So it'll be interesting to see, like, what really happened with the Vita.

2571
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Maybe we'll find out in a few years.

2572
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Maybe it'll be 30 years. Who knows?

2573
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Yeah, those articles were really, really interesting.

2574
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:30,000
But even though the Vita was a really great system and it did a lot of things right, it did things wrong and really, really wrong.

2575
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:37,000
And one of them was the memory storage because that was, like, awful.

2576
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:46,000
I don't know why Sony tried again to do a proprietary storage system or capacity.

2577
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:51,000
And especially because it was, like, really, really expensive.

2578
02:34:51,000 --> 02:35:05,000
64 gigabytes was $100 and you had to import it from Japan because the most you could find on the US or in America was only 32 gigabytes and it wasn't enough.

2579
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Yeah, and I think, you know, that was similar to a point that came up earlier is that Sony's insistence to kind of keep things, everything in the Sony bubble of all these things that Sony produces.

2580
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I don't know if that really did them favors in the long run.

2581
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
I think it might have hurt them and I think the storage is an excellent issue.

2582
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
I think the storage really highlights that.

2583
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:30,000
A lot of people kind of said that was kind of BS and it may have had better luck if it would have adopted, excuse me, a more lenient standard.

2584
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
It was very overpriced.

2585
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:38,000
We just had a little thing on the scroll bar that, you know, on the Twitch stream, the little headlines from various sites around the internet that scroll by.

2586
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I just caught one a little while ago.

2587
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,000
It said something about 128 gigabyte card or something for, like, 20 bucks.

2588
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Like, that's, you know, for something you can use on Switch.

2589
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:51,000
So, I mean, there's, that memory's coming down cheap in price, but those...

2590
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Not the Vita cards.

2591
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
The Vita cards never budged, ever.

2592
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
And they won't get any cheaper because of this.

2593
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
They will probably get way more expensive.

2594
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Like, wow, it's gonna be, like, really crazy.

2595
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:14,000
But another thing that I was really bothered by the Vita, it was the fact that you can only have, like, one account per memory card.

2596
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:24,000
So, yeah, that's another thing that really, really bothered me because, at least in my experience, I have Taiko no Tatsujin for the Vita.

2597
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:30,000
And you can only get the DLC if you have a Japan account.

2598
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:36,000
So, obviously, my main account is for Mexico, and I had to actually, like...

2599
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
It's a really, really long process.

2600
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:43,000
You have to delete your profile on the Vita.

2601
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:48,000
You have to remove the memory card and then do the setup again.

2602
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Again, it's a really long process just to make a profile change.

2603
02:36:53,000 --> 02:37:00,000
And instead of, like, having multiple accounts, since it's, like, yeah, it's gonna be a personal console.

2604
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:08,000
It's affordable, but still, it's not like you cannot have multiple accounts on a system like that.

2605
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
It was really baffling.

2606
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Yeah.

2607
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:16,000
And I wonder if that's similar to the whole fact that, like, you weren't able to change your name on PlayStation Network for the longest time.

2608
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
And even still, I don't think... That still is not rolled out, has it? The name change thing.

2609
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,000
No.

2610
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,000
No, we're still waiting. We know it's going to happen now at this point. It's just a matter of when.

2611
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:28,000
So, it just seems like maybe some archaic things held it back.

2612
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Trying to wrap things up on a positive note here, Act F, what was your favorite Vita game and why?

2613
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
What was my favorite Vita game?

2614
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I really cannot say of at least one game. There were so many. There was the Sly Cooper collection.

2615
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,000
There was Taekunotatsujin. There were the Project D.Va games.

2616
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:53,000
There were other games like Tearaway, Gravity Rush.

2617
02:37:53,000 --> 02:38:02,000
It really had so many great games, and that's the thing that really bothers me with how the Vita was handled, at least in America.

2618
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Because it really had a lot of potential, and Sony just killed it. Sony themselves could kill the Vita.

2619
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:15,000
At least some of those must-have games did kind of get a second life somewhere else.

2620
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Like, things like Gravity Rush did end up on PlayStation 4 eventually, so at least we got that.

2621
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:29,000
But, hey, I get it. You're right. It's one of those things where if only Sony had maybe put a little more effort into, and money,

2622
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:35,000
into trying to get the message across about what all the Vita could do, maybe it would have had better luck.

2623
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:38,000
But we'll never know now because it's dead and gone.

2624
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Maybe it can have a second chance like the Dreamcast had back in the day. Maybe.

2625
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Maybe. Why not? The Dreamcast was ahead of its time. Heck, I've been playing Phantasy Star online probably more than any other game this week.

2626
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I'm still hoping for a Dreamcast Classic Mini at some point.

2627
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Yeah, you never know.

2628
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
I'll jump in on that.

2629
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Anything's possible. Alright, ActDeaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up. Thanks so much for the call, as always.

2630
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2631
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Thanks. Take care. Alright, that was it for the callers we had on Discord.

2632
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:13,000
I will see if we have any quick questions in chat. Most people reacting to the Vita, talking a little bit about that.

2633
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
But quickly, do we have any last-minute stories we want to get to?

2634
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,000
No.

2635
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,000
No? Nothing?

2636
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Nothing.

2637
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Alright. Anything you're gonna try to get done with gaming this week, or your programming stuff?

2638
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:25,000
I'm just working on stuff. That's all.

2639
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Alright.

2640
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I don't know what's gonna come out of it, but I know last week was really busy, and this week's probably still gonna be busy.

2641
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:39,000
I always feel guilty for not playing games, but at the same time, if I'm playing games and I'm not programming,

2642
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:44,000
and if I'm not programming, then I'm not putting out a game, and then people are still gonna complain that I don't have a game done yet.

2643
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,000
So, you can't win either way.

2644
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:54,000
So, for my week this upcoming week, and if you have any questions, get them out in chat before I wrap up here.

2645
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:58,000
For my week this week, I am going to Las Vegas for a few days this week, actually.

2646
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Not with Alan Gasp, but one of my gal pals, Melody, is taking me.

2647
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:10,000
She bought me tickets to see Gwen Stefani at the residency there for my birthday, which was back in June,

2648
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
but obviously they announced those residencies way in advance.

2649
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:17,000
So, I will be in Vegas for a few days, and I'm hoping maybe to check out a few arcades,

2650
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:22,000
and finally, I keep meaning to go by there every time I'm in Vegas, but I know Melody's into this stuff, too,

2651
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:26,000
so we might finally get over and check out that pinball museum that they have there.

2652
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Yes, I saw the pinball museum in Jack Black's Jablinski Games video.

2653
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,000
He went there in Vegas and it looked pretty cool, so they've got some cool stuff there.

2654
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:37,000
But, yeah.

2655
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Shehulk is asking, has Loki seen FP2, Beats of Rage?

2656
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I have not yet.

2657
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,000
I haven't either.

2658
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I haven't seen FP1, to be honest.

2659
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I have the disc for it somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.

2660
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
But I should watch the second one, too.

2661
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Alright.

2662
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,000
I think it's on Netflix, or one of them was on Netflix at one time.

2663
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
The first one, I think.

2664
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
But, yeah. I just haven't gotten around to it.

2665
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
The other thing I'm really excited for in Vegas?

2666
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
The food.

2667
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Because, you know, Vegas has some good restaurants.

2668
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:11,000
So, guess where we have a reservation over the weekend?

2669
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:14,000
We're going to go to the Hell's Kitchen restaurant.

2670
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Because they built, like, a mock, like, the TV show.

2671
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Oh, that's cool.

2672
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
They built, like, an actual restaurant at Caesar's Palace,

2673
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
and you have to get reservations a few weeks out and all that stuff,

2674
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
so we're actually going there.

2675
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
But do they, you know, do, like, show stuff there?

2676
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
No, it's not like the actual TV show,

2677
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
but my understanding is they do have a kitchen with a blue team and a red team.

2678
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Risotto's on the menu.

2679
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,000
But is it cooked, like, shitty?

2680
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Hopefully not.

2681
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:38,000
I don't know if they put on a show where you watch the chefs get screamed at or whatever,

2682
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
but I'm really excited to try that.

2683
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Because I saw the building when I was there in November,

2684
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
because I went to Final Fantasy Fan Fest, and I saw the building,

2685
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:48,000
and it's got the big flaming thing, you know, everything that you see on the TV show.

2686
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Oh, that's awesome.

2687
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Because I think it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant,

2688
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
because he has several of those places in Vegas.

2689
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
And so that's, you know, no different.

2690
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:58,000
So I think that'll be a lot of fun.

2691
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I'm excited. I love the food.

2692
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Pixel Pacas in chat says you've got to hit a buffet.

2693
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Well, that would be something I wouldn't mind doing.

2694
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,000
We'll see how that goes.

2695
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
That all just depends.

2696
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:13,000
So anyway, Loki, you need to entertain the listeners for a bit

2697
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
while I figure out what's going on here.

2698
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Yes. So, yeah, this week I'm probably just going to be programming.

2699
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Remember, I'm going to try to program, maybe.

2700
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:25,000
I've been trying to find out, like, I started one project,

2701
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,000
which I guess I could talk about it a little bit.

2702
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:33,000
So I started a project which I'm probably not going to end up working on anymore,

2703
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:37,000
but it was originally like a terminal emulator type thing,

2704
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
but, I mean, it looked like a terminal,

2705
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:43,000
but it was going to be kind of like a text adventure game type of thing

2706
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:47,000
that was mocked up like a VoG network bulletin board system,

2707
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:51,000
but I ended up not doing that because it was,

2708
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:54,000
what I was using was limited to what I could do,

2709
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
and I wanted to get it done quickly,

2710
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,000
and this is not something that would be done quickly,

2711
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:04,000
and I, like everything else I do, overscope the crap out of it.

2712
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:07,000
So I decided that I am just not going to do that,

2713
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:08,000
not going to work on it,

2714
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
not going to work on something that I can get done quicker,

2715
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,000
although the project I'm working on now is not really going to get done any quicker either.

2716
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:19,000
It's going to take even longer, but it's more entertaining, I should say.

2717
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:23,000
So I decided to go that route instead, but who knows where I'll end up.

2718
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:27,000
I'll probably start several different projects and not finish anything as usual.

2719
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Okay, wow, a lot just happened there.

2720
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:33,000
So that was, somebody was at our door, right?

2721
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
So I had to go, like, nobody ever rings the door on a Sunday night.

2722
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:39,000
It was Uber Eats, and they did have this address,

2723
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
so if you wanted Burger King, I guess I could have grabbed it,

2724
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
because somebody went to the, here's the scary part,

2725
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
because I had the door open for it, Mr. Smoosh ran outside.

2726
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:48,000
So that's the first time that's happened.

2727
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
So yeah, very scary.

2728
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
He started to go in the little plant over here, I'm like, no, no, no, no,

2729
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:55,000
and I was able to pick him up in time, thankfully, but that's scary.

2730
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
So he went on an adventure today.

2731
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Anyway, hopefully she's able to call and get the right address,

2732
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:06,000
because I was like, can't you call whoever put it in and get the right place?

2733
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
I guess I could have just taken the food, huh?

2734
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
No.

2735
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
But that's not nice, that's not the right thing to do.

2736
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Yeah, yikes, very true.

2737
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Smoosh saves, stay inside Smoosh, luckily Alan was behind me and heard it happening,

2738
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
and I was like, oh shit.

2739
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
So anyway, that was scary.

2740
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Anyway, I guess we will wrap up then.

2741
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Now that I've had a heart attack, we can wrap up the show.

2742
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
All right, so as we say at the end of every show,

2743
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,000
thank you guys so much for downloading our show, checking out the show.

2744
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,000
We appreciate you guys being here every week.

2745
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:39,000
All we ask, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word,

2746
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2747
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:45,000
but we can only put those voices out there if they're here.

2748
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
So thank you guys so much for all the kind tweets.

2749
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:50,000
I will say here on Twitch TV, putting us on your hosting list,

2750
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,000
your auto-host list, that helps tremendously as well.

2751
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
We would really appreciate those,

2752
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:58,000
and of course we always appreciate all the bits and subscribers.

2753
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:02,000
I'll read some of those after the show is all done tonight here at VOG Network,

2754
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,000
so stay tuned after the credits live on Twitch.

2755
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Otherwise, I think we can wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.

2756
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2757
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:14,000
My final thought, like I mentioned, I'll try to work on programming

2758
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
and maybe play a game.

2759
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Me stream, I may do some streaming too if I ever get some time.

2760
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Yeah, my final thought is if I am able to do it before I leave for Vegas,

2761
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
I want to freaking do a stream of Super Mario Brothers U already on Switch,

2762
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,000
which I keep saving to stream.

2763
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:32,000
I haven't opened the damn thing in like two or three weeks,

2764
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
because I keep meaning to stream it,

2765
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
but I keep getting pulled into Phantasy Star online.

2766
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
But can I really complain?

2767
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Because playing video games like it's 2000 all over again

2768
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:43,000
is still an awful lot of fun.

2769
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
So, I think that is going to do it for now.

2770
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Oh!

2771
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Oh, no.

2772
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Everything's broken tonight.

2773
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
I'm going to wrap up the show.

2774
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
We're done. We're out of here before something else breaks.

2775
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Have a safe week, everybody.

2776
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
We'll see you here next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2777
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Good night.

2778
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:01,000
