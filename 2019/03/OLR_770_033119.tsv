7000	15000	We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
15000	27000	Tonight, the week of PAX East brought us new game reveals and new ways of revealing game news, but it seems one way of purchasing those games may be seeing big changes. All this tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	45000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 770 for this, March the 31st of 2019.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
50000	51000	Oh, hi.
51000	52000	Hi, how are you doing?
52000	53000	Here's my foot.
53000	54000	Alright, there's your foot.
54000	56000	I'm actually fairly accomplished.
56000	57000	Good.
57000	59000	I've had a week that good things have happened in.
59000	60000	That's good.
60000	63000	Well, I've been open with, you know, my surgery.
63000	64000	Uh-huh.
64000	66000	I fit into a size two this week.
66000	67000	Congrats.
67000	71000	I'm like, I've never been a size two. Maybe when I was six.
71000	72000	Yeah.
72000	73000	So.
73000	74000	Well, good job.
74000	76000	And I also made dandelion cookies.
76000	82000	You did. I've been eating them. They're pretty, they don't really taste like a lot like, maybe it's like a hint. It's like that, it's like just the.
82000	83000	It's meant to be subtle.
83000	87000	Yeah, it's a very subtle, subtle. So it doesn't taste like you're like actually eating flowers.
87000	89000	But they're edible the same way that rose petals are.
89000	90000	Yeah.
90000	91000	So there you go.
91000	92000	And good for you. Lots of beta carotene.
92000	94000	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
94000	97000	She's just, she's just, you know, playing a prank on us.
97000	99000	It's really their spider legs.
99000	102000	But you know, I'm just going to eat them.
102000	105000	Then they have protein.
105000	107000	Actually, I'm most impressed.
107000	109000	Loki doesn't usually eat food from strangers.
109000	111000	I'm not a stranger.
111000	113000	But still, even us, he doesn't.
113000	115000	I am strange.
115000	116000	He doesn't.
116000	118000	He doesn't normally eat baked goods of that nature.
118000	119000	Yeah, no, he.
119000	120000	But thank you for eating my cookie.
120000	122000	He eats what he brings and that's that.
122000	124000	What did you bring today?
124000	126000	A sandwich from, really.
126000	127000	Sandwich is good.
127000	129000	Because it took them forever to make the sandwich.
129000	131000	They have to tell me the story about how they ran out of all the other bread types.
131000	133000	I'm like, I don't fucking care.
133000	135000	Just make my sandwich faster.
135000	138000	Hold on, I have to wrap it four or five times.
138000	140000	It's like, we're just going to open it anyways.
140000	144000	Look for a recipe online and they talk about their family history.
144000	146000	And all of the things that go into it.
146000	148000	And they're like, I want the fucking recipe.
148000	150000	You want the sandwich, I want the recipe.
150000	153000	I would say this is one of those socially acceptable times where you are able to say,
153000	155000	get over there and make me a sandwich.
155000	157000	Because you are in a sandwich shop.
157000	160000	So, it's a little more socially acceptable to be able to do that.
160000	165000	Well, I did the new modern way of shopping today.
165000	168000	I ordered everything online and just went and picked it up.
168000	170000	How convenient.
170000	172000	It's for grocery shopping.
172000	176000	I don't know if I would want to replace all my shopping with that method.
176000	178000	My neighbors have theirs delivered.
178000	180000	I do buy a lot of stuff online.
180000	182000	Well, it's just we buy the same things every week.
182000	185000	What are we going to do with all this commercially zoned space?
185000	188000	We've all stopped going to stores and things.
188000	190000	I don't know. Okay.
190000	192000	And this does tie into games.
192000	196000	Because we are a show that talks about video games, gaming news, gaming culture, and so forth.
196000	199000	And we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,
199000	201000	9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network,
201000	204000	voguesnetwork.com, which is also available on Twitch,
204000	207000	twitch.tv slash voguesnetwork.
207000	211000	And I do apologize because I can see as we are streaming tonight,
211000	214000	we're losing a lot of frames as we upload.
214000	218000	We haven't, there's nothing unusual going on in the studio.
218000	220000	We just unfortunately have some type of bad internet connection.
220000	225000	So, as we would usually do when we were recording this as an audio only podcast,
225000	228000	we're going to push through for the sake of the actual podcast
228000	230000	and just hope it kind of comes back.
230000	232000	Because it looks like the internet is doing one of those things
232000	234000	where it's kind of coming and going.
234000	238000	But unfortunately, like, yes, we've shut off all our background downloads.
238000	240000	None of the other computers are on.
240000	242000	It just, it is what it is. So.
242000	245000	No, we're just doing the robot during the show. That's fine.
245000	249000	Right. Yeah. So, unfortunately, guys, there's not a lot I can do about that,
249000	252000	which really stinks because we are trying to attract some more viewers
252000	254000	and get more people here to join us on Twitch.
254000	257000	So, it kind of sucks when things that are out of your control
257000	260000	are preventing that from happening, but what can you do?
260000	266000	So, anyway, let's, let's, what else was I going to, gosh, I got off track.
266000	269000	I was, oh, speaking of games, okay, so this has to do with the delivery
269000	271000	and all that stuff. So, and this never happens,
271000	274000	but Alan and I last night were like, let's go to Walmart.
274000	278000	And I never go to Walmart, okay, specifically that store.
278000	281000	I usually go to Target. But for some reason, it was like,
281000	283000	oh, we haven't been there in a long time.
283000	288000	And I was like, I wonder if they've released any new of those mini arcade games
288000	293000	because they have that mini collectible series that is over there.
293000	296000	Let me actually, I'm going to stand up and grab one of these.
296000	299000	So, they have these mini collectibles. And yes, this one is new
299000	302000	that I picked up yesterday. So, this is this arcade classics collection.
302000	307000	I've only seen these at Walmart. I've seen a similar type at Target,
307000	311000	but I haven't seen the specific same arcade classics library.
311000	314000	I might be stopping by then. Is it the LCD screen or the?
314000	316000	It is. It's the nicer screen. You can play with that if you want.
316000	320000	I'll just go buy one. This is Ms. Pac-Man, is the one for the podcast folks that can't see it.
320000	325000	I picked up a Ms. Pac-Man machine because I thought they might have a new one I didn't have yet.
325000	328000	And I was right, they have Ms. Pac-Man. And then I also picked up Dig Dug.
328000	332000	And what's interesting about Dig Dug. But you already have Dig Dug.
332000	335000	I do have Dig Dug in the Target collection.
335000	341000	So, Target has the my arcade and Walmart has the arcade classics
341000	346000	and Dig Dug thus far is the only game that I know of that exists in both.
346000	348000	So, now I have two.
348000	350000	Which is better?
350000	354000	I haven't extensively played the arcade classic ones yet.
354000	357000	So, anyway, I told that whole story because my point was
357000	361000	that's probably not something we would have done if we hadn't like thought
361000	366000	oh, let's actually go to Walmart, let's go in there and actually go shopping and all that good stuff.
366000	369000	So, there is still benefits going on in person.
369000	372000	And then of course not only was it that, but it was like
372000	376000	oh, they have the potato chips and all the different flavors
376000	378000	like the hot pickle that we couldn't find anywhere else.
378000	381000	That's where I found the beer cheese flavor.
381000	384000	Yeah, I didn't realize that like Walmart is the place to go for the
384000	389000	and I'm not endorsing him, but appears to be the place to go to find all that flavor filled stuff.
389000	393000	Because the banana frosted flakes I can't find anywhere else now was there.
393000	398000	So, Dan says that by the way the Ms. Pac-Man and the Dig Dug and the Fix-It Felix are not new.
398000	400000	Oh, interesting.
400000	401000	They're new to me.
401000	402000	Oh, they're new to me.
402000	404000	Well, I'm just saying that apparently
404000	407000	I think it was the Ms. Pac-Man one I couldn't find for you.
407000	409000	Yeah, because they're all numbered.
409000	414000	And so Fix-It Felix, which Jamie got for me when she was at, is number 12.
414000	417000	So, I knew there was one missing. I knew there was an 11 that I was missing.
417000	421000	Yes, and I think that Dan had found, maybe Dan found that one and I didn't see it.
421000	423000	But yeah, I had remembered.
423000	426000	And I checked with Dan because I was like, do we have those?
426000	428000	Because I have no idea what the crap we own anymore.
428000	431000	And then Dig Dug was number 13.
431000	432000	Yeah.
432000	434000	So, we need more.
434000	435000	Yeah, I know.
435000	437000	Look, it's like filling up that top shelf.
437000	441000	I have to clean off another shelf space so I have room to put all these mini arcade games.
441000	446000	And at some point I'll have to do a YouTube or something to show off these different little collectibles.
446000	448000	Because they are really cute.
448000	453000	For the folks on the podcast that don't have the benefit of the visual, they're really tiny little machines.
453000	456000	They're like the size of, I don't know, like half a shoebox.
456000	458000	I think a She-Ra doll could play them.
458000	462000	Probably. Actually, yes, you could probably pose like your Barbie dolls and your G.I. Joe dolls in front of them.
462000	463000	Or a couple transformers.
463000	465000	And it would look legit. Yeah, so they're fun.
465000	467000	Anyway, let's get into some news.
467000	469000	There's a lot of gaming news that has happened this past week.
469000	471000	We have a lot of ground to cover tonight.
471000	476000	So I'm going to throw it right over to Loki, if you are willing to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.
476000	478000	No!
478000	486000	Yeah, so this is not a big surprise to me because I always looked at, when they had these available in stores,
486000	497000	like, why would I buy this versus, you know, buying the physical copy or buying it digitally on sale through the store.
497000	502000	I just didn't understand the purpose of having these cards to buy digital versions of the games.
502000	511000	Now, granted, Sony is now removing these from stores, but there are still other companies that have digital codes there.
511000	518000	For example, Nintendo has a lot of these different indie games that are available that you can purchase by digital code.
519000	528000	But you think about it though, usually if you're purchasing digital, you're not going to the store because it's more convenient that way.
528000	536000	Or you're buying it on sale, which this card is never going to be on sale because it's a digital copy.
536000	541000	And it's specifically a certain amount that the vendor paid for that.
541000	543000	They're not normally going to discount those.
544000	547000	Once in a great while, but it's usually a large region.
547000	550000	It's very rare that that happens.
550000	557000	Funny enough, sorry, just quickly, on the Walmart topic, since it is newsworthy, I set foot willingly in one.
557000	560000	And I was like, wow, all these things are different than what I remember.
560000	566000	One of them was, the section for these cards and games on cards is huge.
566000	570000	Like half what I remember used to be the glass cases and all that.
571000	574000	I would say a third of that. A third of that is now games on cards.
574000	583000	And I was kind of like you. I'm like, who's buying games on cards when it's very easy to go on the shop and buy them?
583000	585000	But gifts was the thing that came to mind.
585000	587000	You have a lot of people on stuff.
587000	595000	Well, I guess if you wanted to just buy a card and send it through the mail or something like that to somebody and you wanted to buy them a gift.
595000	599000	Because you can't really gift digital purchases, I think, on many of the store friends.
600000	606000	That's something you could do, but at the same time, just buy them a points card and have them pick out whatever they want.
606000	607000	Grandma's not going to know that.
607000	611000	And I can kind of see, especially like Minecraft, okay?
611000	612000	Minecraft is a card.
612000	620000	Grandma's not going to know, but Grandma's going to know, oh, Minecraft is the thing that kids are into, so I'm going to pick this up.
620000	622000	I think you're not giving enough grandmothers credit.
622000	626000	Grandmothers now are seriously, like, some of them are our age.
626000	629000	True. I'm not talking about Grandma Skyrim.
629000	633000	But, you know, I'm talking, you would be surprised.
633000	635000	You know what? Obviously.
635000	637000	Like, maybe the great grandmothers won't get it.
637000	639000	Okay. Not all grandmas.
639000	643000	But you know what I'm getting at, right? I'm talking about that crowd.
643000	646000	Maybe what we think of as our grandparents never really understood.
646000	653000	Now, that's not necessarily true because I had to set up an Alexa for, or an Echo for my father-in-law.
653000	656000	So not everybody's going to understand what these cards are.
657000	660000	So, I just didn't understand why they're there.
660000	667000	Bobby's yapping in our chat, although I enjoy it here, over at, of course, twitch.tv slash vog network.
667000	669000	But he's bringing up some points that are worth reading here.
669000	673000	So Bobby Black Wilson in our chat saying, they're great for gifting digital games.
673000	677000	I've bought people digital codes of games rather than just sending them $60.
677000	679000	Also, you can't get a $60 point card.
679000	682000	You can get a $50 card and a $20 card.
682000	688000	So it sounds like a little bit like those dollar amounts might be kind of like, I don't know, the hot dogs versus the hot dog buns.
688000	689000	They're uneven.
689000	692000	You get a $50 card that doesn't really cover the cost of the game.
692000	698000	Also, you know that you're, you know that little Jimmy, going back to my grandma example,
698000	702000	you know that little Jimmy's not going to take your $50 gift card and spend it on porn.
704000	709000	Because you may not understand that porn isn't available, but you know what I'm getting at, right?
709000	713000	You want a little more control over what exactly that kid is getting.
713000	721000	Now, Bobby's also bringing up the story that I know he's talked about on his show about mother-in-law kind of messed up trying to do the digital games
721000	726000	because she created a PSN account to buy me some PS4 games and then learned he couldn't play them
726000	729000	because she just didn't understand how the system worked.
729000	733000	But she knew, oh, if I go to the PlayStation store, this is the cheapest place to get them.
733000	735000	So she did, but now they're on her account.
735000	741000	So it's, and it's, he's been writing all these tweets, like they will not refund the money.
741000	743000	They're being sticklers about it.
743000	747000	Can't you just sign in under her account and then like download them and then?
747000	750000	I don't think, because he got it.
750000	752000	He used to share accounts like that.
752000	756000	Well, keep in mind, Bobby's house, there's multiple PlayStations and things going on,
756000	761000	and he's married and the wife is a gamer, so they probably have separate accounts.
761000	763000	I'm not going to overanalyze the situation.
763000	766000	He said it wouldn't work the way it was, I believe it.
766000	768000	Okie doke.
768000	771000	But anyway, back to the point of these cards.
771000	776000	So anyways, April 1st is going to be where they're going to stop selling these cards.
776000	777000	No, that's not really a joke.
777000	784000	It's basically, you know, they're not going to be offered through SIE's Global Digital Retail Program.
784000	789000	The decision was made in order to align key businesses globally
789000	792000	to support full games and premium editions.
792000	796000	SIE will continue or introduce increased denominations
796000	799000	that select retailers, DLC and add-ons, virtual currency.
799000	801000	Season passes will still be available.
801000	802000	So there you go.
802000	805000	So now your complaint was that they didn't have those large amounts for the cards.
805000	809000	Now they're going to offer those instead of just specific games.
809000	811000	And that makes sense, because if you think about it,
811000	815000	I offer like a download for a specific indie title.
815000	818000	Maybe that title's not popular anymore.
818000	820000	And now it's just, you can't sell it.
820000	826000	Whereas if it's a, say, $60 card or something like that, then you can buy it.
827000	831000	What about, like, the fact that it seems with this,
831000	834000	Sony might be trying to bring this in-house
834000	838000	and force digital transactions to go through their own store?
838000	840000	Well, it doesn't sound like that that's the case.
840000	843000	I think it's more of an issue that it's just that they're going to,
843000	845000	that maybe these didn't sell that well.
845000	848000	Instead, they're going to address the need in different ways
848000	853000	so that you can buy those points and then purchase them through this,
853000	855000	you know, purchase your games through the store once you have those points.
855000	857000	So there's more flexibility there.
857000	860000	I think that it makes sense, because think about it.
860000	863000	Instead of printing several different types of cards,
863000	865000	you can just print the one card,
865000	869000	and then you can use it for multiple things versus just having all this.
869000	870000	It reduces shelf space.
870000	874000	It reduces the need, the extra cost of manufacturing that stuff.
874000	879000	And it's giving the consumer what they truly want out of that.
879000	881000	Instead of buying three $20 cards,
881000	884000	you just have one for a full retail price of a game.
884000	887000	So it sounds like they're still going to be doing, like, you know,
887000	891000	DLC and add-ons, different currencies and stuff like that, season passes.
891000	894000	That's another thing you see quite a bit of.
895000	899000	So the trending page, if you go to Recruitment on Monolith Sauce website,
899000	902000	you see this Zelda-filled page.
902000	904000	But here's the thing, I think a lot of people,
904000	908000	there's a lot of, like, big jumps to conclusions people are making here.
908000	912000	For one, on the internet?
912000	916000	Anyway, for one, of course they're making a fucking Zelda game.
916000	918000	Of course they're going to make another Zelda.
918000	919000	Of course another Zelda.
919000	922000	I mean, would Nintendo just decide, you know what, we're done.
922000	925000	Well, they are making several Zelda games.
925000	927000	It's not like we're talking about F-Zero here.
927000	931000	I know, it's like, Zelda, you get three games, F-Zero.
931000	933000	Zelda, you get more games.
933000	935000	F-Zero never happens.
935000	937000	Metroid, you get some more games too.
937000	939000	F-Zero, you get Falcon Punch.
939000	941000	F-Zero, we're going to, you know what,
941000	945000	there's these indie guys that are doing this Super HD Racing game.
945000	947000	I can't remember the name of it in the moment.
947000	950000	What's the big game on Switch that they...
950000	953000	Fast Neo, Neo Racing, that one.
953000	955000	And no shade towards that game because it's great,
955000	958000	but clearly Nintendo's like, oh, we got that, we don't need F-Zero.
958000	960000	It's all about the Mario Kart now.
960000	962000	But anyway.
962000	964000	Mario, you're going to get more games.
964000	966000	Yoshi, you're going to get a ton of games.
966000	968000	And, uh...
968000	970000	Excite Truck.
970000	972000	Anyways.
972000	975000	We hate racing games is what they need to basically say.
975000	977000	You know what, they just need to make a Zelda racing game.
977000	979000	Are you Mario Kart? No. Sorry.
979000	981000	Anyway.
981000	983000	But here's the other thing.
983000	985000	I think some of y'all forgot.
985000	987000	Like, oh my gosh.
987000	989000	Is the next Zelda going to be like Xenoblade?
989000	991000	Is that what's happening?
991000	993000	Because, like, Monolith's doing... Well, hold on.
993000	997000	Monolith's hiring for positions that are related to the Zelda project.
997000	999000	Y'all might have forgot.
999000	1001000	Monolith helped on Breath of the Wild.
1001000	1003000	OK?
1003000	1005000	I'm like, dear people on the internet, calm by tits.
1005000	1007000	Calm it.
1007000	1009000	I mean, maybe they are doing a little more.
1009000	1012000	It's not like Nintendo is unheard of to seek out third party support.
1012000	1014000	For example, what, Namco fucking
1014000	1016000	lended a hand on Smash Brothers, right?
1016000	1018000	Am I crazy on that?
1018000	1020000	I don't think you're crazy.
1020000	1022000	So anyway.
1022000	1024000	You know what else they lended their hand on?
1024000	1026000	F-Zero!
1026000	1028000	Where's my F-Zero, Namco?
1028000	1030000	Of course, they don't make racing games either.
1030000	1032000	So, you know, I guess.
1032000	1034000	Monolith did the maps, I believe.
1034000	1036000	The landscape, the environment, I think
1036000	1038000	was a big thing that Monolith did.
1038000	1040000	And based on how most of y'all felt
1040000	1042000	about Breath of the Wild, myself included,
1042000	1044000	I think we would like Monolith to keep doing that.
1044000	1046000	They did a pretty fucking good job.
1046000	1048000	Yeah, Monolith.
1048000	1050000	Was it them or Nintendo that came up with
1050000	1052000	the weapon durability?
1052000	1054000	The weapon durability is not
1054000	1056000	a bad mechanic, OK?
1056000	1058000	It was a little much.
1058000	1060000	I just wish there was a way you could
1060000	1062000	tone it down. So maybe things break
1062000	1064000	a little less often.
1064000	1066000	That's why you have to hurry up and get the fucking mouse.
1066000	1068000	I want it to tone down to zero.
1068000	1070000	I don't want it in there.
1070000	1072000	It would be nice if maybe there's a mode
1072000	1074000	where you can just turn off the...
1074000	1076000	Hardcore mode. Call it hardcore.
1076000	1078000	Oh no, I'm thinking the opposite.
1078000	1080000	Master mode. I want Bobby Black Wolf
1080000	1082000	BFF mode where nothing breaks.
1082000	1084000	And you already know all the recipes
1084000	1086000	and all that stuff. You just go out there
1086000	1088000	and eventually... You know what? You don't have to know the recipes
1088000	1090000	as long as you know the combination.
1090000	1092000	That's true. I have an internet.
1092000	1094000	Dan got me a cookbook.
1094000	1096000	The Breath of the Wild cookbook.
1096000	1098000	It's not a legit cookbook. It's just
1098000	1100000	the in-game cookbook.
1100000	1102000	Miltonius Games in chat says,
1102000	1104000	weapon durability stressed me out.
1104000	1106000	Same. My heart rate definitely went out
1106000	1108000	playing Zelda.
1108000	1110000	I like some of the mechanics with the weapon durability.
1110000	1112000	I loved Breath of the Wild.
1112000	1114000	If I could change one thing,
1114000	1116000	that was the one thing where I'm like, OK.
1116000	1118000	If you got a shitty little sword,
1118000	1120000	you could use it as a projectile.
1120000	1122000	Or having
1122000	1124000	the wooden weapons if it was...
1124000	1126000	I thought it was a neat addition.
1126000	1128000	I did, but that was better.
1128000	1130000	But you know what should not be changed ever?
1130000	1132000	The fairies were fantastic.
1132000	1134000	And the horse fairy.
1134000	1136000	What were they called? The little mariachi things
1136000	1138000	that would increase your health and stamina?
1138000	1140000	Oh, the yaha!
1140000	1142000	The ones that you had to steal their poops.
1142000	1144000	Can you do that noise again?
1144000	1146000	Yaha!
1146000	1148000	I actually have that as
1148000	1150000	a sound tone on my phone.
1150000	1152000	Corox.
1152000	1154000	That's it. That's it.
1154000	1156000	And you had to collect their poop.
1156000	1158000	The seeds.
1158000	1160000	Their poops.
1160000	1162000	And you get a giant turd out of it.
1162000	1164000	I'm sure not going to be poop
1164000	1166000	is another Zelda game, especially if Monolith
1166000	1168000	is fulfilling a very similar role.
1168000	1170000	Honestly, would anyone be disappointed
1170000	1172000	if they just did Breath of the Wild
1172000	1174000	like a very similar type
1174000	1176000	of game, but like a new map
1176000	1178000	and a couple new mechanics
1178000	1180000	but basically it's Breath of the Wild 2?
1180000	1182000	Would anyone really be disappointed
1182000	1184000	if Nintendo put out that game? Because I don't think I would be.
1184000	1186000	You know what I would want, even though they said
1186000	1188000	they're not going to do any more DLC for the game?
1188000	1190000	I would want the world rebuilding mode.
1190000	1192000	Like, almost sim-like.
1192000	1194000	You know? Or just different quests and stuff.
1194000	1196000	Because, I mean,
1196000	1198000	Zelda, poor Zelda,
1198000	1200000	is coming back 100 years later after
1200000	1202000	you know, basically making Ganon her bitch.
1202000	1204000	And then it's like,
1204000	1206000	my house sucks. It's torn up.
1206000	1208000	I don't know anybody in this world.
1208000	1210000	We need to rebuild my kingdom here.
1210000	1212000	No, no, no.
1212000	1214000	That's just Actraiser at that point, then.
1214000	1216000	Exactly!
1216000	1218000	I'm okay with that, TDH.
1218000	1220000	Let's see, VGRealness says
1220000	1222000	they are 100% going to use that engine again.
1222000	1224000	I agree.
1224000	1226000	That engine's amazing.
1226000	1228000	I'm hearing it'll be Breath of the Wild 2 if not that exact name.
1228000	1230000	No, it won't be the same name.
1230000	1232000	Why would they do that now?
1232000	1234000	They never do the same name.
1234000	1236000	But, I mean, if you look at Ocarina of Time
1236000	1238000	Majora's Mask, I mean,
1238000	1240000	was the engine really that different?
1240000	1242000	I mean, sure, you had the big moon.
1242000	1244000	They were the same engine, and it played
1244000	1246000	very similar. And that's kind of more what I'm talking about.
1246000	1248000	And Majora's Mask started off as a different game
1248000	1250000	using that engine.
1250000	1252000	Oh, right, right. I think I'd heard that too.
1252000	1254000	It's true. Anyway.
1254000	1256000	NinjaBunny in chat says,
1256000	1258000	I didn't like Breath of the Wild at all.
1258000	1260000	Ooh, she's different!
1260000	1262000	Descenting opinion?
1262000	1264000	Descenting opinion? No, I'm not
1264000	1266000	trying to give you crap. But there's always
1266000	1268000	one in the room, right? But that's okay.
1268000	1270000	You know what? Here's the thing.
1270000	1272000	Everybody's got that controversial
1272000	1274000	gaming opinion hot take.
1274000	1276000	And people are entitled to be wrong.
1276000	1278000	And mine is Zelda related too.
1278000	1280000	Mine is that Ocarina of Time
1280000	1282000	is not what you all make it out to be.
1282000	1284000	Is it a good game?
1284000	1286000	Yes. Is it the game
1286000	1288000	y'all hold it up as?
1288000	1290000	For a lot of people though, it was their big
1290000	1292000	thing. Like,
1292000	1294000	for me, and Dan will disagree,
1294000	1296000	but I think Link to the Past is the best.
1296000	1298000	I would play Link to the Past any day
1298000	1300000	of the week, but maybe that's a GenX
1300000	1302000	thing, I don't know. Or
1302000	1304000	gamers of a certain age.
1304000	1306000	Yeah, everyone. GenX exists.
1306000	1308000	Cater to us. Alright. Anyway.
1308000	1312000	NinjaBunny in chat says,
1312000	1314000	I'm a guy, Rob. Gender is merely a suggestion.
1314000	1316000	Come on, it's 2019.
1316000	1318000	Um, let's see. Are you that insecure
1318000	1320000	in your masculinity?
1320000	1322000	There's also a quote, but I don't expect
1322000	1324000	everybody to know the quote that I gave there.
1324000	1326000	I'm also being silly. Bobby Blackwolf in chat
1326000	1328000	says, popular opinion Super Metroid
1328000	1330000	is not all that. See, everybody's got that
1330000	1332000	one wrong-ass gaming opinion
1332000	1334000	that they express once in a while.
1334000	1336000	And those people should just not
1336000	1338000	express them. It's like with
1338000	1340000	the zit. You're not really supposed to
1340000	1342000	express them. Every gamer has a voice
1342000	1344000	starts off. I know, I'm being that bitch
1344000	1346000	tonight. Some of us have to scream a little louder.
1346000	1348000	Okay. Anyway. And some people
1348000	1350000	just need to scream.
1350000	1352000	In all seriousness, let's move on to another story that's also
1352000	1354000	retro latest stuff, right?
1354000	1356000	Doth it be my turn to speak?
1356000	1358000	Yes, I think so.
1358000	1360000	Well, once again
1360000	1362000	we have another attempt
1362000	1364000	at a little teeny Sega Genesis.
1364000	1366000	In this case,
1366000	1368000	it is going to be
1368000	1370000	the, um, basically
1370000	1372000	like a Genesis mini.
1372000	1374000	I guess that's what they're calling it, yeah.
1374000	1376000	So, um,
1376000	1378000	it's going to have, uh,
1378000	1380000	40 classic games installed. I hate
1380000	1382000	that they say fucking pre-installed
1382000	1384000	because you're just fucking installing it.
1384000	1386000	You're not, like, installing it before
1386000	1388000	you're installing it. But it's locked.
1388000	1390000	It's pre-installed because they're installed
1390000	1392000	before you get the console and you can't
1392000	1394000	install more on them. Allegedly.
1394000	1396000	Allegedly. Exactly. That's not gonna last
1396000	1398000	fucking long. Um, but the other
1398000	1400000	games that are included on there is, of course,
1400000	1402000	Sonic the Hedgehog, Echo the Dolphin, Toejam,
1402000	1404000	and Earl. Um, a few
1404000	1406000	ones on there is Castlevania
1406000	1408000	Bloodline, Space Harrier 2.
1408000	1410000	Sega's doing a retro collection
1410000	1412000	and Sonic is a part of it.
1412000	1414000	Can I finish reading my fucking article, Rob?
1414000	1416000	I guess.
1416000	1418000	Shining Force, Dr. Robotnik's Bean Bean Machine,
1418000	1420000	Comic Zone, Altered Beast, and Gunstar Heroes!
1420000	1422000	Awesome!
1422000	1424000	Um, the one hope
1424000	1426000	that I have for this is that it's actually
1426000	1428000	Sega behind it and
1428000	1430000	not outsourced, like the last
1430000	1432000	disastrous attempt.
1434000	1436000	Okay, because that's what I was actually gonna
1436000	1438000	bring up, was that, wait a minute, we've had
1438000	1440000	Genesis, well, they're not minis,
1440000	1442000	but you know what I mean, we've had Genesis available
1442000	1444000	at stores, Genesize,
1444000	1446000	Mega Drive,
1446000	1448000	we've had, hey,
1448000	1450000	Genesis, um,
1450000	1452000	but we've had the Genesis
1452000	1454000	stuff available at retail,
1454000	1456000	the retro stuff, for quite some time
1456000	1458000	now. I believe they have, like, a
1458000	1460000	TV type and they have an on-the-go
1460000	1462000	type. You can buy one now for
1462000	1464000	$25.
1464000	1466000	Those are probably all bargain basement right now because of
1466000	1468000	this other news, but,
1468000	1470000	so this is special because
1470000	1472000	Sega is
1472000	1474000	like, policing it,
1474000	1476000	basically. Sega better be the
1476000	1478000	one releasing it.
1478000	1480000	I mean, like, fully behind
1480000	1482000	all the programming, because we've had some just shit
1482000	1484000	emulation in the past. But, why is
1484000	1486000	the controller only have three buttons, and why
1486000	1488000	is it not the six button controller?
1488000	1490000	What?
1490000	1492000	They're wired.
1492000	1494000	If Street Fighter isn't on it, you don't need six buttons.
1496000	1498000	That's probably not true. There's other six button games
1498000	1500000	I'm not thinking of, but that's obviously the big
1500000	1502000	one. Uh, Dartetsuya in chat
1502000	1504000	says, as far as I know, it's in-house developed.
1504000	1506000	Hell, I heard that Yuzo Koshiro
1506000	1508000	is composing the menu music. Oh, shit,
1508000	1510000	if that's true, sign me
1510000	1512000	the fuck up. 70 of them. Right?
1512000	1514000	Fucking love Yuzo Koshiro.
1514000	1516000	I mean, he would give us our streets of rage.
1516000	1518000	Yeah, I mean,
1518000	1520000	there would definitely be a precedent for him to be involved,
1520000	1522000	but I did not hear that.
1522000	1524000	Anyway. But anything
1524000	1526000	that comes with it are, is the
1526000	1528000	console, two wired controllers,
1528000	1530000	um, a USB power adapter,
1530000	1532000	a power cable, and an HDMI cable.
1532000	1534000	So,
1534000	1536000	sweet.
1536000	1538000	Now, Akdeft in chat is pointing out, the
1538000	1540000	Mega Drive Mini in Japan is
1540000	1542000	getting the six button controller.
1542000	1544000	Well, then I'm gonna import mine instead.
1544000	1546000	Um, now, you know, though,
1546000	1548000	this actually goes kinda along
1548000	1550000	with this, is that a few weeks ago
1550000	1552000	there was a, um,
1552000	1554000	a survey
1554000	1556000	that was put out
1556000	1558000	about for, you know, what would you want to see
1558000	1560000	as far as merchandise and games.
1560000	1562000	And the ones that they were listing
1562000	1564000	on there were the Shining series
1564000	1566000	were Puyo Puyo,
1566000	1568000	you know, were a lot of those
1568000	1570000	games that we're seeing on here.
1570000	1572000	Gunstar Heroes, a lot of it.
1572000	1574000	You know, and so I wonder
1574000	1576000	if that survey might have been
1576000	1578000	related to this.
1578000	1580000	I took it, you know.
1580000	1582000	Maybe. Because I want all the Puyo Puyo.
1582000	1584000	And what's funny is that I love that
1584000	1586000	they listed it as Puyo Puyo.
1586000	1588000	And not as Puyo Pop or whatever the crap.
1588000	1590000	I wish the console port actually opened
1590000	1592000	up and I wish they had the expansion port on the bottom so we can get
1592000	1594000	Mini 32Xs and Mini
1594000	1596000	Sega CDs. That would be kinda rad.
1596000	1598000	The other thing about that survey is that they were
1598000	1600000	talking about originally Japanese only
1600000	1602000	franchises.
1602000	1604000	And Questbuster points out, I did that survey too,
1604000	1606000	they were talking about some old properties like Panzer Dragoon.
1606000	1608000	Well, but the thing is that when they were
1608000	1610000	putting the list of have you played these games
1610000	1612000	in the series, they were going
1612000	1614000	to Japanese only ones. Like, they
1614000	1616000	listed, like, I do want to say
1616000	1618000	that they listed the PC Engine
1618000	1620000	Puyo Puyo among them. Puyo Puyo
1620000	1622000	Sun, which never came out over here.
1622000	1624000	So it was fairly interesting.
1624000	1626000	I think they're finally recognizing that there
1626000	1628000	are importers who have been fans
1628000	1630000	for a while. Sia Tabiri in
1630000	1632000	the chat says, would you guys want a 32X
1632000	1634000	Mini? Yeah.
1634000	1636000	Because, I mean, it had some of the best arcade ports.
1636000	1638000	I want a Saturn Mini. Yes.
1638000	1640000	Or a Dreamcast
1640000	1642000	Mini. I'll take either one. I'll take both.
1642000	1644000	I would. Or either one.
1644000	1646000	I mean, chances are I probably already have
1646000	1648000	everything that I would want on both, but.
1648000	1650000	So none of y'all are Mini
1650000	1652000	systemed out? This Genesis thing sounds
1652000	1654000	Well, I didn't bother with the PlayStation
1654000	1656000	Mini because the emulation was
1656000	1658000	garbage. I didn't bother with it either just because
1658000	1660000	of the choices they made. I found NES
1660000	1662000	Classics at Target
1662000	1664000	a couple weeks ago. Oh, really? For full retail.
1664000	1666000	Pick those up while you can
1666000	1668000	if you want one because they're not coming
1668000	1670000	back. I already have one. Yeah, I've already
1670000	1672000	got an SNES Classic that I packed the
1672000	1674000	bits in. I think
1674000	1676000	that's why they're not coming back. Zero.
1676000	1678000	Nintendo's not happy with how fast those got
1678000	1680000	ripped open. Well, on top of that,
1680000	1682000	legit, all you need
1682000	1684000	is the old console and an EverDrive.
1685000	1687000	The end. The end.
1687000	1689000	I mean, if you're going to put data on those chips,
1689000	1691000	you're going to be able to get data
1691000	1693000	off of those chips. Well, and the other
1693000	1695000	advantage to having, though, the classic
1695000	1697000	series would be the HDMI support
1697000	1699000	with no input lag.
1699000	1701000	That's that. Well, let's
1701000	1703000	move on to another story.
1703000	1705000	Loki, another another blast from the
1705000	1707000	past of sorts, right? Yes. And this is
1707000	1709000	kind of an odd odd one here, but
1709000	1711000	apparently Dance Central is
1711000	1713000	being ported to the Oculus Rift
1713000	1715000	and apparently the Oculus Quest
1715000	1717000	as well. Why
1717000	1719000	is so the keep it going?
1719000	1721000	I don't know how that's going to work. I'm assuming
1721000	1723000	that they're just going to track the arm motions
1723000	1725000	using the controllers. Kind of
1725000	1727000	similar how, I guess, Just Dance does it
1727000	1729000	with phones
1729000	1731000	or I guess it's all phones nowadays.
1731000	1733000	They don't really use the move controllers
1733000	1735000	or Wii remotes or
1735000	1737000	whatever the hell they have. Oh, you
1737000	1739000	mean the move dildos? Yep.
1739000	1741000	So they're going
1741000	1743000	to be porting
1743000	1745000	that over. It says it's going to
1745000	1747000	be exclusive on both of those platforms.
1747000	1749000	This will be the first time
1749000	1751000	it's been on another platform
1751000	1753000	other than the Xbox. They haven't
1753000	1755000	given any sort of
1755000	1757000	specifics on
1757000	1759000	what's going to be included with it, if it's going to
1759000	1761000	include songs from the first three games
1761000	1763000	or if it's just going to be the first game or whatever
1763000	1765000	the hell it is.
1765000	1767000	But it's interesting
1767000	1769000	to see this. I'm curious
1769000	1771000	to see how it's actually going to work, being that
1771000	1773000	the game, I don't know,
1773000	1775000	I guess you'd just see your avatar dancing
1775000	1777000	or something, but
1777000	1779000	it'll be interesting to see how this works.
1779000	1781000	And also kind of curious
1781000	1783000	to the fact that
1783000	1785000	they're going to port
1785000	1787000	this to VR, but I'm surprised they didn't go the route
1787000	1789000	of, say, a Just Dance
1789000	1791000	game, where
1791000	1793000	since they're just using
1793000	1795000	I would imagine, not necessarily head tracking,
1795000	1797000	but they're using just the arm tracking.
1797000	1799000	So you could essentially
1799000	1801000	do just a Just Dance
1801000	1803000	game, but with Dance Central and port it
1803000	1805000	to other systems,
1805000	1807000	we'll have to see how it works, I guess.
1807000	1809000	Yeah, when I was reading about this, I was kind of thinking
1809000	1811000	like, gosh, this sounds really
1811000	1813000	cool, but if it was
1813000	1815000	like PSVR, that thing is kind of like a
1815000	1817000	beast to have on your head. And it's one
1817000	1819000	thing if you're playing something like Beat Saber
1819000	1821000	where, I don't know, my head
1821000	1823000	is staying pretty stationary. Sure, I do the bobs
1823000	1825000	up and down and things like that, but from what I remember
1825000	1827000	of Dance Central is that you were doing real
1827000	1829000	dances, and I just think with that whole
1829000	1831000	contraption...
1831000	1833000	It's pretty heavy, yeah. But, doesn't
1833000	1835000	Oculus, and aren't they trying to scale it back to more
1835000	1837000	just like goggles that you basically strap
1837000	1839000	on your face? Isn't that what the Oculus
1839000	1841000	Go and some of the... The Go is,
1841000	1843000	I don't know how light it is, but it's
1843000	1845000	similar to, I think...
1845000	1847000	Again, I think it's one of those things that as technology
1847000	1849000	advances, it's not like my complaint
1849000	1851000	is not going to be valid anymore because
1851000	1853000	they're not going to be that heavy.
1853000	1855000	I think, though, for me,
1855000	1857000	it would make more sense not to do it
1857000	1859000	just VR because you would want
1859000	1861000	to have it available
1861000	1863000	to as many people as possible
1863000	1865000	that are going to play these games, and I would
1865000	1867000	think that the crowd that's doing Just Dance
1867000	1869000	would want to get into that.
1869000	1871000	I don't know
1871000	1873000	how this is going to track any more accurately
1873000	1875000	than it would with...
1875000	1877000	Unless, I don't think the base stations
1877000	1879000	can track your body movement, aside from
1879000	1881000	if you had sensors on your feet or something like that,
1881000	1883000	but... I don't know.
1883000	1885000	I just think that it would work better
1885000	1887000	if they didn't do it in VR, but we'll have to see.
1887000	1889000	And then also, how's that going to look? Because like,
1889000	1891000	you know, Just Dance originally,
1891000	1893000	or not even Just Dance, Dance Central, the whole
1893000	1895000	point was like, it was Kinect and you were just
1895000	1897000	kind of doing it without any sort of sensors
1897000	1899000	on you, and at least then that way you can
1899000	1901000	record yourself doing it and actually look like you're
1901000	1903000	dancing, but you're kind of looking weird dancing
1903000	1905000	with that giant VR headset on.
1905000	1907000	I just think it's going to be weird, unless you can do
1907000	1909000	some virtual camera with your avatar or whatever,
1909000	1910000	but...
1910000	1912000	Guess you can pretend you're dancing like no one's watching.
1912000	1914000	I mean, I would be super
1914000	1916000	into this with the control,
1916000	1918000	and what you were kind of saying,
1918000	1920000	the control mechanism, and that whole
1920000	1922000	thing with either the move, or the
1922000	1924000	similar, and I don't know what the technical name
1924000	1926000	is on the Vive, has those sticks
1926000	1928000	that you hold that kind of feel like a PlayStation
1928000	1930000	move, even though they're so different.
1930000	1932000	But you know, I would be all for
1932000	1934000	playing a dance game with that type of stuff
1934000	1936000	that's come a long way since the Kinect,
1936000	1938000	and just the fact that technology's advanced,
1938000	1940000	but yeah, I don't know about the whole
1940000	1942000	headset part.
1942000	1944000	I'll try it, but it just seems
1944000	1946000	a little...
1946000	1948000	I have to see it to believe this.
1948000	1950000	Dance Central was so fun.
1950000	1952000	I don't know if this is the case, but we're talking
1952000	1954000	motion gaming and stuff like that.
1954000	1956000	Is it possible to play one of these games
1956000	1958000	that uses the Vive controller
1958000	1960000	without the Vive,
1960000	1962000	or without the Oculus Rift,
1962000	1964000	just using the motion controllers and just playing
1964000	1966000	a game on your PC monitor or something like that?
1966000	1968000	PlayStation can, technically.
1968000	1970000	So I don't understand, couldn't we do it like that?
1970000	1972000	The move was purpose-
1972000	1974000	I understand that there's some of those
1974000	1976000	trackers that use the inside-out tracking
1976000	1978000	where it'll actually use the headset,
1978000	1980000	but the older stuff
1980000	1982000	uses the base stations. Bobby's trying to explain
1982000	1984000	some of this in chat. There's no more base stations
1984000	1986000	with the Oculus Quest. Oculus Quest is now
1986000	1988000	all inside-out tracking, so
1988000	1990000	Oculus Touch, not with the Oculus Quest
1990000	1992000	because the sensors are all in the headset.
1992000	1994000	There are no more base stations.
1994000	1996000	So it would depend on which piece of technology
1996000	1998000	you're using, basically. I guess. I don't know.
1998000	2000000	I just think that they would have a better adoption rate
2000000	2002000	with it being outside of VR,
2002000	2004000	but I'm curious to see how this plays.
2006000	2008000	But also,
2008000	2010000	Bobby's pointing out that
2010000	2012000	Oculus is paying for the
2012000	2014000	Dance Central game, and that's
2014000	2016000	why it's exclusive, so it's not something
2016000	2018000	that- Are we not gonna get Kinect Star Wars now?
2018000	2022000	No dancing to the Han Solo?
2022000	2024000	Or anything like that?
2024000	2026000	Maybe you can hope for a secret unlock
2026000	2028000	or something in the game. I don't know.
2028000	2030000	No? Alright.
2030000	2032000	Well, moving on. Let's talk about
2032000	2034000	everybody's favorite. It's a rumor,
2034000	2036000	but the Wall Street Journal
2036000	2038000	is reporting on this one, so
2038000	2040000	this is one of those rumors that's so loud
2040000	2042000	it's got the attention of the traditional
2042000	2044000	press, and in the case of the Wall Street
2044000	2046000	Journal, a lot of investors and people
2046000	2048000	that, you know, keep their eye on the money and such,
2048000	2050000	so take with a grain of salt, but
2050000	2052000	I know for me, this isn't the first time
2052000	2054000	I've heard this rumor, but- We've also thought
2054000	2056000	of similar things. Yes. So anyway,
2056000	2058000	here it is. Wall Street Journal is saying that
2058000	2060000	Nintendo is looking at doing two
2060000	2062000	new Nintendo Switch models, and
2062000	2064000	one of them could be this summer.
2064000	2066000	Possibly timed around E3,
2066000	2068000	I don't know, that's me making that up, but
2068000	2070000	I mean, it could be interesting if Nintendo were to
2070000	2072000	say, you know, at E3,
2072000	2074000	they're doing their direct, we're looking at doing this
2074000	2076000	new Nintendo Switch, and I don't think they could do
2076000	2078000	the whole, it's in stores today,
2078000	2080000	because it's very hard to keep those kinds of secrets anymore,
2080000	2082000	especially with physical things, but they could say
2082000	2084000	and it's going to be on shelves
2084000	2086000	next Friday, you know, they could
2086000	2088000	have that type of fast turnaround, maybe.
2088000	2090000	I'm fanboying a little
2090000	2092000	bit here and making things up, but they could.
2092000	2094000	Anyway,
2094000	2096000	apparently one new Nintendo
2096000	2098000	Switch model is going to be enhanced and
2098000	2100000	more powerful than the Switch you have today.
2100000	2102000	We're not talking like 4K
2102000	2104000	graphics, we're not talking Xbox
2104000	2106000	One X, we're not talking PlayStation 4 Plus,
2106000	2108000	but it's just going to be more powerful
2108000	2110000	than what we have today.
2110000	2112000	So far I'm a little worried, because
2112000	2114000	this reeks of new 3DS
2114000	2116000	versus 3DS, and
2116000	2118000	does this mean now we're going to segment the game market?
2118000	2120000	I hope it's not that,
2120000	2122000	but we'll see, I'll give Nintendo the benefit of the doubt,
2122000	2124000	after all, this is a rumor. The only thing I could see is
2124000	2126000	maybe that it's a 1080p
2126000	2128000	screen, and they have something to push the graphics
2128000	2130000	1080p portable instead of
2130000	2132000	just, you know,
2132000	2134000	720 portable, maybe?
2134000	2136000	I like that, let's go with that.
2136000	2138000	We'll go with that. More games in portable
2138000	2140000	mode running like they were docked.
2140000	2142000	I like that.
2142000	2144000	But there's also going to be a second model.
2144000	2146000	It's going to be cheaper, because it's going to
2146000	2148000	focus on the handheld mode, meaning
2148000	2150000	I'm assuming to take this to mean there's not
2150000	2152000	really going to be a dock. Nintendo
2152000	2154000	is looking for this to be
2154000	2156000	the successor to the 3DS.
2156000	2158000	Finally.
2158000	2160000	Finally.
2160000	2162000	The 3DS may finally
2162000	2164000	be done. But I don't understand how they're going to make this
2164000	2166000	any cheaper, though. Well, you get rid of the
2166000	2168000	dock, that's going to be part of it, and then
2168000	2170000	just the fact that it's been a couple years
2170000	2172000	maybe it'll be a little smaller, you know,
2172000	2174000	who knows. Maybe the touch,
2174000	2176000	maybe they'll eliminate the touch, because not a lot
2176000	2178000	of games really use it, to be fair. I'm making
2178000	2180000	shit up, Nintendo will be the ones
2180000	2182000	to answer this, but there's ways they can scale it back
2182000	2184000	a little bit. Okay.
2184000	2186000	But anyway, the Wall Street
2186000	2188000	Journal reporter, in the name
2188000	2190000	of the guy that's been talking about this on Wall Street,
2190000	2192000	is Takahashi
2192000	2194000	Moshizuki, is saying that
2194000	2196000	the different designs of these two Nintendo
2196000	2198000	Switch systems are different from the
2198000	2200000	original, and you'd be surprised.
2200000	2202000	I'm not sure what to take
2202000	2204000	that to mean. Perhaps the actual
2204000	2206000	system may look different.
2206000	2208000	Perhaps, you know what, Loki, maybe
2208000	2210000	to save on cost, maybe
2210000	2212000	the portable Switch, you can't
2212000	2214000	take off the sides.
2214000	2216000	Maybe those don't, like it's
2216000	2218000	just something that you can play
2218000	2220000	That's gonna suck.
2220000	2222000	You know why? It's gonna
2222000	2224000	suck because if those
2224000	2226000	Joy-Cons
2226000	2228000	handle dirt
2228000	2230000	and dust and whatever, like the ones I
2230000	2232000	have do, it's gonna suck because they're gonna
2232000	2234000	break and then you're gonna have a whole system to
2234000	2236000	replace. DJ Rama S
2236000	2238000	says, Rob, stop hating on the 3DS.
2238000	2240000	I'm not hating on the 3DS.
2240000	2242000	The 3DS and the DS, therefore,
2242000	2244000	have a wonderful, it's so
2244000	2246000	important for the history of portable gaming, and
2246000	2248000	there's a library of amazing games on
2248000	2250000	it that people should play, and if you never touch
2250000	2252000	one, you'll be missing out on some very great
2252000	2254000	experiences. That being said,
2254000	2256000	Nintendo has a
2256000	2258000	better portable system out now.
2258000	2260000	It's been many
2260000	2262000	years, many years since the first
2262000	2264000	DS especially, but to be
2264000	2266000	fair, even quite a few years since the
2266000	2268000	original 3DS, it's time to
2268000	2270000	move on. Like, I
2270000	2272000	just can't think of any other console
2272000	2274000	that's like lasted this long.
2274000	2276000	I kind of think what Nintendo
2276000	2278000	was doing is after they got burned a little
2278000	2280000	bit with Wii U, they didn't want to put
2280000	2282000	all their eggs in the Switch basket
2282000	2284000	until the Switch was a bona fide success.
2284000	2286000	Well, guess what, y'all? The Switch
2286000	2288000	is a success. The Fides have been
2288000	2290000	bonuts. The Fides have been bonuts.
2290000	2292000	So, therefore,
2292000	2294000	they can move on from the
2294000	2296000	3DS now and let its great
2296000	2298000	legacy live on in our
2298000	2300000	hearts and in our retro game collections.
2300000	2302000	Is that hating on the 3DS?
2302000	2304000	No. Alright, I didn't think so.
2304000	2306000	Alright. Let's see,
2306000	2308000	other comments in chat.
2308000	2310000	Bob Coffee says, I imagine Nintendo will
2310000	2312000	announce a cheap portable, one
2312000	2314000	portable only one for
2314000	2316000	Pokemons. You know, that's a great observation.
2316000	2318000	If there's any time
2318000	2320000	to release like a mini Switch,
2320000	2322000	it's cause of Pokemon. I think
2322000	2324000	I think you're, ding, ding, ding,
2324000	2326000	winner, winner, Pokemon
2326000	2328000	dinner, because
2328000	2330000	and which Pokemon is up to you? Because
2330000	2332000	it would seem like a
2332000	2334000	given that you would have this
2334000	2336000	bundled with Pokemon
2336000	2338000	like same day, like if Nintendo
2338000	2340000	the mini one will
2340000	2342000	be out with Pokemon. Bank on it.
2342000	2344000	Bank on it.
2344000	2346000	Let's see.
2346000	2348000	ActDeft in chat says,
2348000	2350000	new Switch XL or something like that.
2350000	2352000	Who knows? Who knows what the actual
2352000	2354000	system will be called. Tiger Claw
2354000	2356000	says, the Switch is a success
2356000	2358000	because it bridges the gap between handheld
2358000	2360000	and console. And the fact that
2360000	2362000	it's just got Nintendo's brand
2362000	2364000	all over it, you know, and
2364000	2366000	going back to like Zelda from earlier.
2366000	2368000	Like, that's just not a game
2368000	2370000	that exists anywhere else.
2370000	2372000	There's things that try to emulate
2372000	2374000	it and come, you know, I mean, certainly you can
2374000	2376000	say, well, Breath of the Wild was
2376000	2378000	inspired by Skyrim, but there's
2378000	2380000	nothing like Breath of the Wild.
2380000	2382000	There just, anywhere. There just isn't.
2382000	2384000	Anyway. Alright, let's move
2384000	2386000	on. Darsakra, what do you
2386000	2388000	got for us? A little more facts.
2388000	2390000	Things that are actually happening, for sure.
2390000	2392000	Well, do we remember a particular
2392000	2394000	game that never actually came out called
2394000	2396000	Penn and Teller Smoke and Mirrors?
2396000	2398000	I think that we do remember
2398000	2400000	this one, because that's what gave us Desert Fucking
2400000	2402000	Bus. I was going to say, Desert Bus
2402000	2404000	and the, basically,
2404000	2406000	the marathon,
2406000	2408000	the charity event, the drive
2408000	2410000	that they do for that every year
2410000	2412000	is because of Smoke and Mirrors, for sure.
2412000	2414000	Exactly. Well, it looks like
2414000	2416000	Penn and Teller are getting back into
2416000	2418000	the tie-in
2418000	2420000	video game stuff.
2420000	2422000	So, um, they are
2422000	2424000	going to, and whoever
2424000	2426000	wrote this article that I'm reading it from clearly
2426000	2428000	never knew about the Sega CD game
2428000	2430000	and only knew about the Desert Bus Marathon.
2430000	2432000	These kids today. So,
2432000	2434000	whatever the fuck. Um, anyway,
2434000	2436000	so, they did announce at PAX
2436000	2438000	East that Gearbox is going to be
2438000	2440000	working with them to do an Oculus
2440000	2442000	game. Oculus,
2442000	2444000	the Vive, the PSVR
2444000	2446000	headset that's going to be called Penn
2446000	2448000	and Teller VR. Frankly, unfair,
2448000	2450000	unkind, unnecessary, and underhanded.
2450000	2452000	I like that.
2452000	2454000	I do think the name
2454000	2456000	is great. They only have a title and a release date.
2456000	2458000	Um, which
2458000	2460000	I'm looking to see if they put
2460000	2462000	the release date in a stupid article.
2462000	2464000	Um, but at any rate,
2464000	2466000	um, it is going to be
2466000	2468000	developed by Gearbox, so hopefully it will be
2468000	2470000	better than
2470000	2472000	Smoke and Mirrors was supposed to be.
2472000	2474000	Um, but yeah, the one thing
2474000	2476000	they have on here is that it's going to be released in
2476000	2478000	June. They don't actually have the specific date
2478000	2480000	on it. But this, that name is great
2480000	2482000	and it's fun to say.
2482000	2484000	Unfair, unkind, unnecessary, and underhanded.
2484000	2486000	Yeah, no, I like, the name is great.
2486000	2488000	I just, I hope that Penn
2488000	2490000	and Teller and the things that they do,
2490000	2492000	I hope they don't use this as an excuse to make
2492000	2494000	like VR make me sick on purpose
2494000	2496000	type of thing. I hope it's a little,
2496000	2498000	I hope it's controlled.
2498000	2500000	Well, and it was always
2500000	2502000	my impression that at least
2502000	2504000	Penn doesn't
2504000	2506000	really care for video
2506000	2508000	games that much. So the fact
2508000	2510000	that they are licensing out to do
2510000	2512000	a video game is a little bit beyond me
2512000	2514000	so maybe, well, given
2514000	2516000	Do you know what he likes more than games? Money.
2516000	2518000	Yeah, but they're
2518000	2520000	fairly successful. No, they are. Their show's
2520000	2522000	been at the Rio for eons. Well, on top
2522000	2524000	of that though, they also have, I don't know if they still have
2524000	2526000	that TV show where it's like, they try to
2526000	2528000	fool the magicians.
2528000	2530000	But, you know. Oh, yeah.
2530000	2532000	And that's pretty fun to watch. I like that they've actually
2532000	2534000	been fooled a couple of times, but
2534000	2536000	not often. But
2536000	2538000	at any rate, you know, it's
2538000	2540000	it's just very interesting and I have
2540000	2542000	a feeling that there's going to be a lot more commentary
2542000	2544000	in this one, you know, down the line.
2544000	2546000	So. Now, I
2546000	2548000	sorry, I was gonna say, I know you're not
2548000	2550000	a big VR person because of the motion
2550000	2552000	and, you know, some of the other things that you deal with, but
2552000	2554000	if there is a
2554000	2556000	well, I guess there already was an, I see Bobby saying in the chat,
2556000	2558000	there already was a Desert Bus VR, but let's
2558000	2560000	say it's a Desert
2560000	2562000	Desert Double Decker
2562000	2564000	Bus VR. Would you give it a try?
2564000	2566000	No. No. Because I won't play a VR game.
2566000	2568000	It was worth a shot.
2568000	2570000	I'll play it. I'll try it.
2570000	2572000	I actually was trying to double check
2572000	2574000	to see if I could find the quote and it's back from
2574000	2576000	2012.
2576000	2578000	And
2578000	2580000	talking about how there is
2580000	2582000	the video games
2582000	2584000	for a little while.
2584000	2586000	Okay, here's the thing that I want.
2586000	2588000	The cliche of the nerdy kid who doesn't go outside
2588000	2590000	and just plays games is completely untrue.
2590000	2592000	It's also true for the nerdy
2592000	2594000	kid who studies comic books and turns them into
2594000	2596000	basically saying that the obsession
2596000	2598000	with video games can turn into
2598000	2600000	a creative outlet and become
2600000	2602000	a career or something
2602000	2604000	that would make them a creative genius.
2604000	2606000	I'd be curious where their opinions
2606000	2608000	are at all these years later now.
2608000	2610000	The video games are much bigger.
2610000	2612000	It's not that long ago.
2612000	2614000	I guess that's true.
2614000	2616000	So maybe I was wrong about the not liking games.
2616000	2618000	Maybe that was just like in the 90s.
2618000	2620000	Maybe that was the case and it changed in the
2620000	2622000	aughts. That's kind of more what I was getting at.
2622000	2624000	Maybe their opinions kind of come around as
2624000	2626000	now everybody's got cell phones
2626000	2628000	and more people play games because of cell phones.
2628000	2630000	It's a quote we're now. We've all got cell phones
2630000	2632000	so come on. Let's get real.
2632000	2634000	Bobby wants to point out though Gearbox made
2634000	2636000	it and Penn would never allow them to make
2636000	2638000	a game where it makes you sick. Fair enough.
2638000	2640000	They trust Randy Pitchford who is also
2640000	2642000	a magician.
2642000	2644000	I thought I heard he put on
2644000	2646000	a magic show at PAX or something.
2646000	2648000	He did.
2648000	2650000	Bobby also watches that show and said they did
2650000	2652000	get fooled every episode.
2652000	2654000	It's probably, here's the thing
2654000	2656000	those shows are edited in a way. They probably
2656000	2658000	shoot like 20 of those guys
2658000	2660000	and gals every day
2660000	2662000	and then they shuffle them in a way so that every
2662000	2664000	episode has one. Granted I don't really watch the full
2664000	2666000	episodes. I've just watched a bunch of it on YouTube
2666000	2668000	because I hate watching
2668000	2670000	sitting down for a whole episode of something.
2670000	2672000	And I might be wrong. Wasn't it on some obscure
2672000	2674000	cable network? I could be wrong. I thought it was
2674000	2676000	like I
2676000	2678000	I always saw it on YouTube ever too.
2678000	2680000	I just pull up a bunch of YouTubes of like
2680000	2682000	you know different acts within it and try to watch
2682000	2684000	them so maybe I just
2684000	2686000	don't have. I hate sitting down and just focusing
2686000	2688000	on a TV episode. I mean I will
2688000	2690000	only do that for just like things that I
2690000	2692000	am super fan girl about.
2692000	2694000	It was on the CW apparently
2694000	2696000	which yeah that is an obscure
2696000	2698000	broadcast network. I'm sorry. Speaking
2698000	2700000	of CW. The only thing I know about on CW
2700000	2702000	is Supernatural
2702000	2704000	and DC stuff. Well the
2704000	2706000	DC stuff is, DC is garbage.
2706000	2708000	Oh and Top Model. I do not watch any
2708000	2710000	DC shows but Supernatural
2710000	2712000	is going to be on its last season. Yeah I heard.
2712000	2714000	Finally I mean
2714000	2716000	I love the show but I stopped watching after like
2716000	2718000	season 10 and then
2718000	2720000	I've gone back and tried to like watch again
2720000	2722000	but
2722000	2724000	it was supposed to end after season 5.
2724000	2726000	That was the
2726000	2728000	end of the original story.
2728000	2730000	Spoiler. Sam goes to hell.
2730000	2732000	That's the end of the season.
2732000	2734000	I think that's how Buffy season 5 ended too
2734000	2736000	sort of. Well no. In season
2736000	2738000	6 she died. Yeah. And then they
2738000	2740000	did a season 7 which was garbage.
2740000	2742000	I mean it was okay. I mean there's
2742000	2744000	some big stuff that went but it wasn't a
2744000	2746000	great season. Now Pod Culture in chat says
2746000	2748000	don't be ragging on DC. I know some people
2748000	2750000	that are really. You are welcome to enjoy
2750000	2752000	terrible story writing.
2752000	2754000	Pod Culture and I know the critical myth gang
2754000	2756000	are like into those shows.
2756000	2758000	Good for them.
2758000	2760000	I'm just waiting
2760000	2762000	for Disney to get their shit together
2762000	2764000	and I'm also waiting for season 3 of Jessica Jones.
2764000	2766000	But that's going to take
2766000	2768000	Disney getting their shit together right? Because there's no more
2768000	2770000	Netflix Disney thing right? Disney's going to do
2770000	2772000	their own thing.
2772000	2774000	Will they still have Kristen Ritter and all that?
2774000	2776000	I hope she was good but you know
2776000	2778000	it's funny though. I like
2778000	2780000	I finally picked up a Captain Marvel
2780000	2782000	pop but I'm calling them
2782000	2784000	comic besties because they are besties in
2784000	2786000	the comics. So
2786000	2788000	that makes me happy. I have my comic besties.
2788000	2790000	Alright let's move on
2790000	2792000	just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic
2792000	2794000	game of the week. First Loki.
2794000	2796000	Alright so I
2796000	2798000	actually did get to check this out because
2798000	2800000	I almost forgot that it was even on
2800000	2802000	but Sony you may remember
2802000	2804000	was doing their state of play
2804000	2806000	which is kind of like their Nintendo Direct thing
2806000	2808000	and so they actually did
2808000	2810000	show off quite a few different games
2810000	2812000	that are going to be coming out for the Playstation.
2812000	2814000	Actually a lot for the Playstation VR as well.
2814000	2816000	So to kind of run down some of the stuff
2816000	2818000	that they showed.
2818000	2820000	Concrete Genie which is a pretty cool looking
2820000	2822000	game. They have that coming out now with
2822000	2824000	VR support as well.
2824000	2826000	They showed a
2826000	2828000	trailer for Marvel's Iron Man
2828000	2830000	VR which my kids are definitely all
2830000	2832000	over. More gameplay
2832000	2834000	of Days Gone which
2834000	2836000	doesn't have a fucking release date.
2836000	2838000	I thought that was supposed to be out by now.
2838000	2840000	Well
2840000	2842000	it's not.
2842000	2844000	Blood and Truth which is
2844000	2846000	a
2846000	2848000	it looks like almost like a spin off
2848000	2850000	of the game that they had in
2850000	2852000	Playstation Worlds where you kind of
2852000	2854000	play like the mob series and stuff but it's
2854000	2856000	another VR game. Ready Set
2856000	2858000	Heroes look pretty cool.
2858000	2860000	They had
2860000	2862000	Observation which is a
2862000	2864000	game that came out on Oculus
2864000	2866000	Quest. Now it's coming to Playstation
2866000	2868000	VR. They were showing
2868000	2870000	off
2870000	2872000	they're going to have retro skins for Crash
2872000	2874000	Team Racing Nitro Fields.
2874000	2876000	The old school polygon
2876000	2878000	stuff that's going to be in there.
2878000	2880000	Oh that's silly I like that. Yeah so they have
2880000	2882000	those. That's a good kind of silly.
2882000	2884000	They showed off a new trailer for Mortal
2884000	2886000	Combat 11.
2886000	2888000	I can't believe
2888000	2890000	that game is only like three weeks away. I feel like
2890000	2892000	I just heard it was coming.
2892000	2894000	I got to say with as much as you know my
2894000	2896000	opinion on the Mortal Combat franchise and all
2896000	2898000	that it's too much for me but
2898000	2900000	I got to say they did that launch pretty well.
2900000	2902000	They announced it and then like two months later it's here.
2902000	2904000	You may remember No Man's Sky
2904000	2906000	got the new Beyond
2906000	2908000	expansion that's going to be coming out which is that brandy thing
2908000	2910000	but they also have a new patch that's going to be coming out
2910000	2912000	soon that's for Playstation
2912000	2914000	VR as well so you'll be able to play that game
2914000	2916000	in that.
2916000	2918000	That's kind of rad.
2918000	2920000	I don't know how often I would like really use that
2920000	2922000	but I think it would be fun a couple
2922000	2924000	of times to just explore the worlds
2924000	2926000	and VR kind of get my fill of that
2926000	2928000	and that would be cool.
2928000	2930000	I think I did hear though that that same patch is
2930000	2932000	going to hit the PC and the relevant
2932000	2934000	VR platforms on PC too. Yeah so that would be cool
2934000	2936000	and then definitely another one. You'll have fun with
2936000	2938000	Robby's Five Nights at Freddy's VR Help Wanted.
2938000	2940000	Hell no. It's going to be coming out
2940000	2942000	as well. Hell no. It's
2942000	2944000	a great thing for the
2944000	2946000	franchise. It's the same guy doing it but now he's
2946000	2948000	doing a VR game. Yes and my son totally wants to
2948000	2950000	play that as well so that'll be... I hope y'all
2950000	2952000	have fun. That'll be fun.
2952000	2954000	I feel about that the way Jamie does
2954000	2956000	about the DC stuff. I didn't see it in here
2956000	2958000	on this list but I think that they announced
2958000	2960000	also Dreams is going to have that
2960000	2962000	beta test for Dreams as well.
2962000	2964000	I think, I don't remember if that was part of this
2964000	2966000	presentation or not but
2966000	2968000	yeah lots of things
2968000	2970000	coming out. Oh and then they also showed
2970000	2972000	Vacation Simulator again and they announced
2972000	2974000	the release date for that because I know I'm looking forward to that one.
2974000	2976000	That's June 18th.
2976000	2978000	Yeah. Lots of
2978000	2980000	stuff. I think we only touched on some of the
2980000	2982000	things that were in there but it was
2982000	2984000	a decent presentation.
2984000	2986000	I hope they do more of them.
2986000	2988000	SSG100Matt says
2988000	2990000	how many biddies to get Rob to play Five Nights
2990000	2992000	at Freddy's VR? I
2992000	2994000	would only do it for charity. I wouldn't do it for
2994000	2996000	as much as Bobby's going to grit
2996000	2998000	his teeth. But I think he'll agree
2998000	3000000	I would only do it for charity. I wouldn't do it
3000000	3002000	for our own pockets.
3002000	3004000	I would stream it here
3004000	3006000	but I'll only do it for charity.
3006000	3008000	I haven't thought of a number yet.
3008000	3010000	We'll see.
3010000	3012000	I'm like
3012000	3014000	getting scared just thinking about it.
3014000	3016000	The jump scares in those games are
3016000	3018000	horrible.
3018000	3020000	I can't even imagine
3020000	3022000	looking to the right and what those little creatures
3022000	3024000	are. They have additional things that you do like
3024000	3026000	repairing them and stuff.
3026000	3028000	I'm getting a headache just thinking about it.
3028000	3030000	Anyway.
3030000	3032000	Let's see.
3032000	3034000	Yeah, Shane's in chat saying
3034000	3036000	I told Rob he needs to play it the moment
3036000	3038000	it got announced.
3038000	3040000	Siya Tabiri says
3040000	3042000	who's charity and why will you play it for her but not
3042000	3044000	for us? Oh you.
3044000	3046000	Alright, anyway. What did you think of the
3046000	3048000	event itself? I heard it kind of got
3048000	3050000	kind of a tepid. It was okay.
3050000	3052000	It just kind of seemed like it was just like trailer dump.
3052000	3054000	Yeah. But I like, I do
3054000	3056000	like and even though I saw some comments in chat like
3056000	3058000	wow it was a lot of VR. I'm
3058000	3060000	kind of glad that Sony is supporting
3060000	3062000	this hardware that they put out and like
3062000	3064000	I'm okay with them like
3064000	3066000	maybe so that they don't feel like they
3066000	3068000	have to do this around E3 time. Maybe
3068000	3070000	now, yes I know Sony's not doing E3 but
3070000	3072000	still, maybe Sony's kind of like putting
3072000	3074000	this information out there now so it's like oh hey
3074000	3076000	look at all this stuff that's coming on VR.
3076000	3078000	You got a reason to own one. We're still
3078000	3080000	supporting it. And I can
3080000	3082000	appreciate that. So you know even if I'm
3082000	3084000	not into the Five Nights at Freddy's thing
3084000	3086000	yes I am into the No Man's Sky thing.
3086000	3088000	They're not going to have like some sort of announcements around
3088000	3090000	E3. They'll do
3090000	3092000	something but it might just be in this format
3092000	3094000	because more and more want to do
3094000	3096000	a direct style like they want to
3096000	3098000	use and Microsoft
3098000	3100000	has their Inside Xbox that they just
3100000	3102000	had one like last week so
3102000	3104000	yeah you know anyway
3104000	3106000	um what was there was
3106000	3108000	another comment in chat here I want to read oh
3108000	3110000	Spyro557 Jonathan in chat talking about
3110000	3112000	the Crash Team Racing.
3112000	3114000	Oh by the way the low poly skins are
3114000	3116000	a PlayStation 4 exclusive
3116000	3118000	so you don't get them on Xbox or
3118000	3120000	Switch and maybe that ties into the
3120000	3122000	fact that you know those games were
3122000	3124000	PlayStation games there wasn't those
3124000	3126000	same platforms didn't exist back then
3126000	3128000	so maybe it's kind of a special thing for Sony
3128000	3130000	because Sony was the original home
3130000	3132000	of those games so
3132000	3134000	all right well let's move on
3134000	3136000	and I think I've got one more story here before we
3136000	3138000	get to the classic game of the week and this one is about
3138000	3140000	you know and I've talked earlier
3140000	3142000	in the show about how I really think subscription
3142000	3144000	services are kind of the wave
3144000	3146000	of the future and another company
3146000	3148000	throwing their hat in the ring this week
3148000	3150000	Apple did a big thing earlier this week
3150000	3152000	and of course you know Apple does phones
3152000	3154000	and watches but this week was a
3154000	3156000	very different type of event
3156000	3158000	because and you know folks were anticipating
3158000	3160000	this it was supposed to be about
3160000	3162000	TV and what they're going to be doing for the
3162000	3164000	Apple TV and their own type of
3164000	3166000	Netflix slash Hulu
3166000	3168000	slash you know that whole
3168000	3170000	warehouse competitor and
3170000	3172000	so here comes Oprah here comes
3172000	3174000	Spielberg who just
3174000	3176000	hated on Netflix like a couple weeks ago
3176000	3178000	if I'm not mistaken but whatever whatever
3178000	3180000	because he's probably getting paid by Apple so
3180000	3182000	you know somebody showed him money and now he's on board but anyway
3182000	3184000	it sounds like they've got some neat things
3184000	3186000	but that's not games I mean then there was the whole
3186000	3188000	credit card thing which I was like I
3188000	3190000	I guess I mean because Apple pay
3190000	3192000	but anyway that's not the game part the game part
3192000	3194000	is they announced Apple Arcade
3194000	3196000	which will be a premium subscription
3196000	3198000	service for Apple devices so I think
3198000	3200000	many people kind of figured this was coming
3200000	3202000	we've heard these rumors about Apple for quite some
3202000	3204000	time so
3204000	3206000	iPhone
3206000	3208000	iPad Apple
3208000	3210000	computers meaning like Macs
3210000	3212000	right and Mac Minis things like that everything in the
3212000	3214000	Apple family and Apple TV
3214000	3216000	are all part of Apple Arcade
3216000	3218000	and so that kind of
3218000	3220000	oh I was only expecting the phones and the iPads
3220000	3222000	I didn't think but it makes a lot of sense of course
3222000	3224000	Macs and computers will be in there
3224000	3226000	too what are what's available in the service
3226000	3228000	though well they're
3228000	3230000	going to be getting games we didn't get a lot of
3230000	3232000	details on like exactly the games
3232000	3234000	but we do know the talent
3234000	3236000	and they've got some big talent so just like
3236000	3238000	they brought out Oprah and they brought out Spielberg
3238000	3240000	Sega
3240000	3242000	Konami we'll let it slide
3242000	3244000	Mistwalker which for me that's the
3244000	3246000	Mistwalker that's like
3246000	3248000	fucking Lost Odyssey okay Mistwalker is a big
3248000	3250000	deal Mistwalker is the studio that was founded
3250000	3252000	by Final Fantasy Hironobu
3252000	3254000	Sakaguchi so
3254000	3256000	I think they kind of threw
3256000	3258000	a lot of companies out there hoping something
3258000	3260000	will stick with somebody and that's the one that stuck with
3260000	3262000	me was Mistwalker I was like
3262000	3264000	oh shit so the next Mistwalker game is going to be
3264000	3266000	something on my phone but then I also thought
3266000	3268000	oh but no it's going to be on Macs
3268000	3270000	as well because there's that part of me that's like
3270000	3272000	but I like
3272000	3274000	the stuff I like to play on the phone
3274000	3276000	was built for the phone
3276000	3278000	like Ingress, Pokemon Go those were built
3278000	3280000	for phones right there's not a lot
3280000	3282000	although I don't know like Super Hexagon
3282000	3284000	I don't play a lot
3284000	3286000	but the fact that it's on
3286000	3288000	Mac now
3288000	3290000	I'm like okay
3290000	3292000	I mean the only Mac we have is the
3292000	3294000	one that's dedicated to the video for this but assuming
3294000	3296000	I took that plunge in the future or something
3296000	3298000	I got two in my house
3298000	3300000	and I actually just downloaded a game for mine
3300000	3302000	right and you know for all the talk
3302000	3304000	of LOL games
3304000	3306000	on Mac in my opinion
3306000	3308000	the biggest news out of this Apple
3308000	3310000	thing is oh
3310000	3312000	well yes we're bringing games to Mac
3312000	3314000	Konami, Sega
3314000	3316000	Mistwalker
3316000	3318000	God what were all these logos on the screen?
3318000	3320000	Devolver Digital, Disney, the Chinese
3320000	3322000	room which I thought they folded
3322000	3324000	but I guess not. Right it's probably their
3324000	3326000	catalog titles. I don't think it is
3326000	3328000	I because there was something else I read
3328000	3330000	that said no the Chinese room like those guys
3330000	3332000	are now a part of a different
3332000	3334000	studio but they're using that brand on their newest
3334000	3336000	project and the reason why I specifically
3336000	3338000	call out Chinese room that was everybody's gone
3338000	3340000	Rapture and Dear Esther which I
3340000	3342000	loved those games so when I saw
3342000	3344000	their logo pop up I was like
3344000	3346000	I guess I could see that on a phone
3346000	3348000	but I'd rather play it on a TV
3348000	3350000	I am super skeptical
3350000	3352000	but okay. Yeah
3352000	3354000	but anyway we don't know when
3354000	3356000	we don't know oh
3356000	3358000	here's the other bit Will Wright is another
3358000	3360000	big name they've got on the service so I mean
3360000	3362000	attracting the talent not an
3362000	3364000	issue but there are still quite a few
3364000	3366000	gaps in this such
3366000	3368000	as when and how much
3368000	3370000	and those and what and
3370000	3372000	well yeah and the the conclusion of
3372000	3374000	what specifically exactly
3374000	3376000	um and those are all fair questions
3376000	3378000	to ask but I imagine we'll find out
3378000	3380000	a little closer to when they're really ready to
3380000	3382000	roll this out so um
3382000	3384000	who knows but again I
3384000	3386000	you know I think this is kind of where gaming
3386000	3388000	is going anyway and I
3388000	3390000	kind of think the big news out of this isn't
3390000	3392000	really the phones as although
3392000	3394000	certainly that'll be the big user this don't get me wrong
3394000	3396000	but I think this is Apple's own way
3396000	3398000	to kind of be like guess
3398000	3400000	what since people have no problem
3400000	3402000	developing for phones
3402000	3404000	we're going to bring a lot of that to the Mac
3404000	3406000	too and not to say they're not already doing that
3406000	3408000	they have been doing that but I think the fact
3408000	3410000	that it's going to be like this in bulk in one
3410000	3412000	fell swoop so to speak
3412000	3414000	I think I think
3414000	3416000	it's kind of the biggest most news worthy
3416000	3418000	thing out of it but you know your
3418000	3420000	mileage may vary so anyway
3420000	3422000	um thank you Questbuster
3422000	3424000	I knew it was a studio that so Questbuster said
3424000	3426000	Sumo Digital bought what was
3426000	3428000	left of the Chinese room because Chinese room
3428000	3430000	laid off almost all of their staff except
3430000	3432000	the people that founded it were still so
3432000	3434000	Sumo got those guys
3434000	3436000	on board and so whatever they're developing
3436000	3438000	will probably be different now because they're staffed on
3438000	3440000	alright well let's just see but like I just
3440000	3442000	I'm so highly skeptical
3442000	3444000	with that it's like without
3444000	3446000	any sort of like here's what exactly
3446000	3448000	releases like here's the talent we have that's cool but
3448000	3450000	I need to see what it is and how much
3450000	3452000	it is and all that stuff a system is only
3452000	3454000	as good as the games that are on it
3454000	3456000	right? or a service
3456000	3458000	they see those why not
3458000	3460000	can the golden rule of gaming apply to services
3460000	3462000	as well I would say sure because
3462000	3464000	I think before too long services
3464000	3466000	are all that's going to be there no it's not
3466000	3468000	I just
3468000	3470000	I really do alright Bobby
3470000	3472000	wants to point out though in chat at least it's not
3472000	3474000	streaming so that is a good point
3474000	3476000	this is very different from Stadia because
3476000	3478000	Apple's not streaming these
3478000	3480000	things it's more of a
3480000	3482000	game pass if you will you're going to
3482000	3484000	log in download it and
3484000	3486000	although you might think like
3486000	3488000	you know oh my god bandwidth
3488000	3490000	caps and things of that nature these
3490000	3492000	games have not I don't think we're
3492000	3494000	looking at any 60 gig phone
3494000	3496000	games maybe two gigs
3496000	3498000	but it's just going to be a different
3498000	3500000	kind of currency
3500000	3502000	here I suppose so that could make it
3502000	3504000	very interesting we'll see
3504000	3506000	we'll see anyway
3506000	3508000	that's it for now let's move
3508000	3510000	on to let's go back to a
3510000	3512000	classic time let's go back to a classic
3512000	3514000	time when you didn't have all these
3514000	3516000	newfangled services the Googles and the Apples
3516000	3518000	participating in gaming
3518000	3520000	it was no no it was Nintendo, Sega
3520000	3522000	and Sony at some point
3522000	3524000	the classics so it's the classic game of the week
3524000	3526000	Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find
3526000	3528000	a game that she thinks hey
3528000	3530000	you guys should be showing this game a little respect
3530000	3532000	if you can this
3532000	3534000	one might be a little harder for people to find
3534000	3536000	I bought this in a bargain basement
3536000	3538000	import at remember
3538000	3540000	Game Masters
3540000	3542000	oh yeah I bought it from there
3542000	3544000	dirt fucking cheap so tell us
3544000	3546000	already what is the classic game of the week the game
3546000	3548000	is Panzer Bandit
3548000	3550000	it came out
3550000	3552000	for Playstation
3552000	3554000	in 1997 published by
3554000	3556000	Banpresto and developed by
3556000	3558000	Fill in Cafe
3558000	3560000	Panzer Bandit is
3560000	3562000	a fun little
3562000	3564000	beat em up brawler game
3564000	3566000	it uses the same engine
3566000	3568000	as Mad Stalker
3568000	3570000	Full Metal Force
3570000	3572000	and by the way actually it did get a
3572000	3574000	PSN release in 2011
3574000	3576000	only in Japan of course but we have
3576000	3578000	ways of making that happen
3578000	3580000	but anyway the way that you
3580000	3582000	control the game first of all
3582000	3584000	is you have two attack buttons
3584000	3586000	strong and weak your directional pad
3586000	3588000	for moving around crouching jumping
3588000	3590000	and then you have your shoulder buttons to change between
3590000	3592000	foreground and background
3592000	3594000	and can be used to activate your special attack
3594000	3596000	so that was one thing
3596000	3598000	I thought was kind of neat for a brawler
3598000	3600000	it kind of has that Fatal Fury
3600000	3602000	kind of vibe with the two
3602000	3604000	layers and
3604000	3606000	then another thing
3606000	3608000	for the
3608000	3610000	game that's a little bit unique is that
3610000	3612000	if you stand still during
3612000	3614000	an attack it's guarding
3614000	3616000	you also have a combo
3616000	3618000	counter and an
3618000	3620000	elemental attack that will launch
3620000	3622000	an enemy off the screen
3622000	3624000	so it's just a neat fun
3624000	3626000	little game but basically
3626000	3628000	it
3628000	3630000	it's a game that I'm actually surprised
3630000	3632000	never did come out over here just for
3632000	3634000	how fun it was and it was
3634000	3636000	as far as I remember a little bit of a budget title
3636000	3638000	when it came out but
3638000	3640000	and as we all know Banpresto
3640000	3642000	was the one of the arms of
3642000	3644000	Bandai so
3644000	3646000	I mean they also the company is
3646000	3648000	also responsible for giving us
3648000	3650000	Super Robot Tyson
3650000	3652000	Super Robot Wars
3652000	3654000	so but I mean the game
3654000	3656000	it's a little
3656000	3658000	obscure I mean
3658000	3660000	not many people have heard of it
3660000	3662000	but when I
3662000	3664000	played it for the first time I just
3664000	3666000	was enraptured with it it was so much fun
3666000	3668000	and so
3668000	3670000	you know there's not really a lot to say about it
3670000	3672000	it's just to beat them up
3672000	3674000	another thing about it is you have 12 characters
3674000	3676000	that you can play
3676000	3678000	4 story characters and 8 unlockable bosses
3678000	3680000	so there you go
3680000	3682000	it's just fun classic fun
3682000	3684000	brawling
3684000	3686000	sometimes you need a good beat em up
3686000	3688000	and darn it you've just played the shit out of
3688000	3690000	Ninja Turtles and Simpsons
3690000	3692000	it's time for something new
3692000	3694000	I'd tell anybody if you can find
3694000	3696000	this game or you get access to
3696000	3698000	Japanese PSN definitely
3698000	3700000	own this one it is super
3700000	3702000	duper fun actually some folks in chat
3702000	3704000	over at twitch.tv slash vog network are
3704000	3706000	saying some good things about it
3706000	3708000	darticuya says getting a guardian heroes
3708000	3710000	vibe orange right saying kind of looks like
3710000	3712000	guardian heroes actf says
3712000	3714000	this game looks great
3714000	3716000	questpusher says it's like a lot of fun
3716000	3718000	love me a good beat em up
3718000	3720000	it's ridiculously fun
3720000	3722000	and kai judo says
3722000	3724000	the kid is biting off sonics
3724000	3726000	look no
3726000	3728000	this different art style
3728000	3730000	I see where he's
3730000	3732000	got the blue spiky hair
3732000	3734000	if they did make sonic human in the movie
3734000	3736000	it might have looked like that
3736000	3738000	yeah but all you know lead
3738000	3740000	video game characters in the
3740000	3742000	late 90s had that whole
3742000	3744000	extra big well I mean
3744000	3746000	look at like
3746000	3748000	any of the characters that have
3748000	3750000	sort of sci-fi universe
3750000	3752000	alien thing that's just the
3752000	3754000	aesthetic but I mean
3754000	3756000	clearly lots of fun
3756000	3758000	and screaming and blowing up
3758000	3760000	cute robot enemies
3760000	3762000	and the art style is fun and the
3762000	3764000	it's just 2D brawling
3764000	3766000	delightfulness
3766000	3768000	so acquire it
3768000	3770000	however you might need to acquire it
3770000	3772000	look we have a boss battle coming up
3772000	3774000	dialogue
3774000	3776000	yeah
3776000	3778000	I noticed the
3778000	3780000	beginning of the game had a really long
3780000	3782000	kind of cut scene so I chose the video
3782000	3784000	tonight kind of to start at the actual
3784000	3786000	game because
3786000	3788000	we don't always have 10 minutes of discussion
3788000	3790000	on the classic game
3790000	3792000	you see the plane jumping too
3792000	3794000	like Cal is describing in Fatal Fury
3794000	3796000	that's a really
3796000	3798000	fun just added
3798000	3800000	feature in the game I mean I don't like it in
3800000	3802000	Fatal Fury oddly enough but I loved it in this game
3802000	3804000	so there you go Panzer Bandit
3804000	3806000	Panzer Bandit there you go classic
3806000	3808000	game of the week sorry guys I got to take it off the
3808000	3810000	shot now so those of you that are
3810000	3812000	watching on Twitch you'll just have to go find that game
3812000	3814000	for yourself play a little more maybe somebody will stream
3814000	3816000	it on Twitch maybe Dark Sakura after they beat
3816000	3818000	Super Mario World
3818000	3820000	oh fuck I don't even know
3820000	3822000	I thought you had this
3822000	3824000	well no I do but I don't know where
3824000	3826000	the PlayStation with our HDMI output
3826000	3828000	it's a fair question
3828000	3830000	where do I find the hardware to play it on these days
3830000	3832000	well no shit we've got something like
3832000	3834000	six PlayStations
3834000	3836000	well I think it's on the PlayStation Network so you could just
3836000	3838000	Japanese
3838000	3840000	and I'm not going to bother making a Japanese account
3840000	3842000	you could get the old school capture
3842000	3844000	device like the one you used to have
3844000	3846000	I have his old capture device
3846000	3848000	but we agreed
3848000	3850000	that we were going to do Super Mario World
3850000	3852000	in the future in the future down the line someday
3852000	3854000	maybe I'll just put up a bunch
3854000	3856000	of PlayStation games and say
3856000	3858000	yo guys pick one educate the children
3858000	3860000	on some of these obscure
3860000	3862000	titles they know Mario World
3862000	3864000	that game is fun I'm not saying don't stream that because that game is a lot of fun
3864000	3866000	and especially watching you and Dan both
3866000	3868000	is going to be a hoot and holler
3868000	3870000	I'm just going to tell him he's a jerk
3871000	3873000	speaking of retro stuff
3873000	3875000	those of you that have followed me for a long time
3875000	3877000	first thanks for putting up with my bullshit for all these years
3877000	3879000	but second you might remember that when I was trying to do the YouTube thing
3879000	3881000	I started this little series called Let's Remember
3881000	3883000	and I was doing like
3883000	3885000	it's kind of like Let's Plays but I would put in
3885000	3887000	a lot of facts in there
3887000	3889000	you're like a pop up video
3889000	3891000	oh my god that's a great way to describe it
3891000	3893000	it was like pop up video but for games
3893000	3895000	so I think I want to bring that back
3895000	3897000	you guys
3897000	3899000	not necessarily on my YouTube
3899000	3901000	only there was a video platform that we're using more and more often
3901000	3903000	these days
3903000	3905000	I'm just curious what you all on chat think about that
3905000	3907000	is that something you'd be into you might want to watch
3907000	3909000	check it out because here's the thing
3909000	3911000	we should do something like that
3911000	3913000	for a podcast
3913000	3915000	I'm going to tell you the moment
3915000	3917000	I knew I needed to do this and bring this back
3917000	3919000	because it was last week it was 7 days ago
3919000	3921000	do you know when?
3921000	3923000	when I brought up the game Star Tropics
3923000	3925000	and so many of you were like
3925000	3927000	never played it
3927000	3929000	I don't know much about it
3929000	3931000	I was like oh we got to fix this
3931000	3933000	so
3933000	3935000	you can blame Star Tropics for all of this
3935000	3937000	so alright
3937000	3939000	oh we got some good comments in chat
3939000	3941000	thank you guys I swear I wasn't fishing for compliments
3941000	3943000	I swear alright
3943000	3945000	but I think I will fish over to the
3945000	3947000	other studio we're going to do a little break tonight
3947000	3949000	I did a few minutes
3949000	3951000	of a play of
3951000	3953000	Crypt of the NecroDancer
3953000	3955000	which ties in a little bit more maybe to last week's news
3955000	3957000	but you're still all talking about it this week
3957000	3959000	it's that Zelda game
3959000	3961000	the Cadence of Hyrule
3961000	3963000	that is basically this but with the Zelda skin
3963000	3965000	but then I found a lot of you guys
3965000	3967000	because maybe you don't follow music games so much
3967000	3969000	maybe you don't know what Crypt of the NecroDancer is
3969000	3971000	but you really want to play
3971000	3973000	this new Cadence of Hyrule
3973000	3975000	so I thought let's take a look so now we can all
3975000	3977000	know what is
3977000	3979000	Crypt of the NecroDancer
3979000	3981000	okay
3981000	3983000	hello everybody it's Rob in the
3983000	3985000	other room the other studio
3985000	3987000	and I thought for our break tonight we could take a look at
3987000	3989000	this game now it's a little bit older
3989000	3991000	but a lot of people are still talking
3991000	3993000	about it this week
3993000	3995000	or these past couple weeks ever since that Nindies Direct
3995000	3997000	the game we're looking at today is called
3997000	3999000	Crypt of the NecroDancer
3999000	4001000	like I mentioned it is a little bit older but you know
4001000	4003000	just a couple years old
4003000	4005000	and today I'm looking at it on Steam
4005000	4007000	but I know I've played this game quite a bit on the Playstation 4
4007000	4009000	it might have been one of those PS Plus games
4009000	4011000	at one point I can't remember
4011000	4013000	I know it's also on the Switch which is probably
4013000	4015000	part of the reason why it's in the Nindies collection
4015000	4017000	and it's on Xbox One
4017000	4019000	it's pretty much
4019000	4021000	if it plays games this game was
4021000	4023000	probably ported to it at some point
4023000	4025000	and since Orange Launch Radio
4025000	4027000	is rooted in music
4027000	4029000	based games such as
4029000	4031000	DDR and the community where we really got
4031000	4033000	our start there was obviously a lot
4033000	4035000	that was very appealing about Crypt of the NecroDancer
4035000	4037000	being that it was like oh it's a roguelike
4037000	4039000	but it's also kind of a music
4039000	4041000	game little twist to it
4041000	4043000	so I thought we'd take a look at it because
4043000	4045000	with the Nindies announcement
4045000	4047000	in the past couple weeks
4047000	4049000	that Cadence of Hyrule
4049000	4051000	is on it's way out which is basically
4051000	4053000	at least as far as you can tell
4053000	4055000	this game but with the Zelda skin
4055000	4057000	I find there's a lot of people that don't
4057000	4059000	necessarily know a lot about this game
4059000	4061000	but are suddenly interested
4061000	4063000	because of the Zelda tie in
4063000	4065000	maybe I don't play a lot of music games
4065000	4067000	but I'm going to play every Zelda game so I'm going to play that
4067000	4069000	I prefer to use my keyboard in this game
4069000	4071000	so you might hear a little bit of clacking because I do use
4071000	4073000	a mechanical keyboard
4073000	4075000	but in this area you can move around
4075000	4077000	you'll notice there's no I'm just moving around
4077000	4079000	however I want I'm not tied down
4079000	4081000	to the music or what have you
4081000	4083000	so you're kind of free to do what you want to do in these modes
4083000	4085000	but this is kind of like your central hub
4085000	4087000	where you can go buy permanent upgrades
4087000	4089000	which is very typical of a roguelike
4089000	4091000	it's funny because the design
4091000	4093000	of this game actually kind of looks like
4093000	4095000	the old game Rogue
4095000	4097000	which is where that term roguelike comes from
4097000	4099000	if you've never seen it from way
4099000	4101000	way back in the day
4101000	4103000	it was a randomly generated dungeon
4103000	4105000	that kind of looked like this a little bit
4105000	4107000	so you can see in this hub there's
4107000	4109000	various things you can do
4109000	4111000	there's training modes you can do
4111000	4113000	permanent upgrades, you can take away
4113000	4115000	upgrades that maybe would be useful and so forth
4115000	4117000	you'll notice that the game will allow you to
4117000	4119000	play with a dance pad if you want
4119000	4121000	I guess it's a little more forgiving
4121000	4123000	there's a tutorial as well if you forget what to do
4123000	4125000	there's a bunch of other characters you can play as as well
4125000	4127000	although again since I've made a little more progress
4127000	4129000	on PS4 than I did on Steam
4129000	4131000	I don't really have a lot that I can play
4131000	4133000	with right now so we'll just go ahead and
4133000	4135000	keep Cadence which is
4135000	4137000	what I'm going to keep right now
4137000	4139000	although it may change like I believe if I
4139000	4141000	pick one of these other characters
4141000	4143000	yeah it may be like the bard
4143000	4145000	no beats, you can move at any time
4145000	4147000	and enemies can move after you
4147000	4149000	so this is like the Bobby Black Wolf mode
4149000	4151000	and if you're bad at music games
4151000	4153000	you have to slow it down a little bit
4153000	4155000	so you don't have to worry about hitting everything on the beat
4155000	4157000	so that might be helpful for some people
4157000	4159000	oops I didn't actually want to switch to him
4159000	4161000	I'm okay with a little bit of a challenge
4161000	4163000	because without challenge I won't screw up
4163000	4165000	so anyway I've been gabbing for a few minutes
4165000	4167000	let me actually show the game
4167000	4169000	so we're going to go into zone one
4169000	4171000	and you'll notice there's that little meter at the bottom
4171000	4173000	and you have to move in tight because if I don't move
4173000	4175000	see I get all these missed, beat skit
4175000	4177000	I get little deductions
4177000	4179000	my coin streak might break
4179000	4181000	or other types of deductions
4185000	4187000	so I just picked up a whip that's going to let me
4187000	4189000	have a wider attack and that's good
4189000	4191000	that'll allow me to kill those enemies
4191000	4193000	a little easier
4193000	4195000	because you'll notice they kind of move like you do
4201000	4203000	so I'm kind of strategically
4203000	4205000	I notice the length
4205000	4207000	with the whip allows me to hit these
4207000	4209000	little monsters
4209000	4211000	that's what happens when I try to talk and play
4211000	4213000	I skipped a beat
4213000	4215000	I like that the shopkeeper sings
4215000	4217000	so if I had like one more coin
4217000	4219000	I could get an empty heart container
4219000	4221000	but I'm one coin short
4221000	4223000	unfortunately
4225000	4227000	now I believe I have until the length
4227000	4229000	of the song
4229000	4231000	to get through this level
4231000	4233000	or there's like bad penalties or something
4233000	4235000	so there's the little gem
4235000	4237000	and gems are the things you can use
4237000	4239000	to buy those permanent upgrades
4239000	4241000	I don't remember what the bomb switch does
4241000	4243000	it's probably not good, but let's see
4243000	4245000	oh
4245000	4247000	now
4247000	4249000	it kind of made a little dent in the wall
4249000	4251000	and you can't, what's the barrel do?
4251000	4253000	oh
4253000	4255000	so if you get certain items
4255000	4257000	you can try to
4257000	4259000	yeah, I lost my multiplier because I ran into a wall
4259000	4261000	but you can dig through the wall
4261000	4263000	with certain items
4263000	4265000	and you might find like secret rooms
4269000	4271000	so there's a treasure chest, okay vision radius
4271000	4273000	that would be helpful in trying to maybe locate
4273000	4275000	hidden rooms
4275000	4277000	this dragon looks very scary
4277000	4279000	I died
4279000	4281000	because I didn't have enough health to take on
4281000	4283000	that dragon, that was a lot of monsters
4283000	4285000	in that room, yikes
4285000	4287000	so and then it gives you a little
4287000	4289000	recap, I got 46 coins but
4289000	4291000	lol you died
4291000	4293000	so I got to go back to start
4293000	4295000	and the whole process begins again
4295000	4297000	but because I picked up that one gem
4297000	4299000	I don't know if one will be enough
4299000	4301000	to get these permanent upgrades
4301000	4303000	like I could get a permanent heart container
4303000	4305000	if I had two gems
4305000	4307000	but I don't, I only got the one because I did kind of crappy
4307000	4309000	I ran into a hard boss though
4309000	4311000	yeah there's nothing
4311000	4313000	available for one gem there
4313000	4315000	and let's see
4315000	4317000	so riches I could buy for one gem
4317000	4319000	sure why not
4319000	4321000	so that'll be something that will now show up in chests
4321000	4323000	when I do another run through
4323000	4325000	as is again kind of typical
4325000	4327000	of where the roguelikes
4327000	4329000	are at these days is that
4329000	4331000	you play a lot of random generated
4331000	4333000	you know if you play things like rogue legacy
4333000	4335000	or other popular roguelikes
4335000	4337000	you kind of go through the same type of
4337000	4339000	random generated thing over and over again
4339000	4341000	but the only way you really start to really make progress
4341000	4343000	with that is that you're buying these
4343000	4345000	permanent upgrades that therefore help you
4345000	4347000	and in the case of Crypt of the Necrodancer
4347000	4349000	you even have degrades
4349000	4351000	that will take things out of chests
4351000	4353000	where maybe it makes it
4353000	4355000	so you have a higher chance of getting something you really want
4355000	4357000	because chests could have really anything in them
4357000	4359000	so let's see if I can do a little better
4359000	4361000	maybe one more time
4361000	4363000	try to get moving a little sooner here
4363000	4365000	a little less talking
4365000	4367000	now again I'm not going to have those same items in force
4367000	4369000	I don't have that whip
4369000	4371000	so I'm trapping monsters in this hallway
4371000	4373000	to try to get
4373000	4375000	I hit two keys at the same time
4377000	4379000	at least I got a gem
4383000	4385000	yeah these things are making quick work of me
4385000	4387000	instead of trying to run face first into them
4387000	4389000	you really want to strategically attack them
4389000	4391000	from angles and stuff
4393000	4395000	like I just did with that guy
4395000	4397000	like I just did with that guy
4401000	4403000	okay so now I got that vision radius item again
4405000	4407000	this must be a shop
4407000	4409000	I have an apple
4409000	4411000	for health maybe
4411000	4413000	sure I'll take it, I need that
4419000	4421000	and you'll notice that you use
4421000	4423000	different combinations
4423000	4425000	of keystrokes to use items
4431000	4433000	yikes that was almost a bad situation
4439000	4441000	oh wait no I want that
4441000	4443000	that says something about low health
4447000	4449000	yeah something's screaming down here
4449000	4451000	oh it's this gold bat
4453000	4455000	now what else is interesting about this game
4455000	4457000	is that they actually added it to Steam Workshop
4457000	4459000	so if you actually look on Steam Workshop
4459000	4461000	there's already
4461000	4463000	like Zelda type mods
4463000	4465000	available for it
4465000	4467000	like obviously people have skinned in
4467000	4469000	some of their Nintendo favorites
4469000	4471000	already into this game
4471000	4473000	and I did it
4473000	4475000	I got to floor two
4475000	4477000	so now we get a different song that we can dance to
4477000	4485000	I'm sure some of you watching out there are far better than I am at this game
4485000	4489000	but again we're just trying to help those who maybe haven't seen this before get a look
4489000	4491000	so now I'm up to two gems
4491000	4493000	so it's much more
4493000	4495000	what the hell is that thing
4495000	4499000	much more likely to be able to buy something in the lobby
4499000	4501000	when I inevitably die in this one
4501000	4503000	let's see
4503000	4507000	oh that guy was kind of caught on that spring and kept moving up
4507000	4509000	turn out the lights I don't want to do that
4515000	4517000	hopefully the soundtrack is coming through pretty good
4517000	4519000	I know a lot of people are
4519000	4521000	pretty into the soundtrack in this game
4521000	4523000	and I think they do crossovers
4523000	4525000	oh boo I couldn't kill that thing
4525000	4527000	it must be one of those things where
4527000	4529000	it's like a boo
4529000	4533000	oh I'm stuck this way now
4533000	4535000	those arrows are kind of
4539000	4541000	oh boo
4541000	4543000	I lost my coin multiplier because I needed a key that I didn't have
4547000	4549000	so yeah if you can imagine this
4549000	4553000	but like to dance these Zelda songs and stuff
4553000	4555000	that's probably going to be
4555000	4557000	uh oh there's that dragon that got me last time
4557000	4559000	ah much better that time
4559000	4561000	see I just had to get him to follow me a little bit
4561000	4563000	that's all there was to it
4563000	4565000	alright well that's all there is
4565000	4567000	to this little look here at
4567000	4569000	Crypt of the NecroDancer for tonight
4569000	4571000	we've been going for about ten minutes
4571000	4573000	I want to throw it back to the studio
4573000	4575000	but there you go a little look at what that game is all about
4575000	4577000	if you haven't played it again
4577000	4579000	it's available on a lot of different platforms
4579000	4581000	you can check out the sweet soundtrack
4581000	4583000	which incorporates popular songs from other franchises as well
4583000	4585000	I don't remember if I had said that
4585000	4587000	you can see even in this menu
4587000	4589000	there's a way you can play mods
4589000	4591000	make your own mods and so forth
4591000	4593000	especially on Steam and the platforms that support it
4593000	4595000	there's all sorts of ways you can tweak this game
4595000	4597000	and get a real sneak preview
4597000	4599000	of what Cadence of Hyrule might look like
4599000	4601000	but in the meantime I know I'm looking forward to Cadence of Hyrule
4601000	4603000	and I'm sure many of you are as well
4603000	4605000	so there you go
4605000	4607000	a little look at Crypt of the NecroDancer
4607000	4609000	we're going to go back to the studio live
4615000	4617000	thank you me for that
4617000	4619000	a little look at Crypt of the NecroDancer
4619000	4621000	Dark Soccer I saw you kind of looking at the game
4621000	4623000	had you played that game before at all?
4623000	4625000	or is that kind of the person you saw?
4625000	4627000	I haven't played it
4627000	4629000	I tried it a little bit
4629000	4631000	I just wasn't too interested in it
4631000	4633000	it's fun but I understand the whole roguelike element
4633000	4635000	and the random levels sometimes is not
4635000	4637000	and I was really surprised with how little I could remember
4637000	4639000	of that game
4639000	4641000	even though I played it pretty heavy a year or two ago
4641000	4643000	but when I was fighting that dragon
4643000	4645000	I was like oh crap I forget how you have to fight
4645000	4647000	some of these monsters
4647000	4649000	you kind of have to remember how to do that
4649000	4651000	but I think it's such a strong indie title
4651000	4653000	but it's also funny watching back the video
4653000	4655000	because I didn't realize how loud the clacking was
4655000	4657000	I knew that would happen
4657000	4659000	which is why I said in the video you're going to hear me typing
4659000	4661000	which is good for the podcast
4661000	4663000	because you can hear me clicking in time with the music
4663000	4665000	or not
4665000	4667000	but it was just kind of funny the way that all turned out
4667000	4669000	so there you go
4669000	4671000	as a reminder we're looking for more of our folks out there
4671000	4673000	to submit some breaks for us
4673000	4675000	or folks in studio
4675000	4677000	possibly to do that too
4677000	4679000	but man PAX East
4679000	4681000	to be in this weekend was a great opportunity
4681000	4683000	I was hoping to see some video from PAX East
4683000	4685000	but I understand y'all were having a time
4685000	4687000	at PAX East so it's all good
4687000	4689000	but if you are interested in creating a segment
4689000	4691000	here for Orange Lounge Radio
4691000	4693000	you can just reach out to us on Twitter
4693000	4695000	or myself personally
4695000	4697000	I don't care at MrRobRoberts
4697000	4699000	that's MrRobRoberts over on Twitter
4699000	4701000	there's a million ways to find us
4701000	4703000	it's very easy
4703000	4705000	just send me an email
4705000	4707000	robertvognetwork.com
4707000	4709000	and that's fine too
4709000	4711000	let's get back into some more gaming news
4711000	4713000	actually quickly before we do that
4713000	4715000	I remember Jamie
4715000	4717000	you kind of wanted to make this a regular thing
4717000	4719000	where at this point of the show you do a podcast shoutout
4719000	4721000	because we want to help our frenzies
4721000	4723000	and things that do podcasts
4723000	4725000	I've been putting out for suggestions and haven't really gotten many
4725000	4727000	I'm going to save anything that I get
4727000	4729000	for next week
4729000	4731000	but in this one I normally like to do the independent ones
4731000	4733000	but this is one that has been a mainstay
4733000	4735000	of my favorites for quite some time
4735000	4737000	from when they were vaguely independent
4737000	4739000	on into corporate sponsorship
4739000	4741000	and whatnot
4741000	4743000	but it's called Stuff You Missed in History class
4743000	4745000	it's by How Stuff Works
4745000	4747000	and I love these podcasts
4747000	4749000	they basically take
4749000	4751000	different events or people
4751000	4753000	or different things in history
4753000	4755000	compile from different sources
4755000	4757000	and try to give a very clear
4757000	4759000	my favorite ones are the ones where they do
4759000	4761000	unexplained events
4761000	4763000	or things
4763000	4765000	like the Lizzie Borden trial
4765000	4767000	where she was considered innocent
4767000	4769000	but people set all these different accounts
4769000	4771000	and they try to put the accounts together to see
4771000	4773000	what is the real outcome
4773000	4775000	I'm right now listening to one about Charles Adams
4775000	4777000	of the Adams family
4777000	4779000	I did not know he was such a playboy
4779000	4781000	and had two wives
4781000	4783000	named Barbara
4783000	4785000	our discord posted a movie poster
4785000	4787000	I guess they're doing a new Adams family movie
4787000	4789000	but it's animated this time
4789000	4791000	needs more Debbie Jelinski
4791000	4793000	that's all I'm saying
4793000	4795000	but she officially died
4795000	4797000	bring her back
4797000	4799000	we didn't see a severed head
4799000	4801000	at any rate
4801000	4803000	Stuff You Missed in History class
4803000	4805000	definitely worthwhile
4805000	4807000	not just if you love history
4807000	4809000	but learn something
4809000	4811000	it's a really really good podcast
4811000	4813000	and I love listening to
4813000	4815000	the two ladies who are on it
4815000	4817000	so they're a lot of fun
4817000	4819000	speaking of podcasts
4819000	4821000	you should be listening to, just a reminder that VOG Network
4821000	4823000	is more than what we do here on Twitch
4823000	4825000	we have some great audio only podcasts
4825000	4827000	that we work with
4827000	4829000	you can look up more information over at vognetwork.com
4829000	4831000	and one I would particularly give a shout out to tonight
4831000	4833000	would be Electric Sistahood
4833000	4835000	just because I know they are in
4835000	4837000	Boston
4837000	4839000	and go, I saw pictures of
4839000	4841000	my sister all over Twitter this weekend
4841000	4843000	so I know they go
4843000	4845000	since they're based in the Boston area
4845000	4847000	they go to PAX East
4847000	4849000	that's like their home convention
4849000	4851000	so I will be tuning in
4851000	4853000	since nobody sent me a video tonight
4853000	4855000	I will be tuning into Electric Sistahood
4855000	4857000	for the wrap up this weekend
4857000	4859000	we did a podcast with them at PAX East once
4859000	4861000	many moons ago
4861000	4863000	so yeah, good times
4863000	4865000	and then since I'll add to that
4865000	4867000	I haven't listened to them in a while
4867000	4869000	I have trouble concentrating at work
4869000	4871000	when I'm listening to a long podcast
4871000	4873000	or I shouldn't say concentrating at work
4873000	4875000	concentrating on the podcast
4875000	4877000	when I listen to a long podcast at work
4877000	4879000	but the debug log is another good one
4879000	4881000	they're a group of indie developers
4881000	4883000	out in the Atlanta area
4883000	4885000	who work in Unity
4885000	4887000	and they talk about Unity and game development stuff
4887000	4889000	all the time and they have people on their show
4889000	4891000	talking about different game development principles
4891000	4893000	and all sorts of topics
4893000	4895000	so go check them out
4895000	4897000	wow, we all had a little plug tonight
4897000	4899000	I like that, I want to make this a regular thing
4899000	4901000	spreading the love a little bit, good times
4901000	4903000	alright well, let's spread around some more news
4903000	4905000	but the rapid fire kind
4905000	4907000	and there was a lot, honestly a lot of this stuff
4907000	4909000	we probably could have spent a good 10 minutes talking about
4909000	4911000	but there's a lot of news this week
4911000	4913000	but it is what it is, let's rapid fire these next few stores
4913000	4915000	so here's your games
4915000	4917000	the gold lineup for April
4917000	4919000	you've got on Xbox One
4919000	4921000	the Technomancer
4921000	4923000	and that's going to be coming out April 1st to the 30th
4923000	4925000	and then of course
4925000	4927000	Outcast's second contact is going to be
4927000	4929000	16th through May 15th
4929000	4931000	and then your Xbox 360
4931000	4933000	compatible games, you're going to have
4933000	4935000	Star Wars Battlefront 2, the original one
4935000	4937000	that's April 1st through the 15th
4937000	4939000	and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced
4939000	4941000	Warfighter 2 on April 16th
4941000	4943000	through the 30th
4943000	4945000	and then on the Playstation side of the house
4945000	4947000	of course this month it's a little bit lighter
4947000	4949000	because, you know, they got rid of all those other systems
4949000	4951000	so now you have Conan Exiles
4951000	4953000	and The Surge
4953000	4955000	and one of those has a penis slider
4955000	4957000	I'll let you guess which one
4957000	4959000	it's Conan
4961000	4963000	thank you
4963000	4965000	for letting us know
4965000	4967000	thank you for keeping us informed
4967000	4969000	and then of course
4969000	4971000	Risk of Rain 2 is something that they talked about
4971000	4973000	during the whole Gearbox presentation
4973000	4975000	and Risk of Rain
4975000	4977000	was a 2D roguelike
4977000	4979000	Risk of Rain 2 is 3D
4979000	4981000	and what's kind of cool about this is
4981000	4983000	it's in early access right now
4983000	4985000	you can actually purchase a copy
4985000	4987000	but apparently
4987000	4989000	well this is a little old now
4989000	4991000	if you had purchased a copy before March 30th
4991000	4993000	you actually got a free copy to give to a friend
4993000	4995000	but it still looks like it's a pretty decent game
4995000	4997000	so go check it out
4997000	4999000	I did not pick up a copy
4999000	5001000	so I don't have a copy to give to anyone
5001000	5003000	maybe
5003000	5005000	maybe in a future time
5005000	5007000	maybe
5007000	5009000	I may have the original game
5009000	5011000	but I still haven't
5011000	5013000	I'm surprised I haven't played it
5013000	5015000	well I wouldn't give away my copy of this game
5015000	5017000	because I like this game an awful lot
5017000	5019000	it's Minecraft and Minecraft made an update this week
5019000	5021000	unfortunately it was not the 4K update
5021000	5023000	that I was looking forward to
5023000	5025000	but Minecraft actually removed
5025000	5027000	Notch who originally created Minecraft
5027000	5029000	they removed him from the
5029000	5031000	game's splash screens
5031000	5033000	now one could infer that this may have to do with
5033000	5035000	some of the things
5035000	5037000	he says on Twitter
5037000	5039000	I blocked him because quite frankly
5039000	5041000	I don't give a shit what he has to say
5041000	5043000	and that's my personal opinion
5043000	5045000	but I don't know
5045000	5047000	they're not saying, obviously
5047000	5049000	Microsoft is not saying what
5049000	5051000	if it has to do with the guy specifically
5051000	5053000	or what it is
5053000	5055000	I think it's probably just more the fact that
5055000	5057000	the game has evolved so much
5057000	5059000	since he sold this off to Microsoft
5059000	5061000	yeah he hasn't really been working on it
5061000	5063000	it ain't his game anymore
5063000	5065000	it's now this Minecraft team
5065000	5067000	at Microsoft that makes this game
5067000	5069000	so the time was probably right
5069000	5071000	I do believe he is still credited
5071000	5073000	like
5073000	5075000	I think in the
5075000	5077000	actual credits
5077000	5079000	it used to say on the title screen
5079000	5081000	like it would rotate
5081000	5083000	there's like a carousel of things
5083000	5085000	kind of like our little ticker on Twitch
5085000	5087000	there's carousels and sometimes you're gonna see it says
5087000	5089000	follow Rob Roberts on Twitter
5089000	5091000	or follow DarkSakura on Twitch
5091000	5093000	you'll see those things
5093000	5095000	well it's kind of like if one of those said
5095000	5097000	well that would never happen here
5097000	5099000	but if it said created by such and such
5099000	5101000	and said person wasn't here anymore
5101000	5103000	it's like they took that out
5103000	5105000	so you don't even see it show up on the carousel anymore
5105000	5107000	so that was the update they did
5107000	5109000	that being said, where is my 4K graphics pack?
5109000	5111000	yes I want 4K graphics in Minecraft
5111000	5113000	well I got news for you, Notch is working on it
5113000	5115000	but now he's not
5115000	5117000	he wasn't doing shit with that
5117000	5119000	that was all Microsoft's thing
5119000	5121000	I think that was a concept thing that really wasn't meant to go
5121000	5123000	much further than that
5123000	5125000	where is
5125000	5127000	where's my Ouya Minecraft
5127000	5129000	that I was promised
5129000	5131000	when the Ouya came out
5131000	5133000	was that really supposed to be a thing?
5133000	5135000	it was on their screenshot
5135000	5137000	it wasn't necessarily something that they may have had
5137000	5139000	permission or saying
5139000	5141000	this wasn't actually coming to the system
5141000	5143000	here's an example of games
5143000	5145000	you might see on the platform
5145000	5147000	one of which is never really coming there
5147000	5149000	anyway
5149000	5151000	I thought that was more appropriate for rapid fire news
5151000	5153000	because one of those things where it's like, okay
5153000	5155000	they did a thing, but whatever
5155000	5157000	it doesn't really affect the game
5157000	5159000	anyway, this is a big effect for the game
5159000	5161000	and hopefully will be fixed by the time the game comes out
5161000	5163000	505 Games commenting on the Bloodstained
5163000	5165000	Ritual of the Night demo that they showed on the Switch
5165000	5167000	at PAX East
5167000	5169000	apparently wasn't running great
5169000	5171000	it was a little choppy
5171000	5173000	and unpolished
5173000	5175000	505 Games did kind of comment on this
5175000	5177000	to basically say there's still optimization
5177000	5179000	to be done
5179000	5181000	the build that was at the show is a long way from being done
5181000	5183000	the final product should run more like
5183000	5185000	the PC
5185000	5187000	which is like the
5187000	5189000	base one that all the others made
5189000	5191000	was the PC version running well?
5191000	5193000	I wasn't there
5193000	5195000	so I couldn't tell you
5195000	5197000	why would you bring a demo for something that doesn't work?
5197000	5199000	that's kind of where I'm at
5199000	5201000	why did they bother to show it on the Switch then
5201000	5203000	if it wasn't really working right?
5203000	5205000	and if people ask about the Switch
5205000	5207000	say, oh yeah we're working on it
5207000	5209000	it's coming out to the Switch too
5209000	5211000	we didn't have a version available to show you at the show today
5211000	5213000	but whatever
5213000	5215000	they made a choice
5215000	5217000	at the same time, if they hadn't shown it
5217000	5219000	then there would have been these other questions
5219000	5221000	no, there wouldn't have been any other questions
5221000	5223000	I'm sorry, we don't have the Switch version available
5223000	5225000	to show you at the moment
5225000	5227000	it still needs some more
5227000	5229000	enhancements
5229000	5231000	it's unpolished and not ready for the show
5231000	5233000	it'll be ready to go by the release date
5233000	5235000	I don't know
5235000	5237000	anyway, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night is coming
5237000	5239000	to the Switch this summer
5239000	5241000	it's also coming for PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4
5241000	5243000	pretty much everywhere you can play a game
5243000	5245000	this game will be available
5245000	5247000	moving on to Dark Sakura
5247000	5249000	well,
5249000	5251000	Dead by Daylight is getting
5251000	5253000	another character
5253000	5255000	it's going to be Ash from Evil Dead
5255000	5257000	yay!
5257000	5259000	Bruce Campbell probably needed
5259000	5261000	to buy a new roof or something
5261000	5263000	please, let him deliver the line
5263000	5265000	this is my boomstick
5265000	5267000	well, I remembered
5267000	5269000	having seen him when I went to go see
5269000	5271000	the man with the screaming brain at the Crest
5271000	5273000	and he talks about how different
5273000	5275000	roles are like, what he has to pay for something
5275000	5277000	I was like, I wonder if this one's going to be
5277000	5279000	pay for his roof or a car or something
5279000	5281000	well if you watch the little announcement trailer
5281000	5283000	that was kind of the whole point of it
5283000	5285000	he made his announcement and was like, okay
5285000	5287000	who's got my money?
5287000	5289000	but at any rate, that's going to be
5289000	5291000	on April 2nd
5291000	5293000	so just in a couple of days
5293000	5295000	no fooling
5295000	5297000	no one's guessed what the joke is
5297000	5299000	so
5299000	5301000	guess what the joke is
5301000	5303000	and then this is the news that made me happy
5303000	5305000	that I alluded to it in my
5305000	5307000	what I've been playing
5307000	5309000	Steve Ritchie
5309000	5311000	really cool guy, going very very deaf
5311000	5313000	he is
5313000	5315000	a game designer responsible
5315000	5317000	for such classics as Black Knight
5317000	5319000	and Black Knight 2000 and
5319000	5321000	Star Wars Pinball, he's doing a lot of stuff for Stern
5321000	5323000	right now
5323000	5325000	well, we remember
5325000	5327000	hearing that he was
5327000	5329000	told he finally gets to work on his dream game
5329000	5331000	that dream game
5331000	5333000	and Dan and I were like, oh it's another Black Knight, it's another Black Knight
5333000	5335000	turns out, it's another Black Knight
5335000	5337000	so Black Knight Sword of
5337000	5339000	Rage is the new one
5339000	5341000	there is a
5341000	5343000	there's actually even a teaser up
5343000	5345000	some gameplay that's up
5345000	5347000	and then there are
5347000	5349000	going to be two versions of it
5349000	5351000	there's the pro edition which has just
5351000	5353000	one play field
5353000	5355000	and then the premium
5355000	5357000	which is the one that we're going to be getting
5357000	5359000	that's why we're selling off other pins
5359000	5361000	that has the upper level play field that
5361000	5363000	harkens back to Black Knight 2000 and Black Knight
5363000	5365000	sounds fun
5365000	5367000	I wonder if he's still doing the Black Knight voice
5367000	5369000	but the thing that I like is it's even got the spinner
5369000	5371000	from the Black Knight 2000
5371000	5373000	the color scheme is the same, it's got the
5373000	5375000	Black Knight in the middle of it and we're just so
5375000	5377000	excited about this
5377000	5379000	this is going to be one of the first tables
5379000	5381000	that we're really going to buy completely
5381000	5383000	brand new
5383000	5385000	it's like buying a small car
5385000	5387000	in some ways
5387000	5389000	the one that we're getting is going to be
5389000	5391000	67,000
5391000	5393000	we're probably buying ours at
5393000	5395000	6700
5395000	5397000	oh my god, 67,000
5397000	5399000	for a fucking machine
5399000	5401000	6700 is appropriate
5401000	5403000	I think he said the pro is like 52
5403000	5405000	or 55
5405000	5407000	and then the premium
5407000	5409000	is going to be like 67
5409000	5411000	and that's buying it at the show
5411000	5413000	so we're going to be
5413000	5415000	probably picking ours up at California Extreme
5415000	5417000	we may not have the money to get it
5417000	5419000	by, not Pinagogo
5419000	5421000	it's not called that anymore, Pinagogo is a different
5421000	5423000	thing now, Golden State
5423000	5425000	because they moved it from Dixon to Lodi
5425000	5427000	yeah, it's still the same
5427000	5429000	it's the same one as the old Pinagogo
5429000	5431000	but now it's Golden State Pinball Expo
5431000	5433000	in Lodi, the grape center, whatever, wine
5433000	5435000	thing, which I went last year
5435000	5437000	after DragCon, it was super fun
5437000	5439000	but
5439000	5441000	the, god, words
5441000	5443000	but anyway
5443000	5445000	Stern is going to be selling
5445000	5447000	there and at California
5447000	5449000	Extreme at the big pinball event
5449000	5451000	so we're probably getting ours at California Extreme
5451000	5453000	remind me, I need to talk to you about something
5453000	5455000	with California Extreme off air
5455000	5457000	just remind me, because I'll forget
5457000	5459000	alright, we're all going, right?
5459000	5461000	that's the plan, but I've got to ask you something
5461000	5463000	about that
5463000	5465000	anyway, yes, I am conducting
5465000	5467000	personal business on the show, deal with it
5467000	5469000	anyway, give me your money
5469000	5471000	but I'm looking forward to playing this machine
5471000	5473000	and hopefully Dark Soccer will let us bring the camera
5473000	5475000	over, maybe we can do a little midpoint break
5475000	5477000	and showcase the machine, that'll be fun, well once I have it
5477000	5479000	sure, once you have it, well I think we should do that for some of the other machines
5479000	5481000	you have today actually, well I've got Ghostbusters right now
5481000	5483000	or the ones you're about to get rid of
5483000	5485000	well that would be Monopoly
5485000	5487000	you know what's funny is that we always call it
5487000	5489000	Monopoly, because of the master system
5489000	5491000	misprint of Monopoly
5491000	5493000	was Monospace Poly, we've got one of those
5493000	5495000	like right now in the house
5495000	5497000	is Monopoly World Cup
5497000	5499000	Ghostbusters in the dining room
5499000	5501000	and then we have the Medieval Madness
5501000	5503000	hello!
5503000	5505000	we have the Medieval Madness reissue
5505000	5507000	Black Knight 2000 and
5507000	5509000	Theater of Magic, and then outside
5509000	5511000	we've got Judge Dredd
5511000	5513000	which I don't know why they like it, but they do
5513000	5515000	I have a creature from the Black Lagoon
5515000	5517000	Demolition Man, which we're going to be selling
5517000	5519000	The Shadow
5519000	5521000	and, and, and crap
5521000	5523000	they love pinball at your house
5523000	5525000	one other that I can't remember
5525000	5527000	it's fine, oh yeah
5527000	5529000	Twilight Zone, we've got our
5529000	5531000	Twilight Zone back, so
5531000	5533000	but you're Dr. Claw when you're thinking the pinball machines
5533000	5535000	is my favorite thing about this Twitch room
5535000	5537000	about me snapping?
5537000	5539000	the hand gestures that come through on Twitch
5539000	5541000	but this is Thing
5541000	5543000	it's Thing from the Addams Family, of course
5543000	5545000	alright, anyway
5545000	5547000	come on, moving on, let's travel around the world
5547000	5549000	and check out some releases, things that are coming out
5549000	5551000	a little sooner than this new Black Knight
5551000	5553000	machine, starting with the US, Loki
5553000	5555000	I'm afraid I don't have much
5555000	5557000	to announce, but we do
5557000	5559000	have one single game
5559000	5561000	which will be very
5561000	5563000	great news for my son
5563000	5565000	and that is Power Rangers Battle
5565000	5567000	for the Grid is coming to Playstation 4
5567000	5569000	it's a Power Rangers fighting game
5569000	5571000	that's it
5571000	5573000	yeah, it seems like it's a slow week
5573000	5575000	in Japan as well
5575000	5577000	I don't know if that's because golden weeks at the end of the month
5577000	5579000	or something, I don't know, but there's not
5579000	5581000	a lot happening in Japan right now
5581000	5583000	pretty light time, because everyone shoves that stuff
5583000	5585000	out for the end of the
5585000	5587000	financial year, and then it's just like
5587000	5589000	ah, that's true, the only big
5589000	5591000	release on April 11th, that's
5591000	5593000	next week, so I'll probably say this twice, but Earth Defense
5593000	5595000	Force Iron Rain is out in Japan on the way
5595000	5597000	I see that as well, so there is that
5597000	5599000	but then if I'm looking at the Switch, okay the Switch has some things
5599000	5601000	so on the Switch we have
5601000	5603000	Super Dragon Ball Heroes World Mission
5603000	5605000	the Taikan Sports Pack
5605000	5607000	Tennis, Bowling, Golf, and Billiards
5607000	5609000	and the variety game with
5609000	5611000	King Guiyo Suki, Card
5611000	5613000	Tsuji Puzzle, and Nika Kudori
5613000	5615000	these kind of sound like
5615000	5617000	like kind of shovelware, doesn't sound
5617000	5619000	like these are huge games, and that's
5619000	5621000	really, well the Dragon Ball
5621000	5623000	is a different story, but those other two sound like
5623000	5625000	they're kind of mini game collections, but there you go
5625000	5627000	that's what you got in Japan this week, how about the UK?
5627000	5629000	Anything exciting going on over there?
5629000	5631000	Just a few things
5631000	5633000	on the first
5633000	5635000	Darksiders War Mastered
5635000	5637000	Edition, and then on the
5637000	5639000	fourth YouTuber's Life OMG
5639000	5641000	and Super Dragon Ball Heroes
5641000	5643000	World Mission, Dragon Ball Heroes? Oh
5643000	5645000	I guess it's out on Switch
5645000	5647000	I always thought it was an arcade only thing
5647000	5649000	but Super Dragon Ball Heroes
5649000	5651000	World Mission is coming out
5651000	5653000	There were all the DS ones that came out in Japan
5653000	5655000	Well and it's the same thing
5655000	5657000	that was on the Japanese list too
5657000	5659000	Yeah, but I didn't think that
5659000	5661000	it ever had a European release, so maybe this is
5661000	5663000	Dragon Ball Heroes
5663000	5665000	is just kind of weird
5665000	5667000	because it's like you're two kids
5667000	5669000	who play in and get sucked into the
5669000	5671000	video game and they're part of that
5671000	5673000	they like become Saya-jin in the game
5673000	5675000	and have to do shit
5675000	5677000	It's kind of cool, but you buy like cards
5677000	5679000	for the arcade machine
5679000	5681000	and then it reads your characters on the cards
5681000	5683000	Fun, well I think Loki is
5683000	5685000	in the right ballpark though, I think this week in particular
5685000	5687000	is just slow because everybody
5687000	5689000	pushed for last week at the end of the fiscal year
5689000	5691000	so it's kind of like this is just a slow
5691000	5693000	period because of that
5693000	5695000	Alright, well moving on then
5695000	5697000	after world release dates
5697000	5699000	this is the part of the show where we would usually
5699000	5701000	get into the mail bag over at
5701000	5703000	participate at
5703000	5705000	orangelauntrader.com, although when I checked earlier today
5705000	5707000	it was empty, I don't know about now
5707000	5709000	Oh, there's one?
5709000	5711000	Yeah, there's one from today
5711000	5713000	Ok, then that's why I missed it, let's do it
5713000	5715000	Alright, this one comes from our
5715000	5717000	dear Ronchan
5717000	5719000	Evening everyone, great show last week
5719000	5721000	but I wanted to say a couple of things real quick
5721000	5723000	I don't have much hope
5723000	5725000	in Google Stadia, seeing how
5725000	5727000	it's going to rely more on software
5727000	5729000	than hardware. Honestly, if they
5729000	5731000	want Stadia to be a success, Google should
5731000	5733000	release a beefed up Chromecast
5733000	5735000	with more storage and memory and have that
5735000	5737000	as a dedicated streaming device to pair
5737000	5739000	with a controller. To me that makes the most
5739000	5741000	amount of sense, and I actually would second that
5741000	5743000	And then, ooh, to me about
5743000	5745000	what I said about Chrome
5747000	5749000	After the show I checked my task manager and saw
5749000	5751000	for myself with the many instances, but also
5751000	5753000	Firefox, Edge, and other web browsers do the same thing
5753000	5755000	And I
5755000	5757000	understand your views about how Google should
5757000	5759000	optimize Stadia for Safari, but Google
5759000	5761000	shouldn't have to because Chrome is their
5761000	5763000	browser of choice for obvious reasons
5764000	5766000	Yeah, they're going to want you to use Chrome
5766000	5768000	Perhaps once they have perfected how they want
5768000	5770000	Chrome to operate with Stadia, we could see
5770000	5772000	that same optimization on Safari
5772000	5774000	Seeing how Microsoft's new web browser
5774000	5776000	Edge is being redone with Chromium
5776000	5778000	and seeing how that's the majority
5778000	5780000	how that's the majority
5780000	5782000	browser being used, it could be a while
5782000	5784000	And that's all for now, I'm off to edit more con photos
5784000	5786000	and whatnot, stay awesome, I'll run that
5786000	5788000	You can still use Chrome on Apple products
5788000	5790000	It just doesn't run great
5790000	5792000	I use Chrome on my phone, and the reason why
5792000	5794000	it's in incognito mode
5794000	5796000	You have that on Safari
5796000	5798000	Oh, then they must have put that in there recently
5798000	5800000	It hasn't been new, it's been there forever
5800000	5802000	It's called private browsing
5802000	5804000	Because I use it all the time, because when I
5804000	5806000	look at, like, there's so many news sites
5806000	5808000	that, like, when you go, it's like, you've used up
5808000	5810000	your free articles this month
5810000	5812000	Going private browsing works fine
5812000	5814000	Well, it's been there since its inception
5814000	5816000	Oh, I don't remember
5816000	5818000	When you slide up your window, you'll get a new plus
5818000	5820000	for a private browser window
5820000	5822000	I'm used to Chrome anyway, it doesn't matter
5822000	5824000	Okay, so
5824000	5826000	Well, people are used to horse and buggies, but you see where we are now
5826000	5828000	You know what, alright
5828000	5830000	And Bobby Blackwell is saying you might want to reiterate
5830000	5832000	who Ronchon is
5832000	5834000	Rama! T.J. Rama S, he's my Ronchon
5834000	5836000	Our pal from the Anime Jam session
5836000	5838000	Maybe Bobby wants us to
5838000	5840000	work in the cheap plug for Anime Jam session
5840000	5842000	Hosted Tuesday nights here
5842000	5844000	Well, you can do that
5844000	5846000	You got it
5846000	5848000	Alright, anyway, so there you go
5848000	5850000	Yeah, Act Def says, well, there was an email
5850000	5852000	so no Drag Race talk, sadly, nope, we'll have to roll that over
5852000	5854000	Oh, girl!
5854000	5856000	I haven't watched this week anyway, so I'm not, well
5856000	5858000	I got, so, believe it or not
5858000	5860000	I've been trying to, and I didn't want to
5860000	5862000	talk a lot about this on the show until I was actually
5862000	5864000	making a habit of it, but I would say
5864000	5866000	since mid-March, Allen got us
5866000	5868000	gym memberships
5868000	5870000	And I've now been 12 times
5870000	5872000	So I would say I'm making it a habit
5872000	5874000	I haven't been good about every day
5874000	5876000	but I've been going almost every other day
5876000	5878000	So I'm trying, I'm trying to turn
5878000	5880000	this jigglypuff into some wigglytuff
5880000	5882000	That's just kind of, you know, I just want to
5882000	5884000	shape the dad bod a little more, that's all I want
5884000	5886000	And just in general, just be a little more active
5886000	5888000	I still was pretty
5888000	5890000	Do you remember that article about the guy who
5890000	5892000	went from like total twink to total bear?
5892000	5894000	Seriously
5894000	5896000	I'm not, I mean, I'm
5896000	5898000	40 and married, I'm not, you know
5898000	5900000	Sure, sure, I would like to, but I'm not
5900000	5902000	I'm not going to have a six-pack, and I'm totally fine with that
5902000	5904000	But exercise is good for your heart
5904000	5906000	Well, and also, I'm going to be on it
5906000	5908000	I'm going to keep it real, because I'm very real with you all
5908000	5910000	I watched
5910000	5912000	some of this show
5912000	5914000	on Twitch, and I
5914000	5916000	looked at myself and I said, that is
5916000	5918000	the biggest I've been in a very long time
5918000	5920000	I don't like it, I want to change it
5920000	5922000	And so, you know how you change it?
5922000	5924000	You do something about it
5924000	5926000	Exactly, change doesn't happen until you make it happen
5926000	5928000	So it's not just the
5928000	5930000	It's not just the
5930000	5932000	I just want to, you know, everybody views
5932000	5934000	You know, I'm just saying
5934000	5936000	If you are fine with your
5936000	5938000	figure and, you know, full size
5938000	5940000	That is fucking great
5940000	5942000	I'm just saying for me personally, because
5942000	5944000	wonderful people come in all shapes and sizes and colors
5944000	5946000	and formats and so forth
5946000	5948000	But I'm just saying for me, I looked at
5948000	5950000	this show
5950000	5952000	and I said, I'm capable
5952000	5954000	of better, you know, and especially
5954000	5956000	Well, don't you feel better?
5956000	5958000	It's been two weeks, give it, let's ask
5958000	5960000	me again in another month
5960000	5962000	You'll notice that just in general
5962000	5964000	you feel better, have more stamina
5964000	5966000	You know what I do feel better with is that I've also
5966000	5968000	in turn been trying to do more
5968000	5970000	Like I've been eating out at work a lot
5970000	5972000	Like I'll go to the taco place, I'll go to this place
5972000	5974000	I've really managed to
5974000	5976000	And you know what I finally did that kind of worked
5976000	5978000	Instead of forcing myself
5978000	5980000	to eat those diet meals
5980000	5982000	I eat, and I don't want to give them free advertising
5982000	5984000	But I eat a particular brand of meal
5984000	5986000	It's not like Hungry Man
5986000	5988000	But it's more like reasonable portion
5988000	5990000	meal, it's not diet
5990000	5992000	But it's 400 calories, 500 calories
5992000	5994000	I still feel like I'm actually eating something
5994000	5996000	As opposed to eating
5996000	5998000	you know, paper
5998000	6000000	Well I just like the whole fuck it thing
6000000	6002000	Which finally stuck in my head
6002000	6004000	I mean people call it mindful eating, I prefer the
6004000	6006000	fuck it diet
6006000	6008000	But for me it's like
6008000	6010000	If you actually are enjoying what you're eating
6010000	6012000	You may not feel like
6012000	6014000	you have to finish it
6014000	6016000	It'll be there, you can get it again
6016000	6018000	As long as you have reasonable
6018000	6020000	income, if you enjoy a food
6020000	6022000	You can eat it again and you don't have to finish it
6022000	6024000	So you know
6024000	6026000	And you guys have been very open
6026000	6028000	I'm really proud of you by the way, I'm proud of both of you guys
6028000	6030000	Again, save the kudos
6030000	6032000	for about 4 more weeks
6032000	6034000	I wasn't going to say anything until it was 21 days
6034000	6036000	Because it takes 21 days to become a habit
6036000	6038000	Save the kudos until I actually show some visible progress
6038000	6040000	But speaking of visible progress
6040000	6042000	You guys would know that Loki
6042000	6044000	was a bigger guy, a little bit
6044000	6046000	You were never like big
6046000	6048000	You know, you had a little more fluff
6048000	6050000	like me, but you guys wouldn't know it
6050000	6052000	Loki has slimmed down quite a bit
6052000	6054000	So good for you
6054000	6056000	As of the last few months
6056000	6058000	Sometimes the wagon, sometimes the trains
6058000	6060000	get derailed
6060000	6062000	Even with my thing, I've been on a plateau
6062000	6064000	I was on a big plateau for a couple of months and then started losing again
6064000	6066000	And then my weight hasn't changed
6066000	6068000	But I went down a size
6068000	6070000	And you've been very open about
6070000	6072000	You went through a huge life change
6072000	6074000	And you're like, your feet aren't going to get any better
6074000	6076000	Your back's not going to get any better
6076000	6078000	Until this happens
6078000	6080000	And I was very close to pre-diabetic
6080000	6082000	So I was like, okay, fine, I'll do it
6082000	6084000	And I have no regrets
6084000	6086000	PoppyBlackWolf says, I'm still fat and happy
6086000	6088000	Great?
6088000	6090000	Awesome
6090000	6092000	And Bobby
6092000	6094000	has a great presence on Twitch too
6094000	6096000	So it works, great
6096000	6098000	And he says, fitness, whole pizza in my mouth
6098000	6100000	If you are
6100000	6102000	If you are happy being squishy, then be squishy
6102000	6104000	Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it
6104000	6106000	And also, you know what, just because I'm saying I'm doing these different things
6106000	6108000	You think I'm going to rob myself of pizza
6108000	6110000	When I go to Dragon Con
6110000	6112000	You better believe I'm going to eat what I want
6112000	6114000	Who said yes to free pizza at work yesterday?
6114000	6116000	This bitch
6116000	6118000	When I went to Vegas
6118000	6120000	You better believe I ordered exactly what I wanted
6120000	6122000	Because
6122000	6124000	You don't always get to eat at those
6124000	6126000	I don't want no goddamn salad
6126000	6128000	You know what though
6129000	6131000	There are a few things that I miss
6131000	6133000	I miss buffets
6133000	6135000	I don't
6135000	6137000	I can't eat enough to make a buffet worth it anymore
6137000	6139000	But I fucking miss ice cream
6139000	6141000	Like real ice cream
6141000	6143000	And pudding
6143000	6145000	I can't eat ice cream and pudding anymore
6145000	6147000	I haven't been able to eat ice cream since the surgery
6147000	6149000	Ten years ago when I had my gallbladder out
6149000	6151000	What about like fat-free?
6151000	6153000	I'm sorry, let me correct myself
6153000	6155000	I can eat it
6155000	6157000	But it's one of those foods that my insides
6157000	6159000	Don't
6159000	6161000	Do you feel like you're being punched from the inside?
6161000	6163000	A little bit
6163000	6165000	That's what I feel like
6165000	6167000	I don't want to say the name
6167000	6169000	The stuff that advertises itself is only
6169000	6171000	300 calories in a pint because it's less dairy
6171000	6173000	I eat that stuff
6173000	6175000	And I eat frozen yogurt all the time
6175000	6177000	Froyo is great
6177000	6179000	But you know what
6179000	6181000	Anyway
6181000	6183000	The quest one does to better oneself
6183000	6185000	There are sacrifices to make
6185000	6187000	And if you
6187000	6189000	Again, change doesn't happen
6189000	6191000	Until you make it happen
6191000	6193000	Once in a while I will eat
6193000	6195000	Ice cream but it's like
6195000	6197000	I went to Dairy Queen
6197000	6199000	And I'm fucking having a blizzard
6199000	6201000	I don't care about the repercussions
6201000	6203000	But that's like once every few months
6203000	6205000	It's not an everyday type of thing
6205000	6207000	Anyway
6207000	6209000	So I didn't mean to get on that whole tangent
6209000	6211000	I'm sorry, the whole point was
6211000	6213000	I was trying to say
6213000	6215000	I've
6215000	6217000	I watched half of this week's
6217000	6219000	Drag Race while on the elliptical
6219000	6221000	But I'm not through the whole
6221000	6223000	thing yet
6223000	6225000	So I can't talk about Drag Race
6225000	6227000	Because I don't know who got kicked off yet
6227000	6229000	But I have a pretty good guess
6229000	6231000	But anyway, until then
6231000	6233000	We will move on with more stories
6233000	6235000	Let's talk about some more news
6235000	6237000	Then we're going to open it up for your calls
6237000	6239000	If you want to derail the show with your topic
6239000	6241000	You sure can
6241000	6243000	And hang out in the green room
6243000	6245000	But it will be a little bit before we get there
6245000	6247000	Because we got some more stories for you
6247000	6249000	Starting with Loki
6249000	6251000	So now we're laying off some more people
6251000	6253000	And this time EA is doing the laying off
6253000	6255000	The laying off I think was about 4% of their workforce
6255000	6257000	Or 350 people in
6257000	6259000	marketing, publishing, and other areas
6259000	6261000	Basically
6261000	6263000	There was an email
6263000	6265000	That was sent out saying that
6265000	6267000	We have a vision
6267000	6269000	To be the world's greatest games
6270000	6272000	If we're honest with ourselves
6272000	6274000	We're not there right now
6274000	6276000	We have work to do with our games
6276000	6278000	Our player relationships and our business
6278000	6280000	Across the company teams are already
6280000	6282000	Taking action to ensure we are
6282000	6284000	Creating higher quality games
6284000	6286000	And live services reaching more platforms
6286000	6288000	With our content and subscriptions
6288000	6290000	Improving our Frostbite tools
6290000	6292000	Focusing our networks
6292000	6294000	And cloud gaming priorities
6294000	6296000	And closing the gap between us and the player communities
6296000	6298000	That says nothing about laying off the people
6298000	6300000	At all
6300000	6302000	So I'm not really sure
6302000	6304000	You know
6304000	6306000	What the case may be there
6306000	6308000	It seems like with a lot of these other companies
6308000	6310000	It's to kind of
6310000	6312000	Meet the expectations of their
6312000	6314000	Investors basically
6314000	6316000	You have a company that's
6316000	6318000	Made so much money
6318000	6320000	That how are you gonna
6320000	6322000	Top that the following
6322000	6324000	Year because you've pretty much capped out
6324000	6326000	All the people that are gonna be playing your games
6326000	6328000	And now how do you become more profitable
6328000	6330000	While you lay off
6330000	6332000	Some people to make your operating
6332000	6334000	Costs lower
6334000	6336000	I have a theory as to why this all happened
6336000	6338000	But
6338000	6340000	You wanna hear my theory?
6340000	6342000	Let's hear your theory
6342000	6344000	And here's the thing
6344000	6346000	A lot of people are jumping at this going
6346000	6348000	Anthem ruined EA
6348000	6350000	I think this might have been planned
6350000	6352000	A little bit sooner than we definitively
6352000	6354000	Know how Anthem is doing or not
6354000	6356000	But we do know Apex has been
6356000	6358000	Successful and you know what we talked about last week
6358000	6360000	On the show and what a lot of people are saying
6360000	6362000	Very tongue in cheek about this
6362000	6364000	Is that EA paid Ninja
6364000	6366000	A million dollars to stream the game
6366000	6368000	On and
6368000	6370000	You know it got all that visibility
6370000	6372000	Who did they just lay off in this?
6372000	6374000	They laid off a lot of publicity people
6374000	6376000	A lot of promotional people and so forth
6376000	6378000	This in my opinion
6378000	6380000	And I'm just some
6380000	6382000	Dude on a microphone with a podcast
6382000	6384000	I'm not like an official investor or whatever
6384000	6386000	But I kinda see there's a link here
6386000	6388000	Is that EA has now
6388000	6390000	Learned that they can
6390000	6392000	Just take their case to the
6392000	6394000	Gamers in a different way and I'm not saying
6394000	6396000	That it's all
6396000	6398000	Gonna go this way I'm just saying
6398000	6400000	EA's learned maybe where they can
6400000	6402000	Make some change or where they wanna make some changes
6402000	6404000	Whether it's effective
6404000	6406000	Or not I guess that's for the market
6406000	6408000	And the sales of the games to decide
6408000	6410000	But I'll be damned if I don't see some correlation here
6410000	6412000	Between what we talked about last week
6412000	6414000	And this and my heart does go out to those
6414000	6416000	That are laid off I'm not saying it was the right move
6416000	6418000	Or anything like that but it's just
6418000	6420000	I can't help but notice this
6420000	6422000	Loki you think there's something there?
6422000	6424000	Well they were saying also that they're
6424000	6426000	Ramping down their current presence in Japan
6426000	6428000	And Russia to focus on different ways
6428000	6430000	To serve those players
6430000	6432000	In those markets so
6432000	6434000	I think it's just restructuring
6434000	6436000	And
6436000	6438000	I don't know I don't think that they're just
6438000	6440000	All of a sudden put all their eggs in
6440000	6442000	Social media influencers
6442000	6444000	Not all of them but
6444000	6446000	Some of them
6446000	6448000	They laid off the entire staff I mean in some of these
6448000	6450000	Other markets like Russia and Japan they did
6450000	6452000	But I mean
6452000	6454000	I just don't think EA games
6454000	6456000	Go over the same way in Japan
6456000	6458000	It's not really the same to the market
6458000	6460000	So I think there's other
6460000	6462000	Factors when it comes to those decisions
6462000	6464000	But I think they're all
6464000	6466000	Coming to a head at the end of the fiscal year
6466000	6468000	Which is why these things are shifting
6468000	6470000	And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat
6470000	6472000	Says business decisions aren't about what you did
6472000	6474000	But what you're going to do
6474000	6476000	And then Tigerclaw kind of follows that up with
6476000	6478000	I can see EA hiring a bunch of streamers
6478000	6480000	As their PR I don't think it's quite
6480000	6482000	The way you phrased it there Tigerclaw
6482000	6484000	But I think can
6484000	6486000	Are they looking at perhaps it's
6486000	6488000	More cost effective
6488000	6490000	To have some of our PR
6490000	6492000	Done for us by streamers
6492000	6494000	We've seen how that's worked out though
6494000	6496000	Because they did the whole Battlefield 5
6496000	6498000	Thing and I wouldn't see even
6498000	6500000	Battlefield 1 was like that they had
6500000	6502000	Social media influencers
6502000	6504000	Or YouTubers or Twitch streamers or whatever
6504000	6506000	Presenting and unfortunately they are not great
6506000	6508000	Presenters and it was very awkward
6508000	6510000	And again I'm not saying 100% of it is
6510000	6512000	Going to be streamers I'm just saying a good chunk
6512000	6514000	Of it but like I just
6514000	6516000	Don't see
6516000	6518000	I don't see how that's
6518000	6520000	Really going to hit more
6520000	6522000	I don't know if they're getting their
6522000	6524000	Money's worth with that you know paying Ninja
6524000	6526000	A million dollars
6526000	6528000	Is that really going to recoup a million dollars
6528000	6530000	Worth of profit back I don't think so
6530000	6532000	I think it's
6532000	6534000	I think they're wasting money there
6534000	6536000	But whatever I guess we'll have to
6536000	6538000	I don't know I don't see the numbers
6538000	6540000	Look at how Apex is doing I think
6540000	6542000	They did it Yeah but I don't think that's because of him at all
6542000	6544000	Though I think it's because it was a game
6544000	6546000	By Titanfall devs that
6546000	6548000	Look great I don't think it's him
6548000	6550000	Specifically I think
6550000	6552000	We keep saying Ninja because he's
6552000	6554000	Kind of this symbol of
6554000	6556000	Multiple streamers that are doing this
6556000	6558000	Thing and the general concept
6558000	6560000	Of social media influencers
6560000	6562000	It's just that he's been on Ellen so he's
6562000	6564000	Kind of the symbol right now of that whole thing
6564000	6566000	So to be clear I'm not saying
6566000	6568000	Him specifically but I'm saying
6568000	6570000	That market
6570000	6572000	If you will of him and streamers
6572000	6574000	Like him so anyway
6574000	6576000	I don't know I think that's giving
6576000	6578000	Them too much power to be honest
6578000	6580000	I think
6580000	6582000	I mean sure there's going to be
6582000	6584000	Some influence over there
6584000	6586000	Their crowd is going to get more impressions
6586000	6588000	To people that are maybe interested in that
6588000	6590000	Type of gameplay because
6590000	6592000	Obviously people that are following Ninja are
6592000	6594000	Into Fortnite
6594000	6596000	And so spinning
6596000	6598000	Off to another battle royale type
6598000	6600000	Genre game is going to be something
6600000	6602000	That's like oh hey you know maybe I could
6602000	6604000	Try that because it's free to play or something
6604000	6606000	Like that it's not necessarily going to be oh I'm going to jump
6606000	6608000	Into like PUBG or something where I have to pay
6608000	6610000	Money to I will absolutely give you
6610000	6612000	That the fact that Apex is free
6612000	6614000	Is a huge part of the reason why
6614000	6616000	It's succeeding absolutely yeah because if it's like
6616000	6618000	A $60 game I mean
6618000	6620000	I don't know if it would have done as well
6620000	6622000	But I just
6622000	6624000	I don't think
6624000	6626000	The thought process here is that
6626000	6628000	Well these
6628000	6630000	Media influencers
6630000	6632000	Seem to be helping us out
6632000	6634000	So we don't need our marketing department
6634000	6636000	No I don't think that's going to do it
6636000	6638000	They didn't eliminate the marketing department
6638000	6640000	They cut it back
6640000	6642000	That's the difference though
6642000	6644000	That's why I keep saying not 100%
6644000	6646000	But they're maybe looking at
6646000	6648000	Some of these dollars that we're into putting on E3
6648000	6650000	Right
6650000	6652000	No I understand that but it's not
6652000	6654000	You wouldn't cut back on marketing staff
6654000	6656000	You would cut back on your marketing spend
6656000	6658000	In different areas instead of putting all of my money
6658000	6660000	In TV advertisements
6660000	6662000	I'm going to be shifting more to
6662000	6664000	Web, video pre-roll
6664000	6666000	Stuff
6666000	6668000	Maybe these social media influencers
6668000	6670000	Put my money there
6670000	6672000	Where I know I'm going to get more of an impact
6672000	6674000	More of
6674000	6676000	A result that way versus
6676000	6678000	Some older ways
6678000	6680000	Of advertising before print
6680000	6682000	Magazine advertisements
6682000	6684000	Let's cut back on that
6684000	6686000	I think that's more of the long lines
6686000	6688000	And maybe if that's the case
6688000	6690000	And the shift to these other types of platforms
6690000	6692000	Maybe these people that were in those marketing positions
6692000	6694000	Were towards
6694000	6696000	Those types of
6696000	6698000	Marketing
6698000	6700000	Or maybe who cares
6700000	6702000	And we don't need to know about the inner workings
6702000	6704000	Of this company and it's not going to make their gains
6704000	6706000	Any god damn better at all
6706000	6708000	So who gives a shit
6708000	6710000	Sorry for the people that got laid off
6710000	6712000	EA I'm sorry I know you wanted to be the best company in the world
6712000	6714000	But guess what? Hopes and dreams aren't going to make
6714000	6716000	That fucking happen
6716000	6718000	Your lack of loot boxes and shit will though
6718000	6720000	And I'll meet you there
6720000	6722000	This is not going to fix EA's problems
6722000	6724000	Because it's very different than this
6724000	6726000	But way to have them spin
6726000	6728000	Well we're going to do it now
6728000	6730000	Okay
6730000	6732000	Wasn't there like a twin story to this
6732000	6734000	Something else to read with this
6734000	6736000	Because I want to quickly get that out and move on
6736000	6738000	So EA announced a new publishing agreement
6738000	6740000	With Velen Studios
6740000	6742000	So they have a new game coming
6742000	6744000	To the Switch apparently
6744000	6746000	It's like a team based game
6746000	6748000	It's called DJ Hero
6748000	6750000	It's called DJ Hero
6750000	6752000	It's called DJ Hero
6752000	6754000	It's called DJ Hero
6754000	6756000	It's called DJ Hero
6756000	6758000	It's called DJ Hero
6758000	6760000	It's called DJ Hero
6760000	6762000	It's called DJ Hero
6762000	6764000	It's called DJ Hero
6764000	6766000	It's called DJ Hero
6766000	6768000	It's called DJ Hero
6768000	6770000	It's called DJ Hero
6770000	6772000	It's called DJ Hero
6772000	6774000	It's called DJ Hero
6774000	6776000	It's called DJ Hero
6776000	6778000	It's called DJ Hero
6778000	6780000	It's called DJ Hero
6780000	6782000	It's called DJ Hero
6782000	6784000	It's called DJ Hero
6784000	6786000	It's called DJ Hero
6786000	6788000	It's called DJ Hero
6788000	6790000	It's called DJ Hero
6790000	6792000	It's called DJ Hero
6792000	6794000	It's called DJ Hero
6794000	6796000	It's called DJ Hero
6796000	6798000	It's called DJ Hero
6798000	6800000	It's called DJ Hero
6800000	6802000	It's called DJ Hero
6802000	6804000	Show me the game
6804000	6806000	They're making a game
6806000	6808000	It's coming to Switch
6808000	6810000	Look
6810000	6812000	Let's move on
6812000	6814000	I want to talk about some news
6814000	6816000	I think we all can agree on some great news
6816000	6818000	If you are
6818000	6820000	Especially an Amazon Prime person
6820000	6822000	Cheap plug by the way
6822000	6824000	If you are an Amazon Prime person
6824000	6826000	Then guess what?
6826000	6828000	You get one free Twitch subscription
6828000	6830000	Every month
6830000	6832000	I have done so today
6832000	6834000	Hooray!
6834000	6836000	Because then you can actually watch the video archive
6836000	6838000	At any time
6838000	6840000	The audio as it has been for 17 years
6840000	6842000	That same product the audio that we do is free
6842000	6844000	It's just something a little bit extra
6844000	6846000	But you can watch video archives of ourselves
6846000	6848000	Bobby Blackwolf
6848000	6850000	Now this indie game showcase
6850000	6852000	As well as anything we might do in the future
6852000	6854000	You'll have a nice big archive for our subscribers
6854000	6856000	So a big thank you to everybody who is subscribing
6856000	6858000	Using their Amazon Prime
6858000	6860000	Some people are paying out of pocket to do that
6860000	6862000	We really appreciate you guys as well
6862000	6864000	I think also today is the last day to grab
6864000	6866000	The 2500 biddies
6866000	6868000	If it's not already done
6868000	6870000	You can get 2500 biddies for
6870000	6872000	25 bucks which means Twitch is kind of like
6872000	6874000	Not taking their cut right now
6874000	6876000	So that's also
6876000	6878000	Because we really appreciate the bits and all that stuff
6878000	6880000	So it helps us in getting the word out there
6880000	6882000	And some of the plans that we have
6882000	6884000	For this year with promo and all that good stuff
6884000	6886000	Anyway those of you that are on Amazon Prime
6886000	6888000	Guess what? You also get
6888000	6890000	Other perks so you don't just get
6890000	6892000	Your whole like you know that you can
6892000	6894000	Subscribe to one Twitch channel every month
6894000	6896000	But you also right now
6896000	6898000	This is a big kind of a big deal
6898000	6900000	You get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online
6900000	6902000	Free
6902000	6904000	So if you haven't signed up yet
6904000	6906000	Or even if you have actually
6906000	6908000	You can go get 12 months for free
6908000	6910000	And so yeah and I just did this today
6910000	6912000	You can extend
6912000	6914000	Your current membership
6914000	6916000	I think it only lets you 3 months right now
6916000	6918000	Then 90 days you can do another
6918000	6920000	9 months
6920000	6922000	That's I think what they're doing to
6922000	6924000	Like if anybody's trying to do the free trial thing
6924000	6926000	Because you could go in with a free trial
6926000	6928000	Of Amazon Prime or whatever
6928000	6930000	Get your you know
6930000	6932000	So they're wanting to make sure people keep it I think
6932000	6934000	So yeah you can redeem 3 months now
6934000	6936000	And then in like 60 days, 2 or 3 months
6936000	6938000	You can get the rest of it
6938000	6940000	But you know I imagine a lot of you are
6940000	6942000	Thinking about taking advantage of that
6942000	6944000	So yeah you can check that out
6944000	6946000	You see that pop right up there when you're logged into
6946000	6948000	Twitch TV
6948000	6950000	I'm signing up for it right now
6950000	6952000	And you can extend your current membership
6952000	6954000	That's pretty crazy
6954000	6956000	You know what this reminds me of?
6956000	6958000	This reminds me of the recent
6958000	6960000	Spotify thing
6960000	6962000	Where they were like, hey if you're a Spotify premium
6962000	6964000	Person you get Hulu Plus
6964000	6966000	You know it's this like weird
6966000	6968000	Alliance type thing they're doing
6968000	6970000	You know I'm sure Twitch has given Nintendo
6970000	6972000	Some money and so forth but
6972000	6974000	It's pretty crazy so
6974000	6976000	Anyway
6976000	6978000	Oh
6978000	6980000	Shane is pointing something else out here
6980000	6982000	This is also very interesting
6982000	6984000	Shane is in our chat saying
6984000	6986000	Unless you're in a family plan
6986000	6988000	Then you get nothing
6988000	6990000	So those people that were like
6990000	6992000	Coming up with their plan to share their family plan
6992000	6994000	With other people, doesn't work
6994000	6996000	This is only for an individual plan
6996000	6998000	Good good footnote
6998000	7000000	I don't have a family plan
7000000	7002000	Because it's just me and if Allen wants to play something
7002000	7004000	He just uses my account
7004000	7006000	He rarely plays anything on console these days anyway
7006000	7008000	So yes good call out though
7008000	7010000	Let's see
7010000	7012000	Tigercall on chat says I took advantage of this
7012000	7014000	But I can't activate it because I don't have a switch
7014000	7016000	Well
7016000	7018000	Maybe you'll be incentivized to get one
7018000	7020000	Or maybe you'll go to a friend's house
7020000	7022000	Or something I don't know
7022000	7024000	But I think it's kind of interesting
7024000	7026000	Actf says
7026000	7028000	You can add it to your current subscription
7028000	7030000	If you aren't part of the family plan
7030000	7032000	Yeah pretty neat
7032000	7034000	Yeah you can get that for free
7034000	7036000	If you are not already on a family plan
7036000	7038000	I mean
7038000	7040000	Hypothetically
7040000	7042000	If I'm not mistaken you could
7042000	7044000	Make your own account
7044000	7046000	That's not a part of the family plan
7046000	7048000	And then you could get it for 12 months on your own
7048000	7050000	But then why would you do that
7050000	7052000	You probably still have like 9 months left
7052000	7054000	In your family plan
7054000	7056000	That all started like November December
7056000	7058000	Might not be worth it I don't know
7058000	7060000	Anyway there you go pretty good deal
7060000	7062000	A lot of people are taking advantage of right now
7062000	7064000	Moving on DarkSakura
7064000	7066000	Well here are
7066000	7068000	I don't know it's kind of sad it's the end of an era
7068000	7070000	But Kaz Hirai
7070000	7072000	You know he went on to be the director and chairman
7072000	7074000	Of Sony after stepping down as CEO
7074000	7076000	Now he's officially retiring
7076000	7078000	And
7078000	7080000	But I mean he was the
7080000	7082000	Dude that gave us
7082000	7084000	DarkSakura
7084000	7086000	But I think he did a pretty good job
7086000	7088000	With Sony
7088000	7090000	So he's going to be around
7090000	7092000	As a consultant
7092000	7094000	You know to put in input
7094000	7096000	And they say he's going to continue to advise
7096000	7098000	The company until he
7098000	7100000	Decides not to
7100000	7102000	And
7102000	7104000	Yoshida Kenichiro
7104000	7106000	Put out a statement that says while he will be retiring
7106000	7108000	From both chairman and
7108000	7110000	Board of directors we look forward to his continuing
7110000	7112000	Support to Sony's management that
7112000	7114000	Encompasses a breadth of diverse
7114000	7116000	Businesses
7116000	7118000	You know for all the shit we gave this guy over the
7118000	7120000	Years about that infamous Playstation
7120000	7122000	3 reveal at E3
7122000	7124000	You know he did move on
7124000	7126000	To other positions within the company
7126000	7128000	And has kind of overseen the Playstation
7128000	7130000	4 and the success that has come with that
7130000	7132000	So you know
7132000	7134000	As much as we joke about whatever the crayons and all that
7134000	7136000	Stuff from back in the day I think
7136000	7138000	He really was fairly smart he just said some dumb things
7138000	7140000	They had a bad E3
7140000	7142000	And I mean a really bad E3
7142000	7144000	A really bad E3
7144000	7146000	But now it's a much different company
7146000	7148000	And I think
7148000	7150000	It's probably a good time
7150000	7152000	It's probably a good time for him
7152000	7154000	To transition this out
7154000	7156000	And I love the whole he's going to be working for them
7156000	7158000	As an advisor until he doesn't
7158000	7160000	Like
7160000	7162000	I'm going to be doing this until I decide not to
7162000	7164000	Well I mean that kind of is how it is
7164000	7166000	It's like us and Orange Lounge Radio
7166000	7168000	We'll continue to do this show
7168000	7170000	Until we don't
7170000	7172000	I mean seriously
7172000	7174000	That's how we are
7174000	7176000	No it is it is
7176000	7178000	Or until Rob has another big diva fit
7178000	7180000	You never know time is short
7180000	7182000	Yeah
7182000	7184000	Live long diva hard
7184000	7186000	Alright anyhow let's move on
7186000	7188000	Just a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to get to the listener round table
7188000	7190000	With calls and discord and
7190000	7192000	Questions in chat but Loki
7192000	7194000	You're really excited about this project
7194000	7196000	Yeah this is pretty cool
7196000	7198000	I never did get a chance to mess around with it
7198000	7200000	But it's been updated
7200000	7202000	So we talked about this I think months ago now
7202000	7204000	About the Mega Man Maker
7204000	7206000	That is out on PC
7206000	7208000	So basically it's this unofficial
7208000	7210000	Almost like a Mario Maker
7210000	7212000	Type thing for Mega Man games
7212000	7214000	Well now they've added some additional stuff
7214000	7216000	Into the game
7216000	7218000	That's focused around Mega Man 8 and 9
7218000	7220000	So they haven't
7220000	7222000	Done like a retro form though
7222000	7224000	So they've got four new bosses
7224000	7226000	Grenade Man, Astro Man, Tornado Man, Concrete Man
7226000	7228000	They have a quick swap tool
7228000	7230000	Multi-boss option
7230000	7232000	And then you can even have it
7232000	7234000	So basically that means you can have Mega Man fight two bosses
7234000	7236000	At once
7236000	7238000	And just like a bunch of other updates
7238000	7240000	New little gimmicks and stuff
7240000	7242000	In there as well
7242000	7244000	So if it's something you want to check out
7244000	7246000	I don't know where you can actually
7246000	7248000	Pick this up but I see that they have
7248000	7250000	Something on YouTube
7250000	7252000	Regarding it
7252000	7254000	Oh you can download it at
7254000	7256000	MegaManMaker.com
7256000	7258000	Of course it would make sense
7258000	7260000	That would be the URL for that
7260000	7262000	So that's where you can check it out
7262000	7264000	It's free and
7264000	7266000	I'm curious to see if anyone's made anything cool
7266000	7268000	With this probably
7268000	7270000	I'm with Dark Tetsuya in our chat room
7270000	7272000	Over at twitch.tv slash vog network
7272000	7274000	Who says Mega Man Maker just makes me sad
7274000	7276000	Mega Man universe never materialized
7276000	7278000	Yeah but you know what
7278000	7280000	When the official company decides
7280000	7282000	Not to do it other people kind of step
7282000	7284000	In sometimes and homebrew it up
7284000	7286000	And it looks pretty neat
7286000	7288000	They've got some pretty interesting things in this
7288000	7290000	So I mean it definitely
7290000	7292000	Looks pretty cool
7292000	7294000	I guess we'll have to check it out
7294000	7296000	Yeah that might be a fun thing to do some live streams with
7296000	7298000	At some point or something
7298000	7300000	SG100Matt in chat says
7300000	7302000	I was going to say Mega Man universe looked like an amazing
7302000	7304000	Idea
7304000	7306000	Tigerclaw says how about Metroid Maker
7306000	7308000	It's probably out there
7308000	7310000	Someone did do a Metroid Maker already
7310000	7312000	In fact there's some ROMs
7312000	7314000	Out there to do like fan built
7314000	7316000	Metroid
7316000	7318000	And they certainly have the shuffles
7318000	7320000	The random generated ones
7320000	7322000	I always mean to get in there and play some of those randomizers
7322000	7324000	I like the mixed randomizers with Legend of Zelda
7324000	7326000	Yes I've seen that one too
7326000	7328000	The Zelda and Metroid one
7328000	7330000	Yeah they did it at GameStun quick
7330000	7332000	Yeah that looks so cool
7332000	7334000	Anyway
7334000	7336000	Let's move on one more story for you guys here
7336000	7338000	And this has to do with
7338000	7340000	You know another YouTuber
7340000	7342000	But one that might not have as many people
7342000	7344000	Watching as a Ninja
7344000	7346000	But she should
7346000	7348000	Her name is Shirley Curry
7348000	7350000	Which I love her name
7350000	7352000	She's 82 years old and she is a
7352000	7354000	Grandma that plays Skyrim
7354000	7356000	She is the Skyrim Grandma
7356000	7358000	I'm going to be playing Skyrim when I'm 82 years old too
7358000	7360000	Well probably not Skyrim
7360000	7362000	She's like I was young like you once
7362000	7364000	But then I took an arrow
7364000	7366000	Alright anyway
7366000	7368000	This is cool Bethesda announced this week
7368000	7370000	She will be appearing in the Elder Scrolls 6
7370000	7372000	They use technology to scan her face
7372000	7374000	And she's going to be a character in the game
7374000	7376000	Funny enough
7376000	7378000	This little peek behind the scenes
7378000	7380000	That we saw
7380000	7382000	Is really like our first true look
7382000	7384000	At anything
7384000	7386000	With the Elder Scrolls 6
7386000	7388000	I mean that announcement trailer was what
7388000	7390000	A photo and a maybe logo
7390000	7392000	This was really the first true
7392000	7394000	Look we got at the game because
7394000	7396000	Bethesda's already said don't expect
7396000	7398000	This until Starfield's done basically
7398000	7400000	Which on that note
7400000	7402000	I should also say kind of like a tangent
7402000	7404000	From this Bethesda has also
7404000	7406000	Indicated you will not be seeing either of
7406000	7408000	These things at E3 this year
7408000	7410000	So if you are expecting that this will be
7410000	7412000	Starfield's year or this will be
7412000	7414000	Elder Scrolls 6's new Vegas remaster
7414000	7416000	Keep right on thinking
7416000	7418000	It seems like at this point Bethesda may be
7418000	7420000	Holding those things for the
7420000	7422000	PlayStation 5 next
7422000	7424000	Xbox etc etc
7424000	7426000	What's coming next for gaming
7426000	7428000	So don't expect that at this year's E3
7428000	7430000	They're setting those expectations now
7430000	7432000	Anyway this was all revealed at a PAX East
7432000	7434000	Panel this is where this information came out
7434000	7436000	It was actually an Elder Scrolls 25th
7436000	7438000	Anniversary panel I didn't realize the series
7438000	7440000	As a whole I mean probably because
7440000	7442000	Most of us didn't really really follow it
7442000	7444000	Until Morrowind I mean no disrespect
7444000	7446000	To like Arena and the games before it but I think
7446000	7448000	Morrowind especially Morrowind was on
7448000	7450000	Xbox so that's when the game really
7450000	7452000	Started to get more steam
7452000	7454000	The original Xbox not Xbox 360 that was Oblivion
7454000	7456000	But anyway
7456000	7458000	So yeah they were talking about the photo capture technology
7458000	7460000	And then they showed good old Grandma Shirley
7460000	7462000	Actually being in the game and
7462000	7464000	When asked for comment she said
7464000	7466000	This means a lot to me because I would be
7466000	7468000	Extremely happy to know that somebody else
7468000	7470000	Was playing with my character
7470000	7472000	In a future Elder Scrolls game
7472000	7474000	She has 483,000 people on YouTube
7474000	7476000	It's not a nothing
7476000	7478000	Nothing to a bulk at
7478000	7480000	She's got about a thousand times the people
7480000	7482000	That we do
7482000	7484000	So good for her that's great
7484000	7486000	I love that too
7486000	7488000	And I think that's so
7488000	7490000	So good what she's saying there about like this is
7490000	7492000	Something that will be there
7492000	7494000	Forever essentially you know after she's
7494000	7496000	Gone and as video game historians look back on
7496000	7498000	A game like Elder Scrolls 6 she will have
7498000	7500000	Played a small part of that and I think that's a really
7500000	7502000	Until she comes out and says racist things on
7502000	7504000	Twitter and then they can patch her out of the game
7504000	7506000	Well let's hope not
7506000	7508000	Let's hope she doesn't do that let's just hope
7508000	7510000	She's pretty level minded
7510000	7512000	And so forth
7512000	7514000	Slidekickingchat says Rob did you say this will be
7514000	7516000	Garfield's year? I most certainly
7516000	7518000	Did not
7518000	7520000	Starfield very big different
7520000	7522000	But I will say
7522000	7524000	Garfield and I both hate Mondays
7524000	7526000	So there is that going for us this year that's for sure
7526000	7528000	You know what always bothered me about that?
7528000	7530000	Garfield's a fucking cat and doesn't have to
7530000	7532000	Go to work
7532000	7534000	Why the fuck would he hate a Monday?
7536000	7538000	Just doesn't make sense to me
7538000	7540000	I don't know I also appreciate
7540000	7542000	Garfield without Garfield
7542000	7544000	Is that still a thing? That's just really sad
7544000	7546000	It is I love those
7546000	7548000	It is
7548000	7550000	Poor John
7550000	7552000	Ciatiberianchat says do you also love lasagna?
7552000	7554000	Hell yeah Hell yeah I love lasagna
7554000	7556000	Anyway
7556000	7558000	You know what
7558000	7560000	If we still had a fortune cookie I would have
7560000	7562000	you play Weird Al's Lasagna
7562000	7564000	Everybody in chat is
7564000	7566000	Bobby in act after chat
7566000	7568000	chiming in saying
7568000	7570000	John leaves to work on Mondays
7570000	7572000	That's why Garfield hates Mondays
7572000	7574000	Yeah but Garfield only tolerates John
7574000	7576000	Isn't that the truth
7576000	7578000	Alright let's get to the listener round table
7578000	7580000	If you want to call in to talk about literally
7580000	7582000	anything but Garfield
7582000	7584000	Hopefully it has something to do with games
7584000	7586000	You can join our Discord server
7586000	7588000	right now over at
7588000	7590000	voggenetwork.com
7590000	7592000	Discord and we're going to be taking
7592000	7594000	some of your calls here on the show except I'm not
7594000	7596000	configured here on the show computer to do that yet
7596000	7598000	So Loki
7598000	7600000	I'm sure you probably have some last minute stories you want to get to
7600000	7602000	while I get everything configured here right?
7602000	7604000	I've been looking at these videos
7604000	7606000	on Twitter so apparently Sonic
7606000	7608000	Ether's unbelievable shaders
7608000	7610000	for Minecraft is
7610000	7612000	probably pretty close so he's in
7612000	7614000	One of the experimental builds he has now
7614000	7616000	it has ray tracing in it
7616000	7618000	and it looks amazing
7618000	7620000	So
7620000	7622000	That's pretty awesome
7622000	7624000	I'll have to check that out
7624000	7626000	Apparently you can get it if you go back
7626000	7628000	I'm on Patreon Sonic Ether
7628000	7630000	They're $10 and you get access
7630000	7632000	to their experimental shaders
7632000	7634000	Apparently the ray tracing though is still
7634000	7636000	not entirely optimized it only runs at
7636000	7638000	25 to 40 frames per second
7638000	7640000	with far distance
7640000	7642000	on maxed out
7642000	7644000	PC so they had like a
7644000	7646000	9900K with
7646000	7648000	a GTS
7648000	7650000	was it
7650000	7652000	1170 Ti
7652000	7654000	or a 1070 Ti
7654000	7656000	and
7656000	7658000	but god it looks
7658000	7660000	it looks amazing
7660000	7662000	This is what I want to see
7662000	7664000	For the 4K pack
7664000	7666000	This is better than their 4K pack
7666000	7668000	Anyway before you get some more stories
7668000	7670000	We actually have some people waiting to call in
7670000	7672000	and be on the show tonight so I'm going to get to it
7672000	7674000	and get to a call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
7676000	7678000	Oh they disappeared
7678000	7680000	Let me try one more time to bring them into the room
7680000	7682000	and see if they want to be on the show tonight
7682000	7684000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
7684000	7686000	I'm on Ambience
7686000	7688000	I didn't know what I was doing on my phone
7688000	7690000	so whatever it's Shane
7690000	7692000	Hi Shane how are you?
7692000	7694000	I'm on Ambien and tired
7694000	7696000	Okay well that's
7696000	7698000	that's what Ambien does
7698000	7700000	so before you fall asleep what did you want to call in
7700000	7702000	about tonight to talk about?
7702000	7704000	So we know that
7704000	7706000	I defend Anthem a lot
7706000	7708000	I think it's a great game
7708000	7710000	Dustin and I hit 30
7710000	7712000	today
7716000	7718000	He just dropped out
7718000	7720000	Did he just hit the
7720000	7722000	disconnect button? Shane just fell asleep
7722000	7724000	He stopped making Ambien Skype calls
7724000	7726000	He just
7726000	7728000	just so you guys know he disappeared from
7728000	7730000	Discord so he either
7730000	7732000	that's not our internet or anything
7732000	7734000	or those problems that we were having earlier
7734000	7736000	he was in the chat and then he wasn't
7736000	7738000	because
7738000	7740000	you're looking at Britney Spears because somebody put that
7740000	7742000	in our Discord before I started
7742000	7744000	taking calls
7744000	7746000	Alright I'm going to try this one more time
7746000	7748000	Are you back?
7748000	7750000	Yeah I'm back I don't know what happened
7750000	7752000	You hit the disconnect or you quit or something
7752000	7754000	No I didn't I was just
7754000	7756000	straight up talking
7756000	7758000	It was taking Ambien too
7758000	7760000	You were talking about Anthem so even though
7760000	7762000	a lot of folks are expressing
7762000	7764000	displeasure with this game you're into it
7764000	7766000	What is it that
7766000	7768000	you love so much about this game?
7768000	7770000	It's fun the story is not
7770000	7772000	half bad
7772000	7774000	the flying is great
7774000	7776000	the different javelins make the
7776000	7778000	game feel differently for you so
7778000	7780000	I'm not big on just like shooting things
7780000	7782000	but I am big on being like a
7782000	7784000	mage and blowing stuff up
7784000	7786000	so I found something that works for me
7786000	7788000	and Dustin
7788000	7790000	doesn't really like to shoot stuff
7790000	7792000	so he found something that works for him
7792000	7794000	that just melees everything till it dies
7794000	7796000	so it's been pretty fun
7796000	7798000	it's like Mass Effect multiplayer
7798000	7800000	And so it was
7800000	7802000	worth the $60 at the end of the day?
7802000	7804000	Well I didn't pay
7804000	7806000	$60 because I
7806000	7808000	had Gamers Club
7808000	7810000	from Best Buy
7810000	7812000	so yes it was worth whatever that was
7812000	7814000	$42 or something
7814000	7816000	Right I always forget
7816000	7818000	some people are playing it through EA's subscription service
7818000	7820000	because subscription services are the way
7820000	7822000	to go these days
7822000	7824000	Well and that's kind of where my call
7824000	7826000	was leading because I love this game
7826000	7828000	the bugs are sometimes annoying
7828000	7830000	I got into a mission today and I didn't have a head
7830000	7832000	I didn't understand why
7832000	7834000	but I was flying around with no head
7834000	7836000	but
7836000	7838000	during my ambient shopping
7838000	7840000	last night
7840000	7842000	I
7842000	7844000	decided to
7844000	7846000	pick up PC copies
7846000	7848000	for us because he really likes
7848000	7850000	the game and I like playing the game with him
7850000	7852000	so I was like well now we can play on our PCs
7852000	7854000	if we want
7854000	7856000	because we've been playing on Xbox
7856000	7858000	and so we go
7858000	7860000	install the games, put in our codes
7860000	7862000	apparently since
7862000	7864000	Friday
7864000	7866000	Origin is
7866000	7868000	all sorts of broken for
7868000	7870000	the west coast and
7870000	7872000	central US and
7872000	7874000	Canada
7874000	7876000	It'll keep telling you you're not connected
7876000	7878000	online so you can't launch any of the games
7880000	7882000	Yikes
7882000	7884000	Yeah so this is one of those times
7884000	7886000	where I can't defend
7886000	7888000	something to do with EA that I like
7888000	7890000	because I actually think Origin is pretty good
7890000	7892000	but
7892000	7894000	this has been a real
7894000	7896000	annoyance today because we hit
7896000	7898000	30 and I was like here let's go
7898000	7900000	play it on computer and just get started
7900000	7902000	and we're just sitting there and it keeps saying
7902000	7904000	oh we see you're not connected to the internet
7904000	7906000	it's like no we are
7906000	7908000	interesting because
7908000	7910000	because Apex is all
7910000	7912000	through Origin I mean yes I know Apex is on
7912000	7914000	consoles too but that means
7914000	7916000	Apex isn't working for people too
7916000	7918000	Yikes
7918000	7920000	That's their bread and butter right now so that's
7920000	7922000	a little surprising to hear that
7922000	7924000	The only work around is apparently
7924000	7926000	using a VPN and having it
7926000	7928000	think you're like east coast
7928000	7930000	East coast apparently is having no problems
7930000	7932000	it's just the west coast and
7932000	7934000	central
7934000	7936000	Weird
7936000	7938000	I wonder if it's like the data centers that's routing you too
7938000	7940000	like there must be an east coast data center and a west coast
7940000	7942000	data center and so the west coast one is having
7942000	7944000	issues
7944000	7946000	Yeah since Friday and they haven't fixed it
7946000	7948000	so I don't know what's going on
7948000	7950000	I kind of killed my buzz for playing
7950000	7952000	the rest of the day so
7952000	7954000	That's too bad
7954000	7956000	Alright so
7956000	7958000	What?
7958000	7960000	And in the amazing video game news
7960000	7962000	I got the soundtrack
7962000	7964000	to Silent Hill 2 on vinyl
7964000	7966000	Nice
7966000	7968000	And one of the records
7968000	7970000	is like a black and red
7970000	7972000	swirl that you can see through if you
7972000	7974000	put it up to the light and on the
7974000	7976000	back of it and the little hole around it
7976000	7978000	I don't know the paper around the hole
7978000	7980000	says there was a hole here
7980000	7982000	it's gone now and it just made my day
7982000	7984000	That's pretty good I didn't know they were
7984000	7986000	releasing that on vinyl that's pretty rad
7986000	7988000	Yeah they also have Silent Hill 1
7988000	7990000	for vinyl right now but not 3 or 4
7990000	7992000	which is actually the ones I'd want
7992000	7994000	Alright well maybe if the other ones sell
7994000	7996000	really well they'll do the other ones in the future who knows
7996000	7998000	So yeah
7998000	8000000	Well I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls
8000000	8002000	but you know in the future you know you prevent
8002000	8004000	ambient shopping and so forth
8004000	8006000	Have you ever considered like when you take an
8006000	8008000	ambient like go to bed?
8008000	8010000	That's what I'm about to do
8010000	8012000	Alright just checking
8012000	8014000	I mean ask your doctor but it just would seem
8014000	8016000	like if you want to prevent
8016000	8018000	unnecessary shopping
8018000	8020000	you just go to bed when you take the
8020000	8022000	ambient
8022000	8024000	Ok they tell me to take it in bed but I take it like an hour
8024000	8026000	and a half early so the effects
8026000	8028000	start kicking in and even
8028000	8030000	then even then I would
8030000	8032000	just take my phone to
8032000	8034000	bed and then they're shopping right there
8034000	8036000	But then yeah I guess
8036000	8038000	you need to disable shopping on your phone
8038000	8040000	Real quick before we let you go because we are getting a question for you
8040000	8042000	in our chat room. ActDeaf wants to know
8042000	8044000	how many shinies did you get yesterday
8044000	8046000	in Pokemon Go?
8046000	8048000	3 Lotad
8048000	8050000	and I think
8050000	8052000	I ended either 15
8052000	8054000	no like 16 or 17
8054000	8056000	Castform
8056000	8058000	Wow I was going to say 3 is low
8058000	8060000	for you but that Lotad thing
8060000	8062000	Not a lot of people
8062000	8064000	Yeah people are not happy with the way those research
8064000	8066000	quests went down I guess
8066000	8068000	No. Oh and here's another problem
8068000	8070000	sorry I'm keeping me on the line
8070000	8072000	It's fine
8072000	8074000	At least here
8074000	8076000	the spawns kind of sucked
8076000	8078000	and I would see a lot of
8078000	8080000	Castforms just regular Castforms
8080000	8082000	but wouldn't it be sunny
8082000	8084000	like sunny Pokemon
8084000	8086000	weather boosted sunny Pokemon wouldn't be out
8086000	8088000	it'd be like I don't know
8088000	8090000	partly cloudy so when you
8090000	8092000	get quests that say catch X amount
8092000	8094000	of weather boost what are you
8094000	8096000	going to do? You really
8096000	8098000	can't
8098000	8100000	It happens at least 3 of the time
8100000	8102000	3 of the hours that we played
8102000	8104000	It didn't seem like the spawns were
8104000	8106000	increased but I felt like
8106000	8108000	we went to the usual spot at the capital and it felt like it was
8108000	8110000	ok it was fine
8110000	8112000	but yeah we
8112000	8114000	didn't have that but I never need
8114000	8116000	to see a shiny Castform again
8116000	8118000	Alright fair enough
8118000	8120000	Alright I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls
8120000	8122000	but goodnight
8122000	8124000	Alright
8124000	8126000	We're going to get to some more calls here
8126000	8128000	I see this person I don't think this one's called
8128000	8130000	in the show before so let's see if we can get them on
8130000	8132000	We're going to bring them in to chat and say hello
8132000	8134000	you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
8136000	8138000	Hey this is Ninja Bunny
8138000	8140000	Hey Ninja Bunny good to hear from you what's up?
8140000	8142000	I want to
8142000	8144000	talk about
8144000	8146000	wait hold on I'm echoing
8146000	8148000	there you go I wanted to talk
8148000	8150000	about
8150000	8152000	time investment
8152000	8154000	in games
8154000	8156000	Sure what do you mean
8156000	8158000	elaborate on that a little bit
8158000	8160000	what do you mean by time investment in games?
8160000	8162000	So I play a lot of fighting games
8162000	8164000	and
8164000	8166000	pretty much I feel like
8166000	8168000	if you get good at Street Fighter
8168000	8170000	3 or Street Fighter 5
8170000	8172000	or whatever the hell you're playing
8172000	8174000	those skills transfer
8174000	8176000	over to other fighting
8176000	8178000	games
8178000	8180000	and I don't really like to waste time
8180000	8182000	so
8182000	8184000	that's one of the reasons why
8184000	8186000	I don't play MMOs because
8186000	8188000	I don't feel like any of those
8188000	8190000	skills or anything like that
8190000	8192000	transfer over to other MMOs because
8192000	8194000	you still have to grind for
8194000	8196000	items and skills and all that stuff
8196000	8198000	Unless you say the melee class
8198000	8200000	Well I kind of see
8200000	8202000	where he's going though I get what he's saying is that
8202000	8204000	like generally you know when you're
8204000	8206000	playing fighting games like you push the stick
8206000	8208000	up you're always going to jump
8208000	8210000	but like in MMOs
8210000	8212000	the whole like backbone
8212000	8214000	about how the game functions
8214000	8216000	and you know the fighting style let's say
8216000	8218000	is very different between you know
8218000	8220000	World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 11
8220000	8222000	and Guild Wars they're all very
8222000	8224000	different whereas you know in fighting games
8224000	8226000	you have punch, kick, jump
8226000	8228000	you have different types of punches and kicks but generally
8228000	8230000	you know and it's not to say all fighting games are
8230000	8232000	the same but I kind of see
8232000	8234000	I kind of see where you're going with this
8234000	8236000	so is
8236000	8238000	sorry we cut you off did you want to finish your thought or ask a
8238000	8240000	question or? Oh it's
8240000	8242000	just mainly why I don't like
8242000	8244000	why I don't enjoy games like Banjo Kazooie
8244000	8246000	or Donkey Kong
8246000	8248000	or anything where you have to like
8248000	8250000	collect a bunch of shit and it's also the
8250000	8252000	main reason why I don't like Breath of the Wild
8252000	8254000	Oh
8254000	8256000	right because I read you a little bit earlier
8256000	8258000	for the whole Breath of the Wild comment interesting
8258000	8260000	well you know and that's okay all joking aside
8260000	8262000	you know people like what they like
8262000	8264000	and that's okay because
8264000	8266000	you know for instance here at Orange Mountains Radio
8266000	8268000	we don't often talk about sports
8268000	8270000	games there's not a lot of sports we don't really
8270000	8272000	play Madden and stuff like that now
8272000	8274000	some of the old school classics like I heard they did
8274000	8276000	NBA Jam at PAX East today that's
8276000	8278000	pretty cool but you know
8278000	8280000	like a lot of the newer modern sports
8280000	8282000	games we just don't get into those so much
8282000	8284000	but you know I completely understand as someone
8284000	8286000	who's been you know commentating on this for a long
8286000	8288000	time there's a lot of people who play
8288000	8290000	sports games and who buy Xboxes and
8290000	8292000	things to play sports games
8292000	8294000	specifically and in some ways
8294000	8296000	you know what one could say what you're
8296000	8298000	saying here about fighting games in some
8298000	8300000	ways is also true of sports games
8300000	8302000	that like you know if you know how to play
8302000	8304000	football for real you kind of already
8304000	8306000	know what the rules of Madden are gonna be
8306000	8308000	sorta sorta but
8308000	8310000	you know but on the flip side of that
8310000	8312000	and I'm sure you recognize this but for
8312000	8314000	some people that collecting
8314000	8316000	that exploring
8316000	8318000	that's the reward that's
8318000	8320000	what some people love to do
8320000	8322000	specifically when it comes to Breath of the Wild
8322000	8324000	because you know a lot of people
8324000	8326000	think of Zelda as like being on this map
8326000	8328000	and you know this dungeon is here
8328000	8330000	and then you go here and there was you know
8330000	8332000	a lot of especially the older Zelda games was very much
8332000	8334000	a way that you progress
8334000	8336000	and you go through the game that with
8336000	8338000	Breath of the Wild it opened it up
8338000	8340000	and it opened it up really big
8340000	8342000	to a point where maybe it felt a little inaccessible
8342000	8344000	if you didn't really ever play these kinds of games
8344000	8346000	but at the same time also led to
8346000	8348000	a sense of reward for
8348000	8350000	exploration like oh I had no idea
8350000	8352000	this temple was hiding
8352000	8354000	behind this corner over here or what
8354000	8356000	have you and the whole concept
8356000	8358000	of oh sometimes there's
8358000	8360000	more than one way to get through
8360000	8362000	an issue like especially when it comes to like
8362000	8364000	the snowy areas like
8364000	8366000	what you can build a coat I think at some point
8366000	8368000	you can eat fire food
8368000	8370000	you can just fucking run for it and hope
8370000	8372000	you make it before you die there's like
8372000	8374000	multiple ways to get through situations
8374000	8376000	and that I think is fun for some people
8376000	8378000	as well but that doesn't what I think is
8378000	8380000	that the skill that you develop with something like Breath of the
8380000	8382000	Wild is the ability to look around corners
8382000	8384000	and so when I started
8384000	8386000	you know after playing a little bit of Breath of the Wild
8386000	8388000	I actually did apply it to World of Warcraft
8388000	8390000	and found that I was
8390000	8392000	well mostly to my breaking you know
8392000	8394000	barriers in the game and breaking
8394000	8396000	the game but I found that it helped
8396000	8398000	I do want to read
8398000	8400000	a couple of comments here in our chat over
8400000	8402000	twitch.tv slash vog network
8402000	8404000	Questbuster in chat says that's one of
8404000	8406000	the issues about games like Fallout 76
8406000	8408000	that the loot system
8408000	8410000	as it is right now doesn't respect your time
8410000	8412000	oh wow I found a legendary
8412000	8414000	mob and it drops junk again
8414000	8416000	you know that was a big problem in the
8416000	8418000	early days of Diablo 3 is that people
8418000	8420000	felt like the stuff they were killing was not giving
8420000	8422000	loot that was worth their time
8422000	8424000	but anyway I digress
8424000	8426000	so I mean let me just
8426000	8428000	let me ask you this NinjaBunny and then we'll kind of wrap up
8428000	8430000	like even though you kind of know this is where
8430000	8432000	you stand on these types of games
8432000	8434000	have you ever like played a game where you're like
8434000	8436000	you know I'm not usually
8436000	8438000	into this but this
8438000	8440000	I'm into sort of like how we
8440000	8442000	said oh we don't really play sports games
8442000	8444000	but I got a soft spot for Blades of Steel
8444000	8446000	I'm always gonna is there something that kind of like
8446000	8448000	breaks that down for you like
8448000	8450000	is there something that you play even though you
8450000	8452000	didn't think you'd like it
8452000	8454000	Xenoblade Chronicles X
8454000	8456000	interesting
8456000	8458000	interesting because that is
8458000	8460000	definitely an RPG and there's a
8460000	8462000	lot to do in a game like that
8462000	8464000	why do you think that game
8464000	8466000	kind of broke the rule for you
8466000	8468000	probably because it has robots
8470000	8472000	you like robots are cool you like robots
8472000	8474000	and mechs and stuff hey
8474000	8476000	whatever the reason I just think it's always
8476000	8478000	interesting that like we might say we don't like XYZ
8478000	8480000	type of game but then it's like oh
8480000	8482000	but there's this one exception because
8482000	8484000	it kind of did this thing differently in this case
8484000	8486000	you know what I'll give it to you
8486000	8488000	it was an RPG fantasy
8488000	8490000	thing that's not swords and
8490000	8492000	shields and magic and like I love all that
8492000	8494000	stuff it's fucking robots
8494000	8496000	it's different
8496000	8498000	right that was like the original
8498000	8500000	Xenogears yeah well I mean that's
8500000	8502000	you know yes so
8502000	8504000	anyway alright well NinjaBuddy

8592000	8594000	yeah we figured you know we're just going
8594000	8596000	to go for it and uh

8598000	8600000	format but uh trying
8600000	8602000	on a little bit more of a conversational
8602000	8604000	take on things so we hope you like
8604000	8606000	it um but I didn't want to just plug
8606000	8608000	my podcast I did have a
8608000	8610000	question for you Robin I don't
8610000	8612000	know uh because I was just in Final Fantasy
8612000	8614000	14 and
8614000	8616000	I was dealing with that terrible
8616000	8618000	raid with um
8618000	8620000	Diabolos uh
8620000	8622000	like it took three hours just
8622000	8624000	not really but like it took a long time in the
8624000	8626000	alliance roulette so uh
8626000	8628000	I did not get to tune in when I
8628000	8630000	had hoped to but
8630000	8632000	um so my question
8632000	8634000	is like I don't know if you talked about
8634000	8636000	this earlier on the episode I
8636000	8638000	apologize but um
8638000	8640000	I wanted to know what your thoughts are
8640000	8642000	on the whole
8642000	8644000	vera controversy with
8644000	8646000	no male bunny boys for Final Fantasy
8646000	8648000	14 because I know that you
8648000	8650000	played a lot of Final Fantasy
8650000	8652000	11 where uh
8652000	8654000	you know there were only the
8654000	8656000	um the male only race
8656000	8658000	and the female only race and then
8658000	8660000	uh you were at the launch of
8660000	8662000	Final Fantasy 14 too right where we're still
8662000	8664000	gender locked so I kind of wanted to know
8664000	8666000	your perspective on that and uh
8666000	8668000	so I I did address
8668000	8670000	this a little bit on last week's show but that's okay
8670000	8672000	I don't mind um answering the question again now that I've
8672000	8674000	had time to like process my thoughts a little more
8674000	8676000	um I think the big the
8676000	8678000	the reason why I had a really big
8678000	8680000	negative reaction to the fact that they
8680000	8682000	did not do the boy bunnies it's
8682000	8684000	you know sure I was looking forward to Rolling
8684000	8686000	One and all that but also I just
8686000	8688000	thought the Hrothgar that they
8688000	8690000	showed that they did announce just didn't
8690000	8692000	look good like it looked like they were just
8692000	8694000	using the um Rogadin characters
8694000	8696000	but put these like animal masks on them
8696000	8698000	I wasn't really a fan of that like I almost
8698000	8700000	feel like they shifted course
8700000	8702000	part way through it's so
8702000	8704000	weird for Yoshi P to get up on stage
8704000	8706000	and be like this is gonna be the last race
8706000	8708000	this is it and then all of a sudden
8708000	8710000	get up on stage again later and be like okay
8710000	8712000	but we got one more race and this is it
8712000	8714000	and it's just it's just weird but here's the
8714000	8716000	thing I think the reason why the whole thing
8716000	8718000	bothered me it just seemed like this unnecessary
8718000	8720000	change in policy
8720000	8722000	and this has been a thing that was bugging me through
8722000	8724000	a couple things that Final Fantasy 14 has done lately
8724000	8726000	um and the reason why I say unnecessary
8726000	8728000	change in policy is that when Yoshi
8728000	8730000	and his team took over
8730000	8732000	and I want to make very clear a lot of people
8732000	8734000	have been very nasty online about this whole
8734000	8736000	thing and you know I am not about that so
8736000	8738000	like do not cyberbully people that work hard
8738000	8740000	to bring you games but I can say
8740000	8742000	I don't agree with this decision and this is
8742000	8744000	why when they originally took over
8744000	8746000	Realm Reborn you you
8746000	8748000	nailed it in 11 they
8748000	8750000	had this um the Mythra
8750000	8752000	which became the Mikote they were gender locked to women
8752000	8754000	only and then they had the Galka
8754000	8756000	or now they became Rogadin that were gender locked to men
8756000	8758000	only and they decided when they didn't
8758000	8760000	Realm Reborn they were like you know what we're listening to the fans
8760000	8762000	and we didn't really get the
8762000	8764000	point of the gender lock so you know what
8764000	8766000	eh we're gonna get rid of the gender lock and
8766000	8768000	give the fans what they want so
8768000	8770000	it seems weird to me that they would do
8770000	8772000	that and then suddenly come out
8772000	8774000	and say but you know what the Viera
8774000	8776000	are only gonna be females because
8776000	8778000	the lore that's the way the lore
8778000	8780000	is you know if you played Final Fantasy 12
8780000	8782000	you know it's the men stay in the
8782000	8784000	shadows and they're in hiding and it's like
8784000	8786000	bitch you write the lore
8786000	8788000	if you don't
8788000	8790000	like the lore fix it
8790000	8792000	like it's very easy
8792000	8794000	for you to do this and if you
8794000	8796000	want to talk about the lore
8796000	8798000	well they've directly connected the
8798000	8800000	Hrothgar to
8800000	8802000	Ronso and I believe
8802000	8804000	in Final Fantasy 10 somebody
8804000	8806000	correct me if I'm wrong there were
8806000	8808000	female Ronso in
8808000	8810000	Final Fantasy 10 I mean didn't
8810000	8812000	Kilmari have a wife or something
8812000	8814000	like I'm almost talking about it
8814000	8816000	yeah so like
8816000	8818000	it's so even worse
8818000	8820000	your plan B solution
8820000	8822000	is not lore
8822000	8824000	accurate and this also
8824000	8826000	just ties in the reason why I say this isn't unique
8826000	8828000	to the races in Final Fantasy 14
8828000	8830000	is it it kind of ties into the whole
8830000	8832000	problems of Blue Mage right
8832000	8834000	they had to make Blue Mage a limited
8834000	8836000	job because oh that was that's the
8836000	8838000	lore that's the way we remember playing them in Final Fantasy
8838000	8840000	5 and it's like you
8840000	8842000	Final Fantasy 14 is a new entry
8842000	8844000	in the series you have every right to
8844000	8846000	rewrite some lore like you
8846000	8848000	can make Blue Mage like take some of the
8848000	8850000	basic components of Blue Mage like oh
8850000	8852000	they learn spells from monsters and
8852000	8854000	like do your own thing with it
8854000	8856000	like they did the last time you had an MMO
8856000	8858000	in Final Fantasy 11 it came out great
8858000	8860000	in 11 so why
8860000	8862000	why this dude like it doesn't
8862000	8864000	so I will give
8864000	8866000	them credit they do seem to be
8866000	8868000	hearing the feedback pretty loud and clear
8868000	8870000	and I think they will probably
8870000	8872000	ultimately patch in the
8872000	8874000	the you know the male
8874000	8876000	bunnies and the female Rothgar later on
8876000	8878000	but it just seemed like it just like
8878000	8880000	why why all of a sudden are we
8880000	8882000	inventing these rules that like we have to
8882000	8884000	follow these old established
8884000	8886000	patterns like Final Fantasy
8886000	8888000	14 made a name for
8888000	8890000	itself by taking the pattern
8890000	8892000	that had been established by Final Fantasy 11
8892000	8894000	and smashing it so
8894000	8896000	break the rules
8896000	8898000	Yoshi you earned it
8898000	8900000	that's my thought
8900000	8902000	all right well thank
8902000	8904000	you for sharing your thoughts
8904000	8906000	you're welcome sharing
8906000	8908000	is caring I have a lot of feelings quickly
8908000	8910000	what are your thoughts you're a 14 player what are
8910000	8912000	your thoughts
8912000	8914000	you know I was going
8914000	8916000	to make I was going to consider
8916000	8918000	changing my aura into a bunny
8918000	8920000	boy but I really like my
8920000	8922000	aura so it kind of made that
8922000	8924000	decision easier I don't know I mean
8924000	8926000	I understand why people are upset
8926000	8928000	but
8928000	8930000	you know on the other
8930000	8932000	hand it is just a game
8932000	8934000	so yeah I don't know
8934000	8936000	it is I had my moment
8936000	8938000	I inhaled exhaled
8938000	8940000	and I played 14 you had your own touch moment
8940000	8942000	hunty yeah I did I had to feel my oats

8976000	8978000	only because I've got like this headache coming on
8978000	8980000	and we're already almost 20
8980000	8982000	minutes past nine o'clock because some of the tech issues
8982000	8984000	at the beginning so I do kind of want to start
8984000	8986000	to wrap up but I do want to make sure if there's any other big
8986000	8988000	stories we get those out as well yeah I'll try
8988000	8990000	to be very quick Sega announced

9028000	9030000	let's see
9030000	9032000	also
9032000	9034000	that guy
9034000	9036000	Tyler Barris
9036000	9038000	who was a swatter that got an
9038000	9040000	innocent man killed over a
9040000	9042000	mall
9042000	9044000	in a monetary bet of Call of Duty
9044000	9046000	he got sentenced to 20 years
9046000	9048000	in prison over that
9048000	9050000	that's what you get for being shit
9050000	9052000	he pled to I think like 50 counts
9052000	9054000	of I don't remember
9054000	9056000	false reports
9056000	9058000	I don't remember exactly what the charges were
9058000	9060000	but 20 years surprise manslaughter
9060000	9062000	isn't on there yeah I'm surprised
9062000	9064000	too and then of course
9064000	9066000	not to be outdone by PlayStation and
9066000	9068000	Microsoft had their ID
9068000	9070000	at
9070000	9072000	Xbox Game Pass
9072000	9074000	web video and
9074000	9076000	so they announced several games
9076000	9078000	that are going to be coming to Game Pass
9078000	9080000	day one including Killer Queen
9080000	9082000	Black, Outer Wilds, and
9082000	9084000	Blazing Chrome
9084000	9086000	and those are going to be
9086000	9088000	the same day as they launch
9088000	9090000	and those will be out before the
9090000	9092000	end of 2019 they had other ones
9092000	9094000	on the list as well but I don't remember
9094000	9096000	all of those
9096000	9098000	but it's neat to see that they're going to be
9098000	9100000	supporting more indies that way
9100000	9102000	that's pretty much it
9102000	9104000	ok thanks
9104000	9106000	Loki for holding down the fort while I ran
9106000	9108000	off to get a glass of water to try to make myself
9108000	9110000	feel better with this little headache I've got going on
9110000	9112000	again I want to apologize to those that didn't get through
9112000	9114000	but please feel free to send us an email for a future week
9114000	9116000	participate at orangelandtrady.com
9116000	9118000	but it is that part of the show where we go
9118000	9120000	around and get everybody's final thoughts
9120000	9122000	so since I see Dark Sakura finishing a chocolate there
9122000	9124000	I'll start with Loki, Loki your final thought tonight
9124000	9126000	my final thought is I gotta finish
9126000	9128000	over all these edits onto my cabinet
9128000	9130000	so I've got 8 down and probably
9130000	9132000	another 20 left
9132000	9134000	it's a lot
9134000	9136000	but it'll be new stuff to play
9136000	9138000	and they don't look easy at all
9138000	9140000	alright, sounds like much
9140000	9142000	including a Legend of Max
9142000	9144000	edit by Gatton
9144000	9146000	so that's, I'm not looking
9146000	9148000	forward to that, but I'm going to play it
9148000	9150000	let's see my final thought is
9150000	9152000	headaches are crap
9152000	9154000	and I hope this one goes away soon
9154000	9156000	I'm ready to take a nap
9156000	9158000	but at this late hour that would mean just go to bed
9158000	9160000	so that's what I'll be doing pretty soon here
9160000	9162000	as soon as we wrap up
9162000	9164000	Dark Sakura, excuse me, last but not least
9164000	9166000	your final thought
9166000	9168000	I've had a constant headache since the beginning of February
9168000	9170000	and I found out why
9170000	9172000	so
9172000	9174000	I just want some
9174000	9176000	good vibes, do not pray for me
9176000	9178000	because
9178000	9180000	prayer without action is nothing
9180000	9182000	but I would appreciate some good thoughts
9182000	9184000	unless you're a witch
9184000	9186000	then you can cast a good spell for my neck
9186000	9188000	but other than that
9188000	9190000	I'm about to go to Walmart on
9190000	9192000	purpose to buy the
9192000	9194000	machines that we're missing
9194000	9196000	we actually are missing Dig Dug
9196000	9198000	they had a couple more of those, I think they had a couple more
9198000	9200000	of both the ones I bought yesterday, so I think you should be fine
9200000	9202000	we already have the Ms. Pac-Man, but we don't have the Galaga
9202000	9204000	so I'll be going back for Galaga
9204000	9206000	Galaga is the target collection
9206000	9208000	no, but there was another Galaga
9208000	9210000	actually, Dan looked them up
9210000	9212000	so apparently there's a Galaga in that series now
9212000	9214000	he's still like number 9
9214000	9216000	I'll look at it, we'll see
9216000	9218000	but also chocolate is amazing
9218000	9220000	and one last important thing
9220000	9222000	for everybody, there's only one you
9222000	9224000	in this world, take care of yourself
9224000	9226000	alright
9226000	9228000	take care of yourself everybody
9228000	9230000	we will see you, we're going to do this all again in
9230000	9232000	7 days, have a wonderful night everybody
