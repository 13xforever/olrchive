We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:15.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, the week of PAX East brought us new game reveals and new ways of revealing game news, but it seems one way of purchasing those games may be seeing big changes. All this tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 770 for this, March the 31st of 2019.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh, hi.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Hi, how are you doing?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Here's my foot.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Alright, there's your foot.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm actually fairly accomplished.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Good.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I've had a week that good things have happened in.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
That's good.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Well, I've been open with, you know, my surgery.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Uh-huh.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I fit into a size two this week.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Congrats.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm like, I've never been a size two. Maybe when I was six.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
So.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, good job.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
And I also made dandelion cookies.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
You did. I've been eating them. They're pretty, they don't really taste like a lot like, maybe it's like a hint. It's like that, it's like just the.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
It's meant to be subtle.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, it's a very subtle, subtle. So it doesn't taste like you're like actually eating flowers.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
But they're edible the same way that rose petals are.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
So there you go.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
And good for you. Lots of beta carotene.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
She's just, she's just, you know, playing a prank on us.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
It's really their spider legs.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
But you know, I'm just going to eat them.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Then they have protein.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Actually, I'm most impressed.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Loki doesn't usually eat food from strangers.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm not a stranger.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
But still, even us, he doesn't.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I am strange.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
He doesn't.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
He doesn't normally eat baked goods of that nature.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, no, he.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
But thank you for eating my cookie.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
He eats what he brings and that's that.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
What did you bring today?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
A sandwich from, really.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Sandwich is good.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Because it took them forever to make the sandwich.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
They have to tell me the story about how they ran out of all the other bread types.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm like, I don't fucking care.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Just make my sandwich faster.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Hold on, I have to wrap it four or five times.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
It's like, we're just going to open it anyways.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Look for a recipe online and they talk about their family history.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And all of the things that go into it.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And they're like, I want the fucking recipe.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You want the sandwich, I want the recipe.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I would say this is one of those socially acceptable times where you are able to say,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
get over there and make me a sandwich.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Because you are in a sandwich shop.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
So, it's a little more socially acceptable to be able to do that.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, I did the new modern way of shopping today.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I ordered everything online and just went and picked it up.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
How convenient.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It's for grocery shopping.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
I don't know if I would want to replace all my shopping with that method.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
My neighbors have theirs delivered.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I do buy a lot of stuff online.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, it's just we buy the same things every week.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
What are we going to do with all this commercially zoned space?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
We've all stopped going to stores and things.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I don't know. Okay.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And this does tie into games.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Because we are a show that talks about video games, gaming news, gaming culture, and so forth.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
voguesnetwork.com, which is also available on Twitch,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
twitch.tv slash voguesnetwork.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And I do apologize because I can see as we are streaming tonight,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
we're losing a lot of frames as we upload.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
We haven't, there's nothing unusual going on in the studio.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
We just unfortunately have some type of bad internet connection.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
So, as we would usually do when we were recording this as an audio only podcast,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
we're going to push through for the sake of the actual podcast

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
and just hope it kind of comes back.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Because it looks like the internet is doing one of those things

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
where it's kind of coming and going.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
But unfortunately, like, yes, we've shut off all our background downloads.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
None of the other computers are on.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
It just, it is what it is. So.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
No, we're just doing the robot during the show. That's fine.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Right. Yeah. So, unfortunately, guys, there's not a lot I can do about that,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
which really stinks because we are trying to attract some more viewers

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
and get more people here to join us on Twitch.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
So, it kind of sucks when things that are out of your control

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
are preventing that from happening, but what can you do?

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
So, anyway, let's, let's, what else was I going to, gosh, I got off track.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
I was, oh, speaking of games, okay, so this has to do with the delivery

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and all that stuff. So, and this never happens,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
but Alan and I last night were like, let's go to Walmart.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
And I never go to Walmart, okay, specifically that store.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I usually go to Target. But for some reason, it was like,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
oh, we haven't been there in a long time.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And I was like, I wonder if they've released any new of those mini arcade games

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
because they have that mini collectible series that is over there.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Let me actually, I'm going to stand up and grab one of these.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So, they have these mini collectibles. And yes, this one is new

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
that I picked up yesterday. So, this is this arcade classics collection.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
I've only seen these at Walmart. I've seen a similar type at Target,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
but I haven't seen the specific same arcade classics library.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I might be stopping by then. Is it the LCD screen or the?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
It is. It's the nicer screen. You can play with that if you want.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
I'll just go buy one. This is Ms. Pac-Man, is the one for the podcast folks that can't see it.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
I picked up a Ms. Pac-Man machine because I thought they might have a new one I didn't have yet.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And I was right, they have Ms. Pac-Man. And then I also picked up Dig Dug.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
And what's interesting about Dig Dug. But you already have Dig Dug.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I do have Dig Dug in the Target collection.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
So, Target has the my arcade and Walmart has the arcade classics

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
and Dig Dug thus far is the only game that I know of that exists in both.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So, now I have two.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Which is better?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I haven't extensively played the arcade classic ones yet.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So, anyway, I told that whole story because my point was

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
that's probably not something we would have done if we hadn't like thought

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
oh, let's actually go to Walmart, let's go in there and actually go shopping and all that good stuff.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So, there is still benefits going on in person.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And then of course not only was it that, but it was like

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
oh, they have the potato chips and all the different flavors

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
like the hot pickle that we couldn't find anywhere else.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
That's where I found the beer cheese flavor.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, I didn't realize that like Walmart is the place to go for the

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
and I'm not endorsing him, but appears to be the place to go to find all that flavor filled stuff.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Because the banana frosted flakes I can't find anywhere else now was there.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
So, Dan says that by the way the Ms. Pac-Man and the Dig Dug and the Fix-It Felix are not new.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh, interesting.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
They're new to me.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Oh, they're new to me.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, I'm just saying that apparently

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I think it was the Ms. Pac-Man one I couldn't find for you.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, because they're all numbered.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
And so Fix-It Felix, which Jamie got for me when she was at, is number 12.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
So, I knew there was one missing. I knew there was an 11 that I was missing.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes, and I think that Dan had found, maybe Dan found that one and I didn't see it.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
But yeah, I had remembered.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
And I checked with Dan because I was like, do we have those?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Because I have no idea what the crap we own anymore.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And then Dig Dug was number 13.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So, we need more.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, I know.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Look, it's like filling up that top shelf.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I have to clean off another shelf space so I have room to put all these mini arcade games.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
And at some point I'll have to do a YouTube or something to show off these different little collectibles.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Because they are really cute.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
For the folks on the podcast that don't have the benefit of the visual, they're really tiny little machines.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
They're like the size of, I don't know, like half a shoebox.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I think a She-Ra doll could play them.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Probably. Actually, yes, you could probably pose like your Barbie dolls and your G.I. Joe dolls in front of them.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Or a couple transformers.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And it would look legit. Yeah, so they're fun.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Anyway, let's get into some news.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
There's a lot of gaming news that has happened this past week.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
We have a lot of ground to cover tonight.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
So I'm going to throw it right over to Loki, if you are willing to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
No!

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah, so this is not a big surprise to me because I always looked at, when they had these available in stores,

08:06.000 --> 08:17.000
like, why would I buy this versus, you know, buying the physical copy or buying it digitally on sale through the store.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
I just didn't understand the purpose of having these cards to buy digital versions of the games.

08:22.000 --> 08:31.000
Now, granted, Sony is now removing these from stores, but there are still other companies that have digital codes there.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
For example, Nintendo has a lot of these different indie games that are available that you can purchase by digital code.

08:39.000 --> 08:48.000
But you think about it though, usually if you're purchasing digital, you're not going to the store because it's more convenient that way.

08:48.000 --> 08:56.000
Or you're buying it on sale, which this card is never going to be on sale because it's a digital copy.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
And it's specifically a certain amount that the vendor paid for that.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
They're not normally going to discount those.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Once in a great while, but it's usually a large region.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
It's very rare that that happens.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
Funny enough, sorry, just quickly, on the Walmart topic, since it is newsworthy, I set foot willingly in one.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And I was like, wow, all these things are different than what I remember.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
One of them was, the section for these cards and games on cards is huge.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Like half what I remember used to be the glass cases and all that.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I would say a third of that. A third of that is now games on cards.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
And I was kind of like you. I'm like, who's buying games on cards when it's very easy to go on the shop and buy them?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
But gifts was the thing that came to mind.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
You have a lot of people on stuff.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
Well, I guess if you wanted to just buy a card and send it through the mail or something like that to somebody and you wanted to buy them a gift.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
Because you can't really gift digital purchases, I think, on many of the store friends.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
That's something you could do, but at the same time, just buy them a points card and have them pick out whatever they want.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Grandma's not going to know that.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
And I can kind of see, especially like Minecraft, okay?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Minecraft is a card.

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
Grandma's not going to know, but Grandma's going to know, oh, Minecraft is the thing that kids are into, so I'm going to pick this up.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I think you're not giving enough grandmothers credit.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Grandmothers now are seriously, like, some of them are our age.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
True. I'm not talking about Grandma Skyrim.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
But, you know, I'm talking, you would be surprised.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You know what? Obviously.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Like, maybe the great grandmothers won't get it.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Okay. Not all grandmas.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
But you know what I'm getting at, right? I'm talking about that crowd.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Maybe what we think of as our grandparents never really understood.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
Now, that's not necessarily true because I had to set up an Alexa for, or an Echo for my father-in-law.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
So not everybody's going to understand what these cards are.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So, I just didn't understand why they're there.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
Bobby's yapping in our chat, although I enjoy it here, over at, of course, twitch.tv slash vog network.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
But he's bringing up some points that are worth reading here.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
So Bobby Black Wilson in our chat saying, they're great for gifting digital games.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
I've bought people digital codes of games rather than just sending them $60.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Also, you can't get a $60 point card.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
You can get a $50 card and a $20 card.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
So it sounds like a little bit like those dollar amounts might be kind of like, I don't know, the hot dogs versus the hot dog buns.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
They're uneven.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
You get a $50 card that doesn't really cover the cost of the game.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
Also, you know that you're, you know that little Jimmy, going back to my grandma example,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
you know that little Jimmy's not going to take your $50 gift card and spend it on porn.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
Because you may not understand that porn isn't available, but you know what I'm getting at, right?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
You want a little more control over what exactly that kid is getting.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
Now, Bobby's also bringing up the story that I know he's talked about on his show about mother-in-law kind of messed up trying to do the digital games

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
because she created a PSN account to buy me some PS4 games and then learned he couldn't play them

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
because she just didn't understand how the system worked.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
But she knew, oh, if I go to the PlayStation store, this is the cheapest place to get them.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
So she did, but now they're on her account.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
So it's, and it's, he's been writing all these tweets, like they will not refund the money.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
They're being sticklers about it.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Can't you just sign in under her account and then like download them and then?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't think, because he got it.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
He used to share accounts like that.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, keep in mind, Bobby's house, there's multiple PlayStations and things going on,

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
and he's married and the wife is a gamer, so they probably have separate accounts.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm not going to overanalyze the situation.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
He said it wouldn't work the way it was, I believe it.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Okie doke.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
But anyway, back to the point of these cards.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
So anyways, April 1st is going to be where they're going to stop selling these cards.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
No, that's not really a joke.

12:57.000 --> 13:04.000
It's basically, you know, they're not going to be offered through SIE's Global Digital Retail Program.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
The decision was made in order to align key businesses globally

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
to support full games and premium editions.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
SIE will continue or introduce increased denominations

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
that select retailers, DLC and add-ons, virtual currency.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Season passes will still be available.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
So there you go.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So now your complaint was that they didn't have those large amounts for the cards.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Now they're going to offer those instead of just specific games.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
And that makes sense, because if you think about it,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
I offer like a download for a specific indie title.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Maybe that title's not popular anymore.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And now it's just, you can't sell it.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
Whereas if it's a, say, $60 card or something like that, then you can buy it.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
What about, like, the fact that it seems with this,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Sony might be trying to bring this in-house

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
and force digital transactions to go through their own store?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Well, it doesn't sound like that that's the case.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I think it's more of an issue that it's just that they're going to,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
that maybe these didn't sell that well.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Instead, they're going to address the need in different ways

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
so that you can buy those points and then purchase them through this,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
you know, purchase your games through the store once you have those points.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
So there's more flexibility there.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I think that it makes sense, because think about it.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Instead of printing several different types of cards,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
you can just print the one card,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
and then you can use it for multiple things versus just having all this.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
It reduces shelf space.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
It reduces the need, the extra cost of manufacturing that stuff.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
And it's giving the consumer what they truly want out of that.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Instead of buying three $20 cards,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
you just have one for a full retail price of a game.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
So it sounds like they're still going to be doing, like, you know,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
DLC and add-ons, different currencies and stuff like that, season passes.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
That's another thing you see quite a bit of.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
So the trending page, if you go to Recruitment on Monolith Sauce website,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
you see this Zelda-filled page.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
But here's the thing, I think a lot of people,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
there's a lot of, like, big jumps to conclusions people are making here.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
For one, on the internet?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Anyway, for one, of course they're making a fucking Zelda game.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Of course they're going to make another Zelda.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Of course another Zelda.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I mean, would Nintendo just decide, you know what, we're done.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Well, they are making several Zelda games.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
It's not like we're talking about F-Zero here.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
I know, it's like, Zelda, you get three games, F-Zero.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Zelda, you get more games.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
F-Zero never happens.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Metroid, you get some more games too.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
F-Zero, you get Falcon Punch.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
F-Zero, we're going to, you know what,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
there's these indie guys that are doing this Super HD Racing game.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I can't remember the name of it in the moment.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
What's the big game on Switch that they...

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Fast Neo, Neo Racing, that one.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
And no shade towards that game because it's great,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
but clearly Nintendo's like, oh, we got that, we don't need F-Zero.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
It's all about the Mario Kart now.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
But anyway.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Mario, you're going to get more games.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Yoshi, you're going to get a ton of games.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And, uh...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Excite Truck.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Anyways.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
We hate racing games is what they need to basically say.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You know what, they just need to make a Zelda racing game.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Are you Mario Kart? No. Sorry.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Anyway.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
But here's the other thing.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I think some of y'all forgot.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Like, oh my gosh.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Is the next Zelda going to be like Xenoblade?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Is that what's happening?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Because, like, Monolith's doing... Well, hold on.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Monolith's hiring for positions that are related to the Zelda project.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Y'all might have forgot.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Monolith helped on Breath of the Wild.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
OK?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I'm like, dear people on the internet, calm by tits.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Calm it.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I mean, maybe they are doing a little more.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
It's not like Nintendo is unheard of to seek out third party support.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
For example, what, Namco fucking

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
lended a hand on Smash Brothers, right?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Am I crazy on that?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't think you're crazy.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
So anyway.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
You know what else they lended their hand on?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
F-Zero!

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Where's my F-Zero, Namco?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Of course, they don't make racing games either.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
So, you know, I guess.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Monolith did the maps, I believe.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
The landscape, the environment, I think

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
was a big thing that Monolith did.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And based on how most of y'all felt

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
about Breath of the Wild, myself included,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I think we would like Monolith to keep doing that.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
They did a pretty fucking good job.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah, Monolith.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Was it them or Nintendo that came up with

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
the weapon durability?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
The weapon durability is not

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
a bad mechanic, OK?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It was a little much.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I just wish there was a way you could

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
tone it down. So maybe things break

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
a little less often.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
That's why you have to hurry up and get the fucking mouse.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I want it to tone down to zero.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I don't want it in there.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
It would be nice if maybe there's a mode

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
where you can just turn off the...

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Hardcore mode. Call it hardcore.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Oh no, I'm thinking the opposite.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Master mode. I want Bobby Black Wolf

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
BFF mode where nothing breaks.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
And you already know all the recipes

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
and all that stuff. You just go out there

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and eventually... You know what? You don't have to know the recipes

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
as long as you know the combination.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
That's true. I have an internet.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Dan got me a cookbook.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The Breath of the Wild cookbook.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It's not a legit cookbook. It's just

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
the in-game cookbook.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Miltonius Games in chat says,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
weapon durability stressed me out.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Same. My heart rate definitely went out

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
playing Zelda.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I like some of the mechanics with the weapon durability.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I loved Breath of the Wild.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
If I could change one thing,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
that was the one thing where I'm like, OK.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
If you got a shitty little sword,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
you could use it as a projectile.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Or having

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
the wooden weapons if it was...

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I thought it was a neat addition.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I did, but that was better.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
But you know what should not be changed ever?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
The fairies were fantastic.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And the horse fairy.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
What were they called? The little mariachi things

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
that would increase your health and stamina?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Oh, the yaha!

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
The ones that you had to steal their poops.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Can you do that noise again?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Yaha!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I actually have that as

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
a sound tone on my phone.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Corox.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That's it. That's it.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And you had to collect their poop.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
The seeds.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Their poops.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And you get a giant turd out of it.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I'm sure not going to be poop

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
is another Zelda game, especially if Monolith

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
is fulfilling a very similar role.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Honestly, would anyone be disappointed

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
if they just did Breath of the Wild

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
like a very similar type

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
of game, but like a new map

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
and a couple new mechanics

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
but basically it's Breath of the Wild 2?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Would anyone really be disappointed

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
if Nintendo put out that game? Because I don't think I would be.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You know what I would want, even though they said

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
they're not going to do any more DLC for the game?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I would want the world rebuilding mode.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Like, almost sim-like.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
You know? Or just different quests and stuff.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Because, I mean,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Zelda, poor Zelda,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
is coming back 100 years later after

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
you know, basically making Ganon her bitch.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
And then it's like,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
my house sucks. It's torn up.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I don't know anybody in this world.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
We need to rebuild my kingdom here.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
No, no, no.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
That's just Actraiser at that point, then.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Exactly!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm okay with that, TDH.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Let's see, VGRealness says

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
they are 100% going to use that engine again.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I agree.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
That engine's amazing.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm hearing it'll be Breath of the Wild 2 if not that exact name.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
No, it won't be the same name.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Why would they do that now?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
They never do the same name.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
But, I mean, if you look at Ocarina of Time

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Majora's Mask, I mean,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
was the engine really that different?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I mean, sure, you had the big moon.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
They were the same engine, and it played

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
very similar. And that's kind of more what I'm talking about.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
And Majora's Mask started off as a different game

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
using that engine.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Oh, right, right. I think I'd heard that too.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It's true. Anyway.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
NinjaBunny in chat says,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I didn't like Breath of the Wild at all.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Ooh, she's different!

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Descenting opinion?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Descenting opinion? No, I'm not

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
trying to give you crap. But there's always

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
one in the room, right? But that's okay.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
You know what? Here's the thing.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Everybody's got that controversial

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
gaming opinion hot take.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And people are entitled to be wrong.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And mine is Zelda related too.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Mine is that Ocarina of Time

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
is not what you all make it out to be.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Is it a good game?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Yes. Is it the game

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
y'all hold it up as?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
For a lot of people though, it was their big

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
thing. Like,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
for me, and Dan will disagree,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
but I think Link to the Past is the best.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I would play Link to the Past any day

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
of the week, but maybe that's a GenX

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
thing, I don't know. Or

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
gamers of a certain age.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Yeah, everyone. GenX exists.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Cater to us. Alright. Anyway.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
NinjaBunny in chat says,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I'm a guy, Rob. Gender is merely a suggestion.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Come on, it's 2019.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Um, let's see. Are you that insecure

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
in your masculinity?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
There's also a quote, but I don't expect

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
everybody to know the quote that I gave there.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm also being silly. Bobby Blackwolf in chat

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
says, popular opinion Super Metroid

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
is not all that. See, everybody's got that

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
one wrong-ass gaming opinion

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
that they express once in a while.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And those people should just not

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
express them. It's like with

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
the zit. You're not really supposed to

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
express them. Every gamer has a voice

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
starts off. I know, I'm being that bitch

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
tonight. Some of us have to scream a little louder.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Okay. Anyway. And some people

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
just need to scream.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
In all seriousness, let's move on to another story that's also

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
retro latest stuff, right?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Doth it be my turn to speak?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Yes, I think so.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Well, once again

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
we have another attempt

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
at a little teeny Sega Genesis.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
In this case,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
it is going to be

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
the, um, basically

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
like a Genesis mini.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I guess that's what they're calling it, yeah.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
So, um,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
it's going to have, uh,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
40 classic games installed. I hate

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
that they say fucking pre-installed

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
because you're just fucking installing it.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
You're not, like, installing it before

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
you're installing it. But it's locked.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's pre-installed because they're installed

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
before you get the console and you can't

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
install more on them. Allegedly.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Allegedly. Exactly. That's not gonna last

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
fucking long. Um, but the other

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
games that are included on there is, of course,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Sonic the Hedgehog, Echo the Dolphin, Toejam,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
and Earl. Um, a few

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
ones on there is Castlevania

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Bloodline, Space Harrier 2.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Sega's doing a retro collection

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and Sonic is a part of it.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Can I finish reading my fucking article, Rob?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I guess.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Shining Force, Dr. Robotnik's Bean Bean Machine,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Comic Zone, Altered Beast, and Gunstar Heroes!

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Awesome!

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Um, the one hope

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
that I have for this is that it's actually

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Sega behind it and

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
not outsourced, like the last

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
disastrous attempt.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Okay, because that's what I was actually gonna

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
bring up, was that, wait a minute, we've had

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Genesis, well, they're not minis,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
but you know what I mean, we've had Genesis available

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
at stores, Genesize,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Mega Drive,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
we've had, hey,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Genesis, um,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
but we've had the Genesis

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
stuff available at retail,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
the retro stuff, for quite some time

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
now. I believe they have, like, a

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
TV type and they have an on-the-go

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
type. You can buy one now for

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
$25.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Those are probably all bargain basement right now because of

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
this other news, but,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
so this is special because

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Sega is

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
like, policing it,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
basically. Sega better be the

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
one releasing it.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I mean, like, fully behind

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
all the programming, because we've had some just shit

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
emulation in the past. But, why is

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
the controller only have three buttons, and why

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
is it not the six button controller?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
What?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
They're wired.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
If Street Fighter isn't on it, you don't need six buttons.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That's probably not true. There's other six button games

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm not thinking of, but that's obviously the big

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
one. Uh, Dartetsuya in chat

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
says, as far as I know, it's in-house developed.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Hell, I heard that Yuzo Koshiro

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
is composing the menu music. Oh, shit,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
if that's true, sign me

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
the fuck up. 70 of them. Right?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Fucking love Yuzo Koshiro.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I mean, he would give us our streets of rage.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, I mean,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
there would definitely be a precedent for him to be involved,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
but I did not hear that.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Anyway. But anything

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
that comes with it are, is the

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
console, two wired controllers,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
um, a USB power adapter,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
a power cable, and an HDMI cable.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
So,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
sweet.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Now, Akdeft in chat is pointing out, the

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Mega Drive Mini in Japan is

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
getting the six button controller.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Well, then I'm gonna import mine instead.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Um, now, you know, though,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
this actually goes kinda along

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
with this, is that a few weeks ago

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
there was a, um,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
a survey

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
that was put out

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
about for, you know, what would you want to see

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
as far as merchandise and games.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And the ones that they were listing

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
on there were the Shining series

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
were Puyo Puyo,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
you know, were a lot of those

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
games that we're seeing on here.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Gunstar Heroes, a lot of it.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
You know, and so I wonder

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
if that survey might have been

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
related to this.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I took it, you know.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Maybe. Because I want all the Puyo Puyo.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And what's funny is that I love that

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
they listed it as Puyo Puyo.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
And not as Puyo Pop or whatever the crap.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I wish the console port actually opened

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
up and I wish they had the expansion port on the bottom so we can get

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Mini 32Xs and Mini

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Sega CDs. That would be kinda rad.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
The other thing about that survey is that they were

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
talking about originally Japanese only

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
franchises.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And Questbuster points out, I did that survey too,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
they were talking about some old properties like Panzer Dragoon.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Well, but the thing is that when they were

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
putting the list of have you played these games

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
in the series, they were going

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
to Japanese only ones. Like, they

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
listed, like, I do want to say

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
that they listed the PC Engine

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Puyo Puyo among them. Puyo Puyo

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Sun, which never came out over here.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
So it was fairly interesting.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I think they're finally recognizing that there

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
are importers who have been fans

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
for a while. Sia Tabiri in

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
the chat says, would you guys want a 32X

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Mini? Yeah.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Because, I mean, it had some of the best arcade ports.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I want a Saturn Mini. Yes.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Or a Dreamcast

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Mini. I'll take either one. I'll take both.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I would. Or either one.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I mean, chances are I probably already have

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
everything that I would want on both, but.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
So none of y'all are Mini

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
systemed out? This Genesis thing sounds

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Well, I didn't bother with the PlayStation

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Mini because the emulation was

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
garbage. I didn't bother with it either just because

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
of the choices they made. I found NES

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Classics at Target

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
a couple weeks ago. Oh, really? For full retail.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Pick those up while you can

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
if you want one because they're not coming

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
back. I already have one. Yeah, I've already

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
got an SNES Classic that I packed the

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
bits in. I think

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
that's why they're not coming back. Zero.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Nintendo's not happy with how fast those got

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
ripped open. Well, on top of that,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
legit, all you need

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
is the old console and an EverDrive.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
The end. The end.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I mean, if you're going to put data on those chips,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
you're going to be able to get data

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
off of those chips. Well, and the other

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
advantage to having, though, the classic

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
series would be the HDMI support

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
with no input lag.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
That's that. Well, let's

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
move on to another story.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Loki, another another blast from the

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
past of sorts, right? Yes. And this is

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
kind of an odd odd one here, but

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
apparently Dance Central is

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
being ported to the Oculus Rift

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
and apparently the Oculus Quest

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
as well. Why

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
is so the keep it going?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I don't know how that's going to work. I'm assuming

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
that they're just going to track the arm motions

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
using the controllers. Kind of

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
similar how, I guess, Just Dance does it

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
with phones

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
or I guess it's all phones nowadays.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
They don't really use the move controllers

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
or Wii remotes or

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
whatever the hell they have. Oh, you

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
mean the move dildos? Yep.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So they're going

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
to be porting

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
that over. It says it's going to

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
be exclusive on both of those platforms.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
This will be the first time

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
it's been on another platform

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
other than the Xbox. They haven't

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
given any sort of

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
specifics on

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
what's going to be included with it, if it's going to

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
include songs from the first three games

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
or if it's just going to be the first game or whatever

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
the hell it is.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
But it's interesting

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
to see this. I'm curious

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
to see how it's actually going to work, being that

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
the game, I don't know,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I guess you'd just see your avatar dancing

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
or something, but

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
it'll be interesting to see how this works.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And also kind of curious

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
to the fact that

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
they're going to port

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
this to VR, but I'm surprised they didn't go the route

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
of, say, a Just Dance

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
game, where

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
since they're just using

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I would imagine, not necessarily head tracking,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
but they're using just the arm tracking.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
So you could essentially

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
do just a Just Dance

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
game, but with Dance Central and port it

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
to other systems,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
we'll have to see how it works, I guess.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Yeah, when I was reading about this, I was kind of thinking

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
like, gosh, this sounds really

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
cool, but if it was

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
like PSVR, that thing is kind of like a

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
beast to have on your head. And it's one

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
thing if you're playing something like Beat Saber

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
where, I don't know, my head

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
is staying pretty stationary. Sure, I do the bobs

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
up and down and things like that, but from what I remember

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
of Dance Central is that you were doing real

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
dances, and I just think with that whole

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
contraption...

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It's pretty heavy, yeah. But, doesn't

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Oculus, and aren't they trying to scale it back to more

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
just like goggles that you basically strap

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
on your face? Isn't that what the Oculus

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Go and some of the... The Go is,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I don't know how light it is, but it's

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
similar to, I think...

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Again, I think it's one of those things that as technology

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
advances, it's not like my complaint

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
is not going to be valid anymore because

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
they're not going to be that heavy.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I think, though, for me,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
it would make more sense not to do it

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
just VR because you would want

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
to have it available

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
to as many people as possible

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
that are going to play these games, and I would

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
think that the crowd that's doing Just Dance

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
would want to get into that.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I don't know

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
how this is going to track any more accurately

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
than it would with...

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Unless, I don't think the base stations

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
can track your body movement, aside from

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
if you had sensors on your feet or something like that,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
but... I don't know.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I just think that it would work better

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
if they didn't do it in VR, but we'll have to see.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
And then also, how's that going to look? Because like,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
you know, Just Dance originally,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
or not even Just Dance, Dance Central, the whole

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
point was like, it was Kinect and you were just

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
kind of doing it without any sort of sensors

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
on you, and at least then that way you can

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
record yourself doing it and actually look like you're

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
dancing, but you're kind of looking weird dancing

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
with that giant VR headset on.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I just think it's going to be weird, unless you can do

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
some virtual camera with your avatar or whatever,

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
but...

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Guess you can pretend you're dancing like no one's watching.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I mean, I would be super

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
into this with the control,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
and what you were kind of saying,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
the control mechanism, and that whole

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
thing with either the move, or the

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
similar, and I don't know what the technical name

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
is on the Vive, has those sticks

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
that you hold that kind of feel like a PlayStation

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
move, even though they're so different.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
But you know, I would be all for

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
playing a dance game with that type of stuff

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
that's come a long way since the Kinect,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
and just the fact that technology's advanced,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
but yeah, I don't know about the whole

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
headset part.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I'll try it, but it just seems

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
a little...

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I have to see it to believe this.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Dance Central was so fun.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't know if this is the case, but we're talking

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
motion gaming and stuff like that.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Is it possible to play one of these games

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
that uses the Vive controller

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
without the Vive,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
or without the Oculus Rift,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
just using the motion controllers and just playing

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
a game on your PC monitor or something like that?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
PlayStation can, technically.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So I don't understand, couldn't we do it like that?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
The move was purpose-

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I understand that there's some of those

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
trackers that use the inside-out tracking

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
where it'll actually use the headset,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
but the older stuff

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
uses the base stations. Bobby's trying to explain

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
some of this in chat. There's no more base stations

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
with the Oculus Quest. Oculus Quest is now

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
all inside-out tracking, so

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Oculus Touch, not with the Oculus Quest

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
because the sensors are all in the headset.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
There are no more base stations.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
So it would depend on which piece of technology

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
you're using, basically. I guess. I don't know.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I just think that they would have a better adoption rate

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
with it being outside of VR,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
but I'm curious to see how this plays.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
But also,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Bobby's pointing out that

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Oculus is paying for the

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Dance Central game, and that's

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
why it's exclusive, so it's not something

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
that- Are we not gonna get Kinect Star Wars now?

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
No dancing to the Han Solo?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Or anything like that?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Maybe you can hope for a secret unlock

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
or something in the game. I don't know.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
No? Alright.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Well, moving on. Let's talk about

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
everybody's favorite. It's a rumor,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
but the Wall Street Journal

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
is reporting on this one, so

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
this is one of those rumors that's so loud

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
it's got the attention of the traditional

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
press, and in the case of the Wall Street

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Journal, a lot of investors and people

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
that, you know, keep their eye on the money and such,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
so take with a grain of salt, but

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I know for me, this isn't the first time

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I've heard this rumor, but- We've also thought

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
of similar things. Yes. So anyway,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
here it is. Wall Street Journal is saying that

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Nintendo is looking at doing two

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
new Nintendo Switch models, and

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
one of them could be this summer.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Possibly timed around E3,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I don't know, that's me making that up, but

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I mean, it could be interesting if Nintendo were to

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
say, you know, at E3,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
they're doing their direct, we're looking at doing this

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
new Nintendo Switch, and I don't think they could do

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
the whole, it's in stores today,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
because it's very hard to keep those kinds of secrets anymore,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
especially with physical things, but they could say

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
and it's going to be on shelves

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
next Friday, you know, they could

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
have that type of fast turnaround, maybe.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I'm fanboying a little

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
bit here and making things up, but they could.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Anyway,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
apparently one new Nintendo

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Switch model is going to be enhanced and

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
more powerful than the Switch you have today.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
We're not talking like 4K

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
graphics, we're not talking Xbox

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
One X, we're not talking PlayStation 4 Plus,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
but it's just going to be more powerful

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
than what we have today.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
So far I'm a little worried, because

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
this reeks of new 3DS

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
versus 3DS, and

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
does this mean now we're going to segment the game market?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I hope it's not that,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
but we'll see, I'll give Nintendo the benefit of the doubt,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
after all, this is a rumor. The only thing I could see is

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
maybe that it's a 1080p

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
screen, and they have something to push the graphics

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
1080p portable instead of

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
just, you know,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
720 portable, maybe?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I like that, let's go with that.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
We'll go with that. More games in portable

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
mode running like they were docked.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I like that.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But there's also going to be a second model.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
It's going to be cheaper, because it's going to

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
focus on the handheld mode, meaning

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm assuming to take this to mean there's not

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
really going to be a dock. Nintendo

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
is looking for this to be

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
the successor to the 3DS.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Finally.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Finally.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
The 3DS may finally

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
be done. But I don't understand how they're going to make this

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
any cheaper, though. Well, you get rid of the

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
dock, that's going to be part of it, and then

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
just the fact that it's been a couple years

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
maybe it'll be a little smaller, you know,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
who knows. Maybe the touch,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
maybe they'll eliminate the touch, because not a lot

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
of games really use it, to be fair. I'm making

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
shit up, Nintendo will be the ones

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
to answer this, but there's ways they can scale it back

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
a little bit. Okay.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
But anyway, the Wall Street

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Journal reporter, in the name

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
of the guy that's been talking about this on Wall Street,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
is Takahashi

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Moshizuki, is saying that

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
the different designs of these two Nintendo

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Switch systems are different from the

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
original, and you'd be surprised.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I'm not sure what to take

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
that to mean. Perhaps the actual

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
system may look different.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Perhaps, you know what, Loki, maybe

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
to save on cost, maybe

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
the portable Switch, you can't

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
take off the sides.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Maybe those don't, like it's

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
just something that you can play

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
That's gonna suck.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You know why? It's gonna

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
suck because if those

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Joy-Cons

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
handle dirt

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
and dust and whatever, like the ones I

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
have do, it's gonna suck because they're gonna

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
break and then you're gonna have a whole system to

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
replace. DJ Rama S

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
says, Rob, stop hating on the 3DS.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I'm not hating on the 3DS.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
The 3DS and the DS, therefore,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
have a wonderful, it's so

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
important for the history of portable gaming, and

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
there's a library of amazing games on

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
it that people should play, and if you never touch

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
one, you'll be missing out on some very great

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
experiences. That being said,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Nintendo has a

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
better portable system out now.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
It's been many

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
years, many years since the first

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
DS especially, but to be

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
fair, even quite a few years since the

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
original 3DS, it's time to

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
move on. Like, I

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
just can't think of any other console

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
that's like lasted this long.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I kind of think what Nintendo

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
was doing is after they got burned a little

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
bit with Wii U, they didn't want to put

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
all their eggs in the Switch basket

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
until the Switch was a bona fide success.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Well, guess what, y'all? The Switch

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
is a success. The Fides have been

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
bonuts. The Fides have been bonuts.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
So, therefore,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
they can move on from the

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
3DS now and let its great

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
legacy live on in our

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
hearts and in our retro game collections.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Is that hating on the 3DS?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
No. Alright, I didn't think so.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Alright. Let's see,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
other comments in chat.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Bob Coffee says, I imagine Nintendo will

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
announce a cheap portable, one

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
portable only one for

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Pokemons. You know, that's a great observation.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
If there's any time

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
to release like a mini Switch,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
it's cause of Pokemon. I think

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I think you're, ding, ding, ding,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
winner, winner, Pokemon

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
dinner, because

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
and which Pokemon is up to you? Because

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
it would seem like a

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
given that you would have this

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
bundled with Pokemon

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
like same day, like if Nintendo

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
the mini one will

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
be out with Pokemon. Bank on it.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Bank on it.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Let's see.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
ActDeft in chat says,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
new Switch XL or something like that.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Who knows? Who knows what the actual

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
system will be called. Tiger Claw

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
says, the Switch is a success

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
because it bridges the gap between handheld

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
and console. And the fact that

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
it's just got Nintendo's brand

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
all over it, you know, and

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
going back to like Zelda from earlier.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Like, that's just not a game

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
that exists anywhere else.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
There's things that try to emulate

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
it and come, you know, I mean, certainly you can

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
say, well, Breath of the Wild was

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
inspired by Skyrim, but there's

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
nothing like Breath of the Wild.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
There just, anywhere. There just isn't.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Anyway. Alright, let's move

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
on. Darsakra, what do you

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
got for us? A little more facts.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Things that are actually happening, for sure.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Well, do we remember a particular

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
game that never actually came out called

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Penn and Teller Smoke and Mirrors?

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I think that we do remember

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
this one, because that's what gave us Desert Fucking

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Bus. I was going to say, Desert Bus

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
and the, basically,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
the marathon,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
the charity event, the drive

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
that they do for that every year

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
is because of Smoke and Mirrors, for sure.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Exactly. Well, it looks like

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Penn and Teller are getting back into

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
the tie-in

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
video game stuff.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
So, um, they are

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
going to, and whoever

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
wrote this article that I'm reading it from clearly

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
never knew about the Sega CD game

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and only knew about the Desert Bus Marathon.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
These kids today. So,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
whatever the fuck. Um, anyway,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
so, they did announce at PAX

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
East that Gearbox is going to be

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
working with them to do an Oculus

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
game. Oculus,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
the Vive, the PSVR

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
headset that's going to be called Penn

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
and Teller VR. Frankly, unfair,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
unkind, unnecessary, and underhanded.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I like that.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I do think the name

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
is great. They only have a title and a release date.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Um, which

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I'm looking to see if they put

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
the release date in a stupid article.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Um, but at any rate,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
um, it is going to be

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
developed by Gearbox, so hopefully it will be

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
better than

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Smoke and Mirrors was supposed to be.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Um, but yeah, the one thing

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
they have on here is that it's going to be released in

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
June. They don't actually have the specific date

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
on it. But this, that name is great

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and it's fun to say.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Unfair, unkind, unnecessary, and underhanded.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Yeah, no, I like, the name is great.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I just, I hope that Penn

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
and Teller and the things that they do,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I hope they don't use this as an excuse to make

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
like VR make me sick on purpose

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
type of thing. I hope it's a little,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I hope it's controlled.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Well, and it was always

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
my impression that at least

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Penn doesn't

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
really care for video

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
games that much. So the fact

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
that they are licensing out to do

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
a video game is a little bit beyond me

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
so maybe, well, given

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Do you know what he likes more than games? Money.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah, but they're

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
fairly successful. No, they are. Their show's

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
been at the Rio for eons. Well, on top

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
of that though, they also have, I don't know if they still have

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
that TV show where it's like, they try to

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
fool the magicians.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
But, you know. Oh, yeah.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
And that's pretty fun to watch. I like that they've actually

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
been fooled a couple of times, but

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
not often. But

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
at any rate, you know, it's

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
it's just very interesting and I have

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
a feeling that there's going to be a lot more commentary

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
in this one, you know, down the line.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
So. Now, I

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
sorry, I was gonna say, I know you're not

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
a big VR person because of the motion

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
and, you know, some of the other things that you deal with, but

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
if there is a

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
well, I guess there already was an, I see Bobby saying in the chat,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
there already was a Desert Bus VR, but let's

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
say it's a Desert

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Desert Double Decker

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Bus VR. Would you give it a try?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
No. No. Because I won't play a VR game.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
It was worth a shot.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I'll play it. I'll try it.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I actually was trying to double check

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
to see if I could find the quote and it's back from

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
2012.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
And

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
talking about how there is

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
the video games

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
for a little while.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Okay, here's the thing that I want.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
The cliche of the nerdy kid who doesn't go outside

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and just plays games is completely untrue.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
It's also true for the nerdy

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
kid who studies comic books and turns them into

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
basically saying that the obsession

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
with video games can turn into

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
a creative outlet and become

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
a career or something

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
that would make them a creative genius.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I'd be curious where their opinions

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
are at all these years later now.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
The video games are much bigger.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
It's not that long ago.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I guess that's true.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
So maybe I was wrong about the not liking games.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Maybe that was just like in the 90s.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Maybe that was the case and it changed in the

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
aughts. That's kind of more what I was getting at.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Maybe their opinions kind of come around as

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
now everybody's got cell phones

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and more people play games because of cell phones.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
It's a quote we're now. We've all got cell phones

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
so come on. Let's get real.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Bobby wants to point out though Gearbox made

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
it and Penn would never allow them to make

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
a game where it makes you sick. Fair enough.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
They trust Randy Pitchford who is also

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
a magician.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I thought I heard he put on

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
a magic show at PAX or something.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
He did.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Bobby also watches that show and said they did

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
get fooled every episode.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
It's probably, here's the thing

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
those shows are edited in a way. They probably

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
shoot like 20 of those guys

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
and gals every day

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
and then they shuffle them in a way so that every

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
episode has one. Granted I don't really watch the full

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
episodes. I've just watched a bunch of it on YouTube

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
because I hate watching

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
sitting down for a whole episode of something.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
And I might be wrong. Wasn't it on some obscure

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
cable network? I could be wrong. I thought it was

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
like I

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I always saw it on YouTube ever too.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I just pull up a bunch of YouTubes of like

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
you know different acts within it and try to watch

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
them so maybe I just

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
don't have. I hate sitting down and just focusing

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
on a TV episode. I mean I will

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
only do that for just like things that I

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
am super fan girl about.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
It was on the CW apparently

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
which yeah that is an obscure

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
broadcast network. I'm sorry. Speaking

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
of CW. The only thing I know about on CW

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
is Supernatural

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
and DC stuff. Well the

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
DC stuff is, DC is garbage.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Oh and Top Model. I do not watch any

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
DC shows but Supernatural

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
is going to be on its last season. Yeah I heard.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Finally I mean

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I love the show but I stopped watching after like

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
season 10 and then

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I've gone back and tried to like watch again

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
but

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
it was supposed to end after season 5.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
That was the

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
end of the original story.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Spoiler. Sam goes to hell.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
That's the end of the season.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I think that's how Buffy season 5 ended too

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
sort of. Well no. In season

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
6 she died. Yeah. And then they

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
did a season 7 which was garbage.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I mean it was okay. I mean there's

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
some big stuff that went but it wasn't a

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
great season. Now Pod Culture in chat says

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
don't be ragging on DC. I know some people

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
that are really. You are welcome to enjoy

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
terrible story writing.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Pod Culture and I know the critical myth gang

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
are like into those shows.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Good for them.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I'm just waiting

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
for Disney to get their shit together

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and I'm also waiting for season 3 of Jessica Jones.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
But that's going to take

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Disney getting their shit together right? Because there's no more

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Netflix Disney thing right? Disney's going to do

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
their own thing.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Will they still have Kristen Ritter and all that?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I hope she was good but you know

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
it's funny though. I like

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I finally picked up a Captain Marvel

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
pop but I'm calling them

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
comic besties because they are besties in

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
the comics. So

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
that makes me happy. I have my comic besties.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Alright let's move on

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
game of the week. First Loki.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Alright so I

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
actually did get to check this out because

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I almost forgot that it was even on

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
but Sony you may remember

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
was doing their state of play

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
which is kind of like their Nintendo Direct thing

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
and so they actually did

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
show off quite a few different games

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
that are going to be coming out for the Playstation.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Actually a lot for the Playstation VR as well.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
So to kind of run down some of the stuff

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
that they showed.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Concrete Genie which is a pretty cool looking

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
game. They have that coming out now with

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
VR support as well.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
They showed a

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
trailer for Marvel's Iron Man

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
VR which my kids are definitely all

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
over. More gameplay

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
of Days Gone which

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
doesn't have a fucking release date.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I thought that was supposed to be out by now.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Well

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
it's not.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Blood and Truth which is

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
a

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
it looks like almost like a spin off

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
of the game that they had in

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Playstation Worlds where you kind of

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
play like the mob series and stuff but it's

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
another VR game. Ready Set

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Heroes look pretty cool.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
They had

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Observation which is a

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
game that came out on Oculus

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Quest. Now it's coming to Playstation

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
VR. They were showing

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
off

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
they're going to have retro skins for Crash

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Team Racing Nitro Fields.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
The old school polygon

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
stuff that's going to be in there.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Oh that's silly I like that. Yeah so they have

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
those. That's a good kind of silly.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
They showed off a new trailer for Mortal

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Combat 11.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I can't believe

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
that game is only like three weeks away. I feel like

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I just heard it was coming.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I got to say with as much as you know my

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
opinion on the Mortal Combat franchise and all

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
that it's too much for me but

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I got to say they did that launch pretty well.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
They announced it and then like two months later it's here.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
You may remember No Man's Sky

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
got the new Beyond

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
expansion that's going to be coming out which is that brandy thing

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
but they also have a new patch that's going to be coming out

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
soon that's for Playstation

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
VR as well so you'll be able to play that game

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
in that.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
That's kind of rad.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I don't know how often I would like really use that

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
but I think it would be fun a couple

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
of times to just explore the worlds

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
and VR kind of get my fill of that

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
and that would be cool.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I think I did hear though that that same patch is

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
going to hit the PC and the relevant

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
VR platforms on PC too. Yeah so that would be cool

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and then definitely another one. You'll have fun with

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Robby's Five Nights at Freddy's VR Help Wanted.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Hell no. It's going to be coming out

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
as well. Hell no. It's

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
a great thing for the

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
franchise. It's the same guy doing it but now he's

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
doing a VR game. Yes and my son totally wants to

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
play that as well so that'll be... I hope y'all

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
have fun. That'll be fun.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I feel about that the way Jamie does

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
about the DC stuff. I didn't see it in here

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
on this list but I think that they announced

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
also Dreams is going to have that

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
beta test for Dreams as well.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I think, I don't remember if that was part of this

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
presentation or not but

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
yeah lots of things

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
coming out. Oh and then they also showed

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Vacation Simulator again and they announced

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
the release date for that because I know I'm looking forward to that one.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
That's June 18th.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Yeah. Lots of

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
stuff. I think we only touched on some of the

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
things that were in there but it was

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
a decent presentation.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I hope they do more of them.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
SSG100Matt says

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
how many biddies to get Rob to play Five Nights

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
at Freddy's VR? I

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
would only do it for charity. I wouldn't do it for

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
as much as Bobby's going to grit

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
his teeth. But I think he'll agree

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
I would only do it for charity. I wouldn't do it

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
for our own pockets.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I would stream it here

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
but I'll only do it for charity.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I haven't thought of a number yet.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
We'll see.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I'm like

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
getting scared just thinking about it.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
The jump scares in those games are

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
horrible.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I can't even imagine

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
looking to the right and what those little creatures

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
are. They have additional things that you do like

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
repairing them and stuff.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I'm getting a headache just thinking about it.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Anyway.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Let's see.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Yeah, Shane's in chat saying

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I told Rob he needs to play it the moment

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
it got announced.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Siya Tabiri says

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
who's charity and why will you play it for her but not

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
for us? Oh you.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Alright, anyway. What did you think of the

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
event itself? I heard it kind of got

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
kind of a tepid. It was okay.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
It just kind of seemed like it was just like trailer dump.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Yeah. But I like, I do

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
like and even though I saw some comments in chat like

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
wow it was a lot of VR. I'm

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
kind of glad that Sony is supporting

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
this hardware that they put out and like

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I'm okay with them like

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
maybe so that they don't feel like they

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
have to do this around E3 time. Maybe

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
now, yes I know Sony's not doing E3 but

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
still, maybe Sony's kind of like putting

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
this information out there now so it's like oh hey

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
look at all this stuff that's coming on VR.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
You got a reason to own one. We're still

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
supporting it. And I can

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
appreciate that. So you know even if I'm

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
not into the Five Nights at Freddy's thing

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
yes I am into the No Man's Sky thing.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
They're not going to have like some sort of announcements around

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
E3. They'll do

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
something but it might just be in this format

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
because more and more want to do

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
a direct style like they want to

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
use and Microsoft

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
has their Inside Xbox that they just

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
had one like last week so

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
yeah you know anyway

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
um what was there was

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
another comment in chat here I want to read oh

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Spyro557 Jonathan in chat talking about

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
the Crash Team Racing.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Oh by the way the low poly skins are

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
a PlayStation 4 exclusive

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
so you don't get them on Xbox or

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Switch and maybe that ties into the

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
fact that you know those games were

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
PlayStation games there wasn't those

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
same platforms didn't exist back then

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
so maybe it's kind of a special thing for Sony

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
because Sony was the original home

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
of those games so

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
all right well let's move on

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
and I think I've got one more story here before we

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
get to the classic game of the week and this one is about

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
you know and I've talked earlier

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
in the show about how I really think subscription

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
services are kind of the wave

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
of the future and another company

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
throwing their hat in the ring this week

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Apple did a big thing earlier this week

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
and of course you know Apple does phones

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
and watches but this week was a

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
very different type of event

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
because and you know folks were anticipating

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
this it was supposed to be about

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
TV and what they're going to be doing for the

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Apple TV and their own type of

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Netflix slash Hulu

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
slash you know that whole

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
warehouse competitor and

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
so here comes Oprah here comes

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Spielberg who just

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
hated on Netflix like a couple weeks ago

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
if I'm not mistaken but whatever whatever

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
because he's probably getting paid by Apple so

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
you know somebody showed him money and now he's on board but anyway

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
it sounds like they've got some neat things

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
but that's not games I mean then there was the whole

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
credit card thing which I was like I

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I guess I mean because Apple pay

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
but anyway that's not the game part the game part

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
is they announced Apple Arcade

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
which will be a premium subscription

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
service for Apple devices so I think

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
many people kind of figured this was coming

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
we've heard these rumors about Apple for quite some

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
time so

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
iPhone

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
iPad Apple

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
computers meaning like Macs

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
right and Mac Minis things like that everything in the

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Apple family and Apple TV

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
are all part of Apple Arcade

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
and so that kind of

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
oh I was only expecting the phones and the iPads

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I didn't think but it makes a lot of sense of course

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Macs and computers will be in there

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
too what are what's available in the service

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
though well they're

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
going to be getting games we didn't get a lot of

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
details on like exactly the games

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
but we do know the talent

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
and they've got some big talent so just like

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
they brought out Oprah and they brought out Spielberg

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Sega

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Konami we'll let it slide

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Mistwalker which for me that's the

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Mistwalker that's like

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
fucking Lost Odyssey okay Mistwalker is a big

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
deal Mistwalker is the studio that was founded

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
by Final Fantasy Hironobu

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Sakaguchi so

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I think they kind of threw

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
a lot of companies out there hoping something

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
will stick with somebody and that's the one that stuck with

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
me was Mistwalker I was like

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
oh shit so the next Mistwalker game is going to be

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
something on my phone but then I also thought

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
oh but no it's going to be on Macs

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
as well because there's that part of me that's like

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
but I like

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
the stuff I like to play on the phone

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
was built for the phone

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
like Ingress, Pokemon Go those were built

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
for phones right there's not a lot

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
although I don't know like Super Hexagon

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I don't play a lot

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
but the fact that it's on

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Mac now

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I'm like okay

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I mean the only Mac we have is the

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
one that's dedicated to the video for this but assuming

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I took that plunge in the future or something

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I got two in my house

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
and I actually just downloaded a game for mine

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
right and you know for all the talk

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
of LOL games

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
on Mac in my opinion

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
the biggest news out of this Apple

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
thing is oh

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
well yes we're bringing games to Mac

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Konami, Sega

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Mistwalker

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
God what were all these logos on the screen?

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Devolver Digital, Disney, the Chinese

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
room which I thought they folded

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
but I guess not. Right it's probably their

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
catalog titles. I don't think it is

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I because there was something else I read

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
that said no the Chinese room like those guys

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
are now a part of a different

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
studio but they're using that brand on their newest

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
project and the reason why I specifically

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
call out Chinese room that was everybody's gone

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Rapture and Dear Esther which I

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
loved those games so when I saw

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
their logo pop up I was like

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I guess I could see that on a phone

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
but I'd rather play it on a TV

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I am super skeptical

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
but okay. Yeah

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
but anyway we don't know when

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
we don't know oh

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
here's the other bit Will Wright is another

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
big name they've got on the service so I mean

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
attracting the talent not an

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
issue but there are still quite a few

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
gaps in this such

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
as when and how much

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
and those and what and

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
well yeah and the the conclusion of

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
what specifically exactly

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
um and those are all fair questions

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
to ask but I imagine we'll find out

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
a little closer to when they're really ready to

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
roll this out so um

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
who knows but again I

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
you know I think this is kind of where gaming

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
is going anyway and I

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
kind of think the big news out of this isn't

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
really the phones as although

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
certainly that'll be the big user this don't get me wrong

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
but I think this is Apple's own way

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
to kind of be like guess

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
what since people have no problem

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
developing for phones

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
we're going to bring a lot of that to the Mac

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
too and not to say they're not already doing that

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
they have been doing that but I think the fact

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
that it's going to be like this in bulk in one

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
fell swoop so to speak

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I think I think

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
it's kind of the biggest most news worthy

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
thing out of it but you know your

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
mileage may vary so anyway

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
um thank you Questbuster

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I knew it was a studio that so Questbuster said

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Sumo Digital bought what was

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
left of the Chinese room because Chinese room

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
laid off almost all of their staff except

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
the people that founded it were still so

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Sumo got those guys

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
on board and so whatever they're developing

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
will probably be different now because they're staffed on

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
alright well let's just see but like I just

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I'm so highly skeptical

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
with that it's like without

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
any sort of like here's what exactly

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
releases like here's the talent we have that's cool but

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I need to see what it is and how much

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
it is and all that stuff a system is only

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
as good as the games that are on it

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
right? or a service

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
they see those why not

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
can the golden rule of gaming apply to services

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
as well I would say sure because

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I think before too long services

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
are all that's going to be there no it's not

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I just

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I really do alright Bobby

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
wants to point out though in chat at least it's not

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
streaming so that is a good point

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
this is very different from Stadia because

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Apple's not streaming these

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
things it's more of a

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
game pass if you will you're going to

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
log in download it and

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
although you might think like

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
you know oh my god bandwidth

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
caps and things of that nature these

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
games have not I don't think we're

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
looking at any 60 gig phone

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
games maybe two gigs

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
but it's just going to be a different

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
kind of currency

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
here I suppose so that could make it

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
very interesting we'll see

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
we'll see anyway

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
that's it for now let's move

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
on to let's go back to a

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
classic time let's go back to a classic

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
time when you didn't have all these

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
newfangled services the Googles and the Apples

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
participating in gaming

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
it was no no it was Nintendo, Sega

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
and Sony at some point

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
the classics so it's the classic game of the week

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
a game that she thinks hey

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
you guys should be showing this game a little respect

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
if you can this

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
one might be a little harder for people to find

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I bought this in a bargain basement

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
import at remember

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Game Masters

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
oh yeah I bought it from there

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
dirt fucking cheap so tell us

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
already what is the classic game of the week the game

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
is Panzer Bandit

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
it came out

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
for Playstation

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
in 1997 published by

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Banpresto and developed by

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Fill in Cafe

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Panzer Bandit is

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
a fun little

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
beat em up brawler game

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
it uses the same engine

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
as Mad Stalker

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Full Metal Force

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and by the way actually it did get a

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
PSN release in 2011

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
only in Japan of course but we have

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
ways of making that happen

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
but anyway the way that you

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
control the game first of all

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
is you have two attack buttons

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
strong and weak your directional pad

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
for moving around crouching jumping

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
and then you have your shoulder buttons to change between

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
foreground and background

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
and can be used to activate your special attack

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
so that was one thing

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I thought was kind of neat for a brawler

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
it kind of has that Fatal Fury

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
kind of vibe with the two

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
layers and

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
then another thing

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
for the

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
game that's a little bit unique is that

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
if you stand still during

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
an attack it's guarding

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
you also have a combo

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
counter and an

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
elemental attack that will launch

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
an enemy off the screen

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
so it's just a neat fun

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
little game but basically

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
it

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
it's a game that I'm actually surprised

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
never did come out over here just for

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
how fun it was and it was

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
as far as I remember a little bit of a budget title

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
when it came out but

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
and as we all know Banpresto

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
was the one of the arms of

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Bandai so

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I mean they also the company is

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
also responsible for giving us

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Super Robot Tyson

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Super Robot Wars

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
so but I mean the game

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
it's a little

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
obscure I mean

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
not many people have heard of it

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
but when I

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
played it for the first time I just

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
was enraptured with it it was so much fun

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
and so

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
you know there's not really a lot to say about it

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
it's just to beat them up

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
another thing about it is you have 12 characters

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
that you can play

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
4 story characters and 8 unlockable bosses

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
so there you go

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
it's just fun classic fun

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
brawling

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
sometimes you need a good beat em up

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and darn it you've just played the shit out of

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Ninja Turtles and Simpsons

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
it's time for something new

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'd tell anybody if you can find

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
this game or you get access to

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Japanese PSN definitely

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
own this one it is super

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
duper fun actually some folks in chat

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
over at twitch.tv slash vog network are

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
saying some good things about it

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
darticuya says getting a guardian heroes

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
vibe orange right saying kind of looks like

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
guardian heroes actf says

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
this game looks great

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
questpusher says it's like a lot of fun

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
love me a good beat em up

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
it's ridiculously fun

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and kai judo says

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
the kid is biting off sonics

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
look no

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
this different art style

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I see where he's

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
got the blue spiky hair

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
if they did make sonic human in the movie

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
it might have looked like that

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
yeah but all you know lead

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
video game characters in the

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
late 90s had that whole

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
extra big well I mean

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
look at like

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
any of the characters that have

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
sort of sci-fi universe

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
alien thing that's just the

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
aesthetic but I mean

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
clearly lots of fun

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and screaming and blowing up

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
cute robot enemies

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and the art style is fun and the

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
it's just 2D brawling

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
delightfulness

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
so acquire it

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
however you might need to acquire it

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
look we have a boss battle coming up

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
dialogue

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
yeah

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I noticed the

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
beginning of the game had a really long

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
kind of cut scene so I chose the video

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
tonight kind of to start at the actual

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
game because

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
we don't always have 10 minutes of discussion

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
on the classic game

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
you see the plane jumping too

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
like Cal is describing in Fatal Fury

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
that's a really

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
fun just added

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
feature in the game I mean I don't like it in

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Fatal Fury oddly enough but I loved it in this game

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
so there you go Panzer Bandit

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Panzer Bandit there you go classic

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
game of the week sorry guys I got to take it off the

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
shot now so those of you that are

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
watching on Twitch you'll just have to go find that game

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
for yourself play a little more maybe somebody will stream

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
it on Twitch maybe Dark Sakura after they beat

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Super Mario World

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
oh fuck I don't even know

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I thought you had this

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
well no I do but I don't know where

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
the PlayStation with our HDMI output

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
it's a fair question

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
where do I find the hardware to play it on these days

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
well no shit we've got something like

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
six PlayStations

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
well I think it's on the PlayStation Network so you could just

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Japanese

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and I'm not going to bother making a Japanese account

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
you could get the old school capture

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
device like the one you used to have

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I have his old capture device

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
but we agreed

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
that we were going to do Super Mario World

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
in the future in the future down the line someday

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
maybe I'll just put up a bunch

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
of PlayStation games and say

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
yo guys pick one educate the children

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
on some of these obscure

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
titles they know Mario World

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
that game is fun I'm not saying don't stream that because that game is a lot of fun

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and especially watching you and Dan both

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
is going to be a hoot and holler

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I'm just going to tell him he's a jerk

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
speaking of retro stuff

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
those of you that have followed me for a long time

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
first thanks for putting up with my bullshit for all these years

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
but second you might remember that when I was trying to do the YouTube thing

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I started this little series called Let's Remember

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and I was doing like

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
it's kind of like Let's Plays but I would put in

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
a lot of facts in there

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
you're like a pop up video

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
oh my god that's a great way to describe it

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
it was like pop up video but for games

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
so I think I want to bring that back

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
you guys

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
not necessarily on my YouTube

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
only there was a video platform that we're using more and more often

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
these days

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I'm just curious what you all on chat think about that

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
is that something you'd be into you might want to watch

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
check it out because here's the thing

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
we should do something like that

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
for a podcast

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I'm going to tell you the moment

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I knew I needed to do this and bring this back

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
because it was last week it was 7 days ago

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
do you know when?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
when I brought up the game Star Tropics

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and so many of you were like

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
never played it

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I don't know much about it

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I was like oh we got to fix this

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
so

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
you can blame Star Tropics for all of this

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
so alright

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
oh we got some good comments in chat

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
thank you guys I swear I wasn't fishing for compliments

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I swear alright

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
but I think I will fish over to the

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
other studio we're going to do a little break tonight

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I did a few minutes

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
of a play of

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Crypt of the NecroDancer

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
which ties in a little bit more maybe to last week's news

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
but you're still all talking about it this week

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
it's that Zelda game

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
the Cadence of Hyrule

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
that is basically this but with the Zelda skin

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
but then I found a lot of you guys

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
because maybe you don't follow music games so much

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
maybe you don't know what Crypt of the NecroDancer is

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
but you really want to play

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
this new Cadence of Hyrule

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
so I thought let's take a look so now we can all

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
know what is

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Crypt of the NecroDancer

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
okay

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
hello everybody it's Rob in the

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
other room the other studio

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and I thought for our break tonight we could take a look at

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
this game now it's a little bit older

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
but a lot of people are still talking

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
about it this week

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
or these past couple weeks ever since that Nindies Direct

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
the game we're looking at today is called

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Crypt of the NecroDancer

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
like I mentioned it is a little bit older but you know

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
just a couple years old

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
and today I'm looking at it on Steam

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
but I know I've played this game quite a bit on the Playstation 4

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
it might have been one of those PS Plus games

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
at one point I can't remember

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I know it's also on the Switch which is probably

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
part of the reason why it's in the Nindies collection

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and it's on Xbox One

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
it's pretty much

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
if it plays games this game was

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
probably ported to it at some point

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
and since Orange Launch Radio

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
is rooted in music

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
based games such as

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
DDR and the community where we really got

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
our start there was obviously a lot

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
that was very appealing about Crypt of the NecroDancer

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
being that it was like oh it's a roguelike

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
but it's also kind of a music

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
game little twist to it

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
so I thought we'd take a look at it because

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
with the Nindies announcement

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
in the past couple weeks

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
that Cadence of Hyrule

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
is on it's way out which is basically

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
at least as far as you can tell

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
this game but with the Zelda skin

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I find there's a lot of people that don't

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
necessarily know a lot about this game

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
but are suddenly interested

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
because of the Zelda tie in

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
maybe I don't play a lot of music games

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
but I'm going to play every Zelda game so I'm going to play that

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I prefer to use my keyboard in this game

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
so you might hear a little bit of clacking because I do use

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
a mechanical keyboard

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
but in this area you can move around

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
you'll notice there's no I'm just moving around

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
however I want I'm not tied down

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
to the music or what have you

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
so you're kind of free to do what you want to do in these modes

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
but this is kind of like your central hub

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
where you can go buy permanent upgrades

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
which is very typical of a roguelike

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
it's funny because the design

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
of this game actually kind of looks like

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
the old game Rogue

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
which is where that term roguelike comes from

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
if you've never seen it from way

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
way back in the day

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
it was a randomly generated dungeon

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
that kind of looked like this a little bit

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
so you can see in this hub there's

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
various things you can do

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
there's training modes you can do

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
permanent upgrades, you can take away

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
upgrades that maybe would be useful and so forth

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
you'll notice that the game will allow you to

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
play with a dance pad if you want

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I guess it's a little more forgiving

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
there's a tutorial as well if you forget what to do

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
there's a bunch of other characters you can play as as well

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
although again since I've made a little more progress

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
on PS4 than I did on Steam

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I don't really have a lot that I can play

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
with right now so we'll just go ahead and

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
keep Cadence which is

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
what I'm going to keep right now

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
although it may change like I believe if I

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
pick one of these other characters

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
yeah it may be like the bard

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
no beats, you can move at any time

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and enemies can move after you

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
so this is like the Bobby Black Wolf mode

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
and if you're bad at music games

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
you have to slow it down a little bit

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
so you don't have to worry about hitting everything on the beat

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
so that might be helpful for some people

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
oops I didn't actually want to switch to him

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I'm okay with a little bit of a challenge

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
because without challenge I won't screw up

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
so anyway I've been gabbing for a few minutes

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
let me actually show the game

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
so we're going to go into zone one

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
and you'll notice there's that little meter at the bottom

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and you have to move in tight because if I don't move

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
see I get all these missed, beat skit

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I get little deductions

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
my coin streak might break

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
or other types of deductions

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
so I just picked up a whip that's going to let me

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
have a wider attack and that's good

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
that'll allow me to kill those enemies

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
a little easier

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
because you'll notice they kind of move like you do

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
so I'm kind of strategically

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I notice the length

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
with the whip allows me to hit these

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
little monsters

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
that's what happens when I try to talk and play

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I skipped a beat

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I like that the shopkeeper sings

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
so if I had like one more coin

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I could get an empty heart container

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
but I'm one coin short

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
unfortunately

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
now I believe I have until the length

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
of the song

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
to get through this level

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
or there's like bad penalties or something

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
so there's the little gem

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
and gems are the things you can use

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
to buy those permanent upgrades

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I don't remember what the bomb switch does

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
it's probably not good, but let's see

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
oh

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
now

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
it kind of made a little dent in the wall

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
and you can't, what's the barrel do?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
oh

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
so if you get certain items

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
you can try to

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
yeah, I lost my multiplier because I ran into a wall

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
but you can dig through the wall

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
with certain items

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and you might find like secret rooms

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
so there's a treasure chest, okay vision radius

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
that would be helpful in trying to maybe locate

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
hidden rooms

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
this dragon looks very scary

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I died

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
because I didn't have enough health to take on

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
that dragon, that was a lot of monsters

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
in that room, yikes

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
so and then it gives you a little

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
recap, I got 46 coins but

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
lol you died

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
so I got to go back to start

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and the whole process begins again

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
but because I picked up that one gem

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I don't know if one will be enough

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
to get these permanent upgrades

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
like I could get a permanent heart container

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
if I had two gems

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
but I don't, I only got the one because I did kind of crappy

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I ran into a hard boss though

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
yeah there's nothing

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
available for one gem there

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and let's see

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
so riches I could buy for one gem

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
sure why not

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
so that'll be something that will now show up in chests

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
when I do another run through

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
as is again kind of typical

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
of where the roguelikes

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
are at these days is that

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
you play a lot of random generated

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
you know if you play things like rogue legacy

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
or other popular roguelikes

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
you kind of go through the same type of

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
random generated thing over and over again

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
but the only way you really start to really make progress

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
with that is that you're buying these

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
permanent upgrades that therefore help you

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
and in the case of Crypt of the Necrodancer

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
you even have degrades

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
that will take things out of chests

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
where maybe it makes it

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
so you have a higher chance of getting something you really want

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
because chests could have really anything in them

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
so let's see if I can do a little better

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
maybe one more time

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
try to get moving a little sooner here

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
a little less talking

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
now again I'm not going to have those same items in force

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I don't have that whip

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
so I'm trapping monsters in this hallway

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
to try to get

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I hit two keys at the same time

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
at least I got a gem

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
yeah these things are making quick work of me

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
instead of trying to run face first into them

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
you really want to strategically attack them

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
from angles and stuff

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
like I just did with that guy

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
like I just did with that guy

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
okay so now I got that vision radius item again

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
this must be a shop

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I have an apple

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
for health maybe

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
sure I'll take it, I need that

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
and you'll notice that you use

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
different combinations

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
of keystrokes to use items

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
yikes that was almost a bad situation

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
oh wait no I want that

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
that says something about low health

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
yeah something's screaming down here

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
oh it's this gold bat

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
now what else is interesting about this game

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
is that they actually added it to Steam Workshop

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
so if you actually look on Steam Workshop

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
there's already

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
like Zelda type mods

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
available for it

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
like obviously people have skinned in

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
some of their Nintendo favorites

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
already into this game

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and I did it

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I got to floor two

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
so now we get a different song that we can dance to

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I'm sure some of you watching out there are far better than I am at this game

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
but again we're just trying to help those who maybe haven't seen this before get a look

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
so now I'm up to two gems

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
so it's much more

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
what the hell is that thing

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000
much more likely to be able to buy something in the lobby

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
when I inevitably die in this one

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
let's see

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
oh that guy was kind of caught on that spring and kept moving up

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
turn out the lights I don't want to do that

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
hopefully the soundtrack is coming through pretty good

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I know a lot of people are

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
pretty into the soundtrack in this game

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
and I think they do crossovers

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
oh boo I couldn't kill that thing

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
it must be one of those things where

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
it's like a boo

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
oh I'm stuck this way now

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
those arrows are kind of

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
oh boo

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I lost my coin multiplier because I needed a key that I didn't have

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
so yeah if you can imagine this

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
but like to dance these Zelda songs and stuff

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
that's probably going to be

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
uh oh there's that dragon that got me last time

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
ah much better that time

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
see I just had to get him to follow me a little bit

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
that's all there was to it

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
alright well that's all there is

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
to this little look here at

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Crypt of the NecroDancer for tonight

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
we've been going for about ten minutes

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I want to throw it back to the studio

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
but there you go a little look at what that game is all about

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
if you haven't played it again

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
it's available on a lot of different platforms

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
you can check out the sweet soundtrack

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
which incorporates popular songs from other franchises as well

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I don't remember if I had said that

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
you can see even in this menu

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
there's a way you can play mods

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
make your own mods and so forth

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
especially on Steam and the platforms that support it

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
there's all sorts of ways you can tweak this game

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
and get a real sneak preview

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
of what Cadence of Hyrule might look like

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
but in the meantime I know I'm looking forward to Cadence of Hyrule

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
and I'm sure many of you are as well

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
so there you go

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
a little look at Crypt of the NecroDancer

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
we're going to go back to the studio live

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
thank you me for that

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
a little look at Crypt of the NecroDancer

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Dark Soccer I saw you kind of looking at the game

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
had you played that game before at all?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
or is that kind of the person you saw?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I haven't played it

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I tried it a little bit

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I just wasn't too interested in it

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
it's fun but I understand the whole roguelike element

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
and the random levels sometimes is not

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and I was really surprised with how little I could remember

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
of that game

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
even though I played it pretty heavy a year or two ago

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
but when I was fighting that dragon

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I was like oh crap I forget how you have to fight

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
some of these monsters

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
you kind of have to remember how to do that

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
but I think it's such a strong indie title

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
but it's also funny watching back the video

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
because I didn't realize how loud the clacking was

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I knew that would happen

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
which is why I said in the video you're going to hear me typing

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
which is good for the podcast

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
because you can hear me clicking in time with the music

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
or not

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
but it was just kind of funny the way that all turned out

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
so there you go

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
as a reminder we're looking for more of our folks out there

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
to submit some breaks for us

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
or folks in studio

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
possibly to do that too

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
but man PAX East

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
to be in this weekend was a great opportunity

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I was hoping to see some video from PAX East

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
but I understand y'all were having a time

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
at PAX East so it's all good

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
but if you are interested in creating a segment

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
here for Orange Lounge Radio

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
you can just reach out to us on Twitter

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
or myself personally

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I don't care at MrRobRoberts

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
that's MrRobRoberts over on Twitter

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
there's a million ways to find us

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
it's very easy

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
just send me an email

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
robertvognetwork.com

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
and that's fine too

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
let's get back into some more gaming news

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
actually quickly before we do that

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I remember Jamie

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
you kind of wanted to make this a regular thing

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
where at this point of the show you do a podcast shoutout

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
because we want to help our frenzies

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
and things that do podcasts

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I've been putting out for suggestions and haven't really gotten many

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I'm going to save anything that I get

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
for next week

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
but in this one I normally like to do the independent ones

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
but this is one that has been a mainstay

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
of my favorites for quite some time

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
from when they were vaguely independent

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
on into corporate sponsorship

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
and whatnot

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
but it's called Stuff You Missed in History class

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
it's by How Stuff Works

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
and I love these podcasts

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
they basically take

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
different events or people

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
or different things in history

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
compile from different sources

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
and try to give a very clear

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
my favorite ones are the ones where they do

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
unexplained events

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
or things

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
like the Lizzie Borden trial

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
where she was considered innocent

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
but people set all these different accounts

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
and they try to put the accounts together to see

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
what is the real outcome

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I'm right now listening to one about Charles Adams

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
of the Adams family

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I did not know he was such a playboy

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
and had two wives

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
named Barbara

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
our discord posted a movie poster

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I guess they're doing a new Adams family movie

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
but it's animated this time

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
needs more Debbie Jelinski

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
that's all I'm saying

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
but she officially died

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
bring her back

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
we didn't see a severed head

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
at any rate

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Stuff You Missed in History class

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
definitely worthwhile

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
not just if you love history

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
but learn something

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
it's a really really good podcast

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and I love listening to

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
the two ladies who are on it

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
so they're a lot of fun

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
speaking of podcasts

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
you should be listening to, just a reminder that VOG Network

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
is more than what we do here on Twitch

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
we have some great audio only podcasts

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
that we work with

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
you can look up more information over at vognetwork.com

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and one I would particularly give a shout out to tonight

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
would be Electric Sistahood

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
just because I know they are in

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Boston

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
and go, I saw pictures of

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
my sister all over Twitter this weekend

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
so I know they go

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
since they're based in the Boston area

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
they go to PAX East

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
that's like their home convention

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
so I will be tuning in

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
since nobody sent me a video tonight

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I will be tuning into Electric Sistahood

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
for the wrap up this weekend

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
we did a podcast with them at PAX East once

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
many moons ago

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
so yeah, good times

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
and then since I'll add to that

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I haven't listened to them in a while

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I have trouble concentrating at work

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
when I'm listening to a long podcast

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
or I shouldn't say concentrating at work

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
concentrating on the podcast

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
when I listen to a long podcast at work

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
but the debug log is another good one

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
they're a group of indie developers

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
out in the Atlanta area

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
who work in Unity

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
and they talk about Unity and game development stuff

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
all the time and they have people on their show

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
talking about different game development principles

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
and all sorts of topics

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
so go check them out

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
wow, we all had a little plug tonight

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I like that, I want to make this a regular thing

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
spreading the love a little bit, good times

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
alright well, let's spread around some more news

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
but the rapid fire kind

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and there was a lot, honestly a lot of this stuff

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
we probably could have spent a good 10 minutes talking about

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
but there's a lot of news this week

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
but it is what it is, let's rapid fire these next few stores

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
so here's your games

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
the gold lineup for April

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
you've got on Xbox One

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
the Technomancer

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
and that's going to be coming out April 1st to the 30th

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
and then of course

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Outcast's second contact is going to be

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
16th through May 15th

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
and then your Xbox 360

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
compatible games, you're going to have

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Star Wars Battlefront 2, the original one

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
that's April 1st through the 15th

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Warfighter 2 on April 16th

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
through the 30th

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
and then on the Playstation side of the house

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
of course this month it's a little bit lighter

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
because, you know, they got rid of all those other systems

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
so now you have Conan Exiles

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
and The Surge

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
and one of those has a penis slider

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I'll let you guess which one

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
it's Conan

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
thank you

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
for letting us know

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
thank you for keeping us informed

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
and then of course

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Risk of Rain 2 is something that they talked about

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
during the whole Gearbox presentation

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
and Risk of Rain

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
was a 2D roguelike

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Risk of Rain 2 is 3D

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
and what's kind of cool about this is

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
it's in early access right now

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
you can actually purchase a copy

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
but apparently

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
well this is a little old now

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
if you had purchased a copy before March 30th

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
you actually got a free copy to give to a friend

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
but it still looks like it's a pretty decent game

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
so go check it out

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I did not pick up a copy

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
so I don't have a copy to give to anyone

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
maybe

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
maybe in a future time

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
maybe

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I may have the original game

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
but I still haven't

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I'm surprised I haven't played it

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
well I wouldn't give away my copy of this game

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
because I like this game an awful lot

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
it's Minecraft and Minecraft made an update this week

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
unfortunately it was not the 4K update

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
that I was looking forward to

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
but Minecraft actually removed

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Notch who originally created Minecraft

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
they removed him from the

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
game's splash screens

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
now one could infer that this may have to do with

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
some of the things

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
he says on Twitter

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I blocked him because quite frankly

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I don't give a shit what he has to say

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
and that's my personal opinion

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
but I don't know

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
they're not saying, obviously

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Microsoft is not saying what

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
if it has to do with the guy specifically

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
or what it is

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I think it's probably just more the fact that

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
the game has evolved so much

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
since he sold this off to Microsoft

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
yeah he hasn't really been working on it

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
it ain't his game anymore

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
it's now this Minecraft team

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
at Microsoft that makes this game

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
so the time was probably right

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I do believe he is still credited

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
like

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I think in the

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
actual credits

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
it used to say on the title screen

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
like it would rotate

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
there's like a carousel of things

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
kind of like our little ticker on Twitch

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
there's carousels and sometimes you're gonna see it says

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
follow Rob Roberts on Twitter

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
or follow DarkSakura on Twitch

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
you'll see those things

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
well it's kind of like if one of those said

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
well that would never happen here

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
but if it said created by such and such

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
and said person wasn't here anymore

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
it's like they took that out

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
so you don't even see it show up on the carousel anymore

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
so that was the update they did

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
that being said, where is my 4K graphics pack?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
yes I want 4K graphics in Minecraft

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
well I got news for you, Notch is working on it

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
but now he's not

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
he wasn't doing shit with that

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
that was all Microsoft's thing

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I think that was a concept thing that really wasn't meant to go

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
much further than that

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
where is

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
where's my Ouya Minecraft

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
that I was promised

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
when the Ouya came out

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
was that really supposed to be a thing?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
it was on their screenshot

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
it wasn't necessarily something that they may have had

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
permission or saying

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
this wasn't actually coming to the system

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
here's an example of games

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
you might see on the platform

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
one of which is never really coming there

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
anyway

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I thought that was more appropriate for rapid fire news

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
because one of those things where it's like, okay

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
they did a thing, but whatever

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
it doesn't really affect the game

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
anyway, this is a big effect for the game

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
and hopefully will be fixed by the time the game comes out

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
505 Games commenting on the Bloodstained

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Ritual of the Night demo that they showed on the Switch

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
at PAX East

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
apparently wasn't running great

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
it was a little choppy

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
and unpolished

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
505 Games did kind of comment on this

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
to basically say there's still optimization

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
to be done

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
the build that was at the show is a long way from being done

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
the final product should run more like

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
the PC

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
which is like the

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
base one that all the others made

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
was the PC version running well?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I wasn't there

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
so I couldn't tell you

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
why would you bring a demo for something that doesn't work?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
that's kind of where I'm at

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
why did they bother to show it on the Switch then

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
if it wasn't really working right?

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and if people ask about the Switch

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
say, oh yeah we're working on it

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
it's coming out to the Switch too

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
we didn't have a version available to show you at the show today

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
but whatever

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
they made a choice

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
at the same time, if they hadn't shown it

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
then there would have been these other questions

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
no, there wouldn't have been any other questions

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I'm sorry, we don't have the Switch version available

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
to show you at the moment

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
it still needs some more

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
enhancements

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
it's unpolished and not ready for the show

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
it'll be ready to go by the release date

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I don't know

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
anyway, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night is coming

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
to the Switch this summer

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
it's also coming for PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
pretty much everywhere you can play a game

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
this game will be available

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
moving on to Dark Sakura

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
well,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Dead by Daylight is getting

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
another character

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
it's going to be Ash from Evil Dead

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
yay!

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Bruce Campbell probably needed

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
to buy a new roof or something

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
please, let him deliver the line

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
this is my boomstick

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
well, I remembered

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
having seen him when I went to go see

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
the man with the screaming brain at the Crest

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
and he talks about how different

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
roles are like, what he has to pay for something

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
I was like, I wonder if this one's going to be

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
pay for his roof or a car or something

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
well if you watch the little announcement trailer

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
that was kind of the whole point of it

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
he made his announcement and was like, okay

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
who's got my money?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
but at any rate, that's going to be

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
on April 2nd

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
so just in a couple of days

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
no fooling

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
no one's guessed what the joke is

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
so

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
guess what the joke is

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and then this is the news that made me happy

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
that I alluded to it in my

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
what I've been playing

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Steve Ritchie

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
really cool guy, going very very deaf

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
he is

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
a game designer responsible

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
for such classics as Black Knight

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and Black Knight 2000 and

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Star Wars Pinball, he's doing a lot of stuff for Stern

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
right now

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
well, we remember

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
hearing that he was

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
told he finally gets to work on his dream game

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
that dream game

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and Dan and I were like, oh it's another Black Knight, it's another Black Knight

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
turns out, it's another Black Knight

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
so Black Knight Sword of

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Rage is the new one

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
there is a

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
there's actually even a teaser up

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
some gameplay that's up

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
and then there are

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
going to be two versions of it

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
there's the pro edition which has just

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
one play field

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
and then the premium

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
which is the one that we're going to be getting

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
that's why we're selling off other pins

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
that has the upper level play field that

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
harkens back to Black Knight 2000 and Black Knight

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
sounds fun

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I wonder if he's still doing the Black Knight voice

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
but the thing that I like is it's even got the spinner

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
from the Black Knight 2000

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
the color scheme is the same, it's got the

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Black Knight in the middle of it and we're just so

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
excited about this

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
this is going to be one of the first tables

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
that we're really going to buy completely

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
brand new

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
it's like buying a small car

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
in some ways

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
the one that we're getting is going to be

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
67,000

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
we're probably buying ours at

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
6700

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
oh my god, 67,000

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
for a fucking machine

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
6700 is appropriate

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I think he said the pro is like 52

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
or 55

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
and then the premium

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
is going to be like 67

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and that's buying it at the show

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
so we're going to be

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
probably picking ours up at California Extreme

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
we may not have the money to get it

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
by, not Pinagogo

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
it's not called that anymore, Pinagogo is a different

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
thing now, Golden State

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
because they moved it from Dixon to Lodi

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
yeah, it's still the same

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
it's the same one as the old Pinagogo

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
but now it's Golden State Pinball Expo

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
in Lodi, the grape center, whatever, wine

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
thing, which I went last year

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
after DragCon, it was super fun

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
but

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
the, god, words

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
but anyway

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Stern is going to be selling

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
there and at California

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Extreme at the big pinball event

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
so we're probably getting ours at California Extreme

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
remind me, I need to talk to you about something

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
with California Extreme off air

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
just remind me, because I'll forget

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
alright, we're all going, right?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
that's the plan, but I've got to ask you something

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
about that

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
anyway, yes, I am conducting

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
personal business on the show, deal with it

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
anyway, give me your money

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
but I'm looking forward to playing this machine

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
and hopefully Dark Soccer will let us bring the camera

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
over, maybe we can do a little midpoint break

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
and showcase the machine, that'll be fun, well once I have it

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
sure, once you have it, well I think we should do that for some of the other machines

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
you have today actually, well I've got Ghostbusters right now

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
or the ones you're about to get rid of

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
well that would be Monopoly

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
you know what's funny is that we always call it

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Monopoly, because of the master system

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
misprint of Monopoly

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
was Monospace Poly, we've got one of those

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
like right now in the house

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
is Monopoly World Cup

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Ghostbusters in the dining room

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
and then we have the Medieval Madness

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
hello!

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
we have the Medieval Madness reissue

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Black Knight 2000 and

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Theater of Magic, and then outside

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
we've got Judge Dredd

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
which I don't know why they like it, but they do

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I have a creature from the Black Lagoon

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Demolition Man, which we're going to be selling

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
The Shadow

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
and, and, and crap

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
they love pinball at your house

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
one other that I can't remember

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
it's fine, oh yeah

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Twilight Zone, we've got our

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Twilight Zone back, so

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
but you're Dr. Claw when you're thinking the pinball machines

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
is my favorite thing about this Twitch room

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
about me snapping?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
the hand gestures that come through on Twitch

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
but this is Thing

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
it's Thing from the Addams Family, of course

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
alright, anyway

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
come on, moving on, let's travel around the world

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
and check out some releases, things that are coming out

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
a little sooner than this new Black Knight

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
machine, starting with the US, Loki

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
I'm afraid I don't have much

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
to announce, but we do

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
have one single game

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
which will be very

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
great news for my son

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
and that is Power Rangers Battle

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
for the Grid is coming to Playstation 4

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
it's a Power Rangers fighting game

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
that's it

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
yeah, it seems like it's a slow week

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
in Japan as well

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I don't know if that's because golden weeks at the end of the month

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
or something, I don't know, but there's not

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
a lot happening in Japan right now

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
pretty light time, because everyone shoves that stuff

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
out for the end of the

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
financial year, and then it's just like

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
ah, that's true, the only big

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
release on April 11th, that's

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
next week, so I'll probably say this twice, but Earth Defense

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Force Iron Rain is out in Japan on the way

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I see that as well, so there is that

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
but then if I'm looking at the Switch, okay the Switch has some things

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
so on the Switch we have

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Super Dragon Ball Heroes World Mission

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
the Taikan Sports Pack

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Tennis, Bowling, Golf, and Billiards

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
and the variety game with

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
King Guiyo Suki, Card

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Tsuji Puzzle, and Nika Kudori

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
these kind of sound like

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
like kind of shovelware, doesn't sound

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
like these are huge games, and that's

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
really, well the Dragon Ball

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
is a different story, but those other two sound like

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
they're kind of mini game collections, but there you go

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
that's what you got in Japan this week, how about the UK?

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Anything exciting going on over there?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Just a few things

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
on the first

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Darksiders War Mastered

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Edition, and then on the

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
fourth YouTuber's Life OMG

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
and Super Dragon Ball Heroes

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
World Mission, Dragon Ball Heroes? Oh

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I guess it's out on Switch

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I always thought it was an arcade only thing

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
but Super Dragon Ball Heroes

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
World Mission is coming out

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
There were all the DS ones that came out in Japan

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Well and it's the same thing

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
that was on the Japanese list too

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Yeah, but I didn't think that

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
it ever had a European release, so maybe this is

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Dragon Ball Heroes

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
is just kind of weird

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
because it's like you're two kids

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
who play in and get sucked into the

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
video game and they're part of that

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
they like become Saya-jin in the game

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
and have to do shit

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It's kind of cool, but you buy like cards

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
for the arcade machine

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
and then it reads your characters on the cards

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Fun, well I think Loki is

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
in the right ballpark though, I think this week in particular

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
is just slow because everybody

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
pushed for last week at the end of the fiscal year

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
so it's kind of like this is just a slow

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
period because of that

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Alright, well moving on then

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
after world release dates

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
this is the part of the show where we would usually

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
get into the mail bag over at

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
participate at

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
orangelauntrader.com, although when I checked earlier today

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
it was empty, I don't know about now

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Oh, there's one?

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Yeah, there's one from today

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Ok, then that's why I missed it, let's do it

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Alright, this one comes from our

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
dear Ronchan

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Evening everyone, great show last week

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
but I wanted to say a couple of things real quick

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I don't have much hope

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
in Google Stadia, seeing how

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
it's going to rely more on software

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
than hardware. Honestly, if they

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
want Stadia to be a success, Google should

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
release a beefed up Chromecast

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
with more storage and memory and have that

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
as a dedicated streaming device to pair

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
with a controller. To me that makes the most

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
amount of sense, and I actually would second that

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And then, ooh, to me about

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
what I said about Chrome

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
After the show I checked my task manager and saw

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
for myself with the many instances, but also

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Firefox, Edge, and other web browsers do the same thing

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And I

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
understand your views about how Google should

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
optimize Stadia for Safari, but Google

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
shouldn't have to because Chrome is their

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
browser of choice for obvious reasons

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Yeah, they're going to want you to use Chrome

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Perhaps once they have perfected how they want

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Chrome to operate with Stadia, we could see

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
that same optimization on Safari

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Seeing how Microsoft's new web browser

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Edge is being redone with Chromium

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
and seeing how that's the majority

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
how that's the majority

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
browser being used, it could be a while

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And that's all for now, I'm off to edit more con photos

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
and whatnot, stay awesome, I'll run that

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
You can still use Chrome on Apple products

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
It just doesn't run great

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I use Chrome on my phone, and the reason why

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
it's in incognito mode

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
You have that on Safari

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Oh, then they must have put that in there recently

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
It hasn't been new, it's been there forever

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
It's called private browsing

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Because I use it all the time, because when I

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
look at, like, there's so many news sites

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
that, like, when you go, it's like, you've used up

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
your free articles this month

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Going private browsing works fine

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Well, it's been there since its inception

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Oh, I don't remember

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
When you slide up your window, you'll get a new plus

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
for a private browser window

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I'm used to Chrome anyway, it doesn't matter

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Okay, so

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Well, people are used to horse and buggies, but you see where we are now

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You know what, alright

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
And Bobby Blackwell is saying you might want to reiterate

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
who Ronchon is

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Rama! T.J. Rama S, he's my Ronchon

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Our pal from the Anime Jam session

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Maybe Bobby wants us to

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
work in the cheap plug for Anime Jam session

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Hosted Tuesday nights here

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Well, you can do that

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
You got it

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Alright, anyway, so there you go

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Yeah, Act Def says, well, there was an email

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
so no Drag Race talk, sadly, nope, we'll have to roll that over

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Oh, girl!

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I haven't watched this week anyway, so I'm not, well

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I got, so, believe it or not

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I've been trying to, and I didn't want to

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
talk a lot about this on the show until I was actually

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
making a habit of it, but I would say

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
since mid-March, Allen got us

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
gym memberships

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And I've now been 12 times

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So I would say I'm making it a habit

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I haven't been good about every day

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
but I've been going almost every other day

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So I'm trying, I'm trying to turn

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
this jigglypuff into some wigglytuff

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
That's just kind of, you know, I just want to

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
shape the dad bod a little more, that's all I want

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
And just in general, just be a little more active

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I still was pretty

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Do you remember that article about the guy who

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
went from like total twink to total bear?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Seriously

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I'm not, I mean, I'm

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
40 and married, I'm not, you know

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Sure, sure, I would like to, but I'm not

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I'm not going to have a six-pack, and I'm totally fine with that

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
But exercise is good for your heart

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Well, and also, I'm going to be on it

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I'm going to keep it real, because I'm very real with you all

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I watched

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
some of this show

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
on Twitch, and I

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
looked at myself and I said, that is

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
the biggest I've been in a very long time

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I don't like it, I want to change it

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
And so, you know how you change it?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
You do something about it

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Exactly, change doesn't happen until you make it happen

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
So it's not just the

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
It's not just the

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I just want to, you know, everybody views

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
You know, I'm just saying

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
If you are fine with your

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
figure and, you know, full size

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
That is fucking great

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I'm just saying for me personally, because

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
wonderful people come in all shapes and sizes and colors

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
and formats and so forth

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
But I'm just saying for me, I looked at

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
this show

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
and I said, I'm capable

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
of better, you know, and especially

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Well, don't you feel better?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
It's been two weeks, give it, let's ask

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
me again in another month

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
You'll notice that just in general

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
you feel better, have more stamina

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
You know what I do feel better with is that I've also

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
in turn been trying to do more

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Like I've been eating out at work a lot

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Like I'll go to the taco place, I'll go to this place

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
I've really managed to

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And you know what I finally did that kind of worked

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Instead of forcing myself

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
to eat those diet meals

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I eat, and I don't want to give them free advertising

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
But I eat a particular brand of meal

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
It's not like Hungry Man

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
But it's more like reasonable portion

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
meal, it's not diet

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
But it's 400 calories, 500 calories

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I still feel like I'm actually eating something

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
As opposed to eating

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
you know, paper

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Well I just like the whole fuck it thing

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Which finally stuck in my head

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I mean people call it mindful eating, I prefer the

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
fuck it diet

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
But for me it's like

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
If you actually are enjoying what you're eating

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
You may not feel like

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
you have to finish it

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
It'll be there, you can get it again

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
As long as you have reasonable

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
income, if you enjoy a food

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
You can eat it again and you don't have to finish it

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So you know

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And you guys have been very open

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I'm really proud of you by the way, I'm proud of both of you guys

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Again, save the kudos

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
for about 4 more weeks

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I wasn't going to say anything until it was 21 days

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Because it takes 21 days to become a habit

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Save the kudos until I actually show some visible progress

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
But speaking of visible progress

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
You guys would know that Loki

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
was a bigger guy, a little bit

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
You were never like big

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
You know, you had a little more fluff

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
like me, but you guys wouldn't know it

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Loki has slimmed down quite a bit

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
So good for you

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
As of the last few months

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Sometimes the wagon, sometimes the trains

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
get derailed

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Even with my thing, I've been on a plateau

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I was on a big plateau for a couple of months and then started losing again

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
And then my weight hasn't changed

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
But I went down a size

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And you've been very open about

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
You went through a huge life change

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And you're like, your feet aren't going to get any better

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Your back's not going to get any better

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Until this happens

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And I was very close to pre-diabetic

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
So I was like, okay, fine, I'll do it

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
And I have no regrets

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
PoppyBlackWolf says, I'm still fat and happy

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Great?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Awesome

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
And Bobby

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
has a great presence on Twitch too

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
So it works, great

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And he says, fitness, whole pizza in my mouth

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
If you are

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
If you are happy being squishy, then be squishy

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
And also, you know what, just because I'm saying I'm doing these different things

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You think I'm going to rob myself of pizza

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
When I go to Dragon Con

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
You better believe I'm going to eat what I want

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Who said yes to free pizza at work yesterday?

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
This bitch

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
When I went to Vegas

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
You better believe I ordered exactly what I wanted

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Because

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You don't always get to eat at those

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I don't want no goddamn salad

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
You know what though

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
There are a few things that I miss

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I miss buffets

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I don't

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I can't eat enough to make a buffet worth it anymore

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
But I fucking miss ice cream

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Like real ice cream

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And pudding

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I can't eat ice cream and pudding anymore

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I haven't been able to eat ice cream since the surgery

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Ten years ago when I had my gallbladder out

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
What about like fat-free?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I'm sorry, let me correct myself

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I can eat it

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
But it's one of those foods that my insides

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Don't

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Do you feel like you're being punched from the inside?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
A little bit

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
That's what I feel like

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I don't want to say the name

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
The stuff that advertises itself is only

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
300 calories in a pint because it's less dairy

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I eat that stuff

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And I eat frozen yogurt all the time

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Froyo is great

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
But you know what

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Anyway

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The quest one does to better oneself

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
There are sacrifices to make

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And if you

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Again, change doesn't happen

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Until you make it happen

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Once in a while I will eat

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Ice cream but it's like

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
I went to Dairy Queen

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And I'm fucking having a blizzard

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I don't care about the repercussions

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
But that's like once every few months

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It's not an everyday type of thing

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Anyway

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
So I didn't mean to get on that whole tangent

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I'm sorry, the whole point was

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I was trying to say

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I've

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I watched half of this week's

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Drag Race while on the elliptical

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
But I'm not through the whole

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
thing yet

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So I can't talk about Drag Race

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Because I don't know who got kicked off yet

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
But I have a pretty good guess

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
But anyway, until then

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
We will move on with more stories

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Let's talk about some more news

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Then we're going to open it up for your calls

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
If you want to derail the show with your topic

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
You sure can

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
And hang out in the green room

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
But it will be a little bit before we get there

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Because we got some more stories for you

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Starting with Loki

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
So now we're laying off some more people

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And this time EA is doing the laying off

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
The laying off I think was about 4% of their workforce

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Or 350 people in

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
marketing, publishing, and other areas

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Basically

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
There was an email

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
That was sent out saying that

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
We have a vision

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
To be the world's greatest games

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
If we're honest with ourselves

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
We're not there right now

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
We have work to do with our games

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Our player relationships and our business

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Across the company teams are already

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Taking action to ensure we are

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Creating higher quality games

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And live services reaching more platforms

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
With our content and subscriptions

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Improving our Frostbite tools

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Focusing our networks

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And cloud gaming priorities

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And closing the gap between us and the player communities

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
That says nothing about laying off the people

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
At all

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
So I'm not really sure

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
You know

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
What the case may be there

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
It seems like with a lot of these other companies

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
It's to kind of

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Meet the expectations of their

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Investors basically

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
You have a company that's

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Made so much money

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
That how are you gonna

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Top that the following

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Year because you've pretty much capped out

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
All the people that are gonna be playing your games

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
And now how do you become more profitable

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
While you lay off

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Some people to make your operating

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Costs lower

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I have a theory as to why this all happened

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
You wanna hear my theory?

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Let's hear your theory

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
And here's the thing

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
A lot of people are jumping at this going

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Anthem ruined EA

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
I think this might have been planned

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
A little bit sooner than we definitively

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Know how Anthem is doing or not

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
But we do know Apex has been

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Successful and you know what we talked about last week

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
On the show and what a lot of people are saying

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Very tongue in cheek about this

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Is that EA paid Ninja

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
A million dollars to stream the game

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
On and

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
You know it got all that visibility

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Who did they just lay off in this?

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
They laid off a lot of publicity people

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
A lot of promotional people and so forth

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
This in my opinion

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
And I'm just some

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Dude on a microphone with a podcast

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I'm not like an official investor or whatever

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
But I kinda see there's a link here

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Is that EA has now

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Learned that they can

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Just take their case to the

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Gamers in a different way and I'm not saying

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
That it's all

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Gonna go this way I'm just saying

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
EA's learned maybe where they can

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Make some change or where they wanna make some changes

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Whether it's effective

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Or not I guess that's for the market

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And the sales of the games to decide

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
But I'll be damned if I don't see some correlation here

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Between what we talked about last week

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
And this and my heart does go out to those

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
That are laid off I'm not saying it was the right move

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Or anything like that but it's just

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I can't help but notice this

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Loki you think there's something there?

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Well they were saying also that they're

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Ramping down their current presence in Japan

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And Russia to focus on different ways

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
To serve those players

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
In those markets so

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I think it's just restructuring

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
And

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I don't know I don't think that they're just

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
All of a sudden put all their eggs in

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Social media influencers

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Not all of them but

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Some of them

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
They laid off the entire staff I mean in some of these

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Other markets like Russia and Japan they did

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
But I mean

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I just don't think EA games

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Go over the same way in Japan

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
It's not really the same to the market

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So I think there's other

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Factors when it comes to those decisions

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But I think they're all

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Coming to a head at the end of the fiscal year

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Which is why these things are shifting

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Says business decisions aren't about what you did

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
But what you're going to do

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And then Tigerclaw kind of follows that up with

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I can see EA hiring a bunch of streamers

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
As their PR I don't think it's quite

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
The way you phrased it there Tigerclaw

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
But I think can

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Are they looking at perhaps it's

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
More cost effective

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
To have some of our PR

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Done for us by streamers

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
We've seen how that's worked out though

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Because they did the whole Battlefield 5

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Thing and I wouldn't see even

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Battlefield 1 was like that they had

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Social media influencers

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Or YouTubers or Twitch streamers or whatever

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Presenting and unfortunately they are not great

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Presenters and it was very awkward

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And again I'm not saying 100% of it is

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Going to be streamers I'm just saying a good chunk

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Of it but like I just

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Don't see

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
I don't see how that's

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Really going to hit more

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I don't know if they're getting their

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Money's worth with that you know paying Ninja

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
A million dollars

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Is that really going to recoup a million dollars

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Worth of profit back I don't think so

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I think it's

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I think they're wasting money there

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
But whatever I guess we'll have to

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I don't know I don't see the numbers

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Look at how Apex is doing I think

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
They did it Yeah but I don't think that's because of him at all

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Though I think it's because it was a game

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
By Titanfall devs that

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Look great I don't think it's him

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Specifically I think

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
We keep saying Ninja because he's

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Kind of this symbol of

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Multiple streamers that are doing this

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Thing and the general concept

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Of social media influencers

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
It's just that he's been on Ellen so he's

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Kind of the symbol right now of that whole thing

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
So to be clear I'm not saying

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Him specifically but I'm saying

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
That market

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
If you will of him and streamers

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Like him so anyway

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I don't know I think that's giving

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Them too much power to be honest

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I think

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I mean sure there's going to be

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Some influence over there

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Their crowd is going to get more impressions

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
To people that are maybe interested in that

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Type of gameplay because

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Obviously people that are following Ninja are

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Into Fortnite

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And so spinning

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Off to another battle royale type

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Genre game is going to be something

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
That's like oh hey you know maybe I could

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Try that because it's free to play or something

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Like that it's not necessarily going to be oh I'm going to jump

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Into like PUBG or something where I have to pay

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Money to I will absolutely give you

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That the fact that Apex is free

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Is a huge part of the reason why

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
It's succeeding absolutely yeah because if it's like

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
A $60 game I mean

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I don't know if it would have done as well

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
But I just

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I don't think

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
The thought process here is that

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Well these

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Media influencers

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Seem to be helping us out

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So we don't need our marketing department

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
No I don't think that's going to do it

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
They didn't eliminate the marketing department

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
They cut it back

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
That's the difference though

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
That's why I keep saying not 100%

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
But they're maybe looking at

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Some of these dollars that we're into putting on E3

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Right

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
No I understand that but it's not

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
You wouldn't cut back on marketing staff

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
You would cut back on your marketing spend

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
In different areas instead of putting all of my money

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
In TV advertisements

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I'm going to be shifting more to

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Web, video pre-roll

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Stuff

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Maybe these social media influencers

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Put my money there

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Where I know I'm going to get more of an impact

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
More of

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
A result that way versus

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Some older ways

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Of advertising before print

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Magazine advertisements

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Let's cut back on that

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I think that's more of the long lines

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
And maybe if that's the case

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
And the shift to these other types of platforms

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Maybe these people that were in those marketing positions

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Were towards

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Those types of

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Marketing

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Or maybe who cares

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And we don't need to know about the inner workings

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Of this company and it's not going to make their gains

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Any god damn better at all

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
So who gives a shit

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Sorry for the people that got laid off

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
EA I'm sorry I know you wanted to be the best company in the world

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
But guess what? Hopes and dreams aren't going to make

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
That fucking happen

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Your lack of loot boxes and shit will though

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
And I'll meet you there

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
This is not going to fix EA's problems

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Because it's very different than this

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
But way to have them spin

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Well we're going to do it now

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Okay

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Wasn't there like a twin story to this

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Something else to read with this

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Because I want to quickly get that out and move on

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
So EA announced a new publishing agreement

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
With Velen Studios

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
So they have a new game coming

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
To the Switch apparently

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
It's like a team based game

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
It's called DJ Hero

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Show me the game

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
They're making a game

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
It's coming to Switch

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Look

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Let's move on

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I want to talk about some news

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I think we all can agree on some great news

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
If you are

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Especially an Amazon Prime person

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Cheap plug by the way

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
If you are an Amazon Prime person

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Then guess what?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
You get one free Twitch subscription

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Every month

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I have done so today

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Hooray!

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Because then you can actually watch the video archive

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
At any time

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
The audio as it has been for 17 years

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
That same product the audio that we do is free

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
It's just something a little bit extra

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
But you can watch video archives of ourselves

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Bobby Blackwolf

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Now this indie game showcase

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
As well as anything we might do in the future

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
You'll have a nice big archive for our subscribers

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
So a big thank you to everybody who is subscribing

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Using their Amazon Prime

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Some people are paying out of pocket to do that

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
We really appreciate you guys as well

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I think also today is the last day to grab

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
The 2500 biddies

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
If it's not already done

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
You can get 2500 biddies for

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
25 bucks which means Twitch is kind of like

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Not taking their cut right now

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
So that's also

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Because we really appreciate the bits and all that stuff

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
So it helps us in getting the word out there

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
And some of the plans that we have

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
For this year with promo and all that good stuff

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Anyway those of you that are on Amazon Prime

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Guess what? You also get

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Other perks so you don't just get

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Your whole like you know that you can

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Subscribe to one Twitch channel every month

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
But you also right now

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
This is a big kind of a big deal

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
You get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Free

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
So if you haven't signed up yet

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Or even if you have actually

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You can go get 12 months for free

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And so yeah and I just did this today

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
You can extend

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Your current membership

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I think it only lets you 3 months right now

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Then 90 days you can do another

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
9 months

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
That's I think what they're doing to

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Like if anybody's trying to do the free trial thing

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Because you could go in with a free trial

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Of Amazon Prime or whatever

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Get your you know

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
So they're wanting to make sure people keep it I think

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
So yeah you can redeem 3 months now

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
And then in like 60 days, 2 or 3 months

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
You can get the rest of it

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
But you know I imagine a lot of you are

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Thinking about taking advantage of that

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
So yeah you can check that out

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
You see that pop right up there when you're logged into

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Twitch TV

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I'm signing up for it right now

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And you can extend your current membership

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
That's pretty crazy

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
You know what this reminds me of?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
This reminds me of the recent

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Spotify thing

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Where they were like, hey if you're a Spotify premium

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Person you get Hulu Plus

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
You know it's this like weird

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Alliance type thing they're doing

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
You know I'm sure Twitch has given Nintendo

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Some money and so forth but

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
It's pretty crazy so

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Anyway

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Oh

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Shane is pointing something else out here

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
This is also very interesting

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Shane is in our chat saying

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Unless you're in a family plan

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Then you get nothing

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
So those people that were like

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Coming up with their plan to share their family plan

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
With other people, doesn't work

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
This is only for an individual plan

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Good good footnote

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
I don't have a family plan

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Because it's just me and if Allen wants to play something

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
He just uses my account

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
He rarely plays anything on console these days anyway

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
So yes good call out though

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Let's see

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Tigercall on chat says I took advantage of this

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
But I can't activate it because I don't have a switch

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Well

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Maybe you'll be incentivized to get one

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Or maybe you'll go to a friend's house

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Or something I don't know

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
But I think it's kind of interesting

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Actf says

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
You can add it to your current subscription

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
If you aren't part of the family plan

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Yeah pretty neat

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Yeah you can get that for free

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
If you are not already on a family plan

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I mean

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Hypothetically

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
If I'm not mistaken you could

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Make your own account

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
That's not a part of the family plan

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
And then you could get it for 12 months on your own

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
But then why would you do that

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
You probably still have like 9 months left

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
In your family plan

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
That all started like November December

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Might not be worth it I don't know

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Anyway there you go pretty good deal

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
A lot of people are taking advantage of right now

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Moving on DarkSakura

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Well here are

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
I don't know it's kind of sad it's the end of an era

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
But Kaz Hirai

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
You know he went on to be the director and chairman

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Of Sony after stepping down as CEO

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Now he's officially retiring

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
But I mean he was the

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Dude that gave us

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
DarkSakura

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
But I think he did a pretty good job

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
With Sony

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
So he's going to be around

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
As a consultant

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
You know to put in input

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
And they say he's going to continue to advise

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
The company until he

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Decides not to

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Yoshida Kenichiro

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Put out a statement that says while he will be retiring

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
From both chairman and

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Board of directors we look forward to his continuing

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Support to Sony's management that

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Encompasses a breadth of diverse

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Businesses

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
You know for all the shit we gave this guy over the

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Years about that infamous Playstation

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
3 reveal at E3

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
You know he did move on

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
To other positions within the company

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
And has kind of overseen the Playstation

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
4 and the success that has come with that

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
So you know

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
As much as we joke about whatever the crayons and all that

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Stuff from back in the day I think

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
He really was fairly smart he just said some dumb things

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
They had a bad E3

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
And I mean a really bad E3

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
A really bad E3

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
But now it's a much different company

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
And I think

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
It's probably a good time

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
It's probably a good time for him

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
To transition this out

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And I love the whole he's going to be working for them

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
As an advisor until he doesn't

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Like

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I'm going to be doing this until I decide not to

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Well I mean that kind of is how it is

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
It's like us and Orange Lounge Radio

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
We'll continue to do this show

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Until we don't

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I mean seriously

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
That's how we are

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
No it is it is

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Or until Rob has another big diva fit

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
You never know time is short

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Yeah

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Live long diva hard

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Alright anyhow let's move on

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to get to the listener round table

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
With calls and discord and

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Questions in chat but Loki

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
You're really excited about this project

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Yeah this is pretty cool

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I never did get a chance to mess around with it

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
But it's been updated

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
So we talked about this I think months ago now

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
About the Mega Man Maker

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
That is out on PC

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
So basically it's this unofficial

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Almost like a Mario Maker

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Type thing for Mega Man games

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Well now they've added some additional stuff

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Into the game

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
That's focused around Mega Man 8 and 9

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
So they haven't

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Done like a retro form though

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
So they've got four new bosses

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Grenade Man, Astro Man, Tornado Man, Concrete Man

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
They have a quick swap tool

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Multi-boss option

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
And then you can even have it

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
So basically that means you can have Mega Man fight two bosses

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
At once

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
And just like a bunch of other updates

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
New little gimmicks and stuff

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
In there as well

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So if it's something you want to check out

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I don't know where you can actually

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Pick this up but I see that they have

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Something on YouTube

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Regarding it

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Oh you can download it at

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
MegaManMaker.com

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Of course it would make sense

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
That would be the URL for that

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
So that's where you can check it out

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
It's free and

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
I'm curious to see if anyone's made anything cool

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
With this probably

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
I'm with Dark Tetsuya in our chat room

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Who says Mega Man Maker just makes me sad

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Mega Man universe never materialized

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Yeah but you know what

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
When the official company decides

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Not to do it other people kind of step

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
In sometimes and homebrew it up

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
And it looks pretty neat

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
They've got some pretty interesting things in this

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
So I mean it definitely

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Looks pretty cool

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
I guess we'll have to check it out

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Yeah that might be a fun thing to do some live streams with

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
At some point or something

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
SG100Matt in chat says

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I was going to say Mega Man universe looked like an amazing

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Idea

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Tigerclaw says how about Metroid Maker

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
It's probably out there

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Someone did do a Metroid Maker already

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
In fact there's some ROMs

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Out there to do like fan built

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Metroid

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
And they certainly have the shuffles

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
The random generated ones

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I always mean to get in there and play some of those randomizers

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I like the mixed randomizers with Legend of Zelda

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Yes I've seen that one too

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
The Zelda and Metroid one

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Yeah they did it at GameStun quick

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Yeah that looks so cool

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Anyway

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Let's move on one more story for you guys here

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
And this has to do with

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
You know another YouTuber

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
But one that might not have as many people

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Watching as a Ninja

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
But she should

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Her name is Shirley Curry

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Which I love her name

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
She's 82 years old and she is a

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Grandma that plays Skyrim

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
She is the Skyrim Grandma

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I'm going to be playing Skyrim when I'm 82 years old too

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Well probably not Skyrim

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
She's like I was young like you once

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
But then I took an arrow

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Alright anyway

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
This is cool Bethesda announced this week

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
She will be appearing in the Elder Scrolls 6

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
They use technology to scan her face

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
And she's going to be a character in the game

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Funny enough

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
This little peek behind the scenes

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
That we saw

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Is really like our first true look

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
At anything

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
With the Elder Scrolls 6

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I mean that announcement trailer was what

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
A photo and a maybe logo

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
This was really the first true

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Look we got at the game because

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Bethesda's already said don't expect

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
This until Starfield's done basically

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Which on that note

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I should also say kind of like a tangent

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
From this Bethesda has also

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Indicated you will not be seeing either of

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
These things at E3 this year

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
So if you are expecting that this will be

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Starfield's year or this will be

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Elder Scrolls 6's new Vegas remaster

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Keep right on thinking

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
It seems like at this point Bethesda may be

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Holding those things for the

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
PlayStation 5 next

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Xbox etc etc

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
What's coming next for gaming

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
So don't expect that at this year's E3

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
They're setting those expectations now

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Anyway this was all revealed at a PAX East

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Panel this is where this information came out

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
It was actually an Elder Scrolls 25th

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Anniversary panel I didn't realize the series

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
As a whole I mean probably because

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Most of us didn't really really follow it

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Until Morrowind I mean no disrespect

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
To like Arena and the games before it but I think

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Morrowind especially Morrowind was on

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Xbox so that's when the game really

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Started to get more steam

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
The original Xbox not Xbox 360 that was Oblivion

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
But anyway

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
So yeah they were talking about the photo capture technology

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
And then they showed good old Grandma Shirley

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Actually being in the game and

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
When asked for comment she said

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
This means a lot to me because I would be

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Extremely happy to know that somebody else

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Was playing with my character

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
In a future Elder Scrolls game

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
She has 483,000 people on YouTube

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
It's not a nothing

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Nothing to a bulk at

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
She's got about a thousand times the people

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
That we do

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
So good for her that's great

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I love that too

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
And I think that's so

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
So good what she's saying there about like this is

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Something that will be there

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Forever essentially you know after she's

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Gone and as video game historians look back on

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
A game like Elder Scrolls 6 she will have

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Played a small part of that and I think that's a really

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Until she comes out and says racist things on

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Twitter and then they can patch her out of the game

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Well let's hope not

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Let's hope she doesn't do that let's just hope

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
She's pretty level minded

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And so forth

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Slidekickingchat says Rob did you say this will be

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Garfield's year? I most certainly

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Did not

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Starfield very big different

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
But I will say

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Garfield and I both hate Mondays

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
So there is that going for us this year that's for sure

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
You know what always bothered me about that?

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Garfield's a fucking cat and doesn't have to

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Go to work

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Why the fuck would he hate a Monday?

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Just doesn't make sense to me

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I don't know I also appreciate

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Garfield without Garfield

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Is that still a thing? That's just really sad

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
It is I love those

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
It is

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Poor John

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Ciatiberianchat says do you also love lasagna?

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Hell yeah Hell yeah I love lasagna

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Anyway

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
You know what

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
If we still had a fortune cookie I would have

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
you play Weird Al's Lasagna

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Everybody in chat is

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Bobby in act after chat

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
chiming in saying

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
John leaves to work on Mondays

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
That's why Garfield hates Mondays

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Yeah but Garfield only tolerates John

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Isn't that the truth

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Alright let's get to the listener round table

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
If you want to call in to talk about literally

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
anything but Garfield

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Hopefully it has something to do with games

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
You can join our Discord server

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
right now over at

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
voggenetwork.com

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Discord and we're going to be taking

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
some of your calls here on the show except I'm not

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
configured here on the show computer to do that yet

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
So Loki

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
I'm sure you probably have some last minute stories you want to get to

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
while I get everything configured here right?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I've been looking at these videos

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
on Twitter so apparently Sonic

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Ether's unbelievable shaders

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
for Minecraft is

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
probably pretty close so he's in

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
One of the experimental builds he has now

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
it has ray tracing in it

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
and it looks amazing

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
So

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
That's pretty awesome

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I'll have to check that out

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Apparently you can get it if you go back

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
I'm on Patreon Sonic Ether

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
They're $10 and you get access

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
to their experimental shaders

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Apparently the ray tracing though is still

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
not entirely optimized it only runs at

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
25 to 40 frames per second

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
with far distance

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
on maxed out

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
PC so they had like a

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
9900K with

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
a GTS

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
was it

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
1170 Ti

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
or a 1070 Ti

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
and

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
but god it looks

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
it looks amazing

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
This is what I want to see

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
For the 4K pack

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
This is better than their 4K pack

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Anyway before you get some more stories

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
We actually have some people waiting to call in

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
and be on the show tonight so I'm going to get to it

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
and get to a call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Oh they disappeared

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Let me try one more time to bring them into the room

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
and see if they want to be on the show tonight

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
I'm on Ambience

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I didn't know what I was doing on my phone

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
so whatever it's Shane

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Hi Shane how are you?

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I'm on Ambien and tired

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Okay well that's

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
that's what Ambien does

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
so before you fall asleep what did you want to call in

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
about tonight to talk about?

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
So we know that

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I defend Anthem a lot

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
I think it's a great game

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Dustin and I hit 30

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
today

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
He just dropped out

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Did he just hit the

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
disconnect button? Shane just fell asleep

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
He stopped making Ambien Skype calls

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
He just

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
just so you guys know he disappeared from

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Discord so he either

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
that's not our internet or anything

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
or those problems that we were having earlier

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
he was in the chat and then he wasn't

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
because

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
you're looking at Britney Spears because somebody put that

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
in our Discord before I started

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
taking calls

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Alright I'm going to try this one more time

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Are you back?

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Yeah I'm back I don't know what happened

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
You hit the disconnect or you quit or something

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
No I didn't I was just

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
straight up talking

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
It was taking Ambien too

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
You were talking about Anthem so even though

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
a lot of folks are expressing

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
displeasure with this game you're into it

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
What is it that

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
you love so much about this game?

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
It's fun the story is not

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
half bad

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
the flying is great

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
the different javelins make the

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
game feel differently for you so

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I'm not big on just like shooting things

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
but I am big on being like a

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
mage and blowing stuff up

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
so I found something that works for me

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
and Dustin

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
doesn't really like to shoot stuff

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
so he found something that works for him

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
that just melees everything till it dies

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
so it's been pretty fun

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
it's like Mass Effect multiplayer

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
And so it was

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
worth the $60 at the end of the day?

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Well I didn't pay

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
$60 because I

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
had Gamers Club

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
from Best Buy

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
so yes it was worth whatever that was

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
$42 or something

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Right I always forget

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
some people are playing it through EA's subscription service

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
because subscription services are the way

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
to go these days

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Well and that's kind of where my call

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
was leading because I love this game

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
the bugs are sometimes annoying

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I got into a mission today and I didn't have a head

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
I didn't understand why

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
but I was flying around with no head

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
but

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
during my ambient shopping

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
last night

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
I

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
decided to

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
pick up PC copies

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
for us because he really likes

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
the game and I like playing the game with him

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
so I was like well now we can play on our PCs

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
if we want

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
because we've been playing on Xbox

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
and so we go

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
install the games, put in our codes

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
apparently since

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Friday

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Origin is

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
all sorts of broken for

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
the west coast and

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
central US and

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Canada

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
It'll keep telling you you're not connected

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
online so you can't launch any of the games

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Yikes

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Yeah so this is one of those times

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
where I can't defend

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
something to do with EA that I like

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
because I actually think Origin is pretty good

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
but

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
this has been a real

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
annoyance today because we hit

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
30 and I was like here let's go

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
play it on computer and just get started

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
and we're just sitting there and it keeps saying

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
oh we see you're not connected to the internet

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
it's like no we are

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
interesting because

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
because Apex is all

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
through Origin I mean yes I know Apex is on

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
consoles too but that means

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Apex isn't working for people too

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Yikes

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
That's their bread and butter right now so that's

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
a little surprising to hear that

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
The only work around is apparently

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
using a VPN and having it

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
think you're like east coast

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
East coast apparently is having no problems

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
it's just the west coast and

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
central

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Weird

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I wonder if it's like the data centers that's routing you too

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
like there must be an east coast data center and a west coast

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
data center and so the west coast one is having

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
issues

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Yeah since Friday and they haven't fixed it

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
so I don't know what's going on

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I kind of killed my buzz for playing

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
the rest of the day so

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
That's too bad

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Alright so

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
What?

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
And in the amazing video game news

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I got the soundtrack

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
to Silent Hill 2 on vinyl

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Nice

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
And one of the records

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
is like a black and red

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
swirl that you can see through if you

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
put it up to the light and on the

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
back of it and the little hole around it

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I don't know the paper around the hole

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
says there was a hole here

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
it's gone now and it just made my day

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
That's pretty good I didn't know they were

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
releasing that on vinyl that's pretty rad

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Yeah they also have Silent Hill 1

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
for vinyl right now but not 3 or 4

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
which is actually the ones I'd want

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Alright well maybe if the other ones sell

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
really well they'll do the other ones in the future who knows

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
So yeah

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Well I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
but you know in the future you know you prevent

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
ambient shopping and so forth

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Have you ever considered like when you take an

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
ambient like go to bed?

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
That's what I'm about to do

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Alright just checking

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I mean ask your doctor but it just would seem

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
like if you want to prevent

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
unnecessary shopping

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
you just go to bed when you take the

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
ambient

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Ok they tell me to take it in bed but I take it like an hour

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
and a half early so the effects

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
start kicking in and even

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
then even then I would

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
just take my phone to

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
bed and then they're shopping right there

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
But then yeah I guess

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
you need to disable shopping on your phone

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Real quick before we let you go because we are getting a question for you

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
in our chat room. ActDeaf wants to know

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
how many shinies did you get yesterday

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
in Pokemon Go?

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
3 Lotad

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
and I think

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I ended either 15

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
no like 16 or 17

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Castform

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Wow I was going to say 3 is low

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
for you but that Lotad thing

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Not a lot of people

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Yeah people are not happy with the way those research

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
quests went down I guess

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
No. Oh and here's another problem

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
sorry I'm keeping me on the line

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
It's fine

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
At least here

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
the spawns kind of sucked

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
and I would see a lot of

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Castforms just regular Castforms

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
but wouldn't it be sunny

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
like sunny Pokemon

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
weather boosted sunny Pokemon wouldn't be out

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
it'd be like I don't know

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
partly cloudy so when you

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
get quests that say catch X amount

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
of weather boost what are you

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
going to do? You really

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
can't

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
It happens at least 3 of the time

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
3 of the hours that we played

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
It didn't seem like the spawns were

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
increased but I felt like

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
we went to the usual spot at the capital and it felt like it was

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
ok it was fine

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
but yeah we

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
didn't have that but I never need

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
to see a shiny Castform again

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Alright fair enough

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Alright I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
but goodnight

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Alright

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
We're going to get to some more calls here

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
I see this person I don't think this one's called

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
in the show before so let's see if we can get them on

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
We're going to bring them in to chat and say hello

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Hey this is Ninja Bunny

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Hey Ninja Bunny good to hear from you what's up?

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I want to

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
talk about

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
wait hold on I'm echoing

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
there you go I wanted to talk

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
about

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
time investment

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
in games

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Sure what do you mean

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
elaborate on that a little bit

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
what do you mean by time investment in games?

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
So I play a lot of fighting games

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
and

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
pretty much I feel like

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
if you get good at Street Fighter

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
3 or Street Fighter 5

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
or whatever the hell you're playing

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
those skills transfer

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
over to other fighting

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
games

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
and I don't really like to waste time

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
so

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
that's one of the reasons why

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I don't play MMOs because

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
I don't feel like any of those

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
skills or anything like that

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
transfer over to other MMOs because

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
you still have to grind for

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
items and skills and all that stuff

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Unless you say the melee class

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Well I kind of see

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
where he's going though I get what he's saying is that

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
like generally you know when you're

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
playing fighting games like you push the stick

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
up you're always going to jump

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
but like in MMOs

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
the whole like backbone

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
about how the game functions

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
and you know the fighting style let's say

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
is very different between you know

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 11

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
and Guild Wars they're all very

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
different whereas you know in fighting games

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
you have punch, kick, jump

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
you have different types of punches and kicks but generally

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
you know and it's not to say all fighting games are

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
the same but I kind of see

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
I kind of see where you're going with this

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
so is

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
sorry we cut you off did you want to finish your thought or ask a

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
question or? Oh it's

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
just mainly why I don't like

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
why I don't enjoy games like Banjo Kazooie

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
or Donkey Kong

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
or anything where you have to like

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
collect a bunch of shit and it's also the

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
main reason why I don't like Breath of the Wild

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Oh

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
right because I read you a little bit earlier

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
for the whole Breath of the Wild comment interesting

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
well you know and that's okay all joking aside

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
you know people like what they like

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
and that's okay because

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
you know for instance here at Orange Mountains Radio

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
we don't often talk about sports

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
games there's not a lot of sports we don't really

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
play Madden and stuff like that now

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
some of the old school classics like I heard they did

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
NBA Jam at PAX East today that's

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
pretty cool but you know

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
like a lot of the newer modern sports

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
games we just don't get into those so much

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
but you know I completely understand as someone

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
who's been you know commentating on this for a long

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
time there's a lot of people who play

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
sports games and who buy Xboxes and

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
things to play sports games

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
specifically and in some ways

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
you know what one could say what you're

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
saying here about fighting games in some

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
ways is also true of sports games

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
that like you know if you know how to play

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
football for real you kind of already

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
know what the rules of Madden are gonna be

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
sorta sorta but

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
you know but on the flip side of that

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
and I'm sure you recognize this but for

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
some people that collecting

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
that exploring

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
that's the reward that's

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
what some people love to do

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
specifically when it comes to Breath of the Wild

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
because you know a lot of people

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
think of Zelda as like being on this map

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
and you know this dungeon is here

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
and then you go here and there was you know

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
a lot of especially the older Zelda games was very much

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
a way that you progress

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
and you go through the game that with

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Breath of the Wild it opened it up

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
and it opened it up really big

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
to a point where maybe it felt a little inaccessible

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
if you didn't really ever play these kinds of games

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
but at the same time also led to

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
a sense of reward for

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
exploration like oh I had no idea

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
this temple was hiding

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
behind this corner over here or what

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
have you and the whole concept

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
of oh sometimes there's

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
more than one way to get through

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
an issue like especially when it comes to like

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
the snowy areas like

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
what you can build a coat I think at some point

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
you can eat fire food

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
you can just fucking run for it and hope

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
you make it before you die there's like

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
multiple ways to get through situations

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
and that I think is fun for some people

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
as well but that doesn't what I think is

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
that the skill that you develop with something like Breath of the

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Wild is the ability to look around corners

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
and so when I started

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
you know after playing a little bit of Breath of the Wild

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I actually did apply it to World of Warcraft

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
and found that I was

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
well mostly to my breaking you know

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
barriers in the game and breaking

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
the game but I found that it helped

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
I do want to read

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
a couple of comments here in our chat over

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
twitch.tv slash vog network

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Questbuster in chat says that's one of

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
the issues about games like Fallout 76

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
that the loot system

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
as it is right now doesn't respect your time

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
oh wow I found a legendary

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
mob and it drops junk again

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
you know that was a big problem in the

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
early days of Diablo 3 is that people

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
felt like the stuff they were killing was not giving

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
loot that was worth their time

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
but anyway I digress

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
so I mean let me just

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
let me ask you this NinjaBunny and then we'll kind of wrap up

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
like even though you kind of know this is where

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
you stand on these types of games

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
have you ever like played a game where you're like

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
you know I'm not usually

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
into this but this

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I'm into sort of like how we

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
said oh we don't really play sports games

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
but I got a soft spot for Blades of Steel

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I'm always gonna is there something that kind of like

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
breaks that down for you like

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
is there something that you play even though you

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
didn't think you'd like it

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Xenoblade Chronicles X

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
interesting

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
interesting because that is

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
definitely an RPG and there's a

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
lot to do in a game like that

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
why do you think that game

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
kind of broke the rule for you

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
probably because it has robots

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
you like robots are cool you like robots

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
and mechs and stuff hey

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
whatever the reason I just think it's always

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
interesting that like we might say we don't like XYZ

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
type of game but then it's like oh

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
but there's this one exception because

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
it kind of did this thing differently in this case

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
you know what I'll give it to you

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
it was an RPG fantasy

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
thing that's not swords and

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
shields and magic and like I love all that

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
stuff it's fucking robots

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
it's different

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
right that was like the original

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Xenogears yeah well I mean that's

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I was nagging you guys to do that a long time ago I'm

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
so glad that's so exciting

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
yeah we figured you know we're just going

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
to go for it and uh

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
keeping mostly the same

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
format but uh trying

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
on a little bit more of a conversational

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
take on things so we hope you like

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
it um but I didn't want to just plug

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
my podcast I did have a

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
question for you Robin I don't

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
know uh because I was just in Final Fantasy

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
14 and

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
I was dealing with that terrible

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
raid with um

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Diabolos uh

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
like it took three hours just

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
not really but like it took a long time in the

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
alliance roulette so uh

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
I did not get to tune in when I

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
had hoped to but

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
um so my question

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
is like I don't know if you talked about

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
this earlier on the episode I

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
apologize but um

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I wanted to know what your thoughts are

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
on the whole

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
vera controversy with

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
no male bunny boys for Final Fantasy

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
14 because I know that you

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
played a lot of Final Fantasy

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
11 where uh

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
you know there were only the

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
um the male only race

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
and the female only race and then

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
uh you were at the launch of

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Final Fantasy 14 too right where we're still

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
gender locked so I kind of wanted to know

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
your perspective on that and uh

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
so I I did address

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
this a little bit on last week's show but that's okay

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
I don't mind um answering the question again now that I've

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
had time to like process my thoughts a little more

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
um I think the big the

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
the reason why I had a really big

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
negative reaction to the fact that they

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
did not do the boy bunnies it's

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
you know sure I was looking forward to Rolling

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
One and all that but also I just

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
thought the Hrothgar that they

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
showed that they did announce just didn't

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
look good like it looked like they were just

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
using the um Rogadin characters

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
but put these like animal masks on them

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I wasn't really a fan of that like I almost

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
feel like they shifted course

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
part way through it's so

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
weird for Yoshi P to get up on stage

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
and be like this is gonna be the last race

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
this is it and then all of a sudden

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
get up on stage again later and be like okay

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
but we got one more race and this is it

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
and it's just it's just weird but here's the

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
thing I think the reason why the whole thing

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
bothered me it just seemed like this unnecessary

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
change in policy

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
and this has been a thing that was bugging me through

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
a couple things that Final Fantasy 14 has done lately

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
um and the reason why I say unnecessary

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
change in policy is that when Yoshi

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
and his team took over

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
and I want to make very clear a lot of people

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
have been very nasty online about this whole

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
thing and you know I am not about that so

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
like do not cyberbully people that work hard

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
to bring you games but I can say

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
I don't agree with this decision and this is

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
why when they originally took over

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Realm Reborn you you

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
nailed it in 11 they

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
had this um the Mythra

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
which became the Mikote they were gender locked to women

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
only and then they had the Galka

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
or now they became Rogadin that were gender locked to men

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
only and they decided when they didn't

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Realm Reborn they were like you know what we're listening to the fans

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
and we didn't really get the

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
point of the gender lock so you know what

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
eh we're gonna get rid of the gender lock and

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
give the fans what they want so

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
it seems weird to me that they would do

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
that and then suddenly come out

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
and say but you know what the Viera

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
are only gonna be females because

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
the lore that's the way the lore

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
is you know if you played Final Fantasy 12

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
you know it's the men stay in the

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
shadows and they're in hiding and it's like

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
bitch you write the lore

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
if you don't

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
like the lore fix it

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
like it's very easy

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
for you to do this and if you

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
want to talk about the lore

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
well they've directly connected the

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Hrothgar to

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Ronso and I believe

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
in Final Fantasy 10 somebody

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
correct me if I'm wrong there were

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
female Ronso in

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Final Fantasy 10 I mean didn't

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Kilmari have a wife or something

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
like I'm almost talking about it

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
yeah so like

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
it's so even worse

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
your plan B solution

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
is not lore

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
accurate and this also

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
just ties in the reason why I say this isn't unique

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
to the races in Final Fantasy 14

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
is it it kind of ties into the whole

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
problems of Blue Mage right

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
they had to make Blue Mage a limited

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
job because oh that was that's the

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
lore that's the way we remember playing them in Final Fantasy

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
5 and it's like you

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Final Fantasy 14 is a new entry

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
in the series you have every right to

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
rewrite some lore like you

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
can make Blue Mage like take some of the

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
basic components of Blue Mage like oh

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
they learn spells from monsters and

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
like do your own thing with it

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
like they did the last time you had an MMO

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
in Final Fantasy 11 it came out great

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
in 11 so why

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
why this dude like it doesn't

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
so I will give

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
them credit they do seem to be

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
hearing the feedback pretty loud and clear

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
and I think they will probably

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
ultimately patch in the

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
the you know the male

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
bunnies and the female Rothgar later on

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
but it just seemed like it just like

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
why why all of a sudden are we

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
inventing these rules that like we have to

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
follow these old established

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
patterns like Final Fantasy

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
14 made a name for

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
itself by taking the pattern

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
that had been established by Final Fantasy 11

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
and smashing it so

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
break the rules

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Yoshi you earned it

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
that's my thought

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
all right well thank

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
you for sharing your thoughts

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
you're welcome sharing

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
is caring I have a lot of feelings quickly

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
what are your thoughts you're a 14 player what are

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
your thoughts

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
you know I was going

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
to make I was going to consider

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
changing my aura into a bunny

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
boy but I really like my

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
aura so it kind of made that

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
decision easier I don't know I mean

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I understand why people are upset

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
but

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
you know on the other

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
hand it is just a game

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
so yeah I don't know

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
it is I had my moment

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I inhaled exhaled

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
and I played 14 you had your own touch moment

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000

sorry I'm going to end the calls there tonight

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
only because I've got like this headache coming on

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
and we're already almost 20

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
minutes past nine o'clock because some of the tech issues

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
at the beginning so I do kind of want to start

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
to wrap up but I do want to make sure if there's any other big

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
stories we get those out as well yeah I'll try

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
to be very quick Sega announced

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000

to pretty soon enter the Genshin

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
final update farewell to arms

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
was coming out on April 5th

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000

the gunslinger so that's

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
something to look forward to this week

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
let's see

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
also

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
that guy

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Tyler Barris

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
who was a swatter that got an

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
innocent man killed over a

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
mall

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
in a monetary bet of Call of Duty

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
he got sentenced to 20 years

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
in prison over that

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
that's what you get for being shit

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
he pled to I think like 50 counts

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
of I don't remember

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
false reports

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I don't remember exactly what the charges were

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
but 20 years surprise manslaughter

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
isn't on there yeah I'm surprised

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
too and then of course

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
not to be outdone by PlayStation and

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Microsoft had their ID

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
at

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Xbox Game Pass

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
web video and

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
so they announced several games

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
that are going to be coming to Game Pass

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
day one including Killer Queen

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Black, Outer Wilds, and

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Blazing Chrome

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
and those are going to be

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
the same day as they launch

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
and those will be out before the

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
end of 2019 they had other ones

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
on the list as well but I don't remember

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
all of those

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
but it's neat to see that they're going to be

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
supporting more indies that way

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
that's pretty much it

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
ok thanks

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Loki for holding down the fort while I ran

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
off to get a glass of water to try to make myself

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
feel better with this little headache I've got going on

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
again I want to apologize to those that didn't get through

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
but please feel free to send us an email for a future week

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
participate at orangelandtrady.com

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
but it is that part of the show where we go

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
so since I see Dark Sakura finishing a chocolate there

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
I'll start with Loki, Loki your final thought tonight

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
my final thought is I gotta finish

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
over all these edits onto my cabinet

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
so I've got 8 down and probably

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
another 20 left

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
it's a lot

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
but it'll be new stuff to play

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
and they don't look easy at all

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
alright, sounds like much

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
including a Legend of Max

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
edit by Gatton

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
so that's, I'm not looking

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
forward to that, but I'm going to play it

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
let's see my final thought is

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
headaches are crap

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
and I hope this one goes away soon

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I'm ready to take a nap

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
but at this late hour that would mean just go to bed

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
so that's what I'll be doing pretty soon here

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
as soon as we wrap up

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Dark Sakura, excuse me, last but not least

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
your final thought

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I've had a constant headache since the beginning of February

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
and I found out why

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
so

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
I just want some

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
good vibes, do not pray for me

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
because

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
prayer without action is nothing

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
but I would appreciate some good thoughts

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
unless you're a witch

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
then you can cast a good spell for my neck

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
but other than that

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
I'm about to go to Walmart on

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
purpose to buy the

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
machines that we're missing

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
we actually are missing Dig Dug

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
they had a couple more of those, I think they had a couple more

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
of both the ones I bought yesterday, so I think you should be fine

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
we already have the Ms. Pac-Man, but we don't have the Galaga

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
so I'll be going back for Galaga

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Galaga is the target collection

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
no, but there was another Galaga

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
actually, Dan looked them up

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
so apparently there's a Galaga in that series now

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
he's still like number 9

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I'll look at it, we'll see

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
but also chocolate is amazing

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
and one last important thing

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
for everybody, there's only one you

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
in this world, take care of yourself

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
alright

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
take care of yourself everybody

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
we will see you, we're going to do this all again in

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
7 days, have a wonderful night everybody

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
thanks for being with us, oh I almost forgot

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
my usual spiel, if you enjoyed what you heard

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000

help us spread the word, because we are the show

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
where every gamer has a voice, but if your voices

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
aren't here, what are we to do, we're lost

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
and with that, have a good week everybody

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
we'll see you in 7 days, good night

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
you've been listening to Orange
