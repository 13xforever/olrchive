7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, gaming continues its new era of pivot, Microsoft is ditching exclusivity,
18000	22000	Nintendo is both mobile and big screen, and Sony officially ends its handheld gaming machine.
22000	24000	We don't know where gaming will end up, but we'll explain where it is.
24000	28000	This, along with the rest of the gaming news, starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show,
37000	40000	where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio,
40000	46000	live tonight with episode number 766 for this March 3rd of 2019.
46000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as he does every week here on the show is Techmaster Loki.
51000	52000	I'm here.
52000	53000	Hi Loki, how are you doing?
53000	54000	I'm multitasking.
54000	55000	You are multitasking.
55000	58000	We're having to kind of make some arrangements on the fly tonight.
58000	62000	So, not joining us tonight, unfortunately, is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
62000	66000	I do know this was supposed to be the first week that she was back with the show.
66000	70000	Unfortunately, guys, I was just informed a couple hours ago, there's been a death in her family.
70000	76000	Unfortunately, her husband's stepdad, and they were close, passed away.
76000	82000	So, obviously, a lot of our thoughts and well wishes to DarkSakura, and I've let her know.
82000	86000	Anything we can do to help, we will do, but sometimes in situations like these,
86000	93000	you just need some time to do, process, think, and do all of that.
93000	96000	So, that is exactly what we're going to let DarkSakura do.
96000	99000	So, we'll hold down the fort with just myself and Loki tonight,
99000	102000	and if she's ready to come back next week, then we'll be all ready for that.
102000	108000	But joining us adjacent to the studio is Mr. Smoosh, making a ruckus of noise here.
108000	111000	So, I apologize if that gets picked up by the mic.
111000	114000	I don't know why he's bonkers crazy tonight.
114000	118000	Yes, he's fed. We take excellent care of him here. I think he just gets bored.
118000	121000	I think he wants another cat, but I'm like, ugh.
121000	123000	Don't get me wrong, I want another cat.
123000	127000	I just don't want to deal with all the landlord stuff that comes with having another cat.
127000	130000	But soon, soon, we'll figure all that out.
130000	134000	Anyhow, you guys, of course, can join us live, because we do tape live every Sunday night,
134000	137000	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
137000	142000	but broadcasting live on Twitch, at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
142000	145000	We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night,
145000	148000	right after our pal, The Bobby Black Wolf Show.
148000	150000	Bobby Black Wolf and his show.
150000	154000	And, yes, thank you guys in chat. I see all the love pouring out from our chat room.
154000	157000	Definitely will pass that along to Miss Summers.
157000	160000	Anyhow, DarkSakura in chat says,
161000	164000	Sounds like my wife, she was thinking of getting another cat to keep hers company.
164000	167000	I think it's the only thing that'll calm some cats down.
167000	171000	And Mr. Smoosh is such a social cat that I'm sure he wants somebody else.
171000	175000	But then you have to deal with the whole, you got to bring, you know, he's already,
175000	178000	when we rescued him, he was three years old, so now he's going on four years old.
178000	183000	So he's kind of already, you know, at a certain age, it's kind of hard to mix cats together sometimes.
183000	185000	You have to make sure it's going to be a good fit.
185000	189000	The whole reason we got Mr. Smoosh in the first place is that the person who originally rescued him,
189000	193000	because somebody, the original owners, just left him outside, which is really tragic, obviously.
193000	196000	But the original person who rescued him tried to bring him in,
196000	200000	but the existing cat that she had was not having it.
200000	203000	So, you know, it's kind of a big risk in that regard.
203000	207000	It kind of helps if they're already together when they're littler.
207000	210000	But anyway, I don't mean to turn it into a cat discussion show.
210000	213000	After all, I just saw one of those shows on Netflix this past week.
213000	215000	There's a cat discussion show?
215000	220000	No, it was, well, like a cat rescue show. It looked like it was Rescue 911 for cats.
220000	221000	Rescue Cats?
221000	223000	I think that's what it was. Something like that.
223000	226000	I don't know, it was definitely a British show.
226000	229000	Now, is it the cats rescuing people? Because that would be more interesting.
229000	231000	No, it was the people.
231000	234000	Yes, I don't know what the actual is. Somebody in chat will shout it out.
234000	236000	There was a show all about cats.
236000	240000	But there's also a cat fashion show one, or something.
241000	243000	Like best in show, you remember that movie?
243000	246000	Like a documentary on that stuff for cats? For real?
246000	249000	So it's like with cats, except they're trying to get them to do the obstacle course,
249000	250000	and the cat's like, I'm not doing that.
250000	253000	But there's another one. There's another cat documentary that just hit Netflix as well.
253000	255000	So, what can you do?
256000	261000	Well, we finally picked up Hulu, so now I'm going through the entire series of
261000	263000	It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
263000	264000	Good choice.
264000	265000	Because that's awesome.
265000	270000	And then I needed to do the same with South Park, because I'm several seasons behind in South Park.
270000	274000	In fact, I'm feeling that tonight. Does your cat make too much noise?
274000	277000	Anyways, that's my favorite episode of Always Sunny.
277000	282000	No, actually my favorite episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is the night man and the day man.
282000	285000	Everybody knows that episode if you've ever seen.
285000	287000	That's the best one. But anyway.
288000	293000	We could be a TV discussion show, I suppose, but we're actually here to talk about video games.
293000	294000	It's gaming culture!
294000	296000	It is. It is gaming culture.
296000	297000	If I-
297000	298000	There's It's Always Sunny.
298000	304000	Listen, they have all of these shows have memorabilia in GameStop. GameStop is a game store.
304000	307000	Therefore, this is perfectly fine.
307000	309000	Okay, fine. Alright.
309000	313000	But let's get into the kickoff topic tonight, which is a little bit depressing.
313000	318000	I mean, it's one of those things we've kind of been talking about for a little while.
318000	321000	We knew it was coming, but official this week.
321000	324000	Officially done this week, right, Loki?
324000	327000	Sure, it's officially done. The Vita. It's no more.
327000	328000	They've ended the-
328000	334000	They were down to like, I think last week when we reported on, they were down to two of the SKUs that were still available.
334000	336000	And now those are done.
336000	340000	So the Vita is no longer being sold by Sony any longer.
340000	346000	And they have no plans for another portable system as of yet that we're aware of.
346000	349000	I bet you anything Switch does really well.
349000	354000	Everybody likes to copy Nintendo, so we'll see.
354000	358000	What do you think, and I'm going to open this up to our chatters as well in our Twitch TV chat room at VOG Network.
358000	364000	What do you guys think were the good moments of the PlayStation Vita and the bad moments of the PlayStation Vita?
364000	373000	Like why it's not continuing when the 3DS still has game releases coming out in the coming months with Luigi's Mansion and all that.
373000	375000	What were the good things about the Vita?
375000	378000	Because we're not going to be one of those podcasts that's only negative about games.
378000	382000	So what were the good things, and then what were the not so good things that Sony could have done better?
382000	384000	I'm going to open this to chat to them.
384000	388000	The good things were, I would say, the hardware was nice.
388000	390000	I mean it was a nice system altogether.
390000	397000	They tried to pull like that back tap thing, which was not- that wasn't working out.
397000	401000	I think some of the games that they had released on it were really nice.
401000	412000	It was a powerful system as far as being able to play PlayStation 1 games, PSP games, the PlayStation Mobile stuff, the indies.
412000	420000	They had the Vita TV, which was also- it was cool, but no one really picked it up.
420000	426000	I don't know, I think overall it was a pretty decent system.
426000	431000	Yeah, I think the Vita was a really nice piece of hardware, like it really was.
431000	438000	It was a solid system, it was good to look at, very beautiful screen, great for like watching Netflix and things like that.
438000	444000	And they did some cool things like originally with it, but I don't know if it like- because I sold my Vita pretty quickly.
444000	451000	I had picked one up at one time, and then I was like, I'm just not playing this, and so I ended up selling it for something.
451000	453000	I don't remember what it was, I just ended up getting rid of it.
453000	460000	And one of the things I remember it doing was kind of like showing you players that were nearby, like locally.
460000	466000	Like it would just say, hey, this person's interested in this, or you can like exchange things between people.
466000	474000	It was almost like kind of a spot pass for 3DS, but not quite. I don't really know how to describe it.
474000	481000	And I think that while you're on that, that was one of the big negatives on the PlayStation Vita for me, was that things like that didn't make sense.
481000	488000	Sony never did a really good job explaining some of these features and why some of these features were needed.
488000	494000	And I think the biggest example of that, Loki, was 3G. Do you remember that the PlayStation Vita had 3G?
494000	503000	So here was PlayStation Vita 3G. Does 3G allow you to play multiplayer over a cell phone connection? No, it does not.
503000	505000	Okay, so what does it do?
508000	514000	And I don't think there was ever like a real, no, no, you're stream did not just die. I don't think there was ever a real answer.
514000	518000	No, it didn't really do anything. It was just, it was too...
518000	527000	Doesn't that scream missed opportunity? Like there should have been a Sony developed game that was capable of playing over 3G.
527000	534000	And I realized maybe because of the unreliability of the cell networks or whatever, maybe like a first person shooter type of game at the time would not have been it.
534000	539000	No, no, no. You remember, there are some games that allowed you to play over 3G.
539000	544000	And this is where the whole asynchronous multiplayer bullshit came into play.
544000	546000	Okay, what? Because I'm forgetting.
546000	549000	It's like taking turns or ghost data or some shit like that.
549000	556000	Well, I was going to say like a card game or a board game. Eye of Judgment for Vita would have been great because it would have...
556000	558000	Had Eye of Judgment for Vita.
559000	574000	Maybe I want to correct the record, but you know what I mean? Like those types of games, like as much as you say, you know, the A secret, you know, if again, if they had maybe marketed that a little more, you know, because Nintendo has a way of being able to market those kinds of games and make you understand why you need them like clubhouse games.
574000	577000	Can you imagine if Nintendo's clubhouse games was like a Vita?
577000	581000	And it also had, I think, a front and rear camera on the thing too, which...
581000	584000	It did, which also never really made sense.
585000	589000	But they have that on the DS and stuff as well, so that didn't make any sense.
591000	598000	I don't know. There's just a lot of tech in there that like, like the back touch sensor, I never understood the need for that.
598000	601000	Aside from there's a couple games that use it, but it's kind of gimmicky.
601000	608000	Some Sony things are hit and miss sometimes, like 6-axis didn't end up being a thing, but DualShock, like now you can't imagine life without it.
608000	615000	The tilt sensor stuff, they still use that in some games. A lot of people don't really care for it, but they use it sometimes.
615000	618000	Let's get some comments from chat over at VOG Network over on Twitch.
618000	626000	YYR comments, I still own the 3G Vita, and if it could have been used as a phone, I would still be using it as my smartphone.
626000	631000	It was my first portable internet-enabled device. I used it for Twitter, Foursquare, and web browsing.
631000	637000	So, I mean, yes, it could do all those things, but, you know, Sony never really, at least in this country, you know, it's hard for me to say...
637000	641000	I really think that they could come out with a new portable system.
641000	643000	I think so, too. I think Sony should try again.
643000	651000	And actually, like, just, you know, get a decent, you know, cell processor in there so you can actually do, like, 4G, you know, calling and data or whatever.
651000	658000	I think if Sony were to try this again, though, I think one thing I would really want to advise them to do is don't have a one-year plan.
658000	662000	Do not have a one-year plan on what this console is going to do.
662000	663000	Oh, that's the other thing, too.
663000	666000	Have a three-year plan. Because it feels like Sony, like, completely abandoned it.
666000	675000	Oh, no, no, no. I remember now, the 3G thing, too, about that. You were locked with AT&T, and they had cell phone plans with that as well, and they were expensive.
675000	681000	Yes, but I don't... I'm not going to fault Sony as hard for that because iPhone was in the first situation.
681000	686000	Remember, iPhone was AT&T exclusive for the longest time, and it still managed to be okay.
686000	690000	So, I mean, that's something that could have grown as time went on.
690000	695000	Maybe they had an agreement where AT&T was going to push the Vita in their own stores, and that's why they signed onto it.
695000	698000	That's why these companies make those types of agreements sometimes.
698000	704000	Just like why an indie game would sign onto PlayStation exclusive in the first place.
704000	711000	Because, like, a game like No Man's Sky, because Sony was going to help them market and help push them for better or for worse than that particular case.
711000	714000	And it was also a great device for remote play as well.
714000	715000	Yeah.
715000	716000	You know, they used to do that pretty well.
716000	723000	Yeah, and I just feel like this device was capable of so much more than Sony really ever did a good job of communicating,
723000	728000	or really had the faith in pushing forward with their first-party games.
728000	732000	Because, you know, again, one thing Nintendo always does well is that they really sell it with their first-party games.
732000	737000	They kind of... I know some of the games that they put out on it were pretty good, but like the ones you would...
737000	738000	And that was it.
738000	744000	No, but the ones that were supposed to be really good, like Killzone, or I think they had a Call of Duty game on there,
744000	747000	they were like outsourced to third parties to do that.
747000	751000	And not even saying like the Call of Duty one was outsourced to the normal Call of Duty teams.
751000	756000	It was like outsourced to some smaller company to put these games together, and they weren't that great.
756000	758000	And that was kind of the problem.
758000	765000	It's like these big games that you really want to draw people in for, they just didn't really have them.
765000	767000	Going to chat for some more comments.
767000	770000	Kaijuto disagrees and says, no, Sony, don't do another portable.
770000	774000	PSVR. Work on getting a flippin' theater app for PSVR.
774000	780000	As Joe 100 Matt says, I'm with Kaijuto, actually, they should never do another handheld and just focus more on PSVR.
780000	784000	And storage. They're proprietary memory cards.
784000	785000	That was a choice.
785000	788000	That was probably a bad call.
788000	796000	Let's see, and then YYR also said in chat, anyone releasing a dedicated portable at this point is suicidal.
796000	797000	Interesting.
797000	799000	I don't think that's necessarily true.
799000	804000	I mean, is it because phones, I'd like to kind of dissect that comment a little bit.
804000	809000	Is it because phones are more and more becoming like that's the only device you need and it plays games?
809000	810000	No.
810000	814000	Because are tablets even selling, because I would say, but tablets, people are still buying tablets.
814000	817000	But are they? Because iPads, you don't hear about those.
817000	819000	Well, iPads are expensive.
819000	824000	iPads are trying to sell those as almost like computer laptop replacements or something like that.
824000	828000	Okay, but Android tablets too. I don't really hear about those selling like they did five years ago.
828000	834000	Right. I don't think necessarily because, you know, a lot of people still have their tablets from five years ago.
834000	840000	That's the problem with a tablet like that. You don't really need to, like, my kids have cheap ass tablets.
840000	847000	I mean, they were like $70 tablets that they have and they're just fine.
847000	851000	I mean, those things can't do shit. They can't play anything.
851000	855000	I mean, they can play some things. They play Minecraft and Roblox, but they can't play shit.
855000	863000	So, granted, we could upgrade to a better tablet or, you know, for less money than buying an Android tablet,
863000	870000	we can buy a Nintendo Switch or a 3DS, you know, or something like that.
870000	878000	Do you think the answer is for PlayStation 5 to look like a Nintendo Switch where you can play it on your TV and it's portable?
878000	882000	Well, that would certainly help me in the situations where I don't have access to my TV.
882000	885000	I don't think it's necessary.
885000	890000	Yeah, it would be a little weird to see Sony and Microsoft, like, go full-on.
890000	896000	Let's just go full-on bizarre. Let's just do that it's all AR. It's just an AR headset to play that shit.
896000	903000	I think it would be smarter for these companies to adapt Switch-like technology and something that could beam to your cell phones.
903000	908000	Like, you could play, like, on your iPhone, you know, they just, or Android, whatever, both devices.
909000	912000	There's just an app that allows you to do the remote play on your app.
912000	918000	Although, granted, like, obviously, I don't think PlayStation games will play very well on a touch-only screen as well.
918000	928000	Like, you really need a controller. But maybe there's some things you could do through your, you know, Box, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Next, whatever it is,
928000	930000	that, you know, you could beam over to your iPhone.
930000	938000	I just think they should stop introducing new tech, or new, like, not necessarily new tech, new gimmicks to the hardware,
938000	943000	like new control schemes and stuff like that, unless they have some good uses for it.
943000	950000	Like, don't, you know, even with, like, the 3D stuff. The 3D stuff with the 3DS is pretty awesome, but no one ended up using it.
950000	956000	It was kind of a gimmick. And then, and it wasn't really a gimmick, it was because of the stupid health warnings.
956000	961000	Because they're like, oh, it's gonna hurt people's eyes! The young children are gonna go blind!
961000	967000	And then, it's that bullshit that fucking ruined the 3D stuff. That's what it was, it's that bullshit. Otherwise, it would've been cool.
967000	973000	And then, um, the rear touch thing, they have a front touch and rear touch on it, that's a little stupid.
973000	979000	I, I get the front touch screen, the rear touch, is that, that's just a fucking gimmick.
979000	983000	A little bit. It just, maybe they just didn't have the game that really sold you on the concept.
983000	986000	Because I can understand, and somebody in chat had said it, I'm sorry, I forget who.
986000	990000	But that, like, when you're using front touch, your fingers are getting in the way of the screen.
990000	995000	When you're using back touch, you can still see the entire screen, and yet, you know, be using your fingers in the back.
995000	999000	I just don't think they really had the game to really show that strongly.
999000	1006000	Again, you would think that Sony would develop that game, but Sony and Nintendo don't really design games the same way.
1006000	1013000	And are able to show off the hardware, and I think that's one big place where Sony, Vita, you know, kind of didn't do us well here.
1013000	1017000	But then again, you know, one thing we have to remember, in Japan, this is a very different story.
1017000	1025000	The Vita continued to do well over there for quite some time, uh, still being, I think even still today, there's still some Vita games coming out.
1025000	1028000	But it's gonna, it's gonna dry up pretty quick now that...
1028000	1029000	But why is that?
1029000	1031000	I don't, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if I know the answer to that.
1031000	1036000	Is it because, uh, you know, I think it, is it because the fact that a lot of their pop...
1036000	1037000	Maybe they explained it better there?
1037000	1042000	A lot of their population is using mass transit, so like portable devices are more popular.
1042000	1043000	Sure, sure.
1043000	1051000	Or the fact that, you know, maybe, you know, a home theater setup might be a little bit more rare because of spacing issues.
1051000	1055000	I don't know what the case may be, but whatever that was, the messaging wasn't over here.
1055000	1057000	I don't think they really pushed it that hard over here either.
1058000	1069000	I think you're more on to something with the fact that there's more, there's a bigger market for portable gaming in Japan because, you know, everything, you know, people can more walk to a point or they take mass transit.
1069000	1076000	It's not, you know, quite the same culture 100% as it is here from getting from point A to point B for many people.
1076000	1077000	I don't know.
1077000	1084000	Yeah. So, anyway, um, let's see, YYR says in our chat, Japanese developers supported the Vita much, much better.
1084000	1093000	And that's another thing that it kind of comes down to is that, you know, those types of games that we don't see as much of here, like visual novels and, you know, those sorts of things.
1093000	1101000	Those continue to have a strong life on the Vita and, you know, those types of games just don't really have the same market here as they do in Japan.
1101000	1110000	Um, let's see, uh, and YYR says, if you look at the games released in North America for Vita over the last few years, it's Indies and Japanese games.
1110000	1122000	And yeah, that's pretty much all that's been carrying the Vita for a while is those Japanese games do get translated and Indies because, you know what, if I'm not mistaken, Unity had like a Vita output type of feature.
1122000	1133000	So, I mean, it's, you know, as long as the door's been open for Indies to be able to publish their stuff on Vita, of course, they're going to keep doing it because, you know, if I'm an indie developer, I just want to get my game out there just as many places as possible.
1133000	1137000	And so the Vita has always kind of been, I think, an attractive, you know, option.
1137000	1144000	Yeah. So, uh, for sure. Um, let's see, uh, Sia Tabiri pointing out that also the mini disc had a huge life in Japan.
1144000	1151000	So, you know, some things just, I think sometimes not always explainably do better over there than they do over here for whatever reason.
1151000	1157000	Um, let's see, Kaijuto saying the Vita doesn't have an R3 or L3, so the back touch was needed.
1157000	1161000	Uh, that kind of took the place of the clicking, uh, the, the analytics.
1161000	1163000	Well, it doesn't have an R2, yeah.
1163000	1165000	Uh, oh, maybe that's what, yeah.
1165000	1169000	R2, yeah, it's R2, L2. It did have the clicking on the, the controller.
1169000	1173000	And I think you tapped, you tapped the top for one and the bottom for another. Like, I think you...
1173000	1177000	You couldn't push in the, oh, maybe you couldn't push in the LX. I don't know, it's been a long time.
1177000	1181000	I think, I think you tapped the top for two and the bottom for three or something like that. I think that's how it worked.
1181000	1187000	Um, if our, it's been a little bit, obviously, but, uh, if you were doing remote play, you kind of had to do that.
1187000	1193000	That would stand in for some of those buttons that was missing on the, uh, Vita otherwise versus a PlayStation 4.
1193000	1198000	I'm just so surprised that they didn't push the Vita TV or even, like, rebrand the...
1198000	1203000	I mean, honestly, like, the Vita TV, they could have pushed that with...
1203000	1205000	I think that was a huge mistake, too.
1205000	1209000	Like a PlayStation, like a PlayStation Classic, because the PlayStation Classic is like $99.99.
1209000	1215000	Just throw in a fucking DualShock in the PlayStation TV and, like, change up how they store it.
1215000	1222000	I mean, maybe USB storage or something to it and you have a solid device that can not only play PlayStation Classic games,
1222000	1225000	but, oh, hey, look, there's this library of Vita titles.
1225000	1233000	Hugely missed opportunity. They should have just rebranded the Vita TV as a PlayStation Classic, loaded it with 20 pre-done games,
1233000	1238000	and then sold it for $99.99. I think that was a huge missed opportunity.
1238000	1243000	Uh, granted, it could have come a year sooner, because I think the Vita was already on its way out the door
1243000	1245000	at the time PlayStation, the actual PlayStation Classic, got out the door.
1245000	1249000	Speaking of PlayStation Classic, I want to make sure I get this comment from Bobby, who says,
1249000	1253000	as far as the Vita, it was my Suikoden and Final Fantasy PlayStation 1 machine.
1253000	1255000	It made a great PlayStation Classic.
1255000	1263000	So, um, yeah, and it made a great PSP player, too, because you could download things that,
1263000	1268000	as long as you bought it digitally on PSP, you could download it on Vita as well, or, you know, they did sales and things like that.
1268000	1274000	So, like, I remember my Vita had that Final Fantasy IV remake they did on PSP that's great.
1274000	1281000	Like, that version doesn't exist anywhere else but the PSP, because they went the 3D route when they did it for the DS,
1281000	1287000	and then they made that version, the one that they sold on Steam and PC and all the other places, on tablets and stuff.
1287000	1293000	So, like, that 2D remake of Final Fantasy IV, which includes the After Years stuff, too,
1293000	1297000	that's only on PSP and Vita, thanks to the PSP compatibility.
1297000	1299000	So, yeah, what a bummer.
1299000	1300000	Yeah.
1300000	1303000	So, alright, well, you know, just some memories of the Vita.
1303000	1309000	I just, man, you just think if they'd just done a couple other things differently, it might have gone a lot further,
1309000	1313000	and it'll always kind of baffle the mind why they didn't maybe just try to put a little more in it.
1313000	1319000	I don't know if it would have ever outsold the 3DS, but I think, you know, the Vita could have been a bigger brand than it was,
1319000	1325000	and I think that example of the PlayStation Classic piggybacking on existing Vita technology is a great example.
1325000	1331000	Which is why I think with the technology being where it is, I don't think it's impossible for them to come out with another handheld device.
1331000	1335000	I mean, I don't know. They may not do that. They don't want to take risks.
1335000	1341000	YYR in chat says, the other reason PlayStation TV was a failure, where were the streaming apps?
1341000	1343000	No, Netflix was a huge blow.
1343000	1349000	And SSG100Matt, with a very interesting comment that follows that up, they were too busy trying to develop the Vue at the time,
1349000	1352000	and PlayStation Vue does very, very well still.
1352000	1361000	Interesting thought on that is that maybe Sony's desire, because by the nature, Sony is not just a gaming company.
1361000	1368000	We know that, right? Sony is a TV building company. They are a movie-making studio. Sony Pictures, right?
1368000	1378000	Sony does a lot more than games, and maybe sometimes the desire to keep everything Sony, Sony, Sony, maybe works against them in some of these places.
1378000	1386000	Which, that's a very, very fair thought, is that maybe they didn't want to do Netflix or Hulu because Sony was trying to push their own thing,
1386000	1391000	and that it ended up working so well because that's not always what the market wants.
1391000	1395000	Sometimes it works in their favor. Blu-ray worked out for them.
1395000	1401000	Beta versus VHS didn't work out so well for them, right? Because they were the beta team, wasn't Sony the beta team?
1401000	1402000	Yeah, I think so.
1402000	1409000	Yeah, and I think beta was still used in broadcast news for a long time, but that's about, you know, even now, that's all digital, and that beta and VHS are long gone,
1409000	1419000	but that brief period of time when I was interning at a news station, they were using beta tapes for sure, so that's a very niche thing.
1419000	1424000	So, anyway, let's see, a couple other comments in chat, and then we're going to move on to our gaming weeks here.
1424000	1431000	Let's see, Bobby Bockel says, Vita had a YouTube app, but took it offline when YouTube upped the API. Interesting.
1431000	1436000	And YYR says, I feel like it was missing a lot of popular video apps.
1436000	1443000	PodCulture saying, Vita did have a Netflix app. So, and yeah, just maybe it took a little time to come out,
1443000	1449000	but you know what else doesn't have a Netflix app and seems to be doing very well for itself? The Switch.
1449000	1456000	Still no Netflix app on the Switch. It has Hulu, but no Netflix, and still seems to be doing okay.
1456000	1464000	But of course, obviously, you can't really one for one the Switch and the Vita because it's just different stuff.
1464000	1470000	The whole fact that you can take it with you, you know, it's a console and a portable, and just the fact that, you know,
1470000	1481000	Nintendo making the strong, strong first party libraries that you can only play, you know, you can only play Breath of the Wild on a Nintendo product.
1481000	1485000	You know, because technically you can play it on the Wii U, but we know most people playing on the Switch, right?
1485000	1490000	You can only play Mario Kart 8 and Mario Maker and stuff on a Nintendo product.
1490000	1491000	You can't play any of those.
1491000	1492000	Officially.
1492000	1500000	Well, yes, officially, of course. All right. Anyway. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about what we've been doing with our gaming weeks.
1500000	1505000	Maybe we've been playing the Vita or maybe not. Well, how was your gaming week, Loki? What have you been playing this week?
1505000	1511000	I haven't played much of anything, to be honest. I played a little bit of Pokemon Go this week.
1515000	1520000	I haven't really been playing any games this week. I've been trying to get back into programming again.
1520000	1532000	So I was going through, like, one course online just to kind of a code log thing, and then I got bored with it really fast because it was just too basic stuff.
1532000	1538000	I really had to skip ahead on it, and I was like, nah, no, I'm not going to waste my time on this. I'm just going to do something else.
1538000	1542000	So that's what I'm going to do is I'm doing something else. But I was messing with that for a while.
1542000	1556000	And then what else did I play? I played... I downloaded the LEGO Movie 2 game, which is actually very different than the other LEGO games that they have out right now.
1556000	1562000	It's more like open world. It's kind of similar to LEGO Worlds versus any of the other LEGO games.
1562000	1569000	So I haven't gotten a chance to dive into too much of that because my kid's been hogging the Switch.
1569000	1577000	He was playing LEGO Movie 2, and then he got bored with that too. Or got frustrated with it, I should say, and he's been still playing through LEGO Incredibles.
1577000	1584000	So I've been doing that. Haven't played any DDR this week. I've been really bad about that.
1584000	1593000	The problem is at work I've been so busy I've been skipping lunches, and so I'm under my calorie count just without the exercise.
1593000	1603000	And also this week has been crazy with the rain and everything. So I've been under my calories exercise-wise, or without exercise, and then when I come home I end up having to cook or do something.
1603000	1607000	So all my time is gone at that point.
1607000	1612000	So I haven't played any DDR this week, unfortunately, but I've been meaning to get back to it.
1612000	1615000	Eventually it'll happen.
1615000	1625000	Anyone else? I did play a little bit of Crackdown 3. Just still grinding out the last few bits of my skill points I need.
1626000	1633000	And then, yeah, that's pretty much it for right now. I mean, I'm hopefully getting to maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 at some point.
1633000	1636000	Or I'll just completely forget about the game. You know, that may happen too.
1636000	1640000	Don't do that. I mean, you've still got a good, what, 12 years until you do another game.
1640000	1642000	Well, Final Fantasy XV too. I still haven't even-
1642000	1645000	Oh my god, get on that. It's a fun game.
1645000	1647000	Most of that. So I don't know.
1647000	1652000	Anyway, let's see, my gaming week. So I'll kind of follow up your calorie chat and what to do when it's raining and stuff,
1652000	1660000	because I've actually found this week I kind of got sucked into PlayStation VR, which I think you'll be happy with.
1660000	1664000	You know, because I, for whatever reason, just I was kind of waiting for that killer app that I wanted on VR,
1664000	1669000	and now I've been playing more and more Beat Saber on PlayStation VR.
1669000	1674000	I did a little stream on Tuesday where I was playing it, and one thing that I've noticed as I've been playing more Beat Saber
1674000	1681000	is that I'm actually getting exercise, and I'm burning calories, and it's counting on my watch for all the calories burned.
1681000	1687000	My heart rate is getting up. I'm hurting my back like crazy because I'm probably not stretching properly before I play,
1687000	1692000	and I don't know if it's something about the motion of swiping when you play Beat Saber or whatever,
1692000	1699000	but it's been a good workout, so that's been something to do when it's been raining to still get a little bit of exercise.
1700000	1706000	I've been playing more PlayStation VR. Beat Saber specifically, I'm up to, I think I've cleared three expert level songs now,
1706000	1712000	so it's kind of like, wow, I'm progressing in a music game that I have a lot of enthusiasm about.
1712000	1717000	I haven't felt this since, like, back when I played DDR regularly, you know?
1717000	1721000	Well, maybe like Rock Band. I don't know. When I played Rock Band pretty hard, I think I,
1721000	1726000	there's a lot of stuff in those games I really wanted to clear out, but yeah, it's been nice to get up and moving.
1727000	1731000	Another kind of like exercise related game, I actually put like a question on my Twitter.
1731000	1738000	I was like, hey, what other types of like exercise games or what other VR games give you a really good workout,
1738000	1742000	because I'm really loving this idea that like I'm playing, you know, Beat Saber and I'm getting,
1742000	1745000	and don't say just dance, give me like some games I haven't heard of.
1745000	1749000	So somebody on Twitter recommended to me, I play a game called Sprint Vector.
1749000	1754000	So I downloaded that as well, and I've been playing that a little bit, and that one's really interesting too,
1754000	1760000	because you, it's like a racing game, but not with cars. You're like, I guess I would compare it to like skiing.
1760000	1764000	It's kind of like, or like rollerblading is kind of like what you're doing in that game.
1764000	1770000	Like futuristic, but like what you do is you use, like you're holding the controllers
1770000	1774000	and you do this motion like left, right, and like alternating.
1774000	1778000	Like imagine like you're kind of like skiing or something. You're on like a Stairmaster or something
1778000	1781000	where you're going back and forth with the different move controllers.
1781000	1787000	And that's kind of how you control the character, and then which way you look kind of depends on which way you drive.
1787000	1792000	And you can get a really cool, like you can hit both center buttons to like jump,
1792000	1798000	and it's a really kind of cool sensation in VR. And yeah, I've been enjoying that.
1798000	1802000	I ran into a few issues, especially, and you could see this when I was live streaming,
1802000	1806000	a cheap plug for my personal channel, Rob Roberts, when I was doing my personal stream earlier this week.
1807000	1812000	One problem I was running into is like, I thought I was going the wrong direction on the course
1812000	1816000	because all these arrows showed up saying, hey idiot, go this way.
1816000	1820000	And it took me a little bit to figure out what the reason why that error was showing up
1820000	1825000	is because I turned to the right. So I'd started to look this way because I was going this way.
1825000	1830000	But what was happening is that the camera couldn't see the VR headset anymore.
1830000	1833000	So it was saying you need to turn and look at the camera so I can see which way you're going
1833000	1838000	because I should have been using the quick turn buttons to actually do the turn.
1838000	1846000	So my only complaint about Sprint Vector is I don't think that mixing of the real turning with your head
1846000	1851000	and the quick turning, I don't think that works as well as the developers intended.
1851000	1855000	It wasn't as intuitive. And the fact that it took me a long time to figure out
1855000	1860000	why is the game yelling at me like it should have said out of camera range
1860000	1863000	or it should have had some type of error or something, they came up to tell me
1863000	1867000	and I would have figured that out a lot faster. So I feel like that was one place where I was like,
1867000	1871000	ooh, this Sprint Vector could have, maybe the tutorials could have been a little better in the beginning
1871000	1876000	to tell me about that type of stuff. In all fairness, I did not play as far as the intermediate tutorials
1876000	1879000	but I kind of felt like I didn't need to to beat the first couple courses.
1879000	1884000	If I need to go that far in tutorials, then maybe the tutorials are too long
1884000	1888000	and that's something else that should be because the tutorials I did do were kind of,
1888000	1892000	but it takes a little bit to explain. It's like, push the button, then release,
1892000	1896000	and I got it, but obviously I was still having problems.
1896000	1905000	But otherwise, that little complaint aside, I do enjoy the real, I think that idea of how to control it
1905000	1910000	is a great idea for an exercise type game and it feels great to play.
1910000	1916000	I love the sensation of jumping and coasting and there are some levels where you fall down a hole
1916000	1921000	and it's kind of like, whoa, it almost kind of makes you, like, if you're a motion sick type of person,
1921000	1926000	you ain't going to have a good time playing it, but if you're able to stomach it,
1926000	1930000	okay, I think it's a lot of fun, actually. So, again, that's Sprint Vectors.
1930000	1933000	That's another VR game I checked out this week.
1933000	1937000	Other games I've been playing, I've been continuing my adventures in Phantasy Star online.
1937000	1939000	If you, again, have been watching my first channel.
1939000	1940000	The original one?
1940000	1941000	Yeah, the original, Blueburst.
1941000	1942000	Okay.
1942000	1947000	We're playing on a private server that exists out there and it's very, just go to Google, y'all.
1947000	1949000	You'll probably find the same one we're playing on.
1949000	1952000	But, you know, Sega doesn't really care about Blueburst anymore.
1952000	1956000	So is Blueburst the same as, like, the Dreamcast Phantasy Star?
1956000	1957000	Pretty much, it has Episode 4.
1957000	1958000	Oh, okay.
1958000	1959000	And it was the PC one.
1959000	1962000	I thought it was a sequel or something.
1962000	1965000	No, it's, PSO Blueburst is just the PC version of PSO.
1965000	1968000	So, and it was the last version they put out, I think.
1968000	1971000	It was after GameCube, for sure, I know that, and probably Xbox as well.
1972000	1974000	So that's where the private servers are.
1974000	1977000	So my buddy Delvin over at VG Realness.
1977000	1979000	Yeah, I see them, I see the notifications every time we stream.
1979000	1981000	Yeah, well, because it's been a few times.
1981000	1983000	We were streaming last week and then we did a couple nights this week.
1983000	1987000	And that's been fun because he's been like, oh no, you're gonna beat this game.
1987000	1989000	I'm in it, you never beat games, you're beating this.
1989000	1992000	So we've been having a good time just getting through the story.
1992000	1996000	And it's good because, you know, it's not a very complicated game.
1996000	2000000	So it's fun to just sit there and be adventuring together and just talk about other stuff.
2000000	2003000	And that's what usually happens, is that thanks to chat,
2003000	2006000	thanks to other people that will randomly join the stream,
2006000	2009000	like Bobby was with us one night, Shane was on Discord with us one night.
2009000	2011000	And so we would just talk about other random stuff.
2011000	2013000	And I think it makes for great streams.
2013000	2016000	I don't, I don't, hopefully you guys agree.
2016000	2019000	But for those of you that have watched, hopefully you guys have been enjoying those streams.
2019000	2022000	Because it's not even like just about PSO, but just, you know, having fun.
2022000	2024000	Kicking back and playing a game and talking a little smack.
2024000	2028000	So yeah, that's been a big part of my week as well.
2028000	2033000	And then, I'm trying to think, I've still been playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV as well.
2033000	2036000	I had to log in to save my house.
2036000	2039000	Otherwise, I can't think of a lot of like new stuff I've really been playing.
2039000	2042000	I did do the new raid boss in Pokémon GO since you brought that up.
2042000	2043000	I did that.
2043000	2047000	And I was having, I was on a field day in Pokémon GO the other day.
2047000	2051000	What's really funny is that one of my long time Pokémon GO playing friends
2051000	2055000	just got into Ingress finally after all these years and started playing that.
2055000	2061000	And like right at that same time, I was like, I want to play more Pokémon GO and get more gold gym badges.
2061000	2065000	Because I've been ignoring the gym game in that game for so long outside of raids.
2065000	2068000	And like as far as Ingress goes, and I mentioned this on a previous episode.
2068000	2070000	I'm just kind of, I'm really bored.
2070000	2074000	The day-to-day game in Ingress hasn't changed in like four years.
2074000	2076000	Despite the prime client.
2076000	2078000	So I'm kind of like just bored of it.
2078000	2083000	Because, you know, again, how do you defeat that? Which has no life.
2083000	2085000	And that's what it boils down to.
2085000	2087000	But the live events are a lot of fun. So I still do the live events.
2087000	2089000	But that's kind of it for me in that game right now.
2089000	2092000	So anyway, that's pretty much it.
2092000	2094000	That's what I've been playing for my gaming weeks.
2094000	2096000	So I guess we'll move on.
2096000	2097000	Yes.
2097000	2098000	A little bit of housekeeping tonight.
2098000	2102000	DarkSakura, as I mentioned, she's not here tonight because she had a family emergency.
2102000	2105000	And we do hope the best for her and Dan.
2105000	2110000	But please bear with us a little bit because since we did just find that out a couple hours ago.
2110000	2113000	So everything was planned for there to be three hosts tonight.
2113000	2117000	And now there are two. So if things feel a little bit disorganized, sorry about that.
2117000	2120000	But we're trying to fix things on the go.
2120000	2124000	That being said, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2124000	2128000	Also, we would appreciate follows at our Twitch channel.
2128000	2132000	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network is where you can find us on Sunday nights.
2132000	2138000	And we really appreciate, again, those of you that have been given the biddies and the subscriptions as well.
2138000	2140000	To see the video on demand.
2140000	2143000	I've been very, very flattered and thankful to those of you that have been contributing in that forum.
2143000	2145000	Thank you so much.
2145000	2146000	Let's get to some news.
2146000	2149000	Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news.
2149000	2153000	Yes. So apparently there is going to be Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC.
2153000	2156000	Because, you know, they're a company and they have to make a lot of money.
2156000	2159000	And they need to make more money than just selling the game.
2159000	2160000	So how else to do that?
2160000	2162000	Well, you develop DLC for it.
2162000	2167000	So that's going to be a mix of kind of free and paid DLC.
2167000	2171000	I'm not really sure exactly what's going to be available.
2171000	2174000	But they said, you know, they're going to add some free DLC over time.
2174000	2178000	And a paid DLC with several elements in one batch.
2178000	2183000	And this is according to an article in Dengeki Online.
2183000	2190000	Where Tetsuya Nomura was talking about the DLC and whether there's going to be a re-released final mix edition.
2190000	2192000	And how they're going to do that.
2192000	2196000	So I guess we'll wait and see what they add to it.
2196000	2201000	Maybe New Worlds. Maybe more Cup Noodle sponsorship.
2201000	2202000	Who knows?
2202000	2205000	A New World would be quite the undertaking.
2205000	2207000	I would see maybe...
2207000	2211000	A lot of people have been asking where are the Final Fantasy characters in Kingdom Hearts 3.
2211000	2212000	I mean, yes, the Moogles are there.
2212000	2216000	But like, as far as like, you remember in the original Kingdom Hearts games, you had like, you know...
2216000	2217000	Cloud.
2217000	2218000	Cloud was there.
2218000	2221000	And I don't know why they didn't call him Squall.
2221000	2222000	They called him Leon.
2222000	2223000	Aerith was there.
2223000	2225000	And yeah, they changed his name for whatever reason.
2225000	2228000	Which it does play into the Final Fantasy VIII story.
2228000	2230000	But it is weird that we called him Squall there.
2230000	2231000	Anyway.
2231000	2235000	And then Sephiroth. Remember Lance Bass as Sephiroth in the original Kingdom Hearts?
2235000	2237000	That's missing from Kingdom Hearts 3 as well.
2237000	2243000	So you would think it would be a little bit easier maybe for Square to develop on a Final Fantasy themed story.
2243000	2247000	Then maybe having to go back to the table with Disney and negotiate for whatever else.
2247000	2252000	Although I would think if I was Disney and I had a new movie coming out that I really wanted to promote.
2252000	2255000	Maybe I would allow a new world to be made for it.
2255000	2258000	But then again, what's the big Disney movie this winter?
2258000	2260000	It's live action remake world.
2260000	2262000	Oh, there is that.
2262000	2265000	But I was thinking Frozen 2 was the big thing they were pushing this holiday.
2265000	2268000	But we already had Frozen, so I don't know if it really makes sense to do it again.
2268000	2271000	But it's live action remake world where it's the same as the old worlds.
2271000	2273000	It's just done with live actors now.
2273000	2274000	That's right, because we're getting Lion King this year.
2274000	2276000	Is Aladdin this year too?
2276000	2278000	Or is Aladdin next year?
2278000	2279000	Yeah, I think Aladdin's this year.
2279000	2280000	Wow, okay.
2281000	2283000	Isn't there another one too?
2283000	2286000	I know Little Mermaid is something they're talking about.
2286000	2290000	Because didn't they already cast Zendaya for Ariel?
2290000	2292000	Am I crazy on that?
2292000	2293000	Fuck if I remember.
2293000	2294000	I don't know.
2294000	2295000	But anyway, I think that's something.
2295000	2297000	Yeah, but Little Mermaid is probably next year.
2297000	2299000	But yeah, they're revisiting all the 90s.
2299000	2301000	We're running out of ideas.
2301000	2303000	Remake all the...
2303000	2309000	If we're reviving 90s ideas, how about Kingdom Hearts goes to the 90s Lion King game from the Genesis.
2310000	2311000	How about that?
2311000	2318000	How about Kingdom Hearts goes to the 90s Disney Afternoon lineup?
2318000	2320000	Oh, like Gummy Bears and stuff?
2320000	2322000	Gummy Bears, Darkwing Duck.
2322000	2323000	There's the Gummy Ship.
2323000	2324000	Yeah, there you go.
2324000	2327000	Darkwing Duck, DuckTales.
2327000	2329000	Hell, even the new DuckTales is pretty good.
2329000	2332000	Okay, act deft with all the receipts and chat.
2332000	2336000	Aladdin is May, Lion King is July, Dumbo is this month.
2336000	2337000	I knew there was another one.
2337000	2339000	Dumbo is happening too.
2339000	2340000	Yeah.
2340000	2341000	Anyway, let's see.
2341000	2346000	At least that one is like, you know, it's Tim Burton, so it's a little bit different.
2346000	2348000	A Marvel idea, of course.
2348000	2350000	This is Joe 100 Matt says, how long will DLC take though?
2350000	2355000	They will be deep into Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 4 when it finally comes out, but certainly the Marvel.
2355000	2358000	But again, that's all going to be agreements and signing.
2358000	2366000	And does Marvel want to be involved in a Kingdom Hearts world when we know that there is a secret Marvel game project being worked on?
2366000	2370000	Over at Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics, right?
2370000	2372000	Crystal Dynamics, Tomb Raider is doing that game.
2372000	2381000	Yeah, so they're developing that game and you would think, based on the Tomb Raider reboot, that this Marvel game they're doing is probably going to be a more gritty, realistic type of game.
2381000	2383000	That, I mean, we don't know.
2383000	2386000	We're just guessing based on, you know, what Tomb Raider looked like.
2386000	2391000	Would they want to be in Kingdom Hearts at the same time? Maybe not. I don't know.
2392000	2398000	Let's see, Act F pointing out that Scrooge McDuck does appear in Kingdom Hearts 3.
2398000	2401000	That's right, he's the owner of the cafe, right?
2401000	2404000	Where Ratatouille cooks all the dishes.
2404000	2406000	I haven't played the game, so I don't know.
2406000	2408000	You should get on that. Alright.
2408000	2413000	And then see a Tiberian chat that suggests things like Lizzie McGuire and That's So Raven.
2413000	2415000	There you go.
2415000	2422000	I mean, Raven Simonie is only, what, like in her 40s now, so it'd be really funny to see her come back and play that.
2422000	2427000	Or like they could do, you know, I don't know. There's a lot of things that they could do.
2427000	2430000	None of which are good, but you know.
2430000	2432000	We'll see, we'll see.
2432000	2440000	Let's see. Oh, excuse me, Act F is saying at the top of his lungs in chat, Remi, the name of the rat is Remi.
2440000	2444000	Sorry, that's one of the few Pixar movies I actually didn't see.
2444000	2446000	I have not seen Ratatouille as well.
2446000	2449000	I haven't either, it's just the one I missed. So, it happens.
2449000	2451000	That and Brave. I haven't seen that or Brave.
2451000	2455000	But Bobby, in our defense, saying the game does never name him, he's just the chef.
2455000	2457000	They never give him a name, he's just the chef.
2457000	2459000	I thought that was the case.
2459000	2462000	That they just give him a very vague name. Anyway.
2462000	2464000	Alright, let's move on to some more news.
2465000	2471000	Some big announcements this week out of Nintendo as they have unveiled Pokémon Generation 8.
2471000	2482000	Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield is the new Pokémon 8th generation of games as they announced in a very brief 7 minute Nintendo Direct this week.
2482000	2491000	Not Pokémon Gun, as some magazines in other countries have picked up and run with what the Twitterverse has done.
2491000	2497000	Or there was a whole lot of parodies that were shown on our VOG Network Discord at vognetwork.com.
2497000	2499000	Somebody posted a compilation.
2499000	2500000	Journalism, what's that?
2500000	2503000	I know, right? My favorite that I saw on Facebook was Pokémon Chonkala.
2503000	2505000	Where the, uh, you know.
2505000	2508000	I saw Pokémon Trebuchet.
2508000	2510000	Okay. Right, or Catapult.
2510000	2515000	Pokémon Aero I saw as well, which would kind of fit in with the Sword and Shield theme.
2515000	2522000	But anyway, we got to see a little glimpse at the world, which appears to be a little more like, I think they're saying Scottish.
2522000	2528000	Some are saying, kind of somewhere in there. Something like an old, Old Kingdom sort of look there.
2528000	2531000	Um, to the games. I thought they looked really nice.
2531000	2537000	But I did notice what a lot of y'all noticed, where the random encounter Pokémon seem to be back.
2537000	2542000	Where you don't see them on the overworld like you would in the Go games.
2542000	2548000	You still are back to random encounters. So some people kind of dissecting what could that all mean and all this.
2548000	2555000	Of course, there's seven minutes of Pokémon Direct, which leads to the two hour discussion of the seven minute direct.
2555000	2562000	Not that, I mean, we're a three hour weekly podcast on games, so I really have no reason, no room whatsoever to talk smack.
2562000	2568000	But it is interesting how much dissection you can find on these, uh, little trailers.
2568000	2574000	So anyway, and of course, there were brand new Pokémon unveiled, the starter Pokémon.
2574000	2579000	Which is customary when they unveil a Pokémon generation, they say, and these are the three new Pokémon.
2579000	2583000	These are the Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle.
2583000	2588000	It's always the same three types too. It's always a water plant and fire.
2588000	2594000	It is, I think that's part of the tradition, but when they evolve, they usually get a second typing.
2594000	2601000	Like Blaziken was a fire fighting type. So, and the reason why I bring that up specifically is a lot of people are wondering.
2601000	2607000	Is this new fire type that we have in this game, uh, Scorbunny, who's a little bunny that's a fire bunny.
2607000	2611000	Is he a fire fighting type as well? And I don't, we don't know.
2611000	2613000	Because we haven't seen what the evolutions look like.
2613000	2619000	That hasn't stopped very creative artists out there from coming up with their own ideas on what the evolutions could look like.
2619000	2625000	But we really won't know until Nintendo unveils all of that in a later Direct.
2625000	2630000	Maybe at E3, but the Pokémon games really have always tended to do their own thing on their own timetable.
2630000	2635000	They don't follow any type of normal announcement standard with the rest of Nintendo.
2635000	2639000	So, you know what? They will show the evolutions and all that when they're damn good and ready.
2639000	2645000	But the other starters, a shout out for Grookey, which is the little grass monkey.
2645000	2651000	Which is adorable. Did you see the Photoshop where somebody put a gun in his hand? That made me laugh.
2651000	2653000	The internet does funny things sometimes.
2653000	2661000	And, um, let's see, Sobble. If I'm saying that right. Sobble? Sobble? Sobble? Sobble. One of the two.
2661000	2668000	A water type lizard Pokémon who hides himself in water and there's a lot of folks talking about, uh,
2668000	2676000	it's the depression Pokémon and a lot of DATME over on Twitter and looking at that Pokémon, which I'm sure.
2676000	2686000	Is there a typing of the three that you prefer, Loki? Is there one of these that is jumping out at you as one that you want to pick?
2686000	2688000	No. I don't want any of them.
2688000	2690000	Are you not going to pick up Pokémon Gen 8?
2690000	2694000	No, I will. I don't know none of them. Probably the fire bunny.
2694000	2697000	Uh, I would say, I'm on Team Grass Monkey.
2697000	2699000	Grass Monkey. That funky monkey.
2699000	2705000	Yes, but it depends on what the evolutions look like. That's going to really sway me one way or the other, I think.
2705000	2717000	I really want to know what the evolutions look like because if they're ridiculous, um, like, you know, I was not the biggest fan of, um, this guy's final evolution in the last series of games.
2718000	2726000	So if it looks like that again, uh, then, you know, I might pick something else. Obviously I went for Litten last gen because I'm going to pick Firecat, of course.
2726000	2731000	But, we'll see. We'll see what the, uh, maybe they'll come out with more plushies.
2731000	2736000	Oh, what? Them merchandise? Never!
2736000	2738000	My kids have the socks, by the way.
2738000	2745000	Um, s2100matt says, that Beastie Boys reference flew over Rob's head. No, it didn't. I've just heard it 5,000 times this week.
2745000	2752000	Bobby Blackwell says, for the podcast audience, who is that guy? Oh, I'm sorry. This is Popplio. I'm sorry. Thank you.
2752000	2763000	Sorry, podcasters. I was doing a visual there. Popplio is the, um, Pokemon I was holding up there and then Litten was the one I was saying, oh, this is the, this is the one that I, uh, uh, ended up choosing at the end of the day.
2763000	2767000	Though the, um, Rowlet is super cute too. So, um, let's see.
2767000	2777000	Siya Tiberian Chat says, you just need to start buying Pokemon Loafs. Don't I have enough Pokemon shit in this house? Like, you can already see it. This isn't even everything. I have other stuff too that's not, uh, displayed on the Twitch stream.
2777000	2779000	I see several Pokemon already.
2779000	2781000	Yeah, right? So, uh, it's enough.
2781000	2791000	Uh, Tyre Colin Chat says, you think he'll show up in the movie? Of course, there'll be 500 Pokemon movies. There's a Pokemon movie every year and the new starters will show up in the movie as well at some point.
2791000	2793000	Of course, of course there will be.
2793000	2810000	Alright, anyway, uh, that's the early stuff on Pokemon Sword and Shield and, uh, I'm, I'm happy they moved to Switch. I know there's some people that are, like, feeling kind of negative about the graphics and the changes and stuff, but I don't, I think it's way too early to make a snap judgment on the game.
2810000	2825000	Like, there's gonna be plenty more directs over the coming months that show us more and more details. Pokemon games are always full of things to do. In fact, one of my criticisms about Pokemon, I sometimes get overwhelmed with that there is too much shit to do.
2825000	2835000	And I'm left feeling, like, I don't know what to do because, because there's Pokemon Fashion Show as, like, a side thing that you're supposed to do and it's, like, I don't, I don't have time for this or, or growing the trees and all this stuff.
2835000	2844000	Which apparently you don't have to do any of that stuff, but I, I feel like, I don't, I just can't not do it when it's there. It's too much to do. Anyway.
2844000	2851000	So we'll see. We'll see, uh, what they announce more for Pokemon in the coming directs, uh, in the coming months.
2852000	2854000	In the meantime, uh, Loki, you got this next one, right?
2854000	2870000	Yes. So PUBG is getting a parental lock on the game, basically, that requires, uh, children under the age of 13 to unlock it, uh, with the help of their parents. Of course, this is not in all regions.
2870000	2880000	This is mainly just in, uh, it's being piloted for Chinese versions of the game. Um, they're actually doing this with, uh, PUBG Mobile and Honor of the Kings.
2880000	2894000	And so with this, they have, I guess, a way for your parents to basically go and sign in, uh, with, like, a parental code or something like that to unlock the game so that, you know, give your children permission to be able to play it.
2894000	2901000	Because, you know, games are horrible and will cause your children to become stupid.
2901000	2908000	Well, I think this is more like when the kid, and maybe your kids aren't quite at that age yet, but they're going to be there pretty soon.
2908000	2918000	When the kid takes the tablet to bed with them and they're up all night playing games on the tablet. I know this is a struggle I've heard from other parents that have kids of a certain age.
2918000	2927000	It's like they take their phone to bed with them and they're up all night on the fucking phone. So there should be a way to, like, shut down the game so they can't do that stuff after a certain hour.
2927000	2942000	Yeah, and along with that, you know, it's basically saying that the new controls, um, it limits whether they can be played online, um, they have rules to reduce screen time, um, different ways to kind of curb that stuff, so.
2942000	2950000	You know what doesn't have, uh, parental locks? Books. So you could take a book to bed and read it.
2950000	2955000	That's just an actual lock. Just put it in a safe. Can't read it through the safe.
2955000	2963000	But yeah, um, interesting that they're rolling this out in China, although I think there's laws and governance in China that have come into play with why they've chosen to do it there first.
2963000	2979000	Um, but I think one interesting thing, if they do end up rolling out a feature like this in America, which wouldn't be a big deal. I mean, many of the folks listening to this show and watching the show on Twitch, you're not using these types of lock features and stuff like that because you want to play all the games you want.
2979000	2991000	If you want to stay up all night playing Fortnite on your phone, then you're an adult and you've earned it. But so many of you probably just don't use parental locks, but things like the Switch and stuff have parental locks that are very similar.
2992000	3014000	Um, it's just a matter of, do the parents know how to use them? Because I don't know, you know, I come from a certain generation as do probably many of y'all were like, my parents didn't know how to use those locks or use the setting on the TV that would prevent me from watching Cinemax after 9pm. If you know what I mean, right? Like our parents didn't know how to use those locks.
3014000	3026000	Well, right. And I don't think for me, like I know how to use that stuff, but I don't think it's necessary because I just, you know, they don't have the game system with them and we can tell when they have screens on.
3026000	3039000	So it's just, it's not needed, I guess. But I mean, if, if you're letting them have the device in the room and keep it, you know, and it is an issue, then I guess you could do the parental locks if you need to.
3039000	3050000	Or I just do what I do. And since my, you know, internet is all based on Mac address filtering, I just take them out of the filter and then they can't connect to the internet. Oh, darn. That breaks everything.
3050000	3061000	Okay. That's a good thought. Uh, let's see. And some comments in chat. I love this VG realness and chat says, Oh my God, take their fucking phones away. LOL. Sorry to be an old man, but we didn't have that in our day.
3061000	3071000	So back in my day, we didn't have Fortnite on phones. So I don't know why kids under 13 are going to bed with a phone, let alone having one. And Bobby Blackwell says, isn't it past your bedtime?
3071000	3084000	Well, if 1980 cinema supposed to teach me anything and I didn't have this when I was growing up, but back then children had their walkie talkies that they would talk to each other with.
3085000	3096000	You know, back in, you know, we did back in my day, you're ready for all the crazy shit we got into as kids. Okay. You know what we did back in my day? We left the house after bedtime.
3096000	3108000	That's what we did. Like when it was like, you know, or can I, I'm going to bed, you know, you go to bed and then you'd hear when your parents go to bed. And then it's like, you know, your friend and you had agreed that you were going to meet at like 11 o'clock somewhere.
3108000	3118000	So you snuck out of the damn house and you went and met, met up and got into the trouble the kids got into, uh, at that age. And then went and played with your phones out there.
3120000	3128000	We didn't have phones then we had, uh, we had, um, I don't know, TPing people's houses or whatever we did back in the day. We had vandalism.
3129000	3141000	This is so much better than, you know, staying up late and sometimes it wasn't necessarily that you were doing anything at all, except the thing that your parents didn't want you to do. Right.
3141000	3151000	Whatever you do, no vandalism. Now that you're in bed, don't worry mother. I will not do vandalism in bed.
3151000	3159000	Little does she know I am going to sneak out and do all of the vandalism. Bobby and Chad says we did actual illegal shit.
3160000	3166000	We burn things. Kids today that do completely legal things. What a bunch of lame-os.
3166000	3179000	Oh God. Um, SSG100Matt says every damn kid had a beeper in middle school. I didn't have a fucking beeper in middle school. Why did kids, I don't know, forget it.
3179000	3188000	Anyway, we're getting into old man stuff. Let's move on and talk about, speaking of old man stuff, here's this new fangled game.
3188000	3198000	Who's calling you in the middle of school day? Like on the pay phone, you know, they call you like, hey, give me a call. That doesn't make any sense.
3198000	3206000	I only knew how to call with 1-800-COLLECT. Anyway, next story, Loki.
3206000	3219000	Anyways, so Anthem is apparently working on their loot system, which some consider broken because it's frustrating with the balance of what they drop towards the end game stuff.
3219000	3229000	So some of the fixes that they're going to be doing include common and uncommon equipment are no longer going to be dropped during end game activities.
3229000	3237000	Which apparently is, you know, having an issue with, people are having an issue before where they're just ending up with all of a sudden they keep grinding at it.
3237000	3247000	The resources needed to craft certain masterwork items from blueprints will be reduced from 25 masterwork embers to 15. Wow, that's 10 less.
3247000	3254000	And none of this makes any goddamn sense to me because I don't play this game. And then they said many inscriptions.
3254000	3256000	The grinding has been reduced.
3256000	3262000	But the details. The audience needs the details of this game that they're probably not playing.
3262000	3271000	Yeah, so they're making it less grindy so people aren't pissed off so that people will drop more money on their game and they'll make more money because they're EA and that's what they want to do.
3271000	3278000	Because remember, if you support EA and buying all those microtransactions, then BioWare gets to live another day.
3278000	3297000	So yeah. Other fun stuff about Anthem is, unfortunately with the whole loot stuff, not only is that an issue, but overall it hasn't done that great.
3297000	3305000	In fact, Anthem's physical sales are half of that of Mass Effect Andromeda, which I think was not even that great compared to...
3305000	3306000	In Europe, I believe.
3306000	3307000	In Europe.
3307000	3309000	But this is a snapshot though.
3309000	3314000	Is the pendulum really going to swing that hard in America versus Europe?
3314000	3320000	Yeah, and it's physical sales. Granted, digital sales are up, so there's that.
3320000	3322000	But are they up that much in two years since Andromeda?
3322000	3333000	No, and I want to say they were looking at also, they're saying that Anthem sold roughly a quarter of Destiny 2's week one physical sales as well from back in September of 2017.
3333000	3345000	They were also comparing the physical sales were both lower from Kingdom Hearts 3 and Resident Evil 2, which are recent games as well, so you can kind of compare the physical sales of that.
3345000	3351000	So... I don't know. It's not off to a good start.
3351000	3355000	We'll see when the numbers come out. I mean, EA is going to have to...
3355000	3357000	They're not going to share the numbers if the numbers are bad.
3357000	3364000	They have to answer to their investors, so we're either going to see some numbers or we're going to see some real interesting wordsmithing happening.
3364000	3366000	We'll see some numbers of people being laid off.
3366000	3372000	Let's hope not. I would be very sad about that. I don't want to see BioWare go under, but...
3372000	3377000	And I don't want to turn into the dog pile on Anthem Show, because I know some people are having fun playing it.
3377000	3379000	Questbuster in chat says,
3388000	3395000	And I know most people I know that are playing the game are saying the combat is really fun, but it does sound like there's just, you know...
3395000	3402000	Again, I can't help but get the sense, yet again, it's a game that wasn't fully baked before it came out of the oven.
3402000	3408000	And unfortunately, this is a reoccurring theme with a lot of EA things, except for somehow Apex Legends.
3408000	3414000	But in some ways, Apex Legends isn't exactly a fully-fledged game either.
3414000	3420000	There's only, like, eight characters in Apex Legends. It's not that many characters for a game in 2019, right?
3420000	3421000	Right.
3421000	3423000	For that game, it does not seem to matter.
3423000	3425000	You know? And I'm not hating on Apex Legends.
3425000	3426000	What did Overwatch start with?
3426000	3427000	It's fun.
3427000	3431000	Overwatch just got its 30th hero this week, I think.
3431000	3433000	So they probably had, like, 16 at least.
3433000	3438000	No, it was more than that. It was probably 24, I want to say.
3438000	3445000	We had what? We had Ana, Sombra, Orisa, Brigitte, Moira, and now Baptiste.
3445000	3449000	I think 24, unless I'm missing somebody that came out. I think it's 24.
3449000	3451000	So...
3451000	3457000	And YYR points out if EA does have to do layoffs, which, again, we hope they don't, because there's been plenty of layoff news already,
3457000	3462000	they'll have to share those numbers. They kind of have a legal obligation to their shareholders and everything with that.
3463000	3467000	Questbuster says, the combat is great. I just wish it was wrapped in a better game.
3467000	3471000	S2100matt says, I just started playing Apex Legends yesterday. It's really cool.
3471000	3475000	Although I feel bad for the people I'm teamed up with each game because I'm still learning it.
3475000	3479000	YYR says, Overwatch had 21 heroes when the game launched.
3479000	3482000	So I completely left out three people in what I was counting right there.
3482000	3484000	But that happens. I don't have everything.
3484000	3488000	Oh yeah, I left out. I did leave out because I forgot Doomfist was one of them as well.
3488000	3491000	So yeah, there's some I forgot. Sorry!
3491000	3497000	So anyway, but yes, I know Batista's Hero 30 because I was just talking about it earlier today.
3497000	3499000	So there you go.
3499000	3501000	Anyway, let's move on.
3501000	3508000	Let's talk about some news regarding Final Fantasy XII and some of the changes that you're going to see with Final Fantasy XII,
3508000	3512000	the Zodiac Age, when it comes out on the Switch and on the Xbox One.
3512000	3518000	Because, you know, the game already came out on PlayStation 4 and PC a little while ago.
3518000	3523000	So for those people that are thinking about double dipping, especially when it comes to the Switch and the portability,
3523000	3528000	what's kind of new? What are they bringing to the table that hasn't been done before?
3528000	3534000	There's going to be a license reset function. This is needed. I'm very happy to hear this.
3534000	3539000	You can talk to Mont Blanc, the clan's interior leader in Rabanastre.
3539000	3546000	You can reset and change your party member's jobs, allowing you to customize the jobs of the party that you want.
3546000	3554000	So if you feel like you screwed up in building your characters, you don't have to start all over or reload in old state. You can reset.
3554000	3561000	I think that alone is a badly, like, in saying it out loud, I'm like, God, this was needed.
3561000	3565000	I'm surprised this wasn't here before. So a reset will be very nice.
3565000	3568000	Also additional, more than one Gambit set. This is pretty cool.
3568000	3577000	Gambits are how you kind of program the AI, because you control one character, but the other two kind of do things based on a logic system known as Gambits.
3577000	3582000	But you're kind of locked into whatever you design. If you want to change it, you need to go in there and change it.
3582000	3589000	Well, now there's going to be extra Gambit sets. So you can do three unique sets to kind of switch between sets for different situations.
3589000	3597000	That's a great idea, because maybe you don't want your other party members using big spells unless it's a boss.
3597000	3600000	You know, things like that. So that's really smart. That's going to be neat.
3600000	3609000	And then they're also talking about an improved New Game Plus, where you'll be able to have party members at level 90 and carry over items like weapons, magic, and gil.
3609000	3615000	And then specific on the Xbox One X version, 60 frames a second. You'll be able to play at that.
3615000	3616000	Nice.
3616000	3618000	Yeah, very cool. I thought you could do that on PC version.
3618000	3621000	You should be able to. It's a PC.
3621000	3626000	I think that's a new console feature, but still a pretty cool one at that.
3626000	3633000	Let's see. This would be if I were to buy Final Fantasy 12 on Switch, which I'm going to admit, Loki, I'm thinking about it.
3633000	3642000	It would be my fourth time buying Final Fantasy 12 because I had the original, I bought it on PS4, I bought it on PC during a sale.
3642000	3650000	So this would be the fourth time. But now I can have it portable and I can reset characters and kind of, I don't know.
3650000	3652000	I don't know, Loki. What do you think?
3652000	3653000	You should do it.
3653000	3655000	Do you even own it one time?
3655000	3656000	Nope.
3656000	3662000	All right. I'm going to chat over at twitch.tv slash Evaga Network.
3662000	3664000	Some love in the chat.
3664000	3674000	Oh, VG Realness says Doomfist, Ash, the cowgirl, and Hamster Hammond were the heroes I forgot.
3674000	3676000	Thank you. Wow, that was a fun game.
3677000	3679000	Who is Rob too old to remember?
3679000	3681000	Let's see.
3681000	3683000	Also in chat.
3683000	3686000	darktoothy says last time I tried to beat 12, it did not go well.
3686000	3688000	Probably going to skip the Switch one.
3688000	3689000	Oh, well.
3689000	3691000	Bobby Blackwolf says I liked it.
3691000	3692000	Oh, that's about Final Fantasy 9.
3692000	3697000	They're on a tangent on Final Fantasy 9 because that also came out on Switch very recently.
3697000	3699000	So some folks in chat are talking about that as well.
3699000	3703000	ActDeftInChat says Rob, you're saying that like you haven't done it before.
3703000	3708000	That's the whole joke. I'm notorious for buying a game multiple times.
3708000	3711000	Again, let's recall, how many times did I buy Mass Effect 3?
3711000	3721000	It was the PC, the Xbox trilogy, the PlayStation trilogy, and the Wii U.
3721000	3723000	So I bought that game four times.
3723000	3725000	And that wasn't even a remaster.
3725000	3727000	That was just the original Mass Effect.
3727000	3729000	If they do a remaster, I'll buy it again, for sure.
3729000	3731000	Anyway.
3731000	3733000	Enough about me. Stop trying to do an intervention.
3733000	3735000	Let's go to a new story. Loki.
3735000	3739000	Yes, so this is kind of an interesting bit of trivia,
3739000	3743000	but apparently one of the producers on the new Toejam and Earl game,
3743000	3745000	which actually just got released, I think.
3745000	3747000	Oh yeah, I forgot they were bringing that back. That's cute.
3747000	3752000	Yeah, I know we mentioned that last week during releases,
3752000	3756000	but Macaulay Culkin, yes, of Home Alone fame,
3756000	3758000	and now he's doing a lot more stuff,
3758000	3761000	but apparently he is quite the retro game nerd,
3761000	3765000	and he is one of the executive producers on the game,
3765000	3768000	because he was a huge fan of the original game,
3768000	3771000	mentions that he used to play competitive,
3771000	3774000	or he turned it into a competitive game with his friends,
3774000	3776000	because he used to troll each other in the game,
3776000	3779000	and they even made a drinking game out of it.
3779000	3783000	But apparently, you know, he met with the developers,
3784000	3788000	and has he actually done real work on this game,
3788000	3792000	or is it more like a ceremonial type of title,
3792000	3795000	where it's like, we're just going to call you a producer
3795000	3798000	to get that little celebrity, to have stories like this
3798000	3802000	around the internet that get the knowledge of our game out there.
3802000	3804000	Did he actually do stuff on the game?
3805000	3808000	You know, basically, he...
3811000	3812000	Gave feedback.
3812000	3813000	He gave feedback, yeah.
3813000	3817000	So he met with the developers in their office,
3817000	3818000	and he got to play the game.
3818000	3821000	He had the beta for a few days, he got to play that.
3821000	3824000	He said he beat it, and he talked about some of the glitches
3824000	3827000	that him and his friends had discovered in the original game,
3827000	3831000	and they said including a move that granted players infinite rocket skates,
3831000	3836000	and in return, they showed him some concept art and stuff like that.
3836000	3842000	So I don't think he actually contributed anything to the game, per se.
3842000	3843000	Besides his feedback.
3843000	3846000	Yeah, it was more of just kind of a fun thing to do.
3846000	3849000	SG100Matt says, the ToeJam in our old game looks good.
3849000	3851000	Yeah, I hear it's actually getting pretty good reviews
3851000	3853000	as far as retro revival type things go.
3853000	3856000	I think it's doing pretty well for itself, so that's pretty exciting.
3856000	3859000	SG100Matt says, executive producer in title implies
3859000	3861000	that he helped fund it in some way.
3861000	3862000	Maybe he did.
3862000	3864000	Well, maybe. Maybe. We don't know.
3864000	3866000	I mean, they don't. Who knows?
3866000	3867000	Let's see.
3867000	3869000	Dartitsuya says, never got into ToeJam in our old,
3869000	3873000	but I have the Genesis collection on Switch, so maybe I'll check it out.
3873000	3875000	And Questbuster says, definitely one of the weirdest games
3875000	3877000	I've played on the Genesis.
3877000	3880000	Well, ToeJam in our old was kind of like a roguelike on the Genesis, wasn't it?
3880000	3883000	So for that to be coming back is, you know, it's timely.
3883000	3886000	So I guess he started off helping out the campaign
3886000	3892000	with his social media following to, you know, help promote the game,
3892000	3895000	is one of the things, too, that kind of got his attention.
3895000	3898000	So he helped fund it by promoting it, I guess.
3898000	3901000	So it's kind of like what Kylie Jenner did for Fyre Festival,
3901000	3903000	is what Macaulay Cokin did.
3903000	3905000	Except this actually came out.
3905000	3906000	It is actually pretty decent.
3906000	3907000	It's actually decent.
3907000	3909000	I did that for Bobby, who mentioned in chat that he watched
3909000	3912000	the Fyre documentary this weekend on Netflix, which I still haven't seen.
3912000	3914000	Yeah, I haven't watched it either.
3914000	3916000	My wife watched it without me, which I was disappointed.
3916000	3917000	But have you in the way?
3917000	3921000	I don't mean to tangent here, but a cheap plug for if you're not aware,
3921000	3925000	my one of my spinoff shows, Shaking and Crying with Aria Snark is back.
3925000	3928000	We were on hiatus for a little bit, but it's back.
3928000	3930000	There's been three new episodes since we came back.
3930000	3933000	And one of the hot topics has come up there that's worth asking about here
3933000	3936000	is the documentary Abducted in Plain Sight.
3936000	3938000	I did not watch it. My wife watched it.
3938000	3940000	You really need to see Abducted in Plain Sight.
3940000	3941000	She explained the whole thing to me.
3941000	3943000	It sounded ridiculous.
3943000	3947000	I watched part of the last episode, but I wasn't really into it.
3947000	3951000	I'm sure it would be funny from the beginning, but...
3951000	3953000	It's not really funny, actually.
3953000	3954000	It's kind of disturbing.
3954000	3956000	Funny as in, like, just...
3956000	3958000	Shock and horror, yes.
3958000	3959000	The hell?
3959000	3960000	Yeah, the hell, exactly.
3960000	3962000	Alright, anyway.
3962000	3964000	VeeGee Realness saying, oh my god, you guys need to watch it,
3964000	3966000	is insane. I will at some point.
3966000	3969000	Maybe that's what I'll watch before the next episode. We'll see.
3969000	3972000	Anyway, let's move on to another one of your favorite topics,
3972000	3974000	Loki Mods and Skyrim.
3974000	3975000	Yes, Skyrim.
3975000	3979000	And this is also kind of tying a little bit in with Fallout 76, I guess.
3979000	3982000	So, there's a mod that's been worked on for a while now
3982000	3984000	called Skyrim Together.
3984000	3987000	That's basically a co-op mod for Skyrim.
3987000	3993000	They'll allow you to play Skyrim up to, I think, it was like four to eight people.
3993000	3997000	So, but there's a little bit of drama going on behind the scenes
3997000	4000000	because apparently the people that put together the team
4000000	4002000	behind the Skyrim Script Extender
4002000	4006000	have been claiming that the Skyrim Together people
4006000	4010000	are stealing their code for this project.
4010000	4012000	And so, because of that, you know,
4012000	4016000	they've even written in a code license for Skyrim Script Extender.
4016000	4019000	Due to continued intentional copyright infringement
4019000	4021000	and total disrespect for moderate etiquette,
4021000	4024000	the Skyrim Online team is explicitly disallowed
4024000	4027000	from using any of these files for any purpose.
4030000	4033000	You know, and this project's getting, you know,
4033000	4036000	they've got, you know, $33,000 a month
4036000	4040000	from their Patreon backers to help fund this project.
4040000	4042000	That's a lot of money.
4042000	4043000	And basically...
4043000	4044000	A fan project.
4044000	4049000	Yeah, and so, you know, in response, I guess,
4049000	4052000	there was a Skyrim Together team member
4052000	4055000	that posted a comment in Reddit talking about, you know,
4055000	4057000	the Skyrim Script Extender drama and says,
4057000	4060000	We've had disagreements with the SKSE folks in the past,
4060000	4062000	and I've tried to communicate with them,
4062000	4065000	but they've never replied, so we stopped using their code.
4065000	4069000	There may be some leftover code from them that was overlooked.
4069000	4073000	When we removed it, it isn't as simple as deleting a folder.
4073000	4076000	Mainly our fault is because we rushed some parts of the code.
4076000	4078000	Anyways, we're gonna make sure to remove
4078000	4081000	what might have slipped through the cracks for our next patch.
4081000	4084000	And to be clear, you know, things they said,
4084000	4088000	you know, of course, the SKSE members replied, you know.
4088000	4090000	So to be clear, you started using our code,
4090000	4092000	asked for permission, never got permission,
4092000	4094000	continued using it, eventually removed part of it,
4094000	4096000	yet somehow left some of it in there,
4096000	4098000	continued the charge for access the entire time,
4098000	4103000	promised to totally clean up a now licensed tainted project.
4103000	4104000	Okay?
4104000	4108000	So there's still drama is basically what's coming out of the end of the day.
4108000	4111000	My TLDR is, I don't give a shit what's going on behind these things,
4111000	4113000	I just want to play this mod,
4113000	4115000	whatever you got to do to get this shit finished,
4115000	4116000	I don't care whose code you're in.
4116000	4118000	And how much money are you contributing?
4118000	4119000	I'm contributing zero.
4119000	4122000	And that's exactly how much money I'm going to contribute to this.
4122000	4125000	But I still want to play it.
4125000	4127000	So can we make that happen?
4127000	4128000	I want something for free.
4128000	4129000	Exactly.
4129000	4130000	Alright.
4132000	4135000	Well, I hope they can work all their dramas out
4135000	4136000	for the betterness of the player base.
4136000	4139000	I mean, can't both sides to some extent admit,
4139000	4141000	but we didn't make Skyrim.
4143000	4145000	We wouldn't have had to put so much goddamn code into it
4145000	4147000	if it wasn't so fucking buggy anyways.
4148000	4149000	Bethesda.
4150000	4151000	Alright.
4151000	4154000	Something that I actually logged into Fortnite today
4154000	4155000	to take a look at this,
4155000	4157000	because the band Weezer,
4157000	4159000	you know Weezer, right?
4159000	4160000	Yes.
4160000	4161000	Say it ain't so.
4161000	4162000	Alright, yeah.
4162000	4166000	Weezer made a new island in Fortnite to promote their new album.
4166000	4169000	So the new album that just came out is the Black Album,
4169000	4171000	although I think more people are talking about,
4171000	4173000	was it the Teal Album or something?
4173000	4174000	That has their cover.
4174000	4175000	It's like an All Covers album.
4175000	4178000	It has their cover of Africa, which has been on the radio.
4178000	4179000	No Scrubs is on it.
4179000	4182000	So I think more people are talking about the Teal Album.
4182000	4183000	They're talking about the Black Album.
4183000	4186000	But anyway, maybe this is why they need to go to Fortnite.
4186000	4188000	So you can go to Weezer World,
4188000	4190000	but it's in creative mode.
4190000	4192000	And I think a lot of people,
4192000	4193000	when they're reading these headlines
4193000	4195000	and making their snap judgments on these,
4195000	4196000	they're thinking,
4196000	4198000	oh, you do battle in Weezer World now.
4198000	4202000	No, it's this expansion, you may not be aware,
4202000	4204000	but Fortnite doesn't just have the one versus 100 mode
4204000	4207000	and some of the other, you know, the team modes and things,
4207000	4208000	but you can actually have a creative mode.
4208000	4211000	So they kind of tried to do a Minecraft-esque type of mode in the game.
4211000	4214000	Yeah, they also have a PvE mode too now.
4214000	4215000	It's like battle...
4215000	4217000	Well, you know what's funny?
4217000	4219000	That was always supposed to be Fortnite.
4219000	4220000	Right, yeah.
4220000	4221000	That was supposed to be the fucking game.
4221000	4222000	No, I know that.
4222000	4223000	Yeah.
4223000	4226000	I remember when it was before the battle.
4226000	4228000	Battle Royale was just like the afterthought type of thing.
4228000	4232000	So anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
4232000	4235000	there's a part of me that wants to check out Fortnite creative mode,
4235000	4237000	but that would require me playing Fortnite.
4237000	4238000	It's free.
4238000	4239000	I did.
4239000	4242000	I checked it out and you can just go in there and mess around.
4242000	4244000	And I took a look at the Weezer World.
4244000	4248000	And yeah, so it actually plays songs from the album.
4248000	4252000	That's the one reason I didn't do it as a clip here.
4252000	4255000	I actually went into it intending to record a clip for this.
4255000	4256000	And then I realized,
4256000	4259000	oh, that's a bad idea because it has all this Weezer music here.
4259000	4260000	And that's going to be copyright.
4260000	4261000	Strip the audio out.
4261000	4262000	Strip the audio out.
4262000	4263000	So sorry.
4263000	4265000	That's why I did not do B-roll for that tonight.
4265000	4267000	So you'll just have to look at it yourself, I suppose.
4267000	4269000	Or there's plenty of YouTubes and things like that.
4269000	4271000	Maybe other people on Twitch that are streaming it as well.
4271000	4275000	But that's, I mean, it's a very clever marketing idea,
4275000	4280000	I suppose, to team up with this mega popular video game
4280000	4282000	to kind of get your album out there.
4283000	4285000	I mean, I'm sure there's lots of artists
4285000	4287000	that would love to get more promotion like this.
4287000	4290000	But, you know, Weezer is of a certain level.
4290000	4293000	So it's a very interesting combination there.
4293000	4296000	So anyway, it is part of the Season 8 update.
4296000	4297000	So you do want to make sure you're updated
4297000	4299000	to the latest version of Fortnite,
4299000	4302000	which has a bunch of new creative maps.
4302000	4305000	Weezer's just one of many new maps that are in there,
4305000	4307000	which is also, yeah, I noticed when I went in there,
4307000	4309000	I was like, oh, Weezer World's like this first one of like,
4309000	4311000	there's like seven of different worlds up here on the platform.
4311000	4312000	That you can go visit.
4312000	4316000	So, yeah, kind of one way that Fortnite is trying to expand itself a little bit
4316000	4320000	is to tap into a little bit more of the Minecraft-esque side of things.
4320000	4322000	Very interesting.
4322000	4324000	Vidpower573 in chat says,
4324000	4329000	Weezer World sounds like a place Cheech and Chong would go to...
4329000	4332000	Bobby Blackwolf also continues and says,
4332000	4333000	yes, but I can be snobbish and say,
4333000	4335000	I've never played Fortnite,
4335000	4338000	just like how I can say I've never played WoW.
4338000	4343000	I like to at least try everything once, especially, you know,
4343000	4348000	because I do know that a ton of people are playing Fortnite.
4348000	4352000	I've even tried playing League of Legends, even though I'm not very good.
4352000	4354000	That's why I went into Apex Legends as well,
4354000	4358000	because these are all very big ranking games on Twitch,
4358000	4360000	and I know lots of games that people are talking about.
4360000	4362000	So, I want to at least have a base understanding
4362000	4365000	of what these games are all about, even if I fully admit,
4365000	4368000	but I don't really have time to sink all the hours into it myself,
4368000	4371000	because I'd rather be playing XYZ,
4371000	4373000	which I think is also perfectly acceptable.
4373000	4375000	I would say maybe the one place where I failed to do this is
4375000	4378000	I haven't played a Madden game in a very long time.
4378000	4380000	I have before, but it's been a very long time.
4380000	4383000	I'm not going to drop 60 bucks to try out Madden.
4383000	4386000	Apex, Fortnite, League of Legends, those are all free games.
4386000	4388000	So, they're very easy to jump in there and try.
4388000	4390000	You know, very, very minimal stuff,
4390000	4394000	but I'm not going to drop 60 bucks on a game just to try it for that sake.
4394000	4395000	So, anyway.
4398000	4399000	Let's move on.
4399000	4403000	I think we're going to go and now visit the classic game of the week.
4403000	4406000	So, we're going to take a trip into the gaming vault
4406000	4407000	and find a game that we think,
4407000	4410000	hey, you guys should be checking out the game this week.
4410000	4412000	Dark Soccer, obviously not here tonight.
4412000	4413000	She had picked a game.
4413000	4415000	We're going to roll that over to a future week.
4415000	4419000	So, I hastily got some footage together for a substitute game for tonight,
4419000	4421000	which is one that I fondly remember,
4421000	4423000	and we're going to talk about tonight.
4423000	4426000	We are going to talk about the game Super Adventure Island,
4426000	4427000	is what we're going to talk about tonight,
4427000	4429000	and I think, yes, we have some footage of this game.
4429000	4431000	So, this is the classic game of the week, Super Adventure Island,
4431000	4434000	which, of course, was for the Super Nintendo.
4434000	4440000	So, Super Adventure Island was released on the Super Nintendo,
4440000	4443000	and part of the reason that I remember this game
4443000	4447000	and love this game so much was that the music is amazing.
4447000	4449000	I don't know how well you can hear it in the background there,
4449000	4452000	but it was done by Yuzo Koshiro,
4452000	4454000	and it's one of his final soundtracks that he did, yeah.
4454000	4457000	This game was released in Japan in January of 92,
4457000	4460000	and it was released in North America in April of 92.
4460000	4465000	In Japan, it was called Master Takahashi's Great Adventure Island.
4465000	4470000	It also was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2011,
4470000	4473000	and it was the starter of a Super Adventure Island series
4473000	4476000	because there was a Super Adventure Island 2 that came out later.
4476000	4481000	There were three of the regular Adventure Island games on the regular NES.
4481000	4484000	There was also a mobile phone game called Super Adventure Island,
4484000	4489000	but it is not the same game, so it is not what I'm talking about here tonight.
4489000	4493000	So, the plot of the game is that you are trying to find Tina,
4493000	4497000	even though they mistranslated, I guess, the name to Genie Jungle
4497000	4498000	in English materials.
4498000	4500000	That's kind of interesting that the name completely changed
4500000	4503000	based on translation issues.
4503000	4508000	So, it's kind of your very typical 90s save the princess
4508000	4510000	from disaster type of games.
4510000	4515000	That whole, you know, I think we've seen this many times before.
4515000	4520000	But anyway, an evil sorcerer plans to turn Tina into a stone statue for eternity,
4520000	4522000	and you're not going to let that happen.
4522000	4526000	You're going to venture through five stages, four areas in each stage
4526000	4530000	for a total of 20 levels to make sure that doesn't happen.
4530000	4535000	In the first three areas, you go through like an obstacle course,
4535000	4538000	which is what's happening in the video that we're seeing right now.
4538000	4541000	And then the final area is a boss battle,
4541000	4544000	which we should see one of those coming up here in a little bit.
4544000	4548000	Obviously, some of the differences between this Adventure Island
4548000	4551000	and the Adventure Island on the NES that made it very different
4551000	4553000	was much improved visuals.
4553000	4557000	I mean, this game looks phenomenal, especially considering it's kind of early on
4557000	4558000	in the Super Nintendo's life.
4558000	4563000	Like, the sound especially, and again, I call that out,
4563000	4567000	the sound is so good, and it's not just Yuzo Koshiro.
4567000	4568000	I mean, that's a huge part of it.
4568000	4570000	But just like the sampling and kind of what they did
4570000	4573000	with the Super Nintendo's built-in hardware is really great,
4573000	4576000	and it's really something you should check out.
4576000	4579000	So in the game, much like before, you can use an axe,
4579000	4582000	but you also get fireballs as you upgrade your weapon.
4582000	4583000	You also get a boomerang.
4583000	4586000	So you can either throw an axe that moves in like an arc-type pattern,
4586000	4588000	or you can throw a boomerang.
4588000	4591000	And you're trying to collect fruit that fills up a life bar
4591000	4594000	that slowly counts down as you move through the level.
4594000	4596000	You can think of it kind of like a built-in timer.
4596000	4599000	And the fruit helps restore on that timer.
4599000	4600000	There is a score in the game as well.
4600000	4602000	So as you grab fruit, kill enemies and things like that,
4602000	4604000	you increase your score.
4604000	4607000	So if you want to play for score, that is something you can do as well.
4607000	4611000	So yeah, that's a little bit about Super Adventure Island.
4611000	4615000	I guess it is also one of the games that is featured in a manga
4615000	4621000	that was called Cyber Boy that came out between 1991 and 1993.
4621000	4624000	So I think we're just about to get into one of the boss battles
4624000	4627000	here on the video that we're looking at on our Twitch stream.
4627000	4628000	Yeah, so you can kind of see.
4628000	4631000	And again, another thing that really set this game apart,
4631000	4634000	being that it's on the Super Nintendo hardware versus the Nintendo hardware,
4634000	4636000	is that these bosses are gigantic.
4636000	4640000	They were pretty big on the Nintendo version, taking up multiple sprites.
4640000	4642000	But these bosses were definitely bigger.
4642000	4644000	You had these transparent ghost things,
4644000	4647000	and the head and the hand kind of are all moving separately.
4647000	4650000	It's pretty intricate and pretty awesome.
4650000	4653000	And as far as me, one place that I remember this game
4653000	4656000	is I remember this was one of the very first Super Nintendo games
4656000	4658000	that I rented, right?
4658000	4661000	Because you could actually rent stuff in the video store.
4661000	4663000	And I have fond memories of renting this game.
4663000	4667000	And again, a lot of it was just kind of after the first time I rented it,
4667000	4670000	I remember renting it again because I wanted to hear the soundtrack
4670000	4671000	because it was so awesome.
4671000	4674000	So years later, when I put together like, oh, it was Yuzuru Koshiro
4674000	4675000	that did this.
4675000	4678000	And of course, Yuzuru Koshiro did what, like Streets of Rage.
4678000	4681000	He did a lot of the Midnight Maximum Tune racing games.
4681000	4683000	You know, he's a great composer.
4683000	4685000	So, I mean, I just I'm a big fan of his work.
4685000	4689000	So I'm not surprised at all that a game like Super Adventure Island
4689000	4692000	was something that kind of caught my eye and ears
4692000	4694000	because he was a part of that.
4694000	4695000	So there it is.
4695000	4696000	Did you ever play this game?
4696000	4697000	Yeah, I did.
4697000	4698000	Yeah. What'd you think?
4698000	4699000	It was all right. I liked it.
4699000	4700000	Yeah. It was a fun game.
4700000	4705000	So, I mean, the game itself, you know, it's not Mario World
4705000	4708000	or some of the must have Super Nintendo games of its time.
4708000	4710000	But I think it's fun enough.
4710000	4711000	It still holds up.
4711000	4712000	Yeah, it still holds up.
4712000	4713000	And it looks really good.
4713000	4715000	You know, it's still, as far as like graphics and stuff like that,
4715000	4717000	it really holds up after all this time.
4717000	4718000	So there it is, your classic game of the week,
4718000	4721000	Super Adventure Island for the Super Nintendo.
4721000	4725000	And I'm looking in our chat over at twitch.tv slash fog network.
4725000	4727000	Dark Tetsuya points out, I know he did the soundtrack
4727000	4729000	to Dungeons and Dragons, Eye of the Beholder,
4729000	4730000	the Sega CD version.
4730000	4733000	Fantaz points out Skateboard Boy.
4733000	4736000	Oh, yes, there are those parts of the game where he gets on a skateboard
4736000	4738000	and he's kind of like automatically moving.
4738000	4740000	And in those parts, your life isn't draining.
4740000	4743000	So that's part of like the trade off is that if you kind of move
4743000	4745000	into a constant state of motion, you don't get the penalty
4745000	4748000	of your life slowly draining away.
4748000	4751000	VidPower573 in chat says, I wish they would revisit
4751000	4755000	the Adventure Island series, whoever owns the IP.
4755000	4759000	Well, I know the developer of this game, let's see, was Hudson Soft.
4759000	4760000	Wasn't it Hudson?
4760000	4761000	That's Konami.
4761000	4762000	Konami.
4762000	4764000	So there will not be any more Adventure Island games,
4764000	4766000	but there might be a pachinko machine in the near future.
4766000	4768000	You can always scratch your fingers.
4768000	4770000	OK, obviously, I'm being a little bit silly, but well,
4770000	4771000	fruit and slaughter machines.
4771000	4772000	Yeah, right.
4772000	4773000	Or am I?
4773000	4774000	All right.
4774000	4776000	Anyhow, we're going to go to our next story,
4776000	4778000	which was something that I actually taped a little segment
4778000	4781000	about earlier today.
4781000	4786000	OK, so also in the news this week, Overwatch unveiled their 30th hero
4786000	4788000	that they're planning on adding to the game.
4788000	4790000	So as you can see in the background here, we're taking a look
4790000	4793000	at Overwatch and this is Batiste, who is the brand new hero
4793000	4795000	that they're adding to Overwatch.
4795000	4797000	So the way I'm able to actually look at Batiste right now,
4797000	4800000	you may not know this depending on what platform you play Overwatch on,
4800000	4803000	but on the PC, there's this version of the game called
4803000	4805000	the Public Test Region, where you can actually log in
4805000	4808000	and take a look at new characters as they're being developed.
4808000	4811000	This is probably a good way for the Overwatch development team
4811000	4815000	to actually see, you know, how are they performing in a game,
4815000	4817000	you know, are they too strong, are they overpowered,
4817000	4819000	do they need to be rebalanced, and that sort of thing.
4819000	4821000	And that's the kind of thing you can really only tell probably
4821000	4822000	from doing live play.
4822000	4824000	They can do all the stuff they want in the office,
4824000	4827000	but this is, you know, really a good way to figure it out.
4827000	4829000	But it's neat because it actually gives the rest of us
4829000	4831000	kind of a way to get a sneak peek at the hero
4831000	4833000	and see everything that they're doing.
4833000	4836000	This is not something that you can actually do on the PlayStation 4
4836000	4839000	or the Xbox One version of the games, at least not today,
4839000	4842000	not to say that it'll never ever be the case moving forward,
4842000	4844000	but we'll see in the future.
4844000	4846000	So anyways, you can actually, you know, see they have them
4846000	4849000	in the hero gallery and you can kind of get a little closer look at them,
4849000	4853000	except they don't actually have everything here in the test region yet,
4853000	4855000	they just have some of the basic things, like you can see, you know,
4855000	4860000	some heroic type emotes here for when they win matches and stuff.
4860000	4863000	You can also, let's see, the little highlight intros,
4863000	4865000	which are, you know, always kind of fun to watch,
4865000	4866000	but these are the very basic things.
4866000	4869000	They're not going to show you, give you a real sneak peek at the advanced stuff,
4869000	4874000	like what kind of skins might Batiste kind of have extra for, you know,
4874000	4877000	in matches and winning match poses and things like that.
4877000	4880000	They're not going to really add that until probably, you know,
4880000	4882000	about another week or two when they get a little closer
4882000	4885000	to actually putting him in the full game.
4885000	4886000	So let's actually take a look.
4886000	4890000	We can actually go into a training match,
4890000	4894000	which is a good way to kind of get a taste of the character for the first time.
4894000	4898000	I know I use this practice range a lot to try to just get the feel
4898000	4900000	for characters I'm not very familiar with.
4900000	4903000	CLC Batiste is over here with the support classes,
4903000	4906000	and he can actually go into the match,
4906000	4909000	and you can actually kind of get to use him a little bit here.
4909000	4912000	You can see that he has a gun there, a very loud gun,
4912000	4914000	that I can shoot these little training bots with.
4914000	4916000	That's one thing to do with it.
4916000	4919000	So his left click, and I'm going to be speaking in PC terms
4919000	4922000	just because that's the way I'm used to playing the game,
4922000	4924000	although I'm sure, you know, it's very easy to figure out what this would map to
4924000	4927000	if you're a PS4 or you're an Xbox One person.
4927000	4931000	But the left click is going to be that button that attacks other robots,
4931000	4935000	but the right click is actually this kind of like, it's like a bomb type of thing.
4935000	4938000	It kind of reminds me of like maybe what Junkrat would use with his weapon,
4938000	4940000	but it's actually like a heal bomb.
4940000	4943000	So when you use that, it's actually like heal bombing these friendly bots,
4943000	4947000	so you can see those little tiny graphs are actually increasing their health a little bit.
4947000	4949000	And then of course, when I run out of heal bombs,
4949000	4953000	or if I run out of the little regular ammunition to attack guys with,
4953000	4956000	he's actually going to go into his reload animation,
4956000	4960000	which he can also trigger at any time by hitting the reload button or pressing R.
4960000	4965000	Now, some of the real fun stuff would be some of the other abilities that he has access to.
4965000	4968000	So I'm going to wait for these little bots that died to come back.
4968000	4971000	But I will mention that you can always at any time see the abilities.
4971000	4974000	I think it's, is it F1 or F12?
4974000	4976000	I can't remember what it is on PC all of a sudden.
4976000	4979000	Oh yeah, you hold down F1, and you can actually see what some of the different abilities are,
4979000	4981000	and it kind of gives you a little recap.
4981000	4984000	Oh, these are going to do, you know, if you hit shift, it's going to do this.
4984000	4988000	And again, I'm pretty sure PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have similar features as well.
4988000	4992000	So you'll notice the shift key, which is kind of like, I guess his first ability,
4992000	4995000	is like a regenerative sort of aura.
4995000	5001000	So if I hit that button, you'll notice the bots suddenly start to increase health very slowly,
5001000	5003000	and it lasts for a few seconds.
5003000	5007000	So it was able to absorb some of the hits that were coming in from the bots,
5007000	5008000	and you can see it kind of heals.
5008000	5010000	And I'll do it one more time here.
5010000	5013000	If they don't die, you can really get a sense of how much they heal.
5013000	5015000	You can also see he kind of threw out a little bit of an aura there,
5015000	5017000	so you can get a sense for the range.
5017000	5020000	I notice it doesn't draw on the ground what the range looks like.
5020000	5024000	Like, say, if you were playing Lucio, and you can actually really see the range of heals and so forth,
5024000	5028000	it would actually show there, but it doesn't show with that.
5028000	5031000	Now, some of the other abilities that he has,
5031000	5035000	this E key is actually going to do an ability that they call the immortality field,
5035000	5039000	and it's actually going to prevent these bots altogether from dying.
5039000	5042000	So, oops, I did that too soon.
5042000	5044000	I thought I had a chance to place it.
5044000	5046000	That's part of the reason why you do the test realm,
5046000	5049000	because you get to know your different abilities there.
5049000	5051000	So he actually just threw it.
5051000	5053000	I thought I would actually get to place it first.
5053000	5055000	So now I've got to wait for that ability to recharge,
5055000	5057000	which will only be a couple more seconds here.
5057000	5061000	So you see a little cool down there, which will give those guys time to...
5061000	5064000	So this bot on the right here is getting very close to death.
5064000	5070000	So when he gets very close to death, what I'm going to do is throw down that immortality field.
5070000	5072000	Okay, so now watch.
5072000	5076000	Next time he gets shot, his health is not going to drop past a certain point,
5076000	5078000	because that immortality field is up,
5078000	5081000	so it'll give me a chance to heal him up, do whatever I need to do,
5081000	5084000	once that field is down, because obviously it's not going to last forever.
5084000	5087000	Immortality is kind of a very powerful ability.
5087000	5092000	But it'll give me a chance to drop that field, heal up, do what I need to do,
5092000	5094000	especially if there's another support character.
5094000	5100000	If there's a Mercy or something, you could really use that immortality field to heal somebody up to full,
5100000	5106000	so that it'll take a long time to get them killed again.
5106000	5113000	Alright, so that's just about all the abilities, except he does have a jumping kind of ability.
5113000	5120000	If you use this control, he can kind of hold down control, and it actually lets him fly up.
5120000	5124000	So he can't really fly, but it's kind of neat that he has this high jump ability
5124000	5128000	that you can kind of charge with control, and then you can kind of get up to these higher platforms
5128000	5130000	that most characters wouldn't be able to do.
5130000	5132000	So that's just kind of a neat little extra thing.
5132000	5134000	High jump boots, if you will.
5134000	5139000	And then of course, lastly, is his ultimate ability, which is kind of a little different.
5139000	5142000	I like it. It's something you're really going to have to pair with other abilities.
5142000	5145000	But the Q ability for his ultimate is the amplification matrix.
5145000	5150000	So that's going to do a matrix, and it's going to double damage, but also healing effects,
5150000	5153000	depending on what's passing through the matrix where.
5153000	5158000	So for example, if I put the matrix down, and this is the one you actually get to place.
5158000	5159000	This is how I got confused earlier.
5159000	5163000	But let me show you. I'm going to kill this bot on the left.
5163000	5168000	And you can see, it took about three hits to do him in.
5168000	5173000	But with this field, look at that. It just took one.
5173000	5179000	And if I go to the other side and do my heals, look how much healing he got as that passes through that field.
5179000	5182000	And you'll notice it doesn't last long at all.
5182000	5184000	So that's going to be interesting to see how that works,
5184000	5187000	because you're really going to have to take coordination to make the most out of that thing.
5187000	5191000	Just imagine a Bastion turret on the other side of it or something like that
5191000	5197000	that's going to really shred the heck out of the other team if it's timed right.
5197000	5201000	So it'll be interesting to see if Batiste has a place in the competitive mode.
5201000	5204000	It's something you're going to see in the Overwatch League.
5204000	5207000	Not all heroes seem to get equal representation in the Overwatch League,
5207000	5211000	so I know it's something the developers are probably working a little bit on balancing.
5211000	5215000	But I know it's just a matter of time before Batiste makes it to the game.
5215000	5220000	I know I love to play support characters. I like to play Mercy, Lucio.
5220000	5225000	Not so good with Ana, because I'm not a very good sniper, but I do like to play support characters.
5225000	5230000	And I also like playing Junkrat as DPS, so just this heal bomb thing.
5230000	5232000	This is going to be awesome and a lot of fun to play.
5232000	5237000	So I'm definitely looking forward to Batiste hitting live realms very soon.
5237000	5242000	So there you go, a little sneak peek at Batiste, the 30th hero coming to Overwatch,
5242000	5244000	announced by the team this week.
5244000	5246000	And now we'll go back to the show live in the studio.
5249000	5253000	All right, we are back here live in the studio with episode number 766 of our show,
5253000	5257000	already in progress for tonight, March 3rd of 2019.
5257000	5259000	I can't believe it is already March.
5259000	5260000	Yep.
5260000	5265000	Wow. I don't know how much of that clip you saw there of the Batiste in Overwatch.
5265000	5267000	You don't really play Overwatch at all, do you?
5267000	5269000	No, I have it, but I don't play it.
5269000	5271000	It's yet another one of those games you just have.
5271000	5276000	My co-worker, he peer pressured me into buying it.
5276000	5280000	And then I played it a little bit and I was like,
5280000	5286000	I can't really dedicate a ton of time to this, so I'm not going to play it anymore.
5286000	5288000	It's one of those things I play obviously very casually.
5288000	5290000	I never get into the competitive stuff.
5290000	5293000	I know season 15 just started in Overwatch,
5293000	5296000	so there's a lot of people really getting into the competitive stuff right now
5296000	5298000	and talking about placement matches and stuff.
5298000	5300000	That's never really been my thing in Overwatch,
5300000	5302000	but at least in a while I enjoy a casual match, especially with friends.
5302000	5305000	Again, that's another one of those games that's kind of fun to stream with friends
5305000	5307000	or just get online and play multiplayer with friends.
5307000	5310000	But it is a bummer that things are so split up,
5310000	5312000	like I have some friends on PC,
5312000	5314000	but I have other friends that only play on PlayStation 4,
5314000	5316000	and then yet others that play on Xbox.
5316000	5323000	I really understand why Blizzard didn't want to pull that all together,
5323000	5327000	especially when it comes to mouse and keyboard versus controller,
5327000	5329000	because the games are actually tuned separately because of that.
5329000	5331000	But did they have PlayStation and Xbox, though?
5331000	5333000	Do they have cross-play with those?
5333000	5335000	No, not yet.
5335000	5337000	Maybe it won't be that way forever, but that'll be up to them.
5337000	5339000	But anyway, I'm excited about the new hero.
5339000	5341000	I think he's got a lot of very interesting moves
5341000	5343000	and looks like somebody that I could actually enjoy playing,
5343000	5347000	although I'm sure for the first couple weeks that he's out,
5347000	5349000	everybody is going to be playing,
5349000	5351000	because that's always what happens with the new heroes,
5351000	5353000	that everybody picks them.
5353000	5355000	And you can only pick a hero one time in a match
5355000	5357000	unless you're doing that special mode, the no-limits mode in the arcade.
5357000	5359000	Then you can pick as many as you want.
5359000	5361000	But for the most part, you can only do the one.
5361000	5363000	So anyway, let's move on with some rapid-fire news
5363000	5366000	and talk about some other things happening around our industry
5366000	5368000	a little quicker tonight.
5368000	5370000	Let's talk a little bit about what we're going to be getting
5370000	5373000	for our free games for the month of March.
5373000	5377000	So starting off on the Xbox side of the house,
5377000	5383000	we've got Adventure Time Pirates of the Enchiridin.
5383000	5385000	I don't know how you pronounce that,
5385000	5388000	but that's going to be coming out for the month of March.
5388000	5394000	And then for the second half of March through the middle of April,
5394000	5396000	we have Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2.
5396000	5400000	And then for the first half of March for the Xbox 360
5400000	5403000	backwards compatible games, Star Wars Republic Commando.
5403000	5407000	And then for the second half, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
5407000	5410000	So that's pretty nice, four games there.
5410000	5413000	On the PlayStation side of the house,
5413000	5417000	this is the first month that they're not giving away games
5417000	5421000	for other systems aside from PlayStation 4.
5421000	5424000	Well, when you just killed one of them.
5424000	5426000	So the only games you get this month,
5426000	5428000	you get Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered,
5428000	5431000	which is pretty great, and The Witness.
5431000	5434000	Ooh, that's one of those games I never got around to playing
5434000	5436000	that everybody's like, you need to play The Witness,
5436000	5438000	and I just never did, so that's cool.
5438000	5442000	So those will be available starting March 8th.
5442000	5447000	So, cool. I mean, I still, though, as a contrast,
5447000	5451000	I understand that Call of Duty, that's a pretty decent game.
5451000	5457000	But in contrast to just reading four games on the Xbox platform
5457000	5466000	versus the two, you know, it doesn't skew it in their favor, I should say.
5466000	5469000	Okay, fair enough. Let's travel over to some news about Evo.
5469000	5470000	Hey, hey, hold on.
5470000	5471000	Oh, do you have one more?
5471000	5473000	We got one more thing to talk about,
5473000	5480000	and very important news regarding a very popular adventure game franchise,
5480000	5482000	the Leisure Suit Larry franchise.
5482000	5485000	So we have Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams, Don't Dry.
5485000	5490000	That's rated now for the PlayStation 4 and the Switch,
5490000	5492000	and should be coming out at some point,
5492000	5496000	but we don't know much about it aside from the fact that, you know.
5496000	5497000	And new people are doing this now.
5497000	5499000	I think there's new people involved in making this.
5499000	5502000	I don't think it's the developers that did that last game that didn't do so well.
5502000	5503000	No, it's not.
5503000	5506000	And based on the screenshot, it looks pretty decent.
5506000	5510000	It kind of has a 90's Sierra aesthetic look to it.
5510000	5511000	I'm into it.
5511000	5512000	I'll check it out.
5512000	5513000	I even played the shitty ones.
5513000	5515000	I mean, it's fine.
5515000	5520000	Well, Magna Cum Laude, that was the one that was not great, right?
5520000	5522000	Wasn't that the name of it?
5522000	5526000	There was one that had a funny dialogue system that you were talking to women
5526000	5528000	in your little sperm and you had to dodge stuff,
5528000	5532000	and that was funny, but the game was not good.
5532000	5536000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out, I'm pretty sure Al Lowe still isn't involved.
5536000	5541000	It's probably a safe bet that this, you know, it's now just about the IP
5541000	5543000	and trying to sell games just based on the strength of the name,
5543000	5547000	Leisure Suit Larry, and what that means about the type of raunchy humor
5547000	5548000	you're going to get in a game.
5548000	5551000	It means absolutely nothing to the people that were probably, you know,
5551000	5553000	buying the games nowadays.
5553000	5556000	Anyway, now I'll talk about Evo 2019.
5556000	5560000	The official lineup for Evo has been announced,
5560000	5562000	and the games that will be a part of it,
5562000	5567000	including Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Dragon Fighters, Dragon Fighter Z,
5567000	5571000	if you will, Street Fighter V, Tekken 7, Mortal Kombat 11,
5571000	5574000	Soul Calibur VI, Samurai Showdown.
5574000	5576000	Did you know that they're making a new Samurai Showdown?
5576000	5577000	No.
5577000	5578000	This is not the old school Neo Jewel.
5578000	5580000	I mean, it is still, it's like that series,
5580000	5581000	but now they're doing like a new one.
5581000	5582000	So, yeah, it looks pretty good.
5582000	5585000	There was some other news that I don't think many of our show wrote tonight,
5585000	5586000	but, yeah, I'll mention it now.
5586000	5588000	There's a new Samurai Showdown coming.
5588000	5591000	It looked kind of neat, so that's going to be a part of it.
5591000	5595000	But it's not what's a part of the lineup that people are talking about.
5595000	5598000	It's what's not a part of the lineup, because guess what got bumped this year?
5598000	5600000	Melee.
5600000	5603000	So, Super Smash Brothers Melee is no longer in the top nine,
5603000	5606000	the main games that are in contention there.
5606000	5609000	And there's many people that are saying, finally,
5609000	5612000	but, you know, there's other people that are like, but, but, but, you know.
5612000	5615000	But I kind of think now that you have Smash Brothers Ultimate,
5615000	5619000	I'm not hearing a lot of, like, it's bad or I don't like Ultimate.
5619000	5624000	Like, I do feel like most people accept Ultimate as kind of like the definitive edition,
5624000	5626000	because it does have every character.
5626000	5629000	And, sure, there's always going to be people that want their retro throwbacks.
5629000	5630000	Right.
5630000	5631000	Yeah, there's always going to, I understand, I respect that,
5631000	5633000	but, you know, as far as, you know.
5633000	5635000	That's why you don't see like Street Fighter II on there.
5635000	5637000	I mean, you have five.
5637000	5638000	It's true.
5638000	5640000	So, anyway, it is the year 2019.
5640000	5645000	So, this is the first time Melee will not be featured since 2012,
5645000	5651000	because there was another, I think it did take a hiatus at another point,
5651000	5655000	not long after the game came out before the competitive scene kind of built itself back up.
5655000	5656000	So, there you go.
5656000	5658000	It is not happening there.
5658000	5660000	Let's see.
5660000	5661000	Some folks in chat.
5661000	5664000	YYR says, still, Melee was fun to watch.
5664000	5666000	Act F says, finally.
5666000	5672000	Bobby Blackwolf says, the people that still like Melee is because they found glitches that were never intended,
5672000	5676000	and that's why they own everyone else in Melee, and Ultimate doesn't have said glitches.
5676000	5683000	Well, I mean, it's not like the Melee community suddenly can't exist simply because they're not in EVO.
5683000	5686000	I bet somebody is streaming that game on Twitch right now, and go for it.
5686000	5691000	And there's still going to be tournaments, and it will be part of, it's just not going to be on the EVO stage this year.
5691000	5694000	So, that doesn't mean the game, you know what else isn't on the stage?
5694000	5696000	Dance Dance Revolution.
5696000	5700000	But I still know people to this day that don't shut up about that game, and that is just fine, too.
5700000	5704000	So, it's not going to kill the community just because it isn't there.
5704000	5709000	Unfortunately, this story is not loading for me, but I think I know the gist of what this was about.
5709000	5712000	There's a Sega Mega Drive Mini that's happening.
5712000	5714000	So, they're doing another one of those mini consoles.
5714000	5716000	This is for the Mega Drive, and they want you to vote.
5716000	5717000	What do you want?
5717000	5723000	Which Sonic the Hedgehog, which Puyo Puyo, or which Shining Force title do you want to make sure is in this?
5723000	5730000	And I would think the correct answer would be all of them, but for some reason Sega is looking at limiting this.
5730000	5731000	I don't know why they want to do that.
5731000	5735000	Because those ROM file sizes are so huge!
5735000	5739000	We can only fit so much onto one console.
5739000	5740000	Fucking dumb.
5740000	5742000	I know, I know. Anything, I saw you got the story.
5742000	5744000	Is there anything important that I missed in that?
5744000	5747000	No, it's just basically they have three poles right now.
5747000	5749000	Sonic the Hedgehog, or Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
5749000	5750000	Puyo Puyo.
5750000	5751000	It's this or that.
5751000	5754000	Yeah, Puyo Puyo, or Puyo Puyo Sue.
5754000	5759000	And then they have Shining Force Legacy of the Great Intention, or Shining Force 2.
5759000	5764000	Porque no los dos, if I can call up a famous gif that's out there.
5764000	5767000	Why not both, as for all those questions.
5767000	5768000	Alright, anyway.
5769000	5776000	If you have not picked up Final Fantasy Dissidia, or Dissidia Final Fantasy NT if you will.
5776000	5781000	A free version of the game is coming out for Playstation 4 and PC on March 12th.
5781000	5784000	But of course since it's free, you can't play everybody.
5784000	5788000	You will only get a rotating weekly roster of heroes and villains.
5788000	5791000	But of course, you can purchase characters if you'd like.
5791000	5794000	And you can buy more weapons a la carte as well.
5794000	5800000	If you are already playing the game, this should be breathing new life into the multiplayer section of the game.
5800000	5802000	And giving this game a second chance.
5802000	5805000	Because I'm not sure, I don't know where the financials are at for this game.
5805000	5812000	But I gotta admit, I played the demo that they put out and I had to file it in the I don't get it category.
5812000	5819000	Like sorry, maybe if you're a Dissidia fan out there, put together one of those seven things that explains the game to me.
5819000	5821000	The original Dissidia, I was kinda like that too.
5821000	5828000	I was like okay, so I slide around on these things sometimes and then I hit people and stuff is happening and I'm not really sure.
5828000	5832000	But granted, the original Dissidia was back on the Playstation portals.
5832000	5834000	So, I don't know.
5834000	5837000	I think it was the PSP or was it the Vita? Jesus, I don't even remember.
5837000	5839000	The original was the PSP.
5839000	5840000	Okay, so it was the PSP.
5840000	5844000	So we actually had it as a classic game not that long ago actually, funny enough.
5845000	5847000	But you know what?
5847000	5851000	Despite all sales shade aside, what a great new way.
5851000	5853000	I mean the game has been out for a little bit now.
5853000	5854000	It's been out for several months.
5854000	5858000	So I think all the people that were gonna buy it at face value have probably done it at this point.
5858000	5863000	So what a good way to breathe like a second life into the game by doing a free version.
5863000	5864000	And you know what?
5864000	5866000	Maybe now I can give it another shot.
5866000	5869000	Maybe something didn't click for me in the demo, but it will in the full game.
5870000	5875000	But at the price of free, I could go in and take that risk and check it out.
5875000	5876000	So, we'll see.
5876000	5880000	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5880000	5882000	Some other things that are coming out this week.
5882000	5883000	Loki.
5883000	5888000	Well, this week we've got a game, Alien League, that's out on PC.
5888000	5893000	Dead or Alive 6 coming out on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.
5893000	5894000	Actually, I'm sorry, this is the first.
5894000	5895000	That would have already come out.
5895000	5898000	Okay, let's do this week.
5898000	5899000	Not much, actually.
5899000	5902000	Left Alive on PC and Playstation 4.
5902000	5907000	Devil May Cry 5 coming out on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.
5907000	5912000	And then Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn on the 3DS.
5913000	5916000	Alright, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases over there.
5916000	5918000	Not a lot, a lot of stuff.
5918000	5920000	We have just a couple games on the Playstation 4.
5920000	5923000	Flowers, Les Quatre Cezanne.
5923000	5926000	I think it's got a French name, but it's a Japanese release.
5926000	5931000	That game is out this week on March the 7th, but I think the big game is Devil May Cry 5,
5931000	5932000	which is the same day.
5932000	5938000	It's a worldwide release, so it's the same day we're getting it in the US as well as, spoiler alert, sorry, Europe.
5939000	5941000	So that's the big one on the Playstation 4 this week.
5941000	5945000	Playstation Vita's obviously starting to slow down a little bit, but it's not dead yet.
5945000	5949000	They've got a release on March 14th, but I guess I'll get to that next week.
5949000	5953000	Quickly checking the Nintendo Switch to see if they've got anything big coming out there.
5954000	5956000	No, it's a slow week.
5956000	5961000	I mean, Devil May Cry 5 is obviously the big release and kind of taking the attention,
5961000	5963000	but not a very competitive week in Japan this week.
5963000	5964000	That's it.
5964000	5965000	How about Europe?
5965000	5969000	Europe, you have a few games coming out, so starting off with Left Alive.
5969000	5971000	That's going to be out on Playstation 4.
5971000	5975000	The Occupation on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
5975000	5979000	Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn on 3DS.
5979000	5982000	And Devil May Cry 5 on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
5982000	5983000	That's it.
5984000	5988000	Any titles in the next week or anytime soon that you're looking at picking up, Loki?
5988000	5990000	Do you have your backlog of things you won't play?
5992000	5995000	Actually, I was thinking about maybe picking up Trials,
5995000	5998000	because they had a new Trials game that came out this week.
5999000	6003000	But I'm not sure if I'm going to play that right away.
6003000	6007000	I actually went back and was looking at playing the last Trials game,
6007000	6008000	because I still have that.
6009000	6011000	I don't remember what they called it.
6011000	6013000	They had that spin-off Trials game.
6013000	6017000	Well, they had Trials of the Blood Dragon that I checked out.
6017000	6021000	It was kind of lame, but it was just okay.
6021000	6025000	And then they had the Trials, and they had the extra special Trials
6025000	6027000	with the unicorn and the flaming cat.
6027000	6030000	It was crazy stuff, so I need to go back and play that.
6030000	6032000	But the new Trials game looks alright.
6032000	6034000	I don't know if I want to pick it up right now.
6034000	6035000	I may wait for a sale for that.
6035000	6038000	Alright. Well, let's go to the mailbag.
6038000	6040000	Every week, we invite your emails.
6040000	6042000	Participate at orangeloundtrader.com.
6042000	6043000	It's the place to send emails,
6043000	6046000	and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show.
6046000	6048000	Actually, we got a great response to mailbag last week.
6048000	6049000	We have four emails.
6049000	6050000	Sweet!
6050000	6051000	Yeah, we got a lot to talk about tonight, so let's get into it.
6051000	6053000	So we're going to do our first email tonight,
6053000	6057000	which comes to us from Meermuse, is the one that sent in this email,
6057000	6060000	saying, Dear OLR, I've been listening for 12 years
6060000	6062000	at my factory job here in Baltimore.
6062000	6064000	That's a long time. Thank you very much.
6064000	6068000	It helps pass the time, but I was always half-listening in a very passive way.
6068000	6072000	Some info was missed. Sorry, because work came first.
6072000	6075000	You got nothing to apologize for.
6075000	6078000	Sorry, I half-listened the show, too, so it's fine.
6078000	6080000	We're fine being background noise. It's all good.
6080000	6083000	And especially if you're trying to listen to us at work,
6083000	6086000	I completely understand if work comes first.
6086000	6087000	Yeah, but like Loki jokes.
6087000	6090000	I mean, he jokes, but sometimes, you know,
6090000	6093000	as we're trying to do a live show, other things are going on.
6093000	6096000	Like, we might have to completely adjust what we're doing on the fly
6096000	6098000	because, you know, we unexpectedly had a host out.
6098000	6102000	Or my cat will be causing terror in the other room,
6102000	6104000	and I've got to go tend to it.
6104000	6107000	So sometimes we have to multitask as well. It's all good.
6107000	6109000	Anyway, Meermuse continues.
6109000	6112000	Now with Twitch, I watch what I can live.
6112000	6116000	I love reading the chat scroll, and if I ever think of something to add,
6116000	6117000	I can on the spot.
6117000	6120000	Better yet, when I finish watching on the archives,
6120000	6122000	my husband is often right next to me,
6122000	6125000	and we watch and talk together about the gaming news.
6125000	6128000	Let's be honest. The only news that really matters. LOL.
6128000	6131000	Bottom line is I think the Twitch move was fantastic.
6131000	6134000	I feel more connected, more interactive, and more represented.
6134000	6138000	I've told more friends about the show because they don't listen to podcasts,
6138000	6140000	but do watch Twitch streams.
6140000	6141000	Keep up the good work.
6141000	6144000	Meermuse, whose name is noted there, is Emily.
6144000	6146000	So thank you. Thank you so much for that.
6147000	6152000	I mean, we were always a live show with the audio part of it,
6152000	6154000	but I do think there's something about the Twitch community
6154000	6157000	and being able to see the chat on demand, which you couldn't do before.
6157000	6159000	I mean, you could be in chat if you're there live,
6159000	6162000	but if you weren't able to be there live.
6162000	6165000	But a lot of people are kind of watching the live experience
6165000	6167000	when they can during the week,
6167000	6170000	because if you are a subscriber at VOG Network,
6170000	6174000	which you can use your free Twitch Prime if you're so inclined,
6174000	6179000	to subscribe to VOG Network, you get the chat stuff and the video side by side.
6179000	6184000	Although I will caution you, chat only saves for like two weeks, I think,
6184000	6189000	because you could watch any episode since we moved to Twitch.
6189000	6191000	So you could go all the way back to the December episodes,
6191000	6193000	but chat's no longer there.
6193000	6195000	And that's a Twitch decision, not us.
6195000	6198000	They only save the chat scrolls for like two weeks.
6198000	6199000	So you don't want to watch it.
6199000	6202000	We'll just have to incorporate it in the bottom somewhere.
6202000	6205000	You can add to the chat, too, if you feel so inclined.
6205000	6209000	So even though it won't be there live, we actually see the comments later.
6209000	6212000	So, you know, especially if you have something really profound
6212000	6215000	or something you want to say, like, you know, if it's something that catches my eye,
6215000	6217000	I'll bring it up on a later show.
6217000	6220000	Like, maybe you play a game like Dissidia,
6220000	6223000	and so you want to leave a comment about it as to what we're all missing out on.
6223000	6225000	The trailer looked cool.
6225000	6226000	It did.
6226000	6227000	It's just the game.
6227000	6228000	I just don't understand.
6228000	6231000	I thought it would just be a fighting game, and it's kind of not that.
6231000	6234000	All right. Anyway, let's see.
6234000	6235000	There's a P.S. to this.
6235000	6240000	I'm a very sick person, so I have a few ideas for your starting panels.
6240000	6243000	Oh, those little things we do at the beginning of the show.
6243000	6247000	Again, that's part of the Twitch thing, but the little will not be seen tonight.
6247000	6249000	So I'm not going to read those, because I might.
6249000	6253000	There's actually one of these that's really, oh, wait, they're all good.
6253000	6256000	But one of them is like, I'm going to use it next week, because it's timely good.
6256000	6259000	Well, I thought for sure we would have one with,
6259000	6262000	oh, what the hell is the meme, the trolly thing that's going around?
6262000	6264000	Oh, my God, the kids.
6264000	6265000	Oh, Momo?
6265000	6266000	The Momo challenge.
6266000	6268000	I swear, I thought they were going to have a moment.
6268000	6272000	I got one for, I'll just say it now, and then you all act surprised
6272000	6276000	so you see it later, cooking Momo.
6276000	6277000	How about that? You like that?
6277000	6278000	We'll do it.
6278000	6280000	That would have been a good one for tonight.
6280000	6281000	I wish I thought of that.
6281000	6282000	Maybe in a future week.
6282000	6284000	We'll do cooking Momo in a future week.
6284000	6285000	All right.
6285000	6286000	All right.
6286000	6289000	All right.
6289000	6292000	Moving on.
6292000	6293000	Don't worry.
6293000	6295000	Momo will fix it.
6295000	6299000	Let's get to an email from Flaco Jones, who said,
6299000	6303000	just wanted to clarify something that came up on the last show about Ninja.
6303000	6307000	While I do take some issues with the guy, he seems like an overall entertaining strainer,
6307000	6313000	but he has not, as Loki said last week, dropped the homophobic F-word on stream.
6313000	6316000	Perhaps Loki was thinking of the recent story
6316000	6320000	where the DJ Deadmau5 dropped that slur on his Twitch stream
6320000	6322000	than just non-apology apologized for it.
6322000	6325000	I can't remember who the hell is dropping the F-bomb everywhere.
6325000	6327000	I mean, Jesus Christ.
6327000	6329000	Too many people that need to stop, that's for sure.
6329000	6332000	But I do think last week when he said that, I said,
6332000	6335000	I don't know if that's true, Loki.
6335000	6337000	So I'm glad Flaco Jones is here to correct it
6337000	6340000	because we shouldn't attribute shitty things
6340000	6343000	if somebody didn't actually say those things.
6343000	6345000	So our apologies on that.
6345000	6348000	But otherwise, everything else we said I think still holds true.
6348000	6350000	Which I don't remember what we said.
6350000	6354000	Anyway, Flaco Jones continues,
6354000	6358000	Oh, and I also wanted to answer Metal Mayhem's question from the call last week
6358000	6361000	about what critically panned game do you love?
6361000	6366000	My favorite critically panned game is Game & Wario for the Wii U.
6366000	6371000	It's one of my favorite Wii U party games, despite its 61 on Metacritic.
6371000	6375000	Now, that's mostly because I love the Pictionary-style sketch game,
6375000	6379000	but I even found a lot of the other included minigames quite fun.
6379000	6383000	Way better than the 61 score would have you believe, at least.
6383000	6387000	Anyway, thanks for the streams, and as always, have a great show, Flaco Jones.
6387000	6390000	Well, thank you. I appreciate that because it's a little polite correction,
6390000	6394000	but followed by a participation, so that's good.
6394000	6397000	And I remember Flaco being a fan of Game & Wario
6397000	6400000	because I think that's where I played it, was at his place.
6400000	6402000	So it makes sense to me. Great.
6402000	6404000	Alright.
6404000	6407000	ActDeaf does want to point out, 61 isn't bad.
6407000	6409000	It's just average.
6409000	6412000	I still think it works as an answer, though, because sometimes, you know, an average.
6412000	6414000	On the Nintendo bell curve, it's probably true.
6414000	6416000	That's true, on the Nintendo bell curve, yeah.
6416000	6420000	Alright, we have another email tonight, and this email is from Retertainment,
6420000	6423000	who says, Dear Mr. Smoosh and other people,
6423000	6427000	by now you've probably talked about the decision Apple made
6427000	6432000	to delist episodes of podcasts that include the episode number of that podcast.
6432000	6436000	If you haven't discussed this decision yet, please feel free to rant.
6436000	6438000	Okay, so here's what's up.
6438000	6442000	So Apple sent an email to all the podcasters that talked about some good guidelines
6442000	6447000	and I think some tags that they generally saw that people weren't really using.
6447000	6450000	And I don't think the email was worded as well as it could have been
6450000	6453000	because part of the email kind of made it sound like, or gave that impression,
6453000	6458000	that if you're putting episode numbers in your titles because you're not using the tags,
6458000	6461000	we're not going to accept your podcasts on iTunes
6461000	6463000	or we're going to delist your podcasts from iTunes.
6463000	6466000	And as you can imagine, a lot of people threw a fucking fit over that
6466000	6469000	because a lot of people put episode numbers in their descriptions.
6469000	6473000	Of course, including us at Orange Lounge Radio, but many different shows do that.
6473000	6478000	Now it is very important to note, because, you know, before you guys that have been following the news
6478000	6482000	sent me the emails and chat, Apple did reverse course on this decision.
6482000	6487000	So they saw the tweets, they got the emails, the calls, or what have you,
6487000	6492000	and Apple sent out a follow-up email that made it very clear in bold, large font,
6492000	6497000	we will not delist your show if you have your episode number in the title.
6497000	6500000	But then went on to kind of say, we're talking about the tags
6500000	6503000	and we want you guys to explore the tags.
6503000	6506000	And so for the sake of this email, too, because I don't think in the email
6506000	6509000	we ever talk about that Apple did reverse course on the decision,
6509000	6510000	I think it is an important thing to put out there.
6510000	6515000	But, you know, it does bring up this point that whereas Apple brought podcasting to the forefront,
6515000	6521000	you know, podcasting existed before iTunes, but Apple definitely brought that to a huge...
6521000	6526000	I mean, our numbers here at Orange Lounge Radio were never bigger than that first month
6526000	6532000	that Apple launched iTunes, because we were a gaming podcast that existed beforehand.
6532000	6536000	And so we were on iTunes that first week, and so we were doing really, really well.
6536000	6538000	Our numbers were, like, higher than they've ever been.
6538000	6543000	But why aren't they still that high? I guess our show sucks. I don't know.
6543000	6548000	All the big websites and all the celebrities and everybody else started getting into it
6548000	6550000	and kind of diluting the pot.
6550000	6554000	And, you know, I love indie podcasts and I'm all for more people
6554000	6558000	and more diverse perspectives on games, so I'm not butthurt about it, I swear.
6558000	6562000	But I do think it's important that now at this point in 2019,
6562000	6565000	I don't think everybody's getting their podcasts on iTunes.
6565000	6566000	No.
6566000	6571000	We have Spotify, we have TuneIn, we have Google has their own,
6571000	6573000	and there's other ones as well.
6573000	6575000	And you can listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
6575000	6578000	We're not on Spotify yet, but I am going to correct that.
6578000	6580000	That is merely an intentional problem.
6580000	6584000	It's nothing against Spotify but about an upcoming move,
6584000	6587000	and I don't want to have the Spotify there until the move happens.
6587000	6588000	So there is a reason for that.
6588000	6591000	The only one we intentionally held back on was Stitcher.
6591000	6595000	I will not have this show on Stitcher because for way too long,
6595000	6599000	Stitcher was not updating this feed and they were not doing anything about it,
6599000	6601000	which caused our listeners to send us emails saying,
6601000	6603000	Where is your show? Why aren't you updating the show?
6603000	6605000	And so I said, You know what? Fuck it.
6605000	6609000	And I pulled it from Stitcher because if Stitcher can't accurately represent this show,
6609000	6612000	then I'm going to put the listeners somewhere else.
6613000	6617000	And this is what it kind of came down to for me with Apple as well,
6617000	6619000	and I wrote some tweets about this, and I was like,
6619000	6622000	You can't kick all of us off iTunes.
6622000	6624000	Like NPR is putting episode numbers.
6624000	6626000	A lot of nonfiction people put episode numbers in there.
6626000	6629000	You know what? Apple cannot kick us all off.
6629000	6631000	They really can't. Let them try.
6631000	6635000	We'll simply advise our listeners to go somewhere else.
6635000	6639000	Would you guys be willing to go somewhere else besides iTunes to listen to this show?
6639000	6643000	I bet many of you would be happy to be here on Twitch or somewhere else.
6643000	6650000	And I'm just saying that I saw way too many people have that gut reaction of,
6650000	6654000	Fuck, I've got to go through my entire feed and update everything right now
6654000	6655000	because I don't want to get kicked out of Apple.
6655000	6660000	And I was kind of like, I let my cigarette and cross my legs and said,
6660000	6662000	Let them fucking come.
6663000	6665000	Let them fucking come.
6665000	6670000	And I think if more of us would band together like that,
6670000	6672000	any podcasters would stick together.
6672000	6677000	And when a website tries to control what the podcasting standard should be,
6677000	6679000	which no company owns,
6679000	6682000	I think we do need to band together and put our foot down and say,
6682000	6684000	Not on my watch.
6684000	6687000	Just because Siri doesn't want to get confused.
6687000	6689000	Well, no, it's about the tags.
6689000	6693000	And from their perspective, I get what they were getting at,
6693000	6695000	but they just didn't communicate it right.
6695000	6698000	And so they heard that loud and clear that they didn't.
6698000	6701000	And I think they kind of did a good job fixing that, at least on the back end.
6701000	6704000	So there you go.
6704000	6707000	I'm trying to think if there's anything else on that whole debacle I need to say.
6707000	6709000	I don't think so.
6709000	6712000	Anyway, I do want to finish Redertainment's thought, though.
6712000	6715000	It is beyond evident that the decision made by Apple is
6715000	6719000	and was a dumb fucking decision made before anybody fully even bothered
6719000	6722000	to think of the wide-ranging consequences of this dumb fucking decision.
6722000	6724000	Can you think of any others?
6724000	6728000	I mean, other than the decision 62 million plus people made in 2016.
6728000	6732000	Any reasonable person knows that the morally abhorrent racist charlatan
6732000	6735000	is a mistake and has been since its conception.
6735000	6737000	I'm just reading the email.
6737000	6739000	That was, again, from Redertainment.
6739000	6741000	So thank you very much for the email.
6741000	6743000	But, yeah, at the end of the day,
6743000	6746000	I don't think any one company should control the podcasting standard.
6746000	6749000	And if they try to do it, then we should.
6749000	6752000	We made you, and we can break you just as easily.
6752000	6754000	All right, anyway.
6754000	6757000	I'm trying to see if we have any chat comments on that whole thing.
6757000	6760000	Yeah, OnlySonic says, just need an RSS feed.
6760000	6762000	That's what podcasting is.
6762000	6764000	Podcasting is audio RSS.
6764000	6766000	That's what it is.
6766000	6768000	It's just podcasting was kind of a catchier name for it or what have you.
6768000	6772000	S2100Matt says, I mean, metadata is important in media.
6772000	6774000	It helps things get organized and be seen.
6774000	6776000	I get Apple's point, but then again,
6776000	6779000	Apple hasn't really updated their tagging system well.
6779000	6781000	Swongtong points out, that happened to me with Stitcher.
6781000	6784000	I couldn't listen for about a year until I found you again.
6784000	6786000	Totally thought you quit podcasting.
6786000	6789000	See, that pissed me off when Stitcher did that.
6789000	6792000	So, I mean, I think they got bought again.
6792000	6794000	And so they're probably under somebody.
6794000	6796000	But I'm sorry.
6796000	6799000	If Stitcher would like to have Orange On Radio on their player,
6799000	6802000	they can come ask for it.
6802000	6804000	That's where I'm at.
6804000	6805000	They're a who?
6805000	6806000	Yeah, exactly. I know.
6806000	6807000	I know it's not going to happen.
6807000	6809000	I know damn well it's not going to happen.
6809000	6812000	But I can, you know, I can sit here and go, you know what?
6812000	6815000	And I'm going to ask, will you update my feed in a timely manner this time?
6815000	6819000	And who, what direct person can I contact if it's out of whack?
6819000	6821000	Anyway.
6821000	6825000	TigerCon chat says, even though there are options to stream,
6825000	6827000	the option to listen to podcast,
6827000	6829000	I'm very careful at how much data I use.
6829000	6831000	So I download them on iTunes first
6831000	6834000	and then use software to sync them to my Android phone.
6834000	6837000	I'm curious, why aren't you using the Google store if you have an Android?
6837000	6838000	Because they have podcasting as well.
6838000	6840000	At least I thought they did.
6840000	6844000	Google Play has podcasting.
6844000	6846000	It's through the Play Music app.
6846000	6847000	That's what I use.
6847000	6849000	Yeah, so anyway.
6849000	6853000	Yeah, obviously there's tons of, tons of podcasting apps at this point.
6853000	6856000	So I don't think anyone can really dictate the standard anymore.
6856000	6860000	It is not the year 2005 or 2006.
6861000	6862000	Anymore.
6862000	6863000	Anyway.
6863000	6868000	Let's get to our last email tonight, which is from DJ Rama S.
6868000	6870000	Who says, hey everyone, Rama here.
6870000	6872000	I've been having this thought lately.
6872000	6874000	I've looked at my gaming and anime collections,
6874000	6878000	realizing that at times I'm buying these items more for the sake of having them,
6878000	6881000	as opposed to playing or watching these discs.
6883000	6886000	I look at, sorry, I just, I just thought of Loki suddenly.
6886000	6890000	I look at my collection and realize that I have not finished most of the series
6890000	6892000	or played through what I've collected.
6892000	6894000	So what I'm asking is this.
6894000	6896000	Have you ever looked at your collection
6896000	6900000	and think that you're buying these games more for the sake of collecting them
6900000	6903000	because they'll become hard to find or not?
6903000	6904000	Thanks for taking my email.
6904000	6906000	Now I'm off to rebuilding my website.
6906000	6910000	Hopefully it'll be up and fixed by the time y'all get this email.
6910000	6911000	Rama.
6911000	6914000	And good luck on the website relaunch there, Rama.
6914000	6918000	So Loki, are you buying games just for the sake of buying them?
6918000	6920000	Um, no.
6920000	6922000	Sometimes I'll buy them because I'm like, oh, I want to play that.
6922000	6926000	And then I just move on to something else and don't end up playing it.
6926000	6930000	Like, um, or usually if it's on sale, like sometimes I'll pick up stuff.
6930000	6933000	Like I have Dragon Age Inquisition.
6933000	6934000	Still haven't touched that.
6934000	6936000	Um, I have Titanfall 2.
6936000	6938000	A lot of EA games, actually.
6938000	6940000	And Need for Speed, those are all on deep sales
6940000	6943000	and I purchased them and sold them and played them.
6943000	6947000	Wolfenstein, I have probably had such a huge library of games
6947000	6950000	both on the PlayStation Store and through Steam
6950000	6953000	that I have just not played most of them.
6953000	6956000	And yet I'll still keep continuing to buy them
6956000	6958000	and sometimes not even on sale.
6958000	6960000	Like in the case of Kingdom Hearts 3, I just bought it
6960000	6962000	because I was like, oh, hey, that'd be fun to stream.
6962000	6964000	And then I didn't play it.
6964000	6966000	You know, I just like to have physical games.
6966000	6968000	Um, and maybe part of that is about collecting or so forth.
6968000	6972000	But I always think in my mind, what if I want to sell it back someday?
6972000	6974000	I can't tell you the last time I sold a video game.
6974000	6977000	But I can tell you the last time I loaned out video games.
6977000	6979000	And so I know that's a big thing, too, is that, you know,
6979000	6981000	a friend of mine will be like, oh, you're done with that?
6981000	6983000	Like one of my friends borrowed Mass Effect recently
6983000	6985000	just to start playing through that, especially with
6985000	6987000	backwards compatible and Xbox One now and everything.
6987000	6989000	So they've been playing that.
6989000	6991000	So, um, I think that's kind of the biggest perk to having digital.
6991000	6993000	But you're right, there's a lot of like,
6993000	6998000	wow, wow, Rob, physical versus digital.
6998000	7002000	Um, but, um, yeah, I mean, digital is starting to look more and more,
7002000	7005000	you know, especially when it's like on the case of Xbox.
7005000	7009000	Um, if I buy a digital, I can play it on my PC or my Xbox.
7009000	7011000	You know, and I've talked about this before about the whole,
7011000	7013000	like, what's the, you know, value of the game?
7013000	7015000	What's the equity about the disc you hold and so forth?
7015000	7018000	You know, if digital can offset that value,
7018000	7020000	be it through a deep cut sale through.
7020000	7025000	But if something is $60 to buy a digital or $60 to buy a physical,
7025000	7027000	you know what, I'm going to buy a physical.
7027000	7030000	Because at least I have the option to loan it out, sell it back.
7030000	7032000	I have all of that. I don't have that when it's digital.
7032000	7034000	True. Um, the way I look at it though,
7034000	7037000	like especially when I'm looking at physical and digital,
7037000	7040000	it's normally I'm just purchasing it.
7040000	7044000	I'm probably not going to end up selling it back because let's be honest,
7044000	7047000	like if you sell something back, like way down the line,
7047000	7049000	say when you trade in your system or something like that,
7049000	7052000	it's probably not worth anything anyways at that point.
7052000	7055000	Um, and you're really not getting much.
7055000	7057000	It takes a space in the house.
7057000	7060000	Like for me, I'll decide, Oh, Hey, I want this game.
7060000	7063000	I'll download it, you know, or I'll purchase it digitally
7063000	7067000	and I'll set it to download on my system remotely and then come home and play it.
7067000	7070000	Maybe that's assuming actually play the game I purchased.
7070000	7076000	But you know, same, same thought process there is I could do that.
7076000	7078000	Um, I, I purchase a lot of games digitally.
7078000	7080000	I purchased the Lego game digitally.
7080000	7084000	I mean, um, most of the games I have on the switch are digital.
7084000	7088000	I do have some physical games, but those it's, um,
7088000	7090000	sales and getting stuff used usually.
7090000	7092000	Um, I don't know.
7092000	7095000	I walk into the store all the time,
7095000	7098000	like GameStop when my kids are playing the demo kiosk,
7098000	7100000	because God forbid they play the switch they have at home.
7100000	7102000	They want to play the demo, whatever.
7102000	7105000	Um, so I'm actually looking at used games all the time.
7105000	7107000	Like I'm like, is there anything I want?
7107000	7109000	And I just kind of like, no, not really.
7109000	7112000	I'm not gonna, nothing really stands out like, Oh my God,
7112000	7113000	I need to pick this up.
7113000	7115000	Um, I don't know.
7115000	7119000	I, I just eventually someday when I retire, you know,
7119000	7123000	I'll have all these games I can play and then I'll be able to do that.
7123000	7128000	She Hulk in chat says, uh, physical is going away for good someday.
7128000	7131000	No, I don't know if it would be a hundred percent though.
7131000	7132000	I get what you're getting at.
7132000	7135000	I do think we may see like disc drives go away.
7135000	7137000	We, we thought for a little bit,
7137000	7140000	some of the early rumors about the Xbox one is that there may be a
7140000	7141000	version with no drive.
7141000	7144000	Uh, and that could be true, could be true emphasis on could be about
7144000	7146000	PlayStation five of the next Xbox.
7146000	7151000	But I do think if the system can handle physical media,
7151000	7152000	there's still going to be that.
7152000	7155000	And I think there will always be, even if it went a hundred percent digital
7155000	7159000	GameStop or those types of stores would still have like,
7159000	7165000	here's this collectible plushie you can get for Pokemon gen eight.
7165000	7169000	And it comes with a digital code to get the game online so that there's
7169000	7174000	still like a physical something, something integrated with the digital.
7174000	7176000	I just bought, funny enough,
7176000	7181000	a brand new microphone for my studio computer because I did, uh,
7181000	7183000	I did one of those package things. Like I did the overwatch,
7183000	7187000	like I taped that in advance. I did one a couple of weeks ago. I did a, um,
7187000	7190000	I did one for a, what was the, I did Tetris 99 a couple of weeks ago.
7190000	7193000	And I was like, God, my audio is fucking horrible on this.
7193000	7196000	I'm going to just get a new microphone. So I went and got a new microphone.
7196000	7198000	And guess what? I got a Yeti microphone.
7198000	7202000	Guess what it came with? A $50 gift certificate to the Ubisoft store.
7202000	7203000	I was going to say,
7203000	7206000	I thought it came with Assassin's Creed origins cause they had that originally.
7206000	7210000	Close. Okay. So like it's like 50,
7210000	7214000	$50 off a $60 game on the Ubisoft store or whatever that is.
7214000	7219000	So that's the kind of stuff I think you may still see in the future.
7219000	7222000	Is that really physical going away though?
7222000	7225000	But maybe the way we think about what physical games are,
7225000	7227000	that could maybe change in the future.
7227000	7230000	But, you know, Loki joked about it earlier in the show,
7230000	7234000	but it's still very true, especially when it comes to a series like Pokemon.
7234000	7239000	The merchandising, the physical shit, that is all still very important.
7239000	7243000	And I think as video games is more and more a part of our society,
7243000	7246000	that isn't just this underground thing that nerds play.
7246000	7250000	As Fortnite has an aisle dedicated to it and Target and things like that,
7250000	7255000	there's always going to be some sort of physical manifestation of gaming
7255000	7258000	in the world, even if it isn't in the future,
7258000	7261000	a disc that goes in the drive, if that makes sense.
7261000	7263000	So, but good discussion.
7263000	7266000	So great emails tonight. Thank you guys so much for the emails.
7266000	7268000	We hope more of you will send emails.
7268000	7270000	Don't be shy. Send your emails for next week.
7270000	7275000	Participate at orangelandrater.com is the place to send those emails.
7275000	7282000	Let's move on and get to the next story that we have on deck. Loki.
7282000	7292000	So GOG has quietly let go of a dozen of their staff, apparently, this last week here.
7292000	7295000	They didn't say why the layoffs happened,
7295000	7300000	but there was some financial issues that caused the layoff.
7300000	7307000	Basically, there is a rep that said that letting people go is never easy.
7307000	7311000	We have been rearranging certain teams since October 2018,
7311000	7316000	affecting in the closure of around a dozen positions last week.
7316000	7321000	The same time since the process started, we have welcomed nearly twice as many new members
7321000	7324000	and currently hold 20 open positions.
7324000	7327000	So it just sounds like restructuring right now.
7327000	7329000	Still not the best thing to hear about.
7329000	7332000	I feel like every week, literally every week since this year started,
7332000	7335000	maybe two weeks into the year, we've had some story about layoffs.
7335000	7340000	And they were saying that there was a staffer that had been, I think, let go,
7340000	7344000	and they said that it was about 10% of the staff that was affected by layoffs.
7344000	7350000	I don't know. Whatever. I mean, it's restructuring.
7350000	7355000	So, I don't know. This isn't as big as a software company or something.
7355000	7358000	I mean, it's still a platform, people being let out.
7358000	7360000	Aren't they still kind of trying to come out and say,
7360000	7365000	because of this increased competition with game makers getting a larger share of the profits,
7365000	7370000	which we all know the Epic Store came in and kind of took a swing at that whole thing.
7370000	7374000	Isn't that kind of all stuff they're trying to blame for why they're just going to have to scale back?
7374000	7378000	Because they have to give more money to the game developers to be competitive.
7378000	7383000	Well, competition's hard, so that's going to be an issue that they have to do,
7383000	7386000	give people a larger cut of their profits.
7386000	7389000	I'm disappointed that GOG kind of left the retro stuff behind.
7389000	7391000	I know it's still there.
7391000	7394000	Because everybody in chat is going to scream it out, I know.
7394000	7397000	The retro stuff just isn't as lucrative. You don't make as much money.
7397000	7399000	You're selling it for less money.
7399000	7404000	It doesn't mean I don't miss it and that there's so many things that I feel like are missing.
7404000	7409000	But rights, et cetera, I get that I can't just have my dream list of games
7409000	7411000	and that that's going to suddenly happen on GOG.
7411000	7415000	But it is just a bummer that more of that couldn't have been fleshed out.
7415000	7418000	But obviously, they had to get into the newer stuff to stay competitive.
7418000	7419000	Yeah.
7419000	7423000	And it's competitive, and so we're starting to see.
7423000	7429000	But maybe the silver lining is that, OK, so unfortunately, GOG had to let 12 people go,
7429000	7434000	but maybe something like the Epic Store is going to have to hire 12 people because it's getting bigger.
7434000	7438000	Well, they just said they let go of 12 positions, but they are hiring for 20.
7438000	7441000	It's just that those positions, they're restructuring.
7441000	7447000	So 12 of the positions that they had, say they were customer service or something,
7447000	7451000	maybe they need 20 positions to fill in development of a new platform
7451000	7454000	or enhancements to their online platform or whatever.
7454000	7457000	Yeah, it's just needed in different parts.
7457000	7459000	They can't just shuffle some of those people.
7459000	7462000	Maybe the skill sets didn't quite line up with what they needed for those other positions.
7462000	7464000	So I don't know.
7464000	7469000	Sg100Matt in our chat says, well, PR-wise, GOG didn't do themselves any favors last year.
7469000	7471000	I'll just leave it at that.
7471000	7476000	You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but since you said it, I just didn't want to be tacky about,
7476000	7479000	you know, maybe this was the PR department that had to.
7479000	7490000	But since you said it, unfortunately, companies really need to watch it when it comes to their PR
7490000	7496000	and who represents them because all that stuff can have a repercussion on the rest of the company
7496000	7501000	and people that maybe had nothing to do, hardworking artists and programmers
7501000	7508000	and people that had nothing to do with those types of discussions on how to be edgy or cool or things like that.
7508000	7517000	So PR companies really need to, and PR divisions and departments and so forth, really need to watch themselves.
7517000	7521000	And that's all I'm going to say about this week as well as last year.
7521000	7529000	So let's move on, shall we, to our next story, which has to do with a Konami 50th Anniversary Collection
7529000	7532000	Arcade Classics rating that showed up.
7532000	7537000	Nothing's been officially announced by Konami, but the game was rated recently in Australia
7537000	7540000	and isn't that how a lot of these games seem to leak all the time?
7540000	7547000	Yes, they leak with, usually like ratings boards and stuff showing like some sort of rating,
7547000	7550000	like either a PEGI rating or something like that.
7550000	7558000	Now, this has many people saying, ooh, Konami made things like Metal Gear and so that could,
7558000	7565000	well, hold up, if it's Konami Arcade Collection, I wouldn't get too crazy about what you're going to see in this.
7565000	7570000	If you want an idea about what to see in this, look at the types of Konami games that have been released
7570000	7575000	on places like Xbox Live, Arcade, the game room.
7575000	7579000	Believe it or not, there was a lot of Konami stuff in that game room when that was still a thing.
7579000	7580000	God, I miss that service.
7580000	7585000	And, you know, Konami's kind of released stuff from their 80s catalog.
7585000	7589000	If you need an idea what that looks like, I would, and again, we don't know what's in it,
7589000	7594000	but I'm just hypothesizing you might want to be thinking a little less Metal Gear Castlevania
7594000	7600000	and the things they're known for on console and maybe be thinking a little more about things like Scramble,
7600000	7605000	Jungler, Frogger, maybe, although Frogger's a weird one because Sega actually released it.
7605000	7606000	They'll throw in Frogger.
7606000	7609000	They throw in Frogger all the fucking time.
7609000	7610000	Time Pilot.
7610000	7611000	When no one wants it.
7611000	7613000	I love Time Pilot. I would love to see that.
7613000	7618000	Maybe Tutankham, I'd love that, but again, some of these were like co-pilot, like Stern was involved with that too.
7618000	7621000	Jairus, I love that game, so I'd be there for that.
7622000	7625000	Track and Field was an 80s arcade classic as well.
7625000	7630000	And then, you know, Yara Kung Fu was like an original fighting game classic.
7630000	7633000	But there was Gradius in the arcade, so you never know.
7633000	7635000	Salamander in that whole series, you might see some of that.
7635000	7641000	Technically, there was a Castlevania game in the arcade, so we might get lucky and see Haunted Castle could show up.
7641000	7646000	And I would say if you guys get really lucky, maybe stuff like Sunset Riders, you know, when you get into the later Konami years.
7646000	7651000	I doubt the Ninja Turtles game, because Konami did at least the second game, didn't they do the first one?
7651000	7654000	Yeah, they did. They did the first and second Ninja Turtles arcade game.
7654000	7657000	But then you get into licensing, da-pa-da-pa-da.
7657000	7659000	Simpsons arcade game never happened.
7659000	7660000	I don't know if that, yeah.
7660000	7665000	So, I mean, those things only happened, like the Simpsons arcade game did come out as a download, as did the Ninja Turtles.
7665000	7671000	But that was like through new partnerships, so like Ubisoft, EA, or whoever had the current rights at the time.
7671000	7672000	Those came out.
7672000	7678000	So, I don't know. But also, you know what, maybe, if we're really lucky, here's the one I would be crossing my fingers and toes for,
7678000	7681000	is that in 1992, they made the X-Men arcade game.
7681000	7687000	So, again, license, it's com- if they could get all that worked out, I know I'd love to see that.
7687000	7688000	So, we'll see.
7688000	7692000	Oh, DJ Rama S also chimed in chat with that. I swear I said it first.
7692000	7695000	DJ Rama S also suggests Bucky O'Hare.
7695000	7697000	Let's see, some folks in chat.
7697000	7699000	Blades of Steel, Double Dribble.
7699000	7705000	Uh, Dartesia pointing out, technically, Castlevania was in the arcade, but the original game had its issues.
7705000	7708000	Uh, Sjoerdundermatt says Russian Attack, probably.
7708000	7712000	Yeah, you guys in chat, you guys are naming the, uh, the right stuff there.
7712000	7717000	YYR said Ninja Turtles, Simpsons, X-Men did all come out on Xbox Live Arcade, so it's not impossible.
7717000	7721000	You're right, it's not impossible, but it may be a little trickier if it's in a collection,
7721000	7724000	or it's gonna be harder to make sure the rights holders-
7724000	7730000	It's less lucrative for them to re-license that, you know, to, it's not the first of the value add to it.
7730000	7734000	I just don't think that they would go that far to get some of this stuff in there.
7734000	7740000	Now, I guess it's worth asking, cause I do see it in chat, Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution.
7740000	7742000	I wish, but no.
7742000	7745000	I wish, but I just, I don't, how would DDR work on the Switch anyway?
7745000	7747000	Like, I guess you could do with arrows.
7747000	7752000	Beatmania could do the five key like you used to do on the Playstation if you downloaded the controller.
7752000	7755000	I would love it, don't get me wrong, but I just don't.
7755000	7761000	It would be awesome if Konami would put them in as like secret things, or like Easter eggs,
7761000	7764000	but they're just, why would they? Why would they do that?
7764000	7770000	This is, you know, but prove me wrong, Konami, I dare you, I would love that.
7770000	7774000	Moving on, uh, Loki, you got something for us, right?
7774000	7779000	Yes, and so this is kind of a silly add to the game, but there's this game called Plague Inc.
7779000	7785000	where you design your own, like, super viruses and watch them take over the world and stuff like that.
7785000	7794000	So, now they have a scenario, thanks to fan demand, that involves anti-vaxxers.
7794000	7801000	And so, apparently they had a petition out there that says if this petition gets 10,000,
7801000	7806000	we will add a specific new anti-vaxxer scenario into Plague Inc.
7806000	7812000	And of course, over 20,000 people signed it, so they are going to be doing that.
7812000	7814000	So, that's kind of funny.
7814000	7817000	Dude, is there actually anybody anti-vaxxer still left?
7817000	7821000	I feel like it's one of those things that everybody jokes and makes jokes about and so forth,
7821000	7825000	but like, nobody actually confesses to actually being an anti-vaxxer anymore.
7825000	7827000	I think that there still are.
7827000	7829000	Ugh, get with it, people.
7829000	7834000	Well, I guess, okay, yeah, as I'm saying this aloud, and I'm sure before you all scream at me in chat,
7834000	7838000	and I'm going to, believe me, I am on the side of kids ought to be vaccinated,
7838000	7842000	and I work for a company that says that and puts that out there as well.
7842000	7843000	It's stupid not to be vaccinated.
7843000	7846000	And I'm thinking about, there's the whole measles thing that just happened in Washington, so you're right.
7846000	7849000	There are still morons out there that are...
7849000	7850000	It's just the problem...
7850000	7853000	It's Facebook's fault. It is all Facebook's fault.
7853000	7857000	Nobody would have heard what Jenny McCarthy had to say if they hadn't shared it on Facebook.
7857000	7861000	Facebook should have shut that down when they had the chance, but free speech.
7861000	7862000	So, anyway.
7862000	7868000	I liked Jenny McCarthy when she was set dressing, but, you know, now she has opinions.
7868000	7873000	Alright, well, everybody in chat, I knew that happened, everybody in chat, there's many anti-vaxxers.
7873000	7875000	I know people that are anti-vaxxers.
7875000	7882000	But hey, you know what, though, to balance the universe out with all this pro-vaccination stuff,
7882000	7886000	we're going to give Goop a new Netflix series, so that's a thing.
7888000	7891000	Alright, anyway, vaccinate your fucking kids.
7891000	7894000	I work with medical professionals, and they all agree.
7894000	7896000	Vaccinate your fucking kids.
7896000	7898000	And yourself, honestly.
7898000	7900000	Alright, anyway.
7901000	7903000	Moving on. Something a little more lighthearted.
7903000	7905000	Yes, so this is kind of cool.
7905000	7909000	I remember actually getting this within a box of cereal, but...
7909000	7916000	You may remember a while back, especially if you were a kid in the 90s, that there was, you know, a game called Doom,
7916000	7923000	and then there was a famous mod, or total conversion of Doom, that was free with a box of Chex cereal.
7923000	7926000	And that game was called Chex Quest.
7926000	7934000	And Chex Quest was a kid-friendly, non-violent Doom total conversion that you could play,
7934000	7936000	and it came with your box of cereal.
7936000	7939000	Well, guess what? It's getting an HD remake.
7940000	7941000	Why?
7941000	7943000	Because it's fun.
7943000	7949000	So, Chex Quest HD is apparently a passion project of a guy named Chuck Jacoby.
7949000	7951000	Nobody's getting paid for it.
7951000	7957000	And him and volunteers have created, with permission from General Mills, so it is endorsed,
7957000	7960000	that they have fully committed to...
7960000	7963000	Somebody at General Mills was like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?
7963000	7967000	Alright, sure, free advertising for Chex, sure, why not?
7967000	7973000	Yeah, so they're remaking the whole game, including the five-level single-player shooter.
7973000	7978000	So, neat that it's a thing that's gonna be coming out.
7978000	7983000	When is somebody gonna remake Sneak King and all these other great advertisement games?
7983000	7986000	I want that shit re-released, because that was fucking brilliant.
7986000	7990000	And they promised more, they were supposed to be making more games, but it hasn't happened yet.
7990000	7991000	I need more.
7991000	7992000	I need more.
7992000	7996000	But, if you would like to follow the progress of Chex Quest HD,
7996000	7999000	they don't really have an official page aside from their Facebook group,
7999000	8002000	so facebook.com slash chexquesthd.
8002000	8003000	Alright, fair enough.
8003000	8007000	You can go follow the progress of Chex Quest HD.
8007000	8011000	When's Chex Mix Quest HD, because I prefer Chex Mix.
8011000	8016000	I wanna see a version of Chex Quest built into the new Doom game.
8017000	8023000	The frenetic action that is of the modern Doom.
8023000	8025000	Oh man, I love it.
8025000	8026000	It's gonna be awesome.
8026000	8032000	Alright, and one more story for you guys tonight about a website where you can go on adventures.
8032000	8039000	It's a site called Noclip, and it's at the URL noclip.website.
8039000	8042000	Not a .com or a .website.
8042000	8045000	Because, you know, they expanded the .domains layer.
8045000	8051000	So there's noclip.website, which has levels stripped out of existing Nintendo games.
8051000	8056000	Things like Ocarina of Time, Luigi's Mansion, Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine.
8056000	8058000	And what do you do?
8058000	8061000	You just go flying around looking wherever the hell you want.
8061000	8062000	It's just an exploration.
8062000	8065000	That's why it's noclipping, because you can go through walls.
8065000	8066000	You can fly anywhere.
8066000	8071000	So you can explore worlds beyond maybe what the original games would let you explore.
8071000	8073000	And I know some of you eat that stuff up.
8073000	8075000	Jamie loves this stuff.
8075000	8077000	She has a whole Mass Effect.
8077000	8087000	I wish she was here tonight, because she has that whole Mass Effect Tumblr that was dedicated to finding stuff hidden in the Mass Effect games through mods like this that would let you clip through Mass Effect.
8087000	8091000	So people like to do this stuff, you know, breaking down the Nintendo files and all that stuff.
8091000	8093000	I mess around with some of the Mario Kart maps.
8093000	8094000	It was pretty neat.
8094000	8095000	Did you?
8095000	8096000	Yeah.
8096000	8101000	And I noticed there's like gifs and little videos where you can go through fast.
8101000	8102000	Yeah, it's pretty fast.
8102000	8104000	You do a Mario Kart course and you have zero speed.
8104000	8107000	I did try. They have a few experimental things in there.
8107000	8110000	So they have some non-Nintendo games.
8110000	8112000	They also have Super Mario Odyssey.
8112000	8118000	Although that really wasn't loading fast, so I didn't do that.
8118000	8119000	But the Mario Kart maps.
8119000	8124000	And I did Super Paper Mario, which isn't too exciting to look at, because to me it's Paper Mario.
8124000	8126000	But it was neat.
8126000	8131000	All right, and some folks in chat, of course, that got linked in chat, thank you, from Matt.
8131000	8133000	And some folks are saying, fantastic chats.
8133000	8135000	Holy crap, this Noclip website is dope.
8135000	8143000	Yeah, one of those things that's kind of fun to explore, especially because I know a lot of y'all have a soft spot for Nintendo games.
8143000	8146000	And this is just really cool that it kind of just lets you explore them in a different way.
8146000	8148000	So it's like, what was behind that house?
8148000	8149000	What was in that place?
8149000	8151000	What was on top of the hill that I couldn't get to?
8151000	8153000	This website kind of lets you do that.
8153000	8154000	So pretty cool.
8154000	8156000	I like that type of exploration stuff.
8156000	8157000	I wish I'd had the time tonight.
8157000	8163000	I was going to throw together some B-roll, but with all the changes we had to do last minute, I ran out of time.
8163000	8167000	So you'll just have to go adventure and look at it yourself over at the Noclip.website.
8167000	8173000	So vidpower573 in chat says, I see myself spending hours on this website.
8173000	8174000	I understand.
8174000	8176000	I understand the struggle, that's for sure.
8176000	8181000	Anyway, now is the part of the show where we're going to go to the listener roundtable where you can participate,
8181000	8185000	ask us a question in the chat room, or if you'd like to head on over to Discord in our green room,
8185000	8189000	you can actually call into the show as well.
8189000	8195000	I did want to, I promised last week that we would incorporate tweets back into the show in this segment as well.
8195000	8200000	So I wanted to go over to twitter.com slash o-l-r and actually look at some of the tweets that came in this week,
8200000	8202000	because there were a few of you that tweeted.
8202000	8209000	And I do want to say very nice words to people like Spyro557 who wrote a tweet that was like,
8209000	8213000	everybody should listen to Bobby and OLR tonight at 8 o'clock Eastern.
8213000	8218000	I just want to give you a gold star listener recognition there,
8218000	8224000	because we say at the end of the show, help us spread the word and get your friends to listen,
8224000	8227000	and Spyro definitely did that with the tweet this week, so thank you so much for that.
8227000	8234000	But we did get a tweet from M. Colburn on Twitter who was answering the guilty pleasure question.
8234000	8236000	A lot of you guys liked that question.
8236000	8243000	So M. Colburn tweeted us saying, my guilty pleasure crap game was Winx Club on the DS,
8243000	8248000	which Shane, that's one of his too, because I don't know if that was the one he worked on.
8248000	8249000	He was.
8249000	8254000	It was one of those Winx games, and Flocko I think to some extent also considers that a guilty pleasure game.
8254000	8262000	So sometimes those games that are like silly things for kids, like sometimes people get into them.
8262000	8269000	I guess one guilty pleasure game that I played, but only because it was so bad, was Driver 3.
8269000	8270000	Oh yeah.
8270000	8273000	Drive 3.
8273000	8277000	I was just thinking one I didn't mention last week, Spice World on PlayStation.
8277000	8278000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
8278000	8281000	Let's put another girl through her paces.
8281000	8285000	Yeah, that doesn't really have the same connotation as...
8285000	8291000	I know, I know. I loved the Spice World game that was so stupid, but I loved it.
8291000	8294000	Anyway, do we have any last minute stories, Loki, before I get...
8294000	8297000	If you guys have any questions in chat, you can feel free to ask them.
8297000	8302000	I don't know, did you see the new trailer for Detective Pikachu? That looked pretty awesome.
8302000	8304000	Oh, I did. It did look awesome, you're right.
8304000	8309000	Yeah, so I want to definitely check that out still even more so than before.
8309000	8316000	There's a rumor that Sony is offering refunds on Anthem, no questions asked, so that may be a thing.
8316000	8317000	You're looking to get a refund.
8317000	8319000	Is that an exploit though?
8319000	8320000	I don't know.
8320000	8326000	Alright, well let's get to a Discord chat, because we do get folks that want to talk to us on Discord,
8326000	8329000	so I want to get to the first of those calls tonight.
8329000	8331000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8331000	8334000	Hello, it's Delvin from Video Game Realness.
8334000	8339000	It is so good to hear from you, my streaming buddy Delvin. How are you doing tonight?
8339000	8343000	Good, I'm of course a long time listener, but first time caller.
8343000	8345000	Is this really your first time on the show?
8345000	8347000	First time calling, yes.
8347000	8352000	Wow, well, you know why I'm confused? Because you were here.
8352000	8357000	Yes, I was on the show, but this is my first time calling into the show.
8357000	8362000	Okay, I will accept that. To what do we owe this call tonight? What's on your mind?
8362000	8365000	Well, I wanted to talk about something that happened with one of my friends,
8365000	8370000	and then it made me get into thinking about online, on consoles, and paying.
8370000	8376000	So basically, he wanted to try Anthem, because there's all the hubbub about Anthem,
8376000	8382000	so he rented the game. So he rented the game from, I can't remember what service,
8382000	8388000	and got it home, but he doesn't have PS Online, so he couldn't play the game.
8388000	8393000	So in order to play the game, you had to play at least one month minimum to play this game,
8393000	8398000	which there's no way to play the game unless you have online.
8398000	8402000	I didn't even think about that. You're right, a game like Anthem is always online,
8402000	8406000	there's really nothing to do single player. Well, I thought you kind of,
8406000	8410000	I remember in the demo that I played of Anthem, you kind of could do a single player,
8410000	8414000	but it was like, are you sure? Are you sure? You sure you don't want to play with other people?
8414000	8418000	But then now that I think about it, it's still like putting your progress in the cloud,
8418000	8425000	and you're still online whether you're playing with other people or not. So, interesting. Huh.
8425000	8429000	Correct. So he could not play at all unless he had paid for online.
8429000	8434000	So it got me thinking, you know, when Xbox Live came out,
8434000	8441000	it was a luxury to play online with your friends, to play Halo online with your friends and other games.
8441000	8447000	But now in 2019, where many more games require online,
8447000	8453000	Overwatch, Fortnite, Apex, now Anthem,
8453000	8459000	is it valid for consoles to still charge you for online gaming
8459000	8465000	when now the games require it as a basic necessity to even play the game?
8465000	8468000	Well, obviously, I was wondering what your guys' opinion was on that.
8468000	8474000	The easy answer is no. Especially when you consider PC, right?
8474000	8478000	You don't have to pay to play online on PC. Correct. You're able to do that there.
8478000	8483000	So the easy answer is no. But the reality, Delvin, is that people are still paying for it.
8483000	8487000	So as long as people are paying for it, they're going to keep charging for it.
8487000	8494000	But this is going to put Microsoft in a very interesting position in the very new future.
8494000	8498000	And this is what I've been saying, Delvin, on the show for like the past two years.
8498000	8500000	One of my E3 predictions has always been,
8500000	8505000	Microsoft's going to announce that they no longer are going to charge for multiplayer online
8505000	8509000	because why are they doing it when they release the same games on PC
8509000	8511000	and you don't have to pay for online?
8511000	8515000	Instead, the Xbox Live Gold monthly thing is going to turn into
8515000	8518000	this Game Pass thing that they've been wanting to sell you anyway.
8518000	8521000	Like, why don't they just bait and switch Xbox Live Gold
8521000	8524000	with the Netflix thing they want you to have anyway?
8524000	8528000	Because the Netflix thing, they charge more for it,
8528000	8533000	and so I don't think that they're going to want to get both of that.
8533000	8536000	They're just going to get money wherever they can.
8536000	8539000	I just don't think in the long run, especially when they, you know,
8539000	8544000	when they start to blur the line between PC and console more and more,
8544000	8547000	I'm not sure that strategy is going to sustain itself.
8547000	8550000	So they're milking it while they still can.
8550000	8553000	But I would, you know, I'm going to again foolishly predict,
8553000	8556000	as I have for the past couple years, within the next few years,
8556000	8560000	Microsoft's going to be the one to drop it first and everyone will cheer,
8560000	8563000	and then it's going to peer pressure Sony into doing the same thing.
8563000	8566000	Nintendo will cling to it, because they were late to the party,
8566000	8569000	and they're going to say, Nintendo Online,
8569000	8571000	all these other things that they do.
8571000	8573000	That is my crazy ass.
8573000	8575000	If Michael Patrick can make predictions, so can I.
8575000	8578000	Do you guys not like your free Nintendo games each month?
8578000	8580000	I mean, all right.
8580000	8584000	My thing is that I think it should, like, as you mentioned,
8584000	8588000	you can have the premium service and get the free games.
8588000	8593000	That's fine, but I think for basic online, playing with your friends,
8593000	8597000	or even just being able to play Fortnite, Apex, Anthem,
8597000	8603000	these games that require online, you cannot play the game unless you have online.
8603000	8606000	That should not be charged for anymore going forward.
8606000	8608000	Now, let me give you another perspective here,
8608000	8611000	because YYR in our chat is, you know, who has made games
8611000	8613000	and done things for things like Steam,
8613000	8616000	is giving us another perspective here I think is important to weigh.
8616000	8619000	So YYR in chat says, once again, I'll make this case,
8619000	8621000	because I believe we've had a similar discussion before,
8621000	8624000	but probably every time I make my dumb prediction.
8624000	8628000	The platform owners offer functionality to developers,
8628000	8632000	including matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements, et cetera,
8632000	8635000	as well as run all of the servers to back that up,
8635000	8637000	and it costs the developers nothing.
8637000	8640000	Someone has to pay for it, and they ask the gamers to do that.
8640000	8644000	This strategy back in the OG Xbox in early 360 days
8644000	8647000	led to most games having multiplayer features
8647000	8650000	that otherwise would not have had them.
8650000	8652000	So that's an excellent perspective, YYR,
8652000	8653000	and I don't want to discount that perspective.
8653000	8658000	However, the reality is, what rules the talk of the gaming world?
8658000	8662000	Perception. Perception is going to rule everything.
8662000	8665000	And the issue is, is that the perception is,
8665000	8669000	on PC I get to play it for free because EA is absorbing all that content.
8669000	8672000	You get to play it for free, but you have to do it through Origin,
8672000	8675000	because EA has eaten that cost to get you to use Origin, right?
8675000	8680000	But the perception is, it's free, but it's not free the other places.
8680000	8684000	So I definitely don't want to invalidate your point or say it's not valid.
8684000	8687000	It is, but I still think that perception,
8687000	8690000	and I think there is, you say the gamers are eating the cost.
8690000	8697000	I still think there's a possibility Microsoft may be willing to eat that cost
8697000	8704000	to try to win people into its PC and all-in-one kind of ecosystem.
8704000	8707000	They may be willing to take that risk.
8707000	8711000	What do you think about the comments I just read from YYR, Delvin?
8711000	8715000	I think that it made sense before.
8715000	8720000	I just think going forward now, the way that the infrastructure is there,
8720000	8723000	it's been built, once upon a time it didn't exist,
8723000	8725000	so yes, we had the gamers pay for it,
8725000	8727000	but now the infrastructure is there.
8727000	8731000	Let's be real, this does not cost Microsoft or Sony
8731000	8734000	a large amount of money to run servers for online.
8734000	8737000	It doesn't in the grand scheme of things.
8737000	8740000	So I think the infrastructure is there now.
8740000	8742000	They don't need to continue charging for it.
8742000	8746000	Just charge for your premium service, your game streaming, your free games.
8746000	8749000	I think that's the best thing going forward.
8749000	8753000	I just thought of something too that is going to bring this issue to a head
8753000	8756000	maybe sooner rather than later, and that is those rumors,
8756000	8760000	big neon sign rumors, the best Fleetwood Mac album rumors
8760000	8764000	that came up last week on the show about this fact that
8764000	8768000	Nintendo and Microsoft may very soon have a
8768000	8771000	we're getting in bed together type of arrangement.
8771000	8773000	So how's that going to work?
8773000	8777000	If I have a game like, let's say, what were the games that were rumored?
8777000	8780000	Ori and the Blind Forest was one. Well, that's mostly single player.
8780000	8782000	What else did they rumor for the Switch?
8782000	8785000	Cuphead, right? Which I guess has two player mode.
8785000	8789000	But I mean, let's say that Microsoft puts one of their more multiplayer games
8789000	8792000	on the Nintendo Switch. How's that going to work?
8792000	8794000	Am I going to need a Nintendo system?
8794000	8796000	Am I going to need a Microsoft system?
8796000	8798000	Here's how it works with PC.
8798000	8801000	When you're playing cross platform for Forza Horizon or something like that,
8801000	8804000	I don't need to pay for gold in order to play online
8804000	8806000	because I'm on PC.
8806000	8809000	Whereas if someone has an Xbox, they have to play for gold
8809000	8811000	in order to get online.
8811000	8815000	So wouldn't it be weird that if I play Forza or whatever,
8815000	8817000	and again, this is all rumor anyway,
8817000	8820000	so this may just be a whole bunch of smoke and mirrors,
8820000	8823000	and that's fine too, but to think this through a little further,
8823000	8826000	what's going to happen if that ends up being the case?
8826000	8829000	That these Microsoft games are playable on Nintendo's console,
8829000	8831000	so they will let you play for free?
8831000	8834000	Again, I think that adds to the list of why Microsoft is,
8834000	8837000	sooner rather than later, just going to eat the cost of gold.
8837000	8840000	I don't know. We'll see. I don't know.
8840000	8843000	VG Realness, I think it's an excellent question,
8843000	8846000	and I think it's a thing to watch at this E3 for sure,
8846000	8849000	but again, obviously as the consumer, I want to sit here and say,
8849000	8852000	no, they should get rid of it, but the reality is,
8852000	8855000	but will they when people are still paying for it,
8855000	8858000	but as the industry is changing in front of our eyes,
8858000	8860000	as we're moving from physical to digital,
8860000	8862000	is this going to be reevaluated too?
8862000	8864000	And I think it will be. I think this whole online system
8864000	8867000	and who's paying for it and all that will be reevaluated. We'll see.
8867000	8869000	Let's hope so.
8869000	8871000	Well, thank you so much for the call. It's so good to hear from you.
8871000	8872000	All right. Bye.
8872000	8875000	Hey, wait. Plug your Twitch real fast. Plug your Twitch.
8875000	8879000	Oh, come follow me at twitch.tv slash VG Realness.
8879000	8883000	Excellent. Thank you. I will.
8883000	8885000	All right. Bye.
8885000	8887000	All right. Let's get to another call here.
8887000	8889000	We have a few people waiting. I want to try to get to everybody.
8889000	8891000	Let's get to this next call here.
8891000	8893000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8893000	8895000	Hey, what's up, guys? This is Kaijuto.
8895000	8897000	Great to hear from you, Kaijuto. What's on your mind tonight?
8897000	8900000	I just want to recommend some VR games for you because I know you said
8900000	8904000	earlier you wanted some games that would like work you out like Beat Saber.
8904000	8907000	Yes, please. I would love to hear it.
8907000	8910000	Number one game you got to get and I hope it's still on the market because
8910000	8913000	the company that made it, they went under.
8913000	8916000	So they're no longer like updating the game. Well, I think they're fixing bugs.
8916000	8919000	But, you know, like they're not responsible for doing any more with the games.
8919000	8921000	Hopefully it's still there. But that's Spark.
8921000	8925000	That's the main one you have to get. That's like it's like a combination of everything.
8925000	8928000	It's like tennis, fencing, boxing.
8928000	8931000	I remember you. You've talked about this before.
8931000	8934000	You're a fan. I know. I remember this one.
8934000	8938000	And it will it will work you out. And it's not you know, it's not like the
8938000	8941000	what was the running game that you were playing where you just like constantly
8941000	8944000	swinging your arms and you have to run around the map like you're just standing
8944000	8947000	in one spot. But the workout that it gives you is like your arms and everything.
8947000	8950000	You swing in, you're dodging the ball, all that stuff.
8950000	8953000	But you're basically standing in one spot, which I think is like ideal for like
8953000	8957000	a lot of VR sports games. You know, I really don't like the games where you're
8957000	8961000	like kind of like trying to traverse a map because that gets really confusing.
8961000	8965000	So, yeah, definitely get that one. Then there's the Creed boxing game,
8965000	8968000	which is another game where you're kind of like standing there boxing a guy.
8968000	8972000	And then there's another boxing game. And then there's Rec Room,
8972000	8976000	which is a free game that you can download. And that's like that's a community
8976000	8979000	thing where you're like, you know, you're playing laser tag with people.
8979000	8982000	There's a dodgeball game that really doesn't work that well.
8982000	8986000	And there's other activities that you have like a battle royale game in there as well.
8986000	8989000	Rec Room is a is a PC game, though, right? Not PlayStation.
8989000	8993000	No, it's PlayStation. Oh, it is. Yeah, it's free.
8993000	8996000	Yes, of course. So, well, should be playing with.
8996000	9000000	Yeah. All right. That's one of the great things about VR is that there's a lot of
9000000	9003000	cross platform play in a lot of the VR games.
9003000	9007000	So you're always playing with somebody on Rift or now you got the Oculus Go.
9007000	9010000	Does everybody playing together? So definitely check those out.
9010000	9013000	That's all I want to do is recommend those games. Hey, I love it.
9013000	9015000	I love the recommendations, you know, and somebody there was another game that was
9015000	9018000	recommended to me by Bobby that I looked at on the store.
9018000	9020000	I just didn't get around to it. It's not really an exercise game,
9020000	9023000	but it was basically F-Zero and in VR, something like Radial G or something.
9023000	9026000	I don't remember the name. You know, Wipeout. Have you done Wipeout?
9026000	9031000	I can't find my disk for Wipeout. I think I loaned it out.
9031000	9035000	Oh, so there's the downside of your physical games, by the way.
9035000	9038000	And I will I will let you digital people have your field day.
9038000	9040000	There is your downside. I loaned it out.
9040000	9043000	I can't remember who I loaned it out to and now I can't play the fucking game in VR.
9043000	9046000	But yes, Wipeout is certainly there, too.
9046000	9048000	Yeah, we buy it. It's cheap, man. Super cheap.
9048000	9050000	I know. It's true. It's true. All right.
9050000	9053000	Well, thanks for the recommendations, my friend. I'm going to look into it.
9053000	9056000	All right. Take care, buddy.
9056000	9058000	All right. Let's get to at least one more call here.
9058000	9062000	If you want to call into the show, though, join our green room over on Discord,
9062000	9065000	vognetwork.com slash Discord. But we do have at least one more call tonight.
9065000	9068000	Hi, you are on orange on radio. Who's this?
9068000	9069000	Hey, this is Deft.
9069000	9072000	Hey, Deft. It's great to hear from you. What's on your mind?
9072000	9075000	Well, let's talk about the beta.
9075000	9078000	Let's.
9078000	9080000	You first.
9080000	9082000	Okay.
9082000	9087000	Well, basically, one of the things the beta did right,
9087000	9092000	it was a really great PlayStation classic without being the PlayStation classic.
9092000	9095000	The first of all.
9095000	9103000	And really, like it wasn't like really that expensive to to get most of the games you wanted.
9103000	9107000	And it's like really, really easy to play.
9107000	9112000	And even on the PlayStation TV, because you could do that, too.
9112000	9121000	And probably not not as cheap or probably not as bad as the PlayStation classic was.
9121000	9122000	The PlayStation.
9122000	9135000	That's one of the things I really, really I'm baffled that Sony like really did good in this or did well on that on the beta and pretty much screwed up on the PlayStation classic.
9135000	9142000	I will say the PlayStation Vita was an excellent example of Sony knowing how to do backwards compatibility.
9142000	9149000	The PSP stuff worked very well, especially considering that, you know, the Vita didn't have a disk drive, so you couldn't just like actually physically put in the disk.
9149000	9151000	But it supported stuff that you had on the marketplace.
9151000	9155000	They opened up the PSP catalog to be able to rebuy things.
9155000	9156000	And it worked out very well.
9156000	9159000	The Vita was great in that regard for the compatibility.
9159000	9164000	And then, of course, as you say, the PS1 games and being able to experience all that all over again.
9164000	9165000	That was great.
9165000	9167000	And yeah, it was definitely a strong point for the Vita.
9167000	9172000	And I think the reason why a lot of people are going, but why not PlayStation 4?
9172000	9175000	But, you know, that's that's a whole nother dialogue.
9175000	9185000	And even then, it had the remote play on PlayStation 4 and you could actually use it as a controller, as you mentioned earlier in the show.
9185000	9189000	So it really was a really great system.
9189000	9201000	Don't know why Sony didn't like focus or marketed that like really well, because I remember them mentioned it, but it was like, oh, it can do this and nothing more.
9201000	9208000	They really needed to market the Vita more because it was a really, really great console.
9208000	9209000	Agreed.
9209000	9219000	And I wonder if in five years we won't get an interesting post-mortem on the Vita and maybe get some insider info as to what really happened on the insider.
9219000	9226000	I don't know. Maybe it'll forever be a secret because, you know, this is a very large company with very strong contracts and things of that sort.
9226000	9228000	So we may never really, truly know the answer.
9228000	9234000	But these things have a way of coming out as people move on to other jobs and get asked about them in interviews and so forth.
9234000	9238000	You know, we're getting all the dirt on the Atari and television days now.
9238000	9248000	Those guys go to the different conferences and, you know, some of them are very open about the drug use that was around back then and things that you didn't hear about in the 80s.
9248000	9251000	So it'll be interesting to see, like, what really happened with the Vita.
9251000	9252000	Maybe we'll find out in a few years.
9252000	9255000	Maybe it'll be 30 years. Who knows?
9255000	9259000	Yeah, those articles were really, really interesting.
9259000	9270000	But even though the Vita was a really great system and it did a lot of things right, it did things wrong and really, really wrong.
9271000	9277000	And one of them was the memory storage because that was, like, awful.
9277000	9286000	I don't know why Sony tried again to do a proprietary storage system or capacity.
9286000	9291000	And especially because it was, like, really, really expensive.
9291000	9305000	64 gigabytes was $100 and you had to import it from Japan because the most you could find on the US or in America was only 32 gigabytes and it wasn't enough.
9305000	9315000	Yeah, and I think, you know, that was similar to a point that came up earlier is that Sony's insistence to kind of keep things, everything in the Sony bubble of all these things that Sony produces.
9315000	9318000	I don't know if that really did them favors in the long run.
9318000	9320000	I think it might have hurt them and I think the storage is an excellent issue.
9320000	9322000	I think the storage really highlights that.
9322000	9330000	A lot of people kind of said that was kind of BS and it may have had better luck if it would have adopted, excuse me, a more lenient standard.
9330000	9331000	It was very overpriced.
9331000	9338000	We just had a little thing on the scroll bar that, you know, on the Twitch stream, the little headlines from various sites around the internet that scroll by.
9338000	9340000	I just caught one a little while ago.
9340000	9344000	It said something about 128 gigabyte card or something for, like, 20 bucks.
9344000	9347000	Like, that's, you know, for something you can use on Switch.
9347000	9351000	So, I mean, there's, that memory's coming down cheap in price, but those...
9351000	9352000	Not the Vita cards.
9352000	9355000	The Vita cards never budged, ever.
9355000	9358000	And they won't get any cheaper because of this.
9358000	9361000	They will probably get way more expensive.
9361000	9364000	Like, wow, it's gonna be, like, really crazy.
9364000	9374000	But another thing that I was really bothered by the Vita, it was the fact that you can only have, like, one account per memory card.
9374000	9384000	So, yeah, that's another thing that really, really bothered me because, at least in my experience, I have Taiko no Tatsujin for the Vita.
9384000	9390000	And you can only get the DLC if you have a Japan account.
9390000	9396000	So, obviously, my main account is for Mexico, and I had to actually, like...
9396000	9398000	It's a really, really long process.
9398000	9403000	You have to delete your profile on the Vita.
9403000	9408000	You have to remove the memory card and then do the setup again.
9408000	9413000	Again, it's a really long process just to make a profile change.
9413000	9420000	And instead of, like, having multiple accounts, since it's, like, yeah, it's gonna be a personal console.
9420000	9428000	It's affordable, but still, it's not like you cannot have multiple accounts on a system like that.
9428000	9429000	It was really baffling.
9429000	9430000	Yeah.
9430000	9436000	And I wonder if that's similar to the whole fact that, like, you weren't able to change your name on PlayStation Network for the longest time.
9436000	9439000	And even still, I don't think... That still is not rolled out, has it? The name change thing.
9439000	9440000	No.
9440000	9443000	No, we're still waiting. We know it's going to happen now at this point. It's just a matter of when.
9443000	9448000	So, it just seems like maybe some archaic things held it back.
9448000	9453000	Trying to wrap things up on a positive note here, Act F, what was your favorite Vita game and why?
9455000	9457000	What was my favorite Vita game?
9457000	9465000	I really cannot say of at least one game. There were so many. There was the Sly Cooper collection.
9465000	9468000	There was Taekunotatsujin. There were the Project D.Va games.
9468000	9473000	There were other games like Tearaway, Gravity Rush.
9473000	9482000	It really had so many great games, and that's the thing that really bothers me with how the Vita was handled, at least in America.
9483000	9490000	Because it really had a lot of potential, and Sony just killed it. Sony themselves could kill the Vita.
9490000	9495000	At least some of those must-have games did kind of get a second life somewhere else.
9495000	9500000	Like, things like Gravity Rush did end up on PlayStation 4 eventually, so at least we got that.
9500000	9509000	But, hey, I get it. You're right. It's one of those things where if only Sony had maybe put a little more effort into, and money,
9509000	9515000	into trying to get the message across about what all the Vita could do, maybe it would have had better luck.
9515000	9518000	But we'll never know now because it's dead and gone.
9518000	9524000	Maybe it can have a second chance like the Dreamcast had back in the day. Maybe.
9524000	9532000	Maybe. Why not? The Dreamcast was ahead of its time. Heck, I've been playing Phantasy Star online probably more than any other game this week.
9532000	9536000	I'm still hoping for a Dreamcast Classic Mini at some point.
9536000	9537000	Yeah, you never know.
9537000	9538000	I'll jump in on that.
9538000	9542000	Anything's possible. Alright, ActDeaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up. Thanks so much for the call, as always.
9542000	9543000	Hey, thanks for having me.
9543000	9547000	Thanks. Take care. Alright, that was it for the callers we had on Discord.
9547000	9553000	I will see if we have any quick questions in chat. Most people reacting to the Vita, talking a little bit about that.
9553000	9555000	But quickly, do we have any last-minute stories we want to get to?
9555000	9556000	No.
9556000	9557000	No? Nothing?
9557000	9558000	Nothing.
9558000	9562000	Alright. Anything you're gonna try to get done with gaming this week, or your programming stuff?
9562000	9565000	I'm just working on stuff. That's all.
9565000	9566000	Alright.
9566000	9573000	I don't know what's gonna come out of it, but I know last week was really busy, and this week's probably still gonna be busy.
9573000	9579000	I always feel guilty for not playing games, but at the same time, if I'm playing games and I'm not programming,
9579000	9584000	and if I'm not programming, then I'm not putting out a game, and then people are still gonna complain that I don't have a game done yet.
9584000	9588000	So, you can't win either way.
9588000	9594000	So, for my week this upcoming week, and if you have any questions, get them out in chat before I wrap up here.
9594000	9598000	For my week this week, I am going to Las Vegas for a few days this week, actually.
9598000	9604000	Not with Alan Gasp, but one of my gal pals, Melody, is taking me.
9604000	9610000	She bought me tickets to see Gwen Stefani at the residency there for my birthday, which was back in June,
9610000	9612000	but obviously they announced those residencies way in advance.
9612000	9617000	So, I will be in Vegas for a few days, and I'm hoping maybe to check out a few arcades,
9617000	9622000	and finally, I keep meaning to go by there every time I'm in Vegas, but I know Melody's into this stuff, too,
9622000	9626000	so we might finally get over and check out that pinball museum that they have there.
9626000	9630000	Yes, I saw the pinball museum in Jack Black's Jablinski Games video.
9630000	9634000	He went there in Vegas and it looked pretty cool, so they've got some cool stuff there.
9634000	9637000	But, yeah.
9637000	9642000	Shehulk is asking, has Loki seen FP2, Beats of Rage?
9642000	9644000	I have not yet.
9644000	9645000	I haven't either.
9645000	9647000	I haven't seen FP1, to be honest.
9647000	9651000	I have the disc for it somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.
9652000	9654000	But I should watch the second one, too.
9654000	9655000	Alright.
9655000	9658000	I think it's on Netflix, or one of them was on Netflix at one time.
9658000	9660000	The first one, I think.
9660000	9662000	But, yeah. I just haven't gotten around to it.
9662000	9664000	The other thing I'm really excited for in Vegas?
9664000	9666000	The food.
9666000	9668000	Because, you know, Vegas has some good restaurants.
9668000	9671000	So, guess where we have a reservation over the weekend?
9671000	9674000	We're going to go to the Hell's Kitchen restaurant.
9674000	9676000	Because they built, like, a mock, like, the TV show.
9676000	9677000	Oh, that's cool.
9677000	9679000	They built, like, an actual restaurant at Caesar's Palace,
9679000	9681000	and you have to get reservations a few weeks out and all that stuff,
9681000	9682000	so we're actually going there.
9682000	9684000	But do they, you know, do, like, show stuff there?
9684000	9686000	No, it's not like the actual TV show,
9686000	9688000	but my understanding is they do have a kitchen with a blue team and a red team.
9688000	9690000	Risotto's on the menu.
9690000	9693000	But is it cooked, like, shitty?
9693000	9694000	Hopefully not.
9694000	9698000	I don't know if they put on a show where you watch the chefs get screamed at or whatever,
9698000	9700000	but I'm really excited to try that.
9700000	9702000	Because I saw the building when I was there in November,
9702000	9704000	because I went to Final Fantasy Fan Fest, and I saw the building,
9704000	9708000	and it's got the big flaming thing, you know, everything that you see on the TV show.
9708000	9709000	Oh, that's awesome.
9709000	9711000	Because I think it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant,
9711000	9713000	because he has several of those places in Vegas.
9713000	9715000	And so that's, you know, no different.
9715000	9718000	So I think that'll be a lot of fun.
9718000	9721000	I'm excited. I love the food.
9721000	9725000	Pixel Pacas in chat says you've got to hit a buffet.
9725000	9727000	Well, that would be something I wouldn't mind doing.
9727000	9728000	We'll see how that goes.
9728000	9730000	That all just depends.
9730000	9733000	So anyway, Loki, you need to entertain the listeners for a bit
9733000	9735000	while I figure out what's going on here.
9735000	9739000	Yes. So, yeah, this week I'm probably just going to be programming.
9739000	9741000	Remember, I'm going to try to program, maybe.
9741000	9745000	I've been trying to find out, like, I started one project,
9745000	9748000	which I guess I could talk about it a little bit.
9748000	9753000	So I started a project which I'm probably not going to end up working on anymore,
9753000	9757000	but it was originally like a terminal emulator type thing,
9757000	9759000	but, I mean, it looked like a terminal,
9759000	9763000	but it was going to be kind of like a text adventure game type of thing
9763000	9767000	that was mocked up like a VoG network bulletin board system,
9767000	9771000	but I ended up not doing that because it was,
9771000	9774000	what I was using was limited to what I could do,
9774000	9776000	and I wanted to get it done quickly,
9776000	9779000	and this is not something that would be done quickly,
9779000	9784000	and I, like everything else I do, overscope the crap out of it.
9784000	9787000	So I decided that I am just not going to do that,
9787000	9788000	not going to work on it,
9788000	9790000	not going to work on something that I can get done quicker,
9790000	9794000	although the project I'm working on now is not really going to get done any quicker either.
9794000	9799000	It's going to take even longer, but it's more entertaining, I should say.
9799000	9803000	So I decided to go that route instead, but who knows where I'll end up.
9803000	9807000	I'll probably start several different projects and not finish anything as usual.
9807000	9810000	Okay, wow, a lot just happened there.
9810000	9813000	So that was, somebody was at our door, right?
9813000	9815000	So I had to go, like, nobody ever rings the door on a Sunday night.
9815000	9819000	It was Uber Eats, and they did have this address,
9819000	9821000	so if you wanted Burger King, I guess I could have grabbed it,
9821000	9823000	because somebody went to the, here's the scary part,
9823000	9825000	because I had the door open for it, Mr. Smoosh ran outside.
9825000	9828000	So that's the first time that's happened.
9828000	9830000	So yeah, very scary.
9830000	9832000	He started to go in the little plant over here, I'm like, no, no, no, no,
9832000	9835000	and I was able to pick him up in time, thankfully, but that's scary.
9835000	9837000	So he went on an adventure today.
9837000	9841000	Anyway, hopefully she's able to call and get the right address,
9841000	9846000	because I was like, can't you call whoever put it in and get the right place?
9846000	9848000	I guess I could have just taken the food, huh?
9849000	9850000	No.
9850000	9852000	But that's not nice, that's not the right thing to do.
9852000	9854000	Yeah, yikes, very true.
9854000	9858000	Smoosh saves, stay inside Smoosh, luckily Alan was behind me and heard it happening,
9858000	9860000	and I was like, oh shit.
9860000	9862000	So anyway, that was scary.
9862000	9865000	Anyway, I guess we will wrap up then.
9865000	9868000	Now that I've had a heart attack, we can wrap up the show.
9868000	9870000	All right, so as we say at the end of every show,
9870000	9873000	thank you guys so much for downloading our show, checking out the show.
9873000	9876000	We appreciate you guys being here every week.
9876000	9879000	All we ask, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word,
9879000	9881000	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9881000	9885000	but we can only put those voices out there if they're here.
9885000	9887000	So thank you guys so much for all the kind tweets.
9887000	9890000	I will say here on Twitch TV, putting us on your hosting list,
9890000	9893000	your auto-host list, that helps tremendously as well.
9893000	9895000	We would really appreciate those,
9895000	9898000	and of course we always appreciate all the bits and subscribers.
9898000	9902000	I'll read some of those after the show is all done tonight here at VOG Network,
9902000	9905000	so stay tuned after the credits live on Twitch.
9905000	9909000	Otherwise, I think we can wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.
9909000	9911000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9911000	9914000	My final thought, like I mentioned, I'll try to work on programming
9914000	9916000	and maybe play a game.
9916000	9920000	Me stream, I may do some streaming too if I ever get some time.
9920000	9924000	Yeah, my final thought is if I am able to do it before I leave for Vegas,
9924000	9928000	I want to freaking do a stream of Super Mario Brothers U already on Switch,
9928000	9929000	which I keep saving to stream.
9929000	9932000	I haven't opened the damn thing in like two or three weeks,
9932000	9933000	because I keep meaning to stream it,
9933000	9935000	but I keep getting pulled into Phantasy Star online.
9935000	9937000	But can I really complain?
9937000	9940000	Because playing video games like it's 2000 all over again
9940000	9943000	is still an awful lot of fun.
9943000	9945000	So, I think that is going to do it for now.
9945000	9946000	Oh!
9946000	9947000	Oh, no.
9947000	9949000	Everything's broken tonight.
9949000	9951000	I'm going to wrap up the show.
9951000	9953000	We're done. We're out of here before something else breaks.
9953000	9955000	Have a safe week, everybody.
9955000	9957000	We'll see you here next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
