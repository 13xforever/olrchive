Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week, EverQuest turned 20, and it may not be old enough to drink in the US, but if you played it, you are!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If that doesn't drive you to drink, in celebration and moderation, then join us for the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show, where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 769 for this March 24th of 2019.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you with my co-hosts in studio DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hi, how are you?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hungry, for once.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes, I know.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm hungry now.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, unlike the show, what was it, like three weeks ago, when Mr. Smoosh actually got out? I think that was, you weren't here for that, it was like your last show, not here.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, unlike that show, when somebody showed up with food delivery unintentionally, you're planning to make food delivery show up intentionally tonight?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Absolutely, on purpose-ly.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How do you like those services? I've never used them, am I weird?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've only used this once, and I had it delivered while I was doing my hair, getting my hair done, so it was actually really convenient.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Goat curry, yum!

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's interesting to get it delivered places. Yeah, I guess, okay.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I am so getting goat curry.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Interesting, you've had it delivered everywhere but your house. Okay, cool.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Pretty much.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Anyway, also joining us, of course, here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm fine.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I like your Pokémon themed shirt, it's very cute.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, it's one of my new shirts that I have, can't really see it, I guess. Here, I'll stand up.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Because now that we are on Twitch TV, because we do tape live at twitch.tv slash vlog network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And since we are on Twitch, we have to make more like wardrobe choices and style, like I can't come out here in my PJs. Well, I guess I can.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I was gonna wear, I had worn it on stream the other day, I think, maybe I did, I don't remember.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, when you were doing your DDR, like-

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I had a Thomas the Tank shirt, it's a tank, you know, it's hilarious.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I like that.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So I had that and then I have a few other Nintendo shirts, but this is what I went with today because I was playing Pokémon Go.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, we'll come back to that because I think there was quite a bit of Pokémon Go going on this weekend and probably next weekend too.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But we talk about a lot of video games, not just Pokémon Go, but it's, you got to admit that one's pretty convenient because it's on the mobile game.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But we're going to talk a lot about games tonight with you guys in our chatroom, of course, over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where Fifth Dream Today says about the food delivery stuff saying,

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I get them delivered to hotels, very convenient.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I need to think, you know what, because I was just in Vegas a couple weeks ago and we got probably like seven different pizza places slipping the like flyer under the door.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And I'm like, I did not come to Las Vegas to order cardboard pizza, okay?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I came to Las Vegas to eat because there's a lot of good restaurants there.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Food delivery, I didn't think about that one.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm going with Lamb Korma.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know what we were, I guess I can say this now because we're not at that hotel anymore, but do you know what we were right across the street from when we were in Vegas, our hotel?

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This giant new, and I've not seen anything like it here in California, but this gigantic MedMen store, you know what they sell?

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Huh?

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Marijuana.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yum.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It was a gigantic, like it looked like a fricking like Bel Air, Raley's, like Safeway, like shopping thing.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But it was all marijuana because I guess I didn't even realize Nevada made it legal, like we did in California.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So yeah, I just, I was, like here in California, even the places to get, I mean, not that we're a weed podcast, but it's a thing.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's going on in culture right now, right?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It was just made legal in California, right?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But all the places to go buy it here, they still look like shady back alley places.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
At least all the ones I've seen, still like they have the scarred out front.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Just order it online.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's what I've heard too, is that online is like the way to go.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Speaking of, you know, delivery to your door, you can just do that.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's what I do actually, except they don't do it to my door and where I live, but I go to Natomas and have it done at a friend's house.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I go to Chibi's.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wow. Okay.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's where I get my CBD pen for my nausea.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You get your food delivered, you can get your weed delivered, you can get your-

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Get my fake weed. Well, CBD pen.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How long until I can order a beet?

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Did you hear the speakingness now that we're going-

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Would anyone in this room prefer a mango lassi, by the way?

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now that we're going into the marijuana podcast, did you hear that?

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not episode 420, it's 769. That's a different number.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Seriously, does anyone want mango lassi?

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No, I don't.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But anyways, the guy that's the founder of Jelly Belly or whatever, they're making jelly bellies now.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I heard, yeah.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I would eat that.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know. I don't smoke weed, so it's not, you know. I don't care if other people do it, and I understand it's great for nausea and other things like that.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's just, I drink, isn't that enough? Anyway.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right, so I guess, but you know what? Look, I know it's a video game show, not a marijuana show, but I'm no idiot.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I could-

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you allowed to do when you get high? You play video games.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And based on, you know, the billboards that I've seen, I can also apparently have had my Slurpee delivered to me as well.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But what's the point at that point? Because, you know, you have to go get it, and it's immediately melting.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I just don't understand that, but you could do it if you wanted to, if you're that lazy.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Pixel Pacas in chat says, that's on the strip. No, we were off strip, but not far.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you know where the Hard Rock Hotel is in Vegas, that's, well we weren't at that hotel, but we were like right in that area.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And that's where the store was that I was-

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And this place is pickup only, so that sucks.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, all right. Oh no, you put in a whole food order, and then they were like, oh, only pickup?

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, so I have to cancel it.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh boy. All right, well anyway, let's get into our kickoff talk.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, you know what? It's funny, because we're talking about all this instant gratification stuff,

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and that actually does tie into the news this week a little bit, because Game Developers Conference happened,

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
so we had a lot of news around Game Developers Conference, and probably the big thing that we,

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
the big, big news out of Game Developers Conference is finally, we know what Google's dive into gaming is going to look like.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And the twist is, it's not a console, right?

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So tell us a little more about it, Logan.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a service, if you will. So, they're calling it Google Stadia, and of course, Phil Harrison, who's now over at Google now,

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
was talking about their platform and everything, what they're basically going to use, their high-end backbone,

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
running these really high-end gaming PCs or whatever, are going to be streaming up to, well, they said eventually 8K,

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but right now, 4K, 60 frames per second, to any screen you can think of.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Can I just quickly say, like, the 8K, 120 frames a second, like, when they were talking about all that stuff,

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I just, I thought instantly of, like, gigaflops, and things that they just say, because it's like,

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Gigaflops are real things, though.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I know they are, but they're things that they just say, there's more of it, it's more better than what you know today.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just, I don't know.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's just, yeah, I don't know, it's a neat idea.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I just don't know how practical it is with our network infrastructure that we have, but okay, let's just pretend that that wasn't an obstacle.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then, yes, this could be a thing.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, what they're going to do with Stadia is basically, you know, you would be able to, they're kind of linking it with a bunch of different things.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, for example, they have it linked with YouTube, so, like, you'd be playing a game and then have a link on there to join someone that's actually playing a game,

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
or you can basically create save states, sort of, with your different games, so you can actually share those out as well, which is kind of cool.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They have, you know, it's basically going to allow you to jump into a game without having to download anything.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They're showing off, you know, being able to kind of, you know, go from your PC to your TV to tablets.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They have this dedicated controller that looks kind of like a Nintendo Switch Pro controller, but a little bit like Ouya as well.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's kind of like all the existing controllers mushed together type of thing.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's a very, like, when I saw the controller, I was like, this looks extremely unoriginal, but that's actually not a dig on Google.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like, I don't want you guys thinking I'm, like, here to hate on this.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You don't really need to improve too much on the PC.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, I was just like, okay, this is what I would expect in gaming today.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is a par for the course controller.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, exactly. And they're saying that theirs is different because it connects directly with Wi-Fi, and it's supposed to lower latency that way.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So we'll have to see how that actually works out.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right now, though, they didn't give too much of a hint of what they're doing.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They did, you know, show that Jade Raymond's going to be doing games using it for their...

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They actually have their own first party company that's going to be doing games now.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We have no idea what the game is.

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No idea, but...

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But being that this is Game Developers Conference, it is logical that they would be focusing more on the platform, the delivery, the canvas, I suppose, and then we'll see the paintings at E3 or at different times.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So I'm not, like...

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I know there was a lot of talk out there about why did they bring her out.

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They got nothing to show, but it's maybe GDC is not usually the time to announce games.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Although there have been exceptions to the rule, right?

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
PlayStation Move was announced at GDC, but again, that's also more like a platform, a delivery, a canvas, if you will, not a game.

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So...

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I would be...

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now, what they didn't talk about, which I think would be pretty cool if they could do this because, you know, really one of the things that we run into with VR, for example, is having hardware powerful enough to be able to run it.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So if they're talking, you know, assuming that they can actually push 8K at 120 later on in the future, I mean, that might be something worthwhile for, like, VR because then you can have, you know, VR headset that's basically just a receiver and everything's being done in the cloud and you can stream these really powerful games to it.

142
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But once again, that has to do with your network infrastructure.

143
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And let's be honest, that ain't all that great in the United States.

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So...

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I like where they said that they only need 30 megabits down to be able to run games at 4K in 60 frames per second.

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But I would be...

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I would need to actually see this thing running and be able to check it out.

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So hopefully when they do announce price and all that stuff, which apparently is going to happen in the summer at their own separate event where they talk about games and everything or come out to it, then I guess we'll have to wait and see.

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But, you know, some of the games they talked about coming to it, obviously Doom, they were showing off Assassin's Creed, which, you know, that's the part of the project stream testing.

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Which apparently, by the way, for people that I know that were doing that and participating in that said it looked really good.

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I didn't see it myself, you know, so it's hard for me to know.

152
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think it's one of the things you kind of see yourself to really believe in it.

153
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But I do feel like people that participated in that in general were big believers in what Google was delivering at this conference, whereas people who hadn't had their hands on it, admittedly myself, were a little more in the skeptical like,

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know, you know that Google just has that server behind the stage and it's not really, which by the way is the case.

155
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Like there's not, it's not actually beaming over the internet from another, you know, location in another city.

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like it's on site and they do this at E3 with these types of streaming things all the time.

157
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But I get it, I get it. This is a concept, it's not like it's releasing tomorrow, so I'm not going to like judge it harshly.

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And it is benefited a little bit by the fact that, you know, people that I do know that had, did play the Project Stream thing, walked away from it with a pretty favorable impression.

159
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You know, and to my thing, though, with it is like everyone's saying, oh, well, this is going to kill consoles and stuff.

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't think so, because once, you know, first off, you have the issue where it's, you know, your network infrastructure has to be able to, and bandwidth caps for that, have to be able to withstand something like this for one.

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And two, they have to have the games you actually want to play on it, like, cool, it has Assassin's Creed and Doom.

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So do these other consoles. So does my PC. It's like, why do I need yet another service to play the same fucking game?

163
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't need it. I need to see what they're going to, you know, offer on this platform that I can't get on these other platforms.

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can get it, this and a bunch of other things, and it makes it more convenient for me, because honestly, that's what it's going to come down to.

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't care what your tech is. You just have to show me that it's going to work and that it has stuff that actually I'm interested in.

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And it might be a thing you kind of have to try for yourself, but at the same time, if it's as easy as click here in your Google Chrome browser and bam, game.

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I mean, this is not exactly something they're going to have to figure out. How do we get it in Best Buys and GameStop?

168
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Like they should, hypothetically, be able to have like a 10 minute demo or something that you could just click a button and bam, you're going, right?

169
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah.

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So it should be easy to make us believers, I suppose.

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, so my thoughts on this, and I want to know your guys' thoughts too in our chat, and I see some popping in already, and definitely Jamie, if you have thoughts on this thing as well.

172
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My thought on this is that I do think this is the future of gaming. I think that's the reality.

173
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Here's the deal. Broadly, this is the future of gaming. Specifically, I'm not sure this is the future of gaming. Does that make sense?

174
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes.

175
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Immediate versus long term? Maybe?

177
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Google versus the industry, if that makes sense, is that I'm not sure, and this isn't like a Google hate or anything like that. Although, I'm going to say it, Google has a track record of kind of closing things maybe before they really, you know, what Google Plus is sunsetting next month.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But okay, fine. That never really caught on.

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh no.

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Google inbox is going away, which I thought, you know, I was using that for a little bit and I thought it was kind of neat. It was just a different way, but I guess not enough people were doing it.

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Didn't they have like Google Reader or something like that?

182
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Google Wave, Google Reader, that was a big one that I still miss. I really wish that was around. And so on and so on. I mean, you know, okay, so Stadia and gaming, it's a different thing, but you can't help but kind of look at that and go, hmm, here's another big concern I have.

183
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And I'm actually going to read a chat comment on this because I think he summed it up very well, and that's SSJ100Matt in our chat said, it frightens me that this is being powered by YouTube.

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They're making it so that creators can have fans join games live. Google has a horrible track record in moderation in terms of YouTube. I understand the power of moderation will be in the hands of the creator, but the YouTube community is notoriously toxic at times. That is one of my top three concerns.

185
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, but I don't think that's necessarily what they're talking about as far as that because it's more of like that you can share out. They were giving examples and obviously they're going to name their own services if they're giving examples, but they're basically saying like as a streamer and they only have to do it through Google.

186
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You can have a hyperlink basically that you could put in the description for your show, podcast, livestream, whatever you're doing, where they would be able to jump into the instance that you're in as well to be able to play with you if they wanted to.

187
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Or you can send them a link to play this game online or like, hey, I got stuck here. I'm going to put you in the same scenario. It's like a save state basically that I can have my show me how you would get out of this or something.

188
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're like, hey, you know, we're going to set up this Minecraft instance and you set it up and now show me what you're going to build with these blocks or something like that.

189
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That could be neat. I'm going to say like in theory, I do have some concerns about it being tied to YouTube. I hope due to antitrust concerns, especially because we've seen what's happening in Europe where they're getting smacked down, I do hope that this will actually be open.

190
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I hope it's more of a case of what you're saying, like YouTube is the example, but in reality, it'll be open to Twitch, it'll be open to Mixer and things like that. After all, on your Xbox One, you aren't locked into Mixer. That's the one that kind of pushed, but you can do Twitch.

191
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But the thing I did like, though, that they were talking about with the game streaming and stuff is this is opening up game streaming for other people that may not have the hardware to be able to do that.

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Because what they're saying with this is when you basically can hit a button to stream your gameplay, whatever, it's not taking your actual gameplay, it's taking what it's viewing in the cloud. So it's being streamed at 4K and 60 frames per second.

193
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So whereas I don't have hardware on my laptop to be able to do that, I could play this game in Stadia and be able to stream it out and it would be in the highest possible quality that you can get.

194
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Now, here's what I mean about the industry. This is where the industry is going and I'm not sure this is it, but this is definitely a good tea leaves the future.

195
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Actually, one thing I want to address real quick, because a lot of people are calling this OnLive, right? They're saying, Oh, OnLive did this a long time ago.

196
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You know why OnLive failed? Here's why OnLive failed, like straight up.

197
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:52,000
OnLive failed. It wasn't like the fact that it was streaming and all this stuff. It was the fact that they wanted to charge you the same price for a retail game to own it in the cloud, essentially, and not have anything physical for that with no answer as to what would happen when the whole thing went away.

198
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like you're paying 60 bucks and I believe OnLive had a monthly fee. Am I not correct? I believe that was the case.

199
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I remember.

200
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
OnLive had a monthly fee and still wanted to charge 50, 60 bucks a game so you could play it digitally, hopefully, you know, and obviously now they're long gone.

201
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I think it is obvious. Who knows? Maybe I'll be proved wrong. I think it is obvious Stadia is intended to be subscription based.

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Stadia wants to be Netflix for games, end of sentence. I don't think there's going to be more money and more things that are in this.

203
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And you might wonder how, uh, studios are going to be able to make money. And so, well, I mean, Netflix is like, do you guys know?

204
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I still think that they're going to sell actual games with it.

205
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't, I, they might for like premium, premium things. I don't think it'll be successful if they do.

206
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Does Netflix sell movies on top of what they're doing now? What would happen if they did that? I don't think, I don't think it would do well. I really don't.

207
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I really don't. I don't know. But I mean, doesn't mean that they're not going to try.

208
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah. So anyways, it'll, it'll be interesting to see what happens in the near future when other people jump into the fray.

209
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Um, but anyway, let's see, uh, other comments in chat, um, S2100 Matt says, I think that content creators struggling to gain viewership will be forced into having their gameplay open to viewers.

210
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sure, they can make their gameplays close, but if they want to differentiate themselves between other streamers and creators, they will be forced to keep up with the Jones by having their streams open.

211
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Uh, PixelPaca says they talked about the Stadia store as a means to sell games.

212
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay. Personally, if that is the case and I misunderstood something I'm, I'm seeing, or I missed that part of it. If that's the case that they're going to like sell, I, I don't think this thing will work.

213
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't think the industry's ready for it. I think we're back where we were with Xbox One and them wanting to do as much digital as they did in the first announcement.

214
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's going to go the way of the glass?

215
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I think so. I think it will. Um, well, Jamie, I haven't really heard your thoughts on this and I don't know if you've thought a lot about it, but what do you think of this whole like streaming only sensation?

216
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't base my judgment off of the initial statements. You know me, that's just not how I work.

217
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I want to see the damn game in motion. You want to see the damn game?

218
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Exactly.

219
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Fair. Honestly, fair. It's fair. Um, I've learned not to judge things on the hype or on other people's opinions just because, you know, how long did I say, Oh, I'm not going to like Mass Effect. I'm not going to like Mass Effect.

220
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And what game do I super love? Mass Effect. How long did I go, Oh yeah, this particular thing is going to be really awesome.

221
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Everyone says it's going to be great. And then I play it and I'm like, this is kind of shit, you know, but other people love it.

222
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm, my own opinions can't be affected by what other people are saying about it. I have to experience it for myself.

223
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Sure. Now we do know that existing games will be on the platform because you know about Assassin's Creed and all this stuff.

224
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So let's say it is something that's up your alley. Like, I don't know, Tekken 7. Just make believe with me here or Tekken 3. Better yet.

225
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Which was the best of the series.

226
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Let's say, let's say they've got a nice retro collection and you know what? Something like that could win me over in HD.

227
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Something like that could win me over in a heartbeat. If Google was like, we have like Stadia retro that has all these Atari classics on demand and PlayStation.

228
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't, well, obviously it wouldn't have PlayStation, but make believe with me here, classic games on demand.

229
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That would, I would kind of go, okay, you got my attention, right?

230
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But anyway, that stuff aside, what about just the concept of you're not going to have a cartridge or a disc to play Tekken whatevers.

231
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You're going to just go on to Google Chrome and click go and rely on the stream to do it.

232
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I also don't want to rely on Chrome. So there's that too. I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.

233
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I have one computer that Chrome runs really well on and that is still kind of iffy.

234
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I do most of my stuff on a Mac. Chrome kind of doesn't run all that great on a Mac and this I can tell you from the back end of it.

235
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It does not run great on a Mac. So I don't want to be tied to a...

236
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So you have to see it for yourself on said Mac.

237
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Exactly. Exactly. And if anyone wants to talk to me about the back end stuff on it, I'd be happy to talk offline.

238
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But it just doesn't, it runs very inefficiently on a Mac.

239
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And so I'm afraid that with all of the inefficiencies with running, for example, every tab that you open opens three extra processes on the back end.

240
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Which will slow down. So imagine you're running extra tabs or you've got all these processes running and then you're trying to stream on top of it.

241
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That to me is looking like a disaster because, again, Google does not program efficiently for this OS.

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And I'll be perfectly honest, it's not super efficient on a PC either if you look at what runs in your task manager.

243
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Okay, I want to read this comment and it's really funny because he just pasted it again to make sure I see it.

244
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No, I was going to get to this comment a minute ago but then I ended up on a tangent as sometimes happens.

245
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But this is a great comment because I was talking about the industry versus Google. Here's VG Realness' comment in chat.

246
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I also think that it's only a matter of time before Microsoft drops the bomb on Game Pass for PC with a massive library.

247
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So it will be hard for Google to catch up. Sony could make PlayStation Now available on PC as well to combat this.

248
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So it comes down to the available library.

249
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Hell yes, and then I'll have all my games in one place. That's what I really want.

250
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And yes, that is why I say this is where the industry is going. Not necessarily PC, but maybe, although we know Sony loves their proprietary shit, right?

251
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But here's, in my opinion...

252
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh God, what memory sticks do I have to buy now?

253
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,000
In my opinion, expect this shit to be built into the next Xbox and the next PlayStation. Guaranteed.

254
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And I'm not saying it's going to be the only thing. I'm not saying it's going to be that they're going to completely walk away from discs.

255
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They might. I don't know. We'll find out.

256
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And I don't think necessarily PlayStation 5 is Sony's version of Stadia.

257
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But you can absolutely expect something like this will probably be a feature, a part, a component of the next consoles.

258
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Fuck, we've already heard. Microsoft, haven't they talked before?

259
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Correct me if I'm wrong, somebody in chat, somebody in the studio.

260
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Hasn't Microsoft already talked about a game that would play on the disc, like a normal game, but it would be enhanced by the cloud, by an internet connection?

261
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, Crackdown 3.

262
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay, so does it actually do that?

263
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, it does for the multiplayer, and it's alright. They have destruction in the game, but I can't help but think that it looks better even in Battlefield.

264
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They've done this like real time destruction stuff in Battlefield, and it's just kind of a pointless game mode.

265
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It was supposed to be like, oh, you can destroy any of the buildings in this game, but I don't know.

266
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's just it's kind of not all that great.

267
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's not compelling enough for me to play the multiplayer in there because, yeah, cool, you can break things, but the multiplayer sucks.

268
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Like, not the co-op, but like the multiplayer versus sucks.

269
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So it's like, I don't give a shit they can break stuff because it's just a boring game. I don't want to play this.

270
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Right, right. So, I mean, one other thing we got to get into because this is a very legitimate concern people are having about Google Stadia is the bandwidth situation.

271
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What did they say for this? 4K, 60 frames a second was going to be what? 20, 30 gigs?

272
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
30 gigabytes down.

273
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So a lot of us are capped at one terabyte on our Internet.

274
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And I kind of tried to get to this on Twitter, and some of the replies I got was, well, my Internet's unlimited.

275
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I'm like, that's great for you, and it is.

276
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And Google Stadia will be great for you and your house, but the problem is if you're going to catch on everywhere,

277
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
which Google's, you know, a big initiative like this needs to catch on everywhere,

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
then we do have to take some things like what is this going to look like for bandwidth caps into consideration?

279
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Because I don't know about you guys, but, like, I already use, like, a lot of Internet around here.

280
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I mean, shit, we're doing this show right now, right? I stream a lot. Alan streams a lot.

281
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You know, and it's just we're almost consuming more and more.

282
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I kind of wish Google would use some of their leverage as a powerhouse in tech to kind of force the hand of cable companies to help these data caps go up.

283
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I kind of think my gut kind of says these data caps will go up eventually.

284
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I think what's going to be well, what's going to end up happening is real quick.

285
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
They've already gone up. They've got we were just at 250 gigs, not even what, five years ago.

286
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So the industry has already bumped this up due to pressure to bump it up to it.

287
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So it's not like it can't get bumped up again.

288
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But I just feel like this may need to happen a little sooner before Stadia.

289
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You know, some people are going to have some real concerns about it. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

290
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
No, I was just going to say, I don't think that they're going to have bandwidth caps for much longer.

291
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Eventually, they'll go through Congress or the FCC and stuff.

292
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And we'll eventually, once we capture it, we'll be able to pass legislation to make that stuff unlawful.

293
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You know, the whole net neutrality stuff probably pushing that back through again.

294
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But I think they're going to have to get rid of it anyways, because eventually it's just going to get faster and faster.

295
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And obviously they're keeping it there just as a monetization means.

296
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, and I've said this on a show before.

297
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I think what's going to happen in the next couple of years is that cable is going to have a real competitor in places where there aren't options.

298
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like here in this specific place where I live in the Sacramento area, we only have one option.

299
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I know other people in Sacramento that have more than one option.

300
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But unfortunately where I'm at, just one option for internet.

301
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But what's going to happen, you know, because I think there's a lot of people in places where there's only one, maybe two choices for internet.

302
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What's going to happen, 5G getting adopted more and more and more.

303
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And look how fast tech is moving now in just a few years.

304
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I think 5G and over air and that is going to be the real competitor to cable.

305
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You want to jump in, Jamie?

306
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Are they going to use this to push Google Fiber?

307
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You would think.

308
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Google Fiber has kind of failed in a lot of places, though, because...

309
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But they've used this as a promotion point.

310
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You would think that Google could use like their own internet and this stuff.

311
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But you're right, like wasn't Google supposed to be in every city by now?

312
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
No, because I was even reading some online today, they're showing like some of the Google Fiber stuff where they were...

313
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The plan was to just basically bury it a few inches below the ground and cover it with like asphalt or something like that near roadways or whatever.

314
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Just kind of do it faster.

315
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, some folks in chat are saying that Google Fiber is essentially dead.

316
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
They got... Bobby says they got legislated out.

317
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
G.G. Rama says they're not expanding it.

318
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, which is too bad.

319
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Well, unfortunately, add that to the list of failed Google projects.

320
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, and we have Verizon 5G in like the middle of Sacramento right now.

321
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I just wish it would come out further because I do have Verizon.

322
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It will, but Logie, it will eventually.

323
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, but how it wins eventually, 2020, 2021.

324
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Think of where our cell phones were at when OLR started.

325
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I had that hideous flip phone thing, right?

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That's what I had. And look how far we've come in this.

327
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I mean, granted, we've been doing this show 17 years. It's a while.

328
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But we've come all the way from that crappy little flip phone to what?

329
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Edge, 3G, 4G, right?

330
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So it's just a matter of time before we get to a 5G era where it's everywhere.

331
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But you're right. How soon?

332
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And is the fact that 5G is not going to be available in X percent of the nation right away,

333
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
is that going to hinder Stadia's availability?

334
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Success rate, I guess.

335
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Although, granted, that makes it sound like I'm saying, oh, Stadia is only available on 5G. I'm not.

336
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Well, here's the thing. I don't know that all, I think, you know, for other consoles,

337
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
like for everybody that jump in on this is not necessarily a good idea.

338
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
May we not, may we forget that not literally a few years ago,

339
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
everyone was like, you know what's going to be the big thing of the future?

340
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
3D in your household.

341
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's like it's pictures, but they're coming out of your face.

342
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And everyone jumped in full bore in the 3D and where the fuck did that go?

343
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Nowhere, because it flopped.

344
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Virtual reality.

345
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, but that's virtual reality. That's different.

346
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But like when you say 3D, I'm like, it's just that just kind of shifted a little bit.

347
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But what I'm saying, though, is like people jump on board like they don't make 3D TVs.

348
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Well, I mean, not nearly like they were trying to do like three years ago.

349
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah, companies jump on board like with this stuff to try to push this new tech.

350
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But like if the infrastructure is not there to support it, it's kind of a waste of time.

351
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Maybe just make a nice console and stick with that.

352
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Do we really need to be planning for like 20 years in the future?

353
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You're going to have like two or three consoles by then.

354
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I mean, let's just one step at a time here. Make better games.

355
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Anyway, I think what ultimately becomes a Google stadia, you know, I'm interested to try it for myself.

356
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But I just, you know, the cost is going to be a big thing.

357
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And if they're going to say, oh, you've got to pay a monthly fee and you've got to pay like 30 bucks a game.

358
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Or even if you've got to pay like 30 bucks a game.

359
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But I don't like, I don't know how I'm going to feel about that when it's like, oh, but I've got to be thinking about my cable bill too.

360
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I don't know. I've got to, I think I'm going back to kind of where Jamie's at where like I really have to see it for myself

361
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and not in a controlled environment, in a real environment to really be able to make that decision.

362
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But if Google's going to make first party games with all stars like Jade Raymond.

363
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Who knows what they're capable of making where they might have a game where it's like, shit, I got to play that.

364
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah. You know, but I can't like if it's something that I would play as much of as like World of Warcraft.

365
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't have the frickin bandwidth for that. So that's got to be addressed. I don't know.

366
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm curious. I'm more curious about some of the things that VG realness was saying.

367
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
How the rest of the industry is going to respond to it. Because again, I do kind of think this is where industry is going.

368
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I do want to address the physical thing real quick and why I didn't call out Nintendo either.

369
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So, I think physical, there may still always kind of be a place for that. It's harder to tell with games.

370
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because, you know, you look at music. Music has really shifted to things like Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, right?

371
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's a lot of where music is, is in that streaming area right now. But you could still get a CD.

372
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You can still get, I mean, you can't exactly walk into Best Buy and get one anymore.

373
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But they're collectibles oftentimes. Not always necessarily in other countries, too, as well.

374
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
CDs are the predominant way of getting your music instead of streaming like in Japan for real.

375
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That's also a damn good point when we talk about things like Stadia is like how adopted is something like Stadia going to be in Brazil?

376
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You know? And I pick on that because isn't that the country where things like the Mega Drive and the Genesis were still big years later on?

377
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Because the stuff that we might be playing in the States was impossibly high to import in a country like Brazil.

378
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So, I'm kind of curious, you know, obviously there's gamers in Brazil. Are they going to be able to play Stadia like this?

379
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So, probably, I don't know. But anyway.

380
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But it's not coming out in all regions, too.

381
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I guess that's true. It's probably not something they're going to target right away. But I guess neither do a lot of gaming companies officially.

382
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But anyway, movies. Movies within the past few years have really made a shift to things like Netflix, Hulu, and more to come.

383
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We know Apple is likely doing something in the next couple weeks involving streaming. Disney is certainly doing a streaming thing. We know that.

384
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And this whole like streaming solution for film, TV, movie, that's just getting bigger and bigger.

385
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But it's not like Blu-rays are dead. People still buy them. Why? It's collectibles, right? Or things to watch on the go on an airplane, right?

386
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But I can't. When was the last time you brought a Blu-ray? Because I don't remember.

387
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I haven't bought a Blu-ray. Well, no. The last Blu-ray I bought was part of a Kickstarter. And I didn't even really need it.

388
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It was for Kung Fury. Because like, oh yeah, I want that on Blu-ray so I can watch as much as I want.

389
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Come to find out, the Blu-ray got delayed for so long. I've already watched this movie like 80 times online.

390
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh, hey, there's a Blu-ray now. I'll just put this in a pile of stuff I'm going to forget about.

391
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Here's why I don't think the gaming industry will be completely detached from physical games.

392
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's the same reason why I didn't name Nintendo earlier. I don't think they're, why would they do this?

393
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't think Nintendo has any plans to do anything like this. Why should they?

394
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Why try to figure out what the future is when you can just do what works?

395
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And Nintendo's big business is portable. Sure, the Switch is docked, but it also makes a lot of bread and butter by the fact that it's portable.

396
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And, you know, although maybe soon, maybe in 5, 10 years, we'll be in a 5G world where maybe I'll want to evaluate this statement.

397
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I think we all agree that Nintendo would be the last company to move to something like this.

398
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And I think Nintendo also underst... You're sitting on a joke over there, I know it.

399
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I just, they couldn't even, they can't, they can't even get a storefront working, let alone, you know, game streaming service.

400
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Let's, let's, let's not like, let's not scare Nintendo into doing something they're not prepared for.

401
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I bought Blaster Master Zero 2, just fine. Their storefront's fine. Anyway, here's the thing.

402
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
When Nintendo, and I think Nintendo understands the value of IP, their collectibles, their characters,

403
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
where I think, you know, a lot of the movies and music industry kind of make their money right now,

404
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
selling shirts, selling posters, selling collectibles, and even the game industry is kind of moving in that direction,

405
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
which I talked a little bit on Bobby's show at the end, in the call, like if you go to a Target,

406
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
you start finding loot boxes for games that don't have the game in them, it's just a bunch of, like, collectibles.

407
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But anyway, I think Nintendo can still hang on to that stuff for a long time.

408
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So I just feel like, I think we all have a general understanding that Nintendo would be the last company to adopt something like this,

409
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and I don't think they would be in any rush to do so, and why should they?

410
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
They're not, because they're successful, and I think it's just these other companies that are gonna try to figure out what the next big thing is,

411
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and I don't think we even know, they're just pushing it, they're just trying to tell you this is what the next thing is,

412
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
but we don't know until we get there, because, I don't know. Well, let's just see what happens, okay?

413
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Let's see how well the service runs, and what's even available in it, because if it sucks, then it's gonna fail.

414
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's what it's just gonna be.

415
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Let's see, other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwell says, I buy 4K Blu-rays because you can't rent them via Netflix DVD or Redbox.

416
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And I know that, I know that, like, Netflix does some 4K, but it's kind of limited, right?

417
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Like, their originals are all in 4K, but usually the stuff that's, like, licensed on Netflix, not a lot of that is in 4K.

418
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I can never tell because it usually upscales some of that stuff on my TV, so, like, I can't really tell sometimes if it's in 4K,

419
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:28,000
if it's just 1080. But, yeah, I mean, 4K looks nice. I wish I would, see, I would get the Ultra 4K stuff for watching them on my TV,

420
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
but, oh darn, that PlayStation Pro, it doesn't play 4K content via the Blu-ray drive. Thanks, Sony!

421
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Thank you, Sony, I appreciate that so much.

422
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But we also know that this conversation about the future of gaming is not going to be had on the PlayStation 4.

423
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:53,000
The PlayStation 4 is kind of in its, I don't want to say it's sunsetting, but it's in its, we all know that the PlayStation 5 is on the horizon.

424
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's more like, more like the sun is rising on PlayStation 5, it's just a matter of time.

425
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And this is where we'll have these conversations, but the PlayStation 4 is not where these conversations are going to be had. Anyway.

426
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Or where I could just get an Xbox, you know, 1S, and a 1S, not the X, but the S, and that can do that shit just fine.

427
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh, but Sony, fuck them, they just wanted to save some money on that Blu-ray drive.

428
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Dartatia in chat says, I was just telling someone on Twitter, that's why I love Nintendo, they don't really do any of the loot boxes slash microtransactions stuff.

429
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They did do some DLC, but at least it's always been good. And how long did it take Nintendo to finally come to the table with DLC?

430
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But, but you're right, it's all been very good.

431
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But that's the thing though, they're like 10 years behind in trends as far as online goes.

432
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Remember back when we used to get decent expansion packs and DLC for games?

433
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We used to have that, but now we have this bullshit. Just give them 10 years and they'll be in straight in bullshit again.

434
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I feel like though, we live in an industry that will forgive Nintendo time and time again because Nintendo makes those IPs you gotta have.

435
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's kind of like Disney coming to the table really late on streaming.

436
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
We all still know it's going to be a big fucking deal because it's Disney, right?

437
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And they got the Star Wars and they got their, what they just said, all of their classics.

438
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
There is no longer a Disney vault because all of their classics will be on the streaming thing and that whole thing.

439
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
That's a big deal. So even though it took Disney forever to come to this table, compared to Netflix and Hulu and so forth, the industry's kind of ready for it.

440
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And I think in some ways a lot of those same rules apply to Nintendo. They can get away with it for a long time.

441
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The only time I think Nintendo didn't get away with it was when they made a huge mistake of naming one of their consoles something as atrocious as Wii U and not being able to explain that to their audience.

442
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And I'm telling, I will still stand by that. The Wii U failed because of its name. Period.

443
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, sure. On that note, we'll move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week, whether it was on the Wii U or not.

444
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

445
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It was pretty good. Of course, some of my gaming week did include the GDCN party. And so what I played, I finally found the...

446
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Back up. Because you actually went to GDC, sort of.

447
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Not into the convention, but I went to the party. Just two of the parties.

448
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Just for some networking.

449
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You were in the area. How was that? Tell us a little bit about your experience there.

450
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well, the Unowns were G, D, and C for Pokemon Go. I didn't catch a C, but I caught another D and another G because OG, I got the D.

451
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Well, you know what's sad is that I would have...

452
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
This is not sitting properly on my head.

453
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You got a lot of compliments on the hat in chat, though.

454
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Thank you. Target.

455
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The problem with GDC, guess what? Guess what letters I already have? DragonCon. So, D-R-A-G-O-N-C. I have all the letters already because of DragonCon.

456
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I need another C, then.

457
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I can trade you a C. I've got Unown out the Unown right now, okay? I'll trade you one. It's fine.

458
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But at any rate, the Unparty was okay. The whole thing was supposed to be a quiet thing, and so they would have this wave go through it.

459
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It would get quiet for two seconds and it would be unbearably loud because it was in a freaking warehouse.

460
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So, I mean, I had a good time. It was really nice. And they got us pizza. I haven't had Papa John's since I was in college.

461
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Pizza's awesome.

462
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Even Papa John's pizza's okay.

463
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But he's not the CEO anymore, so...

464
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know if that's... All that stuff aside, which I really...

465
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm not gonna say no to free pizza.

466
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I can't follow that anymore, but that's not exactly the pizza chain I get up and cheer for.

467
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But they said, there's gonna be tea, and it was bring your own tea. So there was hot water.

468
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It was nice. It was a good place. I'm not complaining.

469
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Instead, Dark Soccer walked up and said, okay, well let's talk some shit. You wanna talk some shit? Let's talk some shit.

470
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
No. But anyway, there were... I saw two games there that were on demo.

471
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And one of them was called Hyperdot, which if you go to hyperdotgame.com, you can see.

472
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And really the point is to dodge everything.

473
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You have a hundred trials that you go through in your campaign mode and you have to...

474
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
There's even a multiplayer mode. And you can do custom challenges, but basically you're a little green dot avoiding all these blocks.

475
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And I don't know, maybe it got a little bit of inspiration from Undertale, maybe? The boss battles in Undertale.

476
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But at any rate, it is a neat little game. It actually reminded me of that game I love, Fractal, in just it's style.

477
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So, really neat. Check it out, guys.

478
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And then I spoke to the guy who's behind Zephyr Fox Games.

479
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And I'm so sad. I have his name on a business card and I left the business card at home.

480
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But he actually is local. So I said we should... I talked to him about getting him in that spot so he can hide Pikachu.

481
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
He's a really cool guy, too. But he's working on a game actually in Unity called Space Uber.

482
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And he actually showed me two different demos. And one of them is going in in your spaceship and fixing it up and hacking into stuff on it.

483
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And then the other one is actually where you pick up passengers in space, but at the same time you have to dodge mines in space.

484
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
He said as you go later on, you can pick up other vehicles like you find in space.

485
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You have to hack into them or you find different creative ways to get the machine started, to get the ship started.

486
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I just remembered it because the name of his ship in the demo was the Lopey Bovine.

487
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And it was just really, really kind of funny.

488
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But I did take some video of it and once I get it edited down we can do it during a mid-break thing.

489
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But it was a really neat little game.

490
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And actually if you go to zephyrfoxgames.com, his most recent update on March 5th actually shows some of the gameplay of Space Uber.

491
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And it's just a neat little game.

492
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
For me now, I will warn you, it made me super motion sick.

493
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I could not play or control it because my motion sickness got way set off.

494
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But the guy next to me had no problem with it.

495
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So everyone knows I got crazy motion sickness.

496
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
When I told him that I couldn't play Goldeneye, he's like, oh.

497
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
So it was like that.

498
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But it's a really, really, and he's doing it in Unity and he's done some amazing stuff with it already.

499
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So I'd say check both of them out.

500
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So zephyrfoxgames.

501
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And then the other one was hyper.game.com.

502
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Alright, well I'm sure they appreciate those plugs.

503
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I play a lot of pinball, like I do.

504
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm playing Pokemon Go. I played Ingress.

505
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I used up all my stupid bursters at work, thinking I could take it down.

506
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Now I have no bursters. Thanks, Rob.

507
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Why are you thanking me?

508
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Because you should give me more bursters.

509
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'll give you more bursters. It's fine. I got a ton of them yesterday, so it's fine.

510
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
At any rate, I'm also still playing idle pouring because of stupid, addictive reasons.

511
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And I started playing Pocket Camp again.

512
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Which reminds me, I should probably open up Pocket Camp and get stuff.

513
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But I didn't do it yesterday, so whatever.

514
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Well then, while you do that, we'll go on over to Loki and check out Loki's gaming week.

515
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I didn't play a whole lot this week. I mainly played just Pokemon Go while I'm doing other things.

516
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Because I always turn it on so that it automatically plays while I'm out and about.

517
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So that's what I did.

518
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I played that, and then I played a little...

519
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Was it H2 Overdrive?

520
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Arcade, the Hydro Thunder.

521
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah, H2 Overdrive is a sequel.

522
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So we played a little bit of that today.

523
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, that's about it, unfortunately.

524
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Didn't get to play a lot.

525
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh, a little bit of DDR.

526
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But I didn't stream a ton of it.

527
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm probably going to try to stream some more this week, though.

528
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I wanted to stream a lot more last week.

529
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But it just didn't work out because I have to cook things.

530
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And I always have to cook things when I get home.

531
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But this week, I didn't prepare for crap.

532
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So I don't have any meals to cook this week.

533
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So it'll be perfect.

534
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Alright, so look forward to that on your Twitch channel.

535
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yes.

536
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
My gaming week actually was not a lot of...

537
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I didn't really get into new stuff.

538
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So here's the weird thing about gaming week.

539
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I still was playing quite a bit of Pokemon Go.

540
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I feel like we're like the Pokemon Go talk channel or whatever.

541
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But I did play a bit for Community Day.

542
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Because Community Day was yesterday.

543
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yeah, 3 to 6.

544
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yeah, it was 3 to 6.

545
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Well, the funny thing was, OK, so that morning I was playing Ingress

546
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
because there was things that we were getting together and doing in Ingress.

547
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That's all I'm really going to say about that. We were having fun.

548
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
A social event, we'll say that.

549
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And then with Pokemon Go in the afternoon,

550
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I kind of went right into that.

551
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And so we went downtown, and by that point I was already kind of sick of staring at my phone.

552
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So I was like, alright, I'll just kind of play.

553
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So the very first Trico I tapped on, Shiny.

554
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And then we get to the park, get another Shiny pretty quick in about five minutes.

555
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I get a third Shiny by the time we walk over to the Rose Garden.

556
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So we're 15 minutes in, I have three Shinies.

557
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So I was like, alright, I got what I need.

558
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So I kind of closed my phone, put it in my pocket, and I turned on my Bluetooth catcher.

559
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And I was just like, I'm just going to catch a Bluetooth, whatever.

560
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So we just kind of, we walked around.

561
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I was more into the walking, I've been trying to get more in tune with fitness and things like that lately.

562
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So I was more into the walking, and seeing what Alan was up to, and cheering him on, and so forth.

563
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
By the time it was done, and we really, we kind of went to go eat at one point.

564
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
We just really took it easy, even though we were still down in the capital.

565
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We went to, you know, it's kind of where we always go is the capital park.

566
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I had 11 Shinies by the time it was done.

567
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I had none.

568
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
What? I'll give you one.

569
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I don't care.

570
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Loki, I have 11. Take a goddamn Shiny.

571
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Fine.

572
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Alright.

573
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Shiny what?

574
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Trico.

575
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'll take one.

576
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Okay, there you go.

577
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
If you don't take it, I can do one a day, because they're special trades.

578
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So yeah, so I have like 11.

579
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What am I going to do with that many?

580
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I don't know.

581
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Recycle them.

582
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'll give, yes, obviously other people don't have such great luck.

583
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But I always say that's what, like, I have a million Cyndaquil.

584
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I have a million, you know, some of the others.

585
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Now some I didn't get so lucky on.

586
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Like Charmander, I only have like the three.

587
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Bulbasaur, I was out of town when that happened, so I'm only, I only have two, so I don't really have enough of those.

588
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But you know, some of them I just barely skip by with three or four.

589
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But like, yeah, what am I going to do with 11 Shinies?

590
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And I always say, I'll trade the extra ones.

591
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And it's like, I never, it's like all those unknowns I'm sitting on.

592
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Never, I think being limited to one special trade a day kind of sucks.

593
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Because I can't really unload those as fast as I want to.

594
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So, anyway.

595
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Pat Deft asks, how many did Shane get?

596
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't know, sometimes he's, sometimes he's listening or watching, so if he's out there maybe he'll reveal himself and tell you.

597
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It was more than me.

598
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I think he said his husband got 12, and I think he said he got 15?

599
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
He'll correct me if I'm wrong.

600
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
But, yeah.

601
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So anyway, but here's the other thing.

602
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So I did play a console, here's the crazy thing.

603
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So you know I kind of got into Skyrim VR last week.

604
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
So I played a little more of that.

605
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah.

606
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And then I got to the point where I'm like, okay, this is fun and all, but I'm like, I don't, I don't know if I want to keep playing this in VR.

607
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I want to go back to the PC. You know, I haven't seen Skyrim on the PC in a long time, and I have a 4K monitor now.

608
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And I don't even have the Skyrim Special Edition, but I got like an HD texture pack at some point, I don't know.

609
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So I started playing Skyrim on the PC again.

610
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Well, the Special Edition, I think, didn't they give that to you for free if you had bought it?

611
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
If you had all the expansions, which I didn't.

612
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Oh, yeah.

613
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
No, they didn't give it to me for free. They gave it to Alan for free because he had all the expansions, but he had already played it a lot more.

614
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So I spent a lot of gaming time this week playing Skyrim, because I'll tell you what, in 4K, even on the regular version.

615
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yeah, I don't play the HD version either because half the mods don't have them.

616
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Well, it's not, well, it's not, yeah, I do use mods, especially like inventory mods.

617
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Very, I don't, I don't mod heavy it like you do.

618
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But like, I do run a few mods in the old one, but I also feel like maybe because it wasn't like optimized for like HD, I can actually play it in 4K.

619
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Because a lot of games, my video card isn't strong enough to actually support full 4K gameplay.

620
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But Skyrim is great and it's gorgeous.

621
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And so I've just been playing it on PC, like, ooh.

622
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So I got, you know, enough through the story where what I got to, well, I don't want to spoil the whole thing, but you know, there's dragons.

623
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So I fought the dragon, I got Lydia, and doing that thing where I got to go up to the top of the mountain. That's where I'm at right now.

624
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So I played a little bit. And then, of course, as I'm going up to the mountain, what happens?

625
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Ooh, cave! Ooh, giant! Ooh! You get distracted with everything.

626
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And that's, that's the Elder Scrolls experience, basically. So, yeah.

627
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Now we're in Blackreach.

628
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I've been spending a lot of my gaming week playing a game that's eight years old, but whatever, right?

629
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Skyrim was 2011, right? Oh, it's kind of a...

630
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It speaks to the longevity of the game design.

631
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh, no, for sure. For sure. I mean, hell, Skyrim just came out on Switch, what, a year ago?

632
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So, I mean, you know, there's still, there's still a lot of longevity in that game.

633
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But I am definitely looking forward to Elder Scrolls VI as well, that's for sure.

634
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So, anyway, that was my Game of Week. Mobile phone games in Skyrim.

635
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here.

636
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Let me just quickly say, though, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

637
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

638
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And, yeah, the next show we will not be here is Memorial Day weekend, but that's a long ways off.

639
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So, let's talk about some gaming news for now. Loki.

640
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So, they had this Nindies Nintendo Direct this week, and they announced a bunch of games that are coming out on the Switch.

641
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And some even were released that same day because that's something that they like to do.

642
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So, starting in order of when they're coming out, Blaster Master Zero part two, or number two, is coming out.

643
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Well, came out earlier, and I guess we'll see some of that later.

644
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yes, we're going to see some of that later in our break.

645
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:50,000
There's, was it Nuclear Throne is coming to the Switch, so that was also released as well.

646
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And then, in a few months here, they're going to be releasing Cuphead on the Switch, which was kind of interesting because that was pushed by Microsoft to try to put that there.

647
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So, that's April 18th. Katana Zero is coming April 18th. I think that's from Devolver Digital.

648
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And there's some more Vlambeer games, so Super Crate Box also coming out in April, and Ultra Bugs is another thing that they have coming out.

649
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There's a game called Darkwood, which is also coming to the Switch in May.

650
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
My friend Pedro is also coming out in June.

651
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And then, they have this one, which was kind of a release surprise here.

652
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So, from the makers of Crypt of the Necrodancer, they have a game called Cadence of Hyrule.

653
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Cadence, I think.

654
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The musical term, yes.

655
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Cadence of Hyrule, and it's basically Crypt of the Necrodancer in Hyrule.

656
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It looks like a mod for Crypt of the Necrodancer is what it looks like, but it's not a slam.

657
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I think a lot of people were like, whoa, cool. And yeah, I'm into it too.

658
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
One of the games they have, Neo Cab, which is going to be coming out this summer.

659
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,000
There's this game from Double Fine called Rad. It's an isometric 3D action RPG.

660
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And then, they've got a game called Swim Sanity.

661
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Bloodroots, Creature in the Well, which looked kind of cool.

662
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
This was a game that was like a pinball action game.

663
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So, the whole game is played like pinball almost, but it looked pretty cool.

664
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
They have the Stranger Things retro game that's coming out on July 4th, the same time as season 3,

665
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
which we've got a trailer for this week as well.

666
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Pine, Overland, and a game called The Red Lantern,

667
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
which is about a woman getting stranded in Alaska with her sled dogs.

668
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Did you mention Cuphead?

669
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes.

670
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Okay, I must have missed when you brought that up. Okay, that Cuphead thing.

671
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Okay, hold up though, because Cuphead, I mean, that's obviously, you know,

672
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
that's a game that's going to be great for the Switch,

673
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
but it also means that a lot of those Microsoft Nintendo things that have been rumors in previous episodes,

674
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
hold up, it's happening.gif, right?

675
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Because Cuphead is coming to the Switch,

676
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
which may indicate that some of these other things we've been hearing about could happen as well,

677
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
namely Ori and the Blind Forest and some of these other Microsoft things,

678
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
which is funny because I saw people on Twitter going,

679
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I predict that Ori and the Blind Forest is next.

680
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm like, yeah, because that's what all the rumors already said. Hello?

681
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But anyway, whatever.

682
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And the fact that maybe Xbox Game Pass, which that was kind of the big warning.

683
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I don't know how that would work though, but like, how does Hulu work?

684
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You know, I don't know. We'll see.

685
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But that's a little different. They're running on the actual hardware.

686
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yeah, you're not going to be dealt, but I mean, maybe like a streaming, like, you know.

687
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, whenever they talk about their streaming thing, which we still haven't heard about,

688
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and maybe we'll hear about later this year. Who knows?

689
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
VG Realness in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says the budding

690
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Microsoft Nintendo relationship is very interesting in it,

691
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
which is also kind of goes back to what we were talking about earlier about,

692
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
you know, the future of gaming is that maybe.

693
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh, my God. My God. What did they join forces?

694
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You got Microsoft with the back with the the tech.

695
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You've got Nintendo with the games. They could defeat everybody.

696
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I think there's a lot of fan wank that comes into situations like that.

697
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I mean, both of them are still in it to make profit, you know, for themselves.

698
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I don't think we're in a you know, when people say Microsoft should just buy Nintendo,

699
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
they forget how much money Nintendo has and they end up buying them.

700
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
They just team up. Yeah. I mean, a team up could be interesting,

701
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
but I just I don't I don't know how far that goes and where what.

702
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I mean, I guess Nintendo gets, you know, some more things on their switch platform

703
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and maybe Microsoft has an agreement. They're not going to address the portable market.

704
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And that's not something they're going into with, you know, the next Xbox.

705
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Nintendo probably knows. And this is this is fascinating to think about.

706
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Nintendo probably knows exactly what the next Xbox is for a lot of this to happen.

707
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
If we're going to go this far, I mean, Cuphead on Switch is one thing.

708
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But if we're going to go this far down to talking about, you know, a true like alliance

709
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
or whatever to dominate the gaming industry, if that's really where we're headed,

710
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
then wouldn't it be logical to know that Nintendo already knows what Microsoft's working on?

711
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And for them to agree to this, they know it's not portable.

712
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And it's not something that's going to step on the toes of the switch.

713
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Microsoft. Microsoft is not going to come out with an Xbox that pops off a dock and you can take with you.

714
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Nintendo would never have agreed to this whole thing if that's what Microsoft's doing.

715
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
We'll see. Oh, it's kind of, I don't know, interesting to me.

716
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:09,000
S.H.A. 100 Matt points out this is messing with everyone's Apple and Nintendo fan fix that people have been writing for decades.

717
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's in that same vein. It certainly is.

718
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Renji two to one in chat says something that wasn't brought up is Castle Crashers remastered on the switch.

719
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
That was the thing right out of this week. But that was also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.

720
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And it's also like, with all respect to Castle Crashers, that game's pretty old at this point.

721
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I mean, I say that and then I talk about how I played Skyrim all week.

722
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So, you know, an old game is still a good game.

723
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But I was just kind of like, I think I would have been more excited if it was a Castle Crashers sequel that was coming out to all these platforms.

724
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And maybe the first game with it or something, you know, just the fact that it's, oh, it's that same game again.

725
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And I'm not as excited about, but it's not like it was a bad game. So there is that for sure.

726
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Let's see. V.G. Realness says both companies have what the other needs.

727
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Nintendo needs better hardware and network infrastructure. Microsoft needs stronger Japanese presence. Interesting.

728
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
That's true. You know, we didn't bring up the Japanese presence part.

729
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But that is a very good way for Microsoft to shove their foot in the door in Japan is the Nintendo partnership.

730
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Fifth Dream Today says people still think Microsoft will make a handheld. People think a lot of things. Go onto Reddit or Twitter.

731
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
It's still out there, of course. So anyway, we will see what develops.

732
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
So what did you think, though, quickly before I move on to the next story?

733
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Was there any of those Nindies that really jumped out at you where you're like, oh, I got to get this?

734
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Blaster Master Zero 2 looks good. I still haven't played through Blaster Master Zero, the first one.

735
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I have it. I purchased it, but I haven't played through it. So I need to probably do that.

736
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
No, that's about it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really want to play through Cuphead again.

737
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I might pick up Cuphead because I'm just it's such a good game and I might be a sucker for it, especially with the portability and all that.

738
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Is your play through video? Was it that old school musical yet?

739
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You know what? No, I didn't pick that up. I really should know. You're right.

740
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So many so many games I need to catch up on. Yet here I am playing Skyrim from how long ago?

741
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I don't know. All right. It'll keep sucking you back in for hundreds of hours at a time.

742
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And that's money well spent, though. All right. Let's get into our next story, which has to do with a rumor from the past that's kind of come true,

743
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
because this is one of those rumors based on ratings in another country.

744
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And sure enough, those are usually the ones where it's like, yeah, this is going to happen.

745
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So Konami put out information this week that they are in celebration of their 50th anniversary doing some different collections.

746
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And the first one is the Konami Anniversary Collection Arcade Classics.

747
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So it's going to have eight arcade masterpieces, according to the list, from the 1980s.

748
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So here's what's in Konami's collection.

749
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
They've announced the list here because this is out on April 18th, which is a pretty big deal.

750
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And this is coming out on all the platforms. Right.

751
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I missed it. It's Switch for sure. Right. Was it PS4 and Xbox One as well?

752
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It's got to be. But it's digital. Right. Because it's like 20 bucks. Right.

753
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm pretty sure it's on all the all the major gaming platforms.

754
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah. It's PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.

755
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
OK, great. Oh, PC as well. Cool. All right.

756
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:38,000
All right. So anyway, in the arcade classics, Haunted Castle, which, if I'm not mistaken, was like Castlevania's kind of first game.

757
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Right. It was Haunted Castle. Probably an arcade game.

758
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah, it was. Or was it or am I mixing it up with Vampire Killer?

759
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
No, Haunted Castle was Castlevania.

760
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
OK. All right. Let's see. Typhoon or Ajax, which that one's not ringing a bell.

761
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I don't remember that one. Is that one that you recognized?

762
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Typhoon. No, she's just shaking. No, Nemesis or Nemesis.

763
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, well, of course, Nemesis is basically Gradius, Vulcan Venture, Gradius 2, Life Force or Salamander.

764
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That one has me excited for sure. Thunder Cross, Scramble and Twinbee.

765
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So those are the games that are going to be in the arcade collection, which is that's kind of neat.

766
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So. Oh, thank you, Dark Tetsuya. That's why it's throwing me off.

767
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Haunted Castle was the arcade. Vampire Killer was the MSX version.

768
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
OK, thank you. All right.

769
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Now, speaking of Vampire Killer and Castlevania, the other collection they announced, one of the other two,

770
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
was a Castlevania anniversary collection for early summer 2019.

771
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
There will be eight games in this collection, two. We only know four of them.

772
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
The original Castlevania for NES, Castlevania 3, Castlevania 2, Belmont's Revenge.

773
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,000
That's the Game Boy one, not Simon's Quest, which is notably missing, at least so far,

774
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
because there's also four games we don't know yet.

775
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And then Super Castlevania 4 is the other entry here.

776
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
We don't know what the other four games are. We don't know if it's Simon Quest.

777
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
We don't know if it's, you know, Symphony of the Night or some of the 3DS games or what.

778
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So it's to be determined still on what that could contain.

779
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But that could be interesting, especially for 20 bucks.

780
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And then lastly, a Contra anniversary collection.

781
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Now, I would think there's only so many games they can pick from for this,

782
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
because I don't think Contra's had as many games as Castlevania. Really?

783
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
All right. If you say so.

784
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And some weren't even Contras originally.

785
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Maybe that's what it is.

786
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And it's one of those things where it's like these games that were kind of like derivatives of Contra

787
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
are probably going to be included.

788
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But the original list is Contra, the arcade version, not the NES version.

789
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
They really are the same thing.

790
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's just the arcade version didn't have the 30 lives code.

791
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But I think Konami would be stupid not to put a throwback

792
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
where you would just unlock 30 lives in the arcade version by putting in the Konami code.

793
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Super Contra, also the arcade version.

794
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Super C, which was the 1990 NES one.

795
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And then Contra 3, the Alien Wars, the pretty sweet Super Nintendo version of the game.

796
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Those are the four that they've announced for the Contra collection.

797
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So again, four more to be determined.

798
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We have noticed the lack of Contra hardcore in all the Genesis ones.

799
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So far, but they could be some of the Secret Four that are in there.

800
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So we'll see.

801
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But what do you guys think so far?

802
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I mean, I know Konami's gotten a lot of shit lately and rightfully so,

803
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
but as far as like retro throwbacks and so forth,

804
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
this seems like I think what a lot of people would be interested in.

805
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I know I'm probably going to be a sucker for that Castlevania collection, that's for sure.

806
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I wish the arcade collection, some of those...

807
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I mean, I might get it just for Gradius and Life Force, honestly.

808
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Where's my throwback Bomani arcade collection?

809
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
It's doing a presidential move.

810
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Distracting us from the real issues with, you know, little tidbits.

811
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yes. But, well, I mean, if these sell well, maybe there will be more.

812
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
You know, like Beatmania, popin' music.

813
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Do you know how much I would love like a five-key Beatmania collection,

814
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,000
but also I just feel like it's so niche that like we're asking for it.

815
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Some of our listeners that date, you know, to the music game days

816
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and our fans and that stuff are asking for it too.

817
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Put it only on PC.

818
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Enough people asking for it? I don't know.

819
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I would love it, but I just don't, I don't, I don't totally see it happening,

820
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
but we'll see. You never know. You never know.

821
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I have a collection.

822
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Tiger Claw and Chat says what this Konami collection needs

823
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
is the two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games and Simpsons and Sunset Riders.

824
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I only need the arcade ones for sure.

825
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Well, Ninja Turtles and Simpsons, that's going to be very hard

826
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
with the licensing and all that stuff.

827
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So that's why those got pulled off of the other digital storefronts.

828
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Right. But Sunset Riders is certainly a realistic prediction for maybe the future.

829
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Like if, if a second collection is released, but, uh, yeah, we'll, we'll see.

830
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Honestly, for 20 bucks, I'll probably pick it up,

831
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
but I love that it's on PC as well.

832
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But then, oh, do I get it on PC because it's where I play a lot of stuff

833
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
and like have really good graphics and all that,

834
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
or do I get it on Switch so I can be portable?

835
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Ah, the struggle.

836
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I don't know what to do.

837
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
All right. Wait for the sales.

838
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Yeah, I guess, I guess. All right, let's move on.

839
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

840
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Well, I have some news about Mortal Kombat 11, which I think is pretty neat.

841
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Um, but basically, now we all know what a beautiful thing the original Mortal Kombat movie was.

842
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It was one of the first video game movies done right.

843
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Well, um, the guy who played Shang Tsung, who is, uh,

844
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Kari, uh, Hiroyuki Tagawa, um, is coming into Mortal Kombat 11

845
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
and lending his likeness to Shang Tsung in the game.

846
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And he will be the first character to be downloadable content for the game.

847
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
He's also the, uh, guide for the Crypt, Mortal Kombat 11's campaign style mode

848
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
that gives you challenges and unlockables.

849
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Um, also, um, when he was unveiled, it was our first look at the Crypt

850
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
at Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo, C2E2.

851
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Um, there actually is a clip of that out and about.

852
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Also, there's a confirmation of a return of Noob Saibot.

853
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And I think in the Noob Saibot clip, there was also Jackie was in there as well.

854
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Oh no, there was Kotal Kahn. There was like a separate, I think a separate thing. But anyway.

855
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
But yeah, but there's some cool stuff. I mean, we're getting some of our little classics back.

856
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Allen always makes it a point. You know Allen really likes Mortal Kombat games, right?

857
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And you all know where I'm at with these.

858
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Where it's like, I love the old Mortal Kombat games with the new ones.

859
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
They're, they're like kind of like ultra violent for me. I don't know. It's a bit much.

860
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I kind of prefer Injustice as far as like the NetherRealm games go.

861
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,000
But, um, Allen makes it a point when they go, when like, oh, look, uh, there's a Noob Saibot Fatality.

862
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
You want to see it? You should see it. Let's see.

863
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And it holds the phone in front of my face. So I have to watch it.

864
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And I'm just like, this is, this is, y'all, y'all.

865
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
You've turned into your mom.

866
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I know I have. It's crazy. But seriously, like, did you see that Noob Saibot Fatality?

867
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
What the hell? That's, who thinks of that?

868
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I don't think I saw it. Ew. Anyway.

869
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So what was it in graphic detail?

870
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I don't know. He fricking like pulls out the intestines and then like uses that to like go inside the body and then like jump out of the mouth.

871
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Like his hands like go to the mouth and like rips the head. It was disgusting.

872
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And then it's also impossible.

873
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Does he go happy birthday?

874
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
At the end?

875
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I thought you were telling me he was going to rip out.

876
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I'd play that game.

877
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I was thinking you were going to tell me he's taking out the guts and macrame with them.

878
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And so he gets a nice hanging plant.

879
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I like the happy birthday.

880
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I'm still imagining the macrame like with the head is the plant in the middle and have it swinging like in the breeze on a porch.

881
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I want to see like, I don't know if they do this in games.

882
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Sorry, real quick. With these really gross fatalities,

883
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I think it does say something that this guy is still lending his likeness to the game, knowing that it's going to be ripped apart in hideous pieces.

884
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
That's that's a strong actor willing to do this as an added bonus.

885
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
What are you talking about?

886
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Maybe he's just like, leave the head intact.

887
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Well, that you can't do that.

888
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Not if you could do a fatality on him anyway.

889
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh, I was just saying, you know how they do like the whole like X-ray things when you're like breaking bones and stuff like that.

890
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And it gets really gross and up close.

891
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I want to see them do that for friendships, but like maybe something a little bit differently, you know, baking a cake.

892
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And I don't know what they do. They still leave friendships in.

893
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I feel like Mortal Kombat nine had them.

894
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I don't remember X because I didn't play enough of it because I was like, you know, I just think it'd be funny.

895
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
The parody that probably somebody in shadow probably yell out where the friendship thing is at.

896
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But yeah, when you are bad balladys. Yes.

897
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
They saw the balladys.

898
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I don't know if the balladys have been in the game in a while.

899
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I don't know. I think that's maybe that was in nine to nine was really like a throwback to the classic like Mortal Kombat games.

900
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Those are the last one that I kind of played, to be honest.

901
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I do hope they find a way to work in with the Shang Tsung actor.

902
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I really hope they do find find a way to get him to actually do the your soul is mine.

903
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
That whole thing like for the movies that has to be there.

904
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Like, please tell me they got him to do that.

905
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Like, you know, their little walk ins when they're all bad ass when they walk into the arena.

906
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I really hope he does that. Your soul is mine with the, you know, big eyes and all that, like in the movie.

907
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So, yeah, the hilarious. So let's see.

908
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Comments and chat as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Jax still hasn't been announced.

909
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
There's still time, right? They didn't announce Jackie was she was hers.

910
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
The one I saw another fatality because, again, Alan makes me watch them all because he's sick.

911
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
There's one where, like, they're putting up fake walls like a laser wall or something.

912
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And like the laser wall is totally splits this guy in half.

913
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And I was like, this is great. I think that was Jackie.

914
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Didn't I steal that like from the first Resident Evil movie or something?

915
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I think, well, but you could also say Resident Evil stole it from Cube.

916
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So hard to say.

917
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Cube was a good movie.

918
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You know what's weird? As much as I hate gore and violence and all that stuff.

919
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I actually thought Cube was a great movie, too.

920
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I really liked Hypercube better, though.

921
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I never saw the sequels. You know that?

922
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Actually, the reason I liked it better is because it does like it.

923
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Hypercube is another word for a tesseract, which is a fourth dimensional cube.

924
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
No, I heard like the sequels get super nerdy with the math.

925
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
The third one is shitty. The third one is absolute shit.

926
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Were there four or three?

927
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
There was Cube, Hypercube and Cube Zero.

928
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So these are like, if you've never heard of these movies like Cube,

929
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
they're like super like cold, like low budget.

930
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
The first one was really low budget.

931
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
They were Canadian films.

932
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I thought, well, Nicole DeBoer is in the first one.

933
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I'm almost positive the first one's a Canadian film.

934
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Yeah.

935
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Yeah. And so I think it had a limited release here.

936
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
If anyone doesn't recognize that name, she was Ezri Dax in Deep Space Night.

937
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yeah. Yeah.

938
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
She's also like one of the big main characters in it, too.

939
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
But yeah, it was basically these people are put in like this shifting room cube

940
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
and they had to figure out how to find the exit.

941
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But the rooms are shifting.

942
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Cube two is when it's also shifting in time.

943
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Cube would have made a great video game.

944
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I was just thinking that.

945
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm surprised they never did that.

946
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I don't think I can eat Indian food anymore.

947
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It could have been on the GameCube.

948
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And if Cube came out in this day and age, it would be an escape room.

949
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Right.

950
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Because you know how like those those escape rooms are huge and everywhere,

951
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
like cube is an escape.

952
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
That would have been a thing.

953
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
But I think the movie's a little old now at this point.

954
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Anyway, everyone should still watch it.

955
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It's it's a classic.

956
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
See, it's not really that gross either.

957
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
See a Tiberian chat commenting on as I'm talking about Jackie Bridges.

958
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Fatality is asking, when do we get the two to seven crossover?

959
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I want to see Jackie Harry.

960
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I want to see Jackie.

961
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Oh, God.

962
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Just think.

963
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Think one of those actresses from two to seven just won an Oscar.

964
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Think about that for a minute.

965
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Anyway, moving on.

966
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Let's move on.

967
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Dr.

968
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Sue is saying, isn't there already an escape room horror movie?

969
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yes, but I'm talking about the other way around.

970
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Like if Cube was a movie that came out today,

971
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
they do an escape room based on Cube, I think is a good concept.

972
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
That would be crazy, though, because I mean, it's not feasible.

973
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's true.

974
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I know.

975
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I keep but they should do a game.

976
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I keep seeing commercials on Facebook for a saw themed escape room in Vegas.

977
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And I'm like, nope, nope.

978
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
The fuck out of there.

979
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Nope.

980
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
The fuck out of that block ad report ad numbers.

981
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
But I definitely was like, I'm not interested in this.

982
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Oh, I'm blocking ads left and right, though.

983
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But still.

984
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
All right.

985
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And I'm going to actually officially say I would put this as a dream game.

986
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
They do a cube video game.

987
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
No, I'll be rad.

988
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'll be glad.

989
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Pissal Blanca says there is a game based on Cube.

990
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Ugh, what's it called?

991
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But Pissal Blanca, there certainly wasn't one based on the movie,

992
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
but maybe it's inspired by Cube.

993
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
That I could see.

994
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
There probably is a game out there.

995
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And this is not intelligent Cube either.

996
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
That is very different.

997
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I'm just going to say right now, everyone needs to watch Cube.

998
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And also, one last thing.

999
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Someone recreated the end of Hypercube in Unreal.

1000
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Are they on streaming service?

1001
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I take that back.

1002
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
They did it as a Quake mod.

1003
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Is that movie on streaming services and stuff?

1004
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm sure it is, but I own, like, old-ass DVDs of them.

1005
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Yeah, I know, I know.

1006
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Somebody else in Chat has seen it.

1007
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Only Sonic in Chat says Cube was cool.

1008
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Somebody else knows what we're talking about.

1009
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
That's good.

1010
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And Tigerclaw found the IMDB, so that's good.

1011
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
All right.

1012
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Let's move on and talk about some more gaming news,

1013
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
because we're running a little long tonight, but that's okay.

1014
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
We're having good discussions.

1015
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Let's go, Loki.

1016
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I was just looking for Cube, the video game.

1017
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
They have a game on Steam called Half Dead

1018
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
that people are comparing to Cube,

1019
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
because you just survive through rooms of traps,

1020
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
so that might be something they'll look up.

1021
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Anyways, speaking of Steam, though,

1022
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
it's getting an overhaul, especially the libraries.

1023
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
So they had some screenshots put up

1024
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and a bunch of information coming out during GDC

1025
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
talking about how they're going to overhaul the Steam library page,

1026
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
and yes, it looks amazing.

1027
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
They've got basically different sections,

1028
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
like, for example, parts.

1029
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Not everybody's a fan.

1030
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I've been looking on Twitter.

1031
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Some people are like, what's this, you know?

1032
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I think it looks cool.

1033
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I mean, they have different games that have updates recently,

1034
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
games you have completed.

1035
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Well, that's going to be a very small list for me.

1036
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
They should have games I haven't played yet.

1037
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That's going to be all of it.

1038
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
But yeah, they've seen...

1039
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It should feature in the library very big.

1040
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Here's a game that you paid money for,

1041
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
but you still haven't touched.

1042
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Feature of the day.

1043
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yes.

1044
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But basically, they have a carousel of dedicated games and updates.

1045
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
They've got different things that show different friends' activities.

1046
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,000
It almost looks a little bit like the PlayStation events page.

1047
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
What do they call that?

1048
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
That social media thing that they have on the PlayStation 4

1049
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
that's like kind of whatever.

1050
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
That shows your friends' activities and stuff.

1051
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1052
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I don't know the branded name of that, though.

1053
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
The feed or...

1054
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Yeah, I think it's something like PlayStation feed or something.

1055
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Anyways, whatever that is.

1056
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
But they're going to have something that shows what your friends are playing,

1057
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
the type of stuff.

1058
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So that's kind of cool.

1059
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah, and then they have different events,

1060
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
so you can actually see what's coming up,

1061
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
like different tournaments and online games.

1062
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Like free weekend of DLC or something.

1063
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, let's be honest.

1064
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I think Steam could use a little bit of a refresh.

1065
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I mean, so I'm down.

1066
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Isn't that funny?

1067
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Right around this time where we talk a lot about the Epic Game Store

1068
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
and we talk about good old games

1069
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
and we talk about all the competition out,

1070
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Humble Bundle and all the competition out there,

1071
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
isn't it funny that Steam is suddenly kind of feeling the need to refresh

1072
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and tidy up house a little bit?

1073
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
It's funny, though,

1074
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
it's like actually looking at the layout that they have

1075
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
kind of reminds me of the Epic Game Store a bit.

1076
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
A little bit.

1077
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Actually, speaking of game stores, though,

1078
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
this came across my Twitter feed this week,

1079
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
and I didn't really realize this.

1080
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Did you notice Discord's game store is gone?

1081
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
It was quietly removed from the app,

1082
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
and it's been replaced with a section that focuses on that Nitro thing

1083
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
that they sell.

1084
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So not so much the piece by piece game store things,

1085
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
but the subscription service, basically.

1086
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot all about it.

1087
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Which is basically a Discord's paid version,

1088
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
you know, and that whole thing, right?

1089
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah.

1090
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Isn't that interesting?

1091
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Discord kind of quietly slipped out the back door

1092
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
on all those games things,

1093
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
but they, you know, as much as,

1094
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and I still think, and I've said this on the show before,

1095
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I think Discord is a pretty brilliant gaming company

1096
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and the way that they got themselves on all your computers

1097
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and all your mobile phones and all that stuff,

1098
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I think it's pretty brilliant what they did,

1099
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
and I'm kind of surprised to hear that the store has exited as a result,

1100
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
but it did come out at kind of like exactly the wrong moment

1101
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
when all of a sudden now Epic Games Store comes in and says,

1102
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
oh, no, by the way, the price cut we're given is, you know,

1103
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
so it's almost like Discord probably, in a weird way,

1104
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
had a problem standing out with that.

1105
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So I don't know.

1106
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
So anyway, Pixel Pacas also says this is kind of a change here.

1107
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
If you have a, and I remember reading about this in the press release too,

1108
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Pixel Pacas says if you have a verified Discord server,

1109
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
then you can sell your game on the server,

1110
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
and so that's pretty clever too because, you know,

1111
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
there's all these Discords out there.

1112
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
There's obviously a cheap plug for the VOG Network Discord

1113
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
at vognetwork.com slash Discord where we talk about the shows,

1114
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
and a lot of people drop topics in the OLR chat room,

1115
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
and I know for Bobby's chat room too, we use them.

1116
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
We absolutely use them on the show,

1117
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
and I love some of the discussion that happens on there too

1118
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
because some of the people who can't listen live

1119
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
will kind of go into like a long form kind of feedback,

1120
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
and I love reading it.

1121
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Even if I don't always respond to it directly,

1122
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I just, you know, love that it's there.

1123
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So anyway, cheap plug for our own Discord,

1124
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
but game makers all have their own Discord too,

1125
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
so wouldn't it be something if like you were to join the Discord for,

1126
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
you know, Indie Adventure 11 or whatever game is under development,

1127
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
and then when the game's ready to go on sale,

1128
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
oh, here's in our Discord because we're a premium.

1129
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You can click right here and get the game right now.

1130
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So it's not to say that the store is gone, gone,

1131
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
but it's not like a traditional store at this point anymore.

1132
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
So anyway, let's move on.

1133
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Let's talk.

1134
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Maybe let's not move on for a minute because I need a drink. Sorry.

1135
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Oh, Rob.

1136
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Well, I did discover that I apparently can't eat Indian food like I used to,

1137
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
but I'd be happy to share with anybody else who wants some.

1138
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Would you like your sinuses blown wide open?

1139
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I got to wait for it. Did you get really spicy?

1140
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It's not really spicy, but spicy to me.

1141
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I was going to say, can't you not like do spicy?

1142
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I can only have like some pepper stuff.

1143
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
It's not to where I'm going to need any Benadryl yet.

1144
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Okay, gotcha.

1145
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
For those who don't know, Jamie has a pepper allergy.

1146
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
That's right. All right. Anyway, I'm ready. Sorry.

1147
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I've rinsed my mouth with water, and I'm ready to talk again.

1148
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Hopefully. Oh, girl. I know. Right.

1149
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
All right. Anyway, let's talk about Nintendo's Labo

1150
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
and the next Labo kit that they've announced, which is Labo VR.

1151
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Remember a puppy came back? We could call him Black Labo.

1152
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I would love from way back in the day.

1153
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
God, what was the last time he was on the show?

1154
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I wish puppy would come back.

1155
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Ten years ago was probably last time.

1156
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Everyone who knows puppy told him to come back.

1157
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
You know, he's got like a kid now. That kid's probably like five years old.

1158
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
It's perfect time to get his kid introduced to our podcast.

1159
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
We got to recruit. We got to recruit still for people.

1160
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Get him young.

1161
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,000
We got to recruit for people to co-host the show with Josh and Julian.

1162
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Julian. So we still got to get a third host somewhere.

1163
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Julian's going to be 12 next month.

1164
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Oh, my God. You got to be kidding me. 12?

1165
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
12.

1166
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
How old was he when he was on the show? Like nine?

1167
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
It was a while ago.

1168
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
He was like 10.

1169
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Was he? All right. Anyway. Anyway, back to Labo.

1170
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
The next kit for Nintendo Labo is a VR kit.

1171
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And so, of course, a lot of people went, oh, my gosh.

1172
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Nintendo is taking on Oculus Rift.

1173
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
No, Nintendo is not taking on Oculus Rift.

1174
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
This is not playing Breath of the Wild in VR.

1175
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
In fact, Nintendo actually has put out a video that's really demonstrated

1176
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
some of the things that they're doing in their Labo VR kit.

1177
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
And I got to say, it's pretty like the amount, the depth,

1178
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
and the amount of stuff they're doing.

1179
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
If it's like a mini game collection, there's a lot of freaking mini games in it.

1180
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
So like there's a thing where you can build like a blaster

1181
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
and there's like a blaster little mini game that you can play.

1182
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But there were some other cool little things, too, like a 3D paint.

1183
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So it's not Mario Paint.

1184
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I don't know why they didn't brand it Mario Paint.

1185
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
That would have been...

1186
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It looks like an elephant.

1187
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
With that elephant thing, that was like the painting thing, though, right?

1188
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That's what's so confusing because it's like an elephant thing.

1189
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I also feel like it's a missed opportunity for Mario Paint 3D, but that's all right.

1190
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
But I mean, it was like a neat concept.

1191
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
You know, just the idea of like painting in the 3D space.

1192
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Anyway, so here it is. Here it is.

1193
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Really, the VR is like a plastic goggle thing that just goes on top of your Switch.

1194
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And it's never going to be like the Oculus.

1195
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It isn't strapped to your head.

1196
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
There's no strap to keep it there, but you have to hold it to your head.

1197
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I get why they're doing that, because they can do the math with the two controllers

1198
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
with the angles and stuff, since it can tell, based on the angles of the two controllers,

1199
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
where it is in 3D space, because there's no real way to track it.

1200
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But it's still weird.

1201
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I'm looking in chat over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network,

1202
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
and I see they're talking a little bit about some of the...

1203
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Okay, so Bobby says, I can explain the elephant.

1204
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
It's using infrared stickers to mimic 6DOF controllers,

1205
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
like the Vive controllers or Oculus Touch controllers.

1206
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
The infrared stickers are on the headset of the elephant.

1207
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I mean, it's cool, but it's also the way we expected Nintendo to get into VR in some ways.

1208
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Although, I've got to say, because there's a whole video.

1209
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
There's a 10-minute video you can watch out there about LaboVR,

1210
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
and you can see all the things, because they show all these different experiences,

1211
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
and then they go, and there's 64 more that are just for the goggles.

1212
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And it's like, jeez.

1213
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
They're not all full-featured games.

1214
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Some of them are just like, look in this fish thing.

1215
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But you've got to wonder, did Nintendo start to go down this path of VR,

1216
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
and these were all the concept things they built,

1217
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
and then they were like, eh, maybe not.

1218
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And so they repackaged it into this, because you know Nintendo is never going to be one

1219
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
to throw something away completely, right?

1220
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:59,000
They're going to repackage it, just like the Wii U, the Miyamoto experience,

1221
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
they repackaged it into a Star Fox spin-off, right? Remember that?

1222
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yeah, I know. You're Project Guard.

1223
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah. They ended up making a Star Fox spin-off out of it.

1224
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
So it's like, you almost wonder, was this all made originally with Labo in mind,

1225
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
or was this kind of like the whole, this is what we're going to do with it?

1226
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I don't know. It's kind of interesting to think about where Nintendo's brain might have been with this.

1227
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,000
But that all being said, I think it'll do pretty good.

1228
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I think it'll be the type of thing, even though it's out kind of early,

1229
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I think especially for that younger audience.

1230
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I don't know if you, me, Jamie, I don't know if we would be at the start of the line to get this sort of thing,

1231
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:46,000
but I think for the younger kids, the teens and the tweens, this is going to be right up their alley.

1232
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
If I was 12 and gaming right now, I'd fucking want this. You know what I mean?

1233
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah.

1234
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
But don't be under seven years old, because there's all sorts of health warnings.

1235
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Put all that aside, like this is pretty, and it's, you know,

1236
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
what you learn from the experience of building it and all that stuff as well is an important part of it.

1237
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Yeah, the thing that sucks is, I bet this would be pretty hard to stream this.

1238
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Bobby in chat says, I'm at the start of the line getting it.

1239
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Yeah, but you're a VR enthusiast and it's a little different. It's to be expected.

1240
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So I think it's, I think it's a logical step for how Nintendo goes into the VR.

1241
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
They can kind of put one foot in the pool and be like, okay, that was nice.

1242
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And then go back to do with what they were doing.

1243
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1244
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Well, who remembers a particular game where you took, holy crap, did I just lose?

1245
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I lost my story.

1246
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
I don't remember a game where you took a holy crap.

1247
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
That was in.

1248
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
There was, try not to, was it?

1249
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Don't shit your pants.

1250
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Don't shit your pants. I remember that.

1251
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Anyway, um, where you took a manual, you dipped it in water or a letter,

1252
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and you would get a code on it that you would put in after you submerged your submarine.

1253
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Although, in retrospect, I wonder how they would have gotten it out,

1254
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
gotten the letter out of the submarine in the game to then get it back to get the code,

1255
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
because that would depressurize the submarine and everyone would die.

1256
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
But I'm talking about Star Tropics.

1257
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I was like, you are going to tell the kids the Children's Z is what game we're talking about, right?

1258
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Okay, yes, Star Tropics.

1259
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Well, Star Tropics is going to be on the Switch, but guess what is missing?

1260
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
The letter.

1261
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Yeah.

1262
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
That has the thing.

1263
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It didn't work out well for me when I was, you know, when I originally got this game,

1264
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
because I bought it used a long time ago and it didn't have the letter.

1265
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I had to call it 800 numbers.

1266
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Well, some people think that's why Nintendo did this, because y'all probably wouldn't remember,

1267
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,000
but back in the day, back in my day, when these video game rentals,

1268
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
game companies were really pissed about video game rentals,

1269
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
because they're like, it's preventing people from dropping money on the game.

1270
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
They beat the games. They never buy it.

1271
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And they don't get to see those returns on the rentals.

1272
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So the gaming industry hated the rental.

1273
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
They probably still do, but it's probably just not as big of a deal as it used to be.

1274
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Now they have, you know, licensing deals with rental companies.

1275
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
That's true.

1276
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Some say that DLC online pass, the EA did. Remember that?

1277
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
That was the used game market and all that.

1278
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But anyway, this was Nintendo's way of kind of combating that.

1279
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Back in the day, it was like, oh, you don't get past a certain point without a special code

1280
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
that's only with new copies of the game.

1281
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Yeah.

1282
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
But at any rate, the manual is not going to be there.

1283
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Nobody said anything about the manual being there. It's not there.

1284
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Of course, we do have the internet today.

1285
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
They're just at the same time, Nintendo themselves aren't really...

1286
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
They're not providing the code.

1287
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Well, I'm really surprised they didn't just put it in the description.

1288
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Like, there's little descriptions.

1289
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Well, they had, in the Wii U version, they had the whole manual, like the digital manuals,

1290
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
and you could actually, it did a little animation where it dips it in the water and all that,

1291
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
but why couldn't they just port that over?

1292
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Because they...

1293
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Reasons.

1294
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
It's not like they're...

1295
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Because they half-assed it, is what they did.

1296
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Well...

1297
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
And spoiler, the code is 747.

1298
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Yes, if you need it, the code is 747, like an airplane, 747.

1299
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Even though you're in a submarine.

1300
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yes.

1301
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So, whatever.

1302
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
But you'd think they would just put that in the description or something.

1303
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
This is weird.

1304
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Anyway, the point in the game is when Babu, who is the uncle's assistant,

1305
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
is possessed and says,

1306
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Evil aliens from a distant planet, tell my nephew to use code 1776.

1307
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Tell Mike to dip my letter in water.

1308
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
You know, StarTropics was a really unique kind of game.

1309
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
If you haven't played StarTropics, you really should.

1310
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It was lateness.

1311
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
It was lateness.

1312
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Well, you know what's funny?

1313
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
The Super Famicom had already been out in Japan for a few weeks when this game released.

1314
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I think StarTropics was too late for me.

1315
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I think I moved on to the Super Nintendo by then.

1316
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I think people did, but some people forget.

1317
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Did you guys remember? There was a StarTropics 2.

1318
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Zoda's Revenge.

1319
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Zoda's Revenge, yeah.

1320
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And you want to talk about a game, because Zoda's Revenge, if I'm not mistaken,

1321
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
was the next to last NES game, the last being Warriors Woods,

1322
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
that Nintendo did, period, for the NES.

1323
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Like, Zoda's Revenge was next to last.

1324
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That was very late in the cycle.

1325
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
But if you haven't played the original StarTropics, it's a good, it's neat.

1326
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yeah, I've actually beaten that game.

1327
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
It mixes elements of, like, Zelda.

1328
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Here's the other fascinating thing, though, you might not have known about that game.

1329
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Because, you know, on the Switch Online right now,

1330
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
we got StarTropics and Kid Icarus, right?

1331
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And then, over in Japan, they got Kid Icarus,

1332
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
and they got their special Japanese-only game.

1333
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I don't remember if this was the month that the Sumo Wrestling game came out.

1334
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
But they got some Japanese-only thing that was never here.

1335
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
But they didn't get StarTropics in Japan.

1336
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
They got Fire Emblem, which we never got here, right?

1337
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Why didn't Japan get StarTropics?

1338
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It was never released in Japan.

1339
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Even though StarTropics was developed in Japan,

1340
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
it was this rare product of a company that said,

1341
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:00,000
we're going to develop a game here for the audience over here in the States.

1342
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And so, StarTropics was developed in Japan for an American audience.

1343
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And that's why that game is kind of interesting.

1344
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And UK. I believe the first StarTropics was in the UK.

1345
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I don't think the sequel ever was.

1346
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I think Zelda's Revenge, and I think I maybe played Zelda's Revenge once,

1347
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
but I don't remember it.

1348
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I want to say, Zelda's Revenge tried to teach you history or something.

1349
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It had a lot of historical stuff that was kind of built into it.

1350
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It was learning. I don't want to do any of that.

1351
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Which is why it didn't sell.

1352
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So, anyway.

1353
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Murica.

1354
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Yeah.

1355
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
S2100 Matt in chat says,

1356
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I think Rob needs to do a stream playing StarTropics.

1357
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Be careful what you ask for.

1358
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Bob Coffee brings up Like Secret of Evermore.

1359
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Close.

1360
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Secret of Evermore, remember, there was a Square USA for a hot minute.

1361
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I think it was in the Seattle area, right?

1362
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
So, there was a Square USA for a hot minute,

1363
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and Secret of Evermore was like the game that they produced.

1364
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
So, it was still like a Japanese company,

1365
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
but with a US office.

1366
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
This was years before they ever had like Eidos or things like that,

1367
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
you know, and that whole thing.

1368
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
So, a little bit different, but like,

1369
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I see where you're going with that.

1370
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Which, then the interesting thing about Secret of Evermore is that was,

1371
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
oh God, what's that composer?

1372
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Sulay? Jeremy?

1373
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Is that his name?

1374
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Who did Skyrim and Oblivion.

1375
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Does all the Guild Wars.

1376
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
He does a lot of great soundtracks.

1377
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That was like, he was probably a young guy when he did that.

1378
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Yeah, Jeremy Sulay.

1379
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Thank you.

1380
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Okay, I knew it was like, yeah, he was on Secret of Evermore.

1381
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Random.

1382
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Go Fig.

1383
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Weird ass fact, but yeah.

1384
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
So, it was developed here in America.

1385
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
It was the first game that brought us that guy

1386
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
who still does a lot of these, you know,

1387
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
everybody knows the Skyrim stuff, right?

1388
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Dovahkin. Dovahkin. Dovahkin.

1389
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Right, that whole thing, right?

1390
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
So, that was his first game.

1391
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
So, there you go.

1392
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Anyway, actdeftinchat says,

1393
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
here, there, everywhere, indeed.

1394
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
All right.

1395
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And we are going here, here, there, everywhere.

1396
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Let's go to another story from Loki.

1397
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
All right.

1398
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So, this is pretty awesome.

1399
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So, they announced, they were showing this off at GDC.

1400
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I want to say that this was a Kickstarter one time,

1401
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,000
but this device called the NES, the NES Maker.

1402
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
So, you know, you may have your Mario Makers and stuff,

1403
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
but this actually makes NES games.

1404
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Mentos, the NES Maker.

1405
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And it's coming from, what was it?

1406
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
It's coming from the 8-bit, or,

1407
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
what was it, the group that did the 8-bit Heroes film,

1408
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
in which they made a game called Mystic Searches,

1409
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
which is an NES game.

1410
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And so, they released, basically, their tool set

1411
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
to make these games.

1412
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
And so, it is, it's very much,

1413
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
you can make stuff without any programming.

1414
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
You can make your own NES cartridges

1415
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
and actually play them on an NES,

1416
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
which is pretty awesome.

1417
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
So, if this is something you're interested in,

1418
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
you check it out at www.thenew8bitheroes.com,

1419
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and they sell, you can download the software,

1420
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
you have to buy the activation code for it,

1421
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
and then they also sell the flashers and stuff.

1422
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Plus, there's dozens of tutorials on how to do everything.

1423
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
This is hot.

1424
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I'm into this now.

1425
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Loki, you're the one that, like, tries to make games.

1426
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
You don't ever finish, but, you know,

1427
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
it's a long-running joke here on the show.

1428
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Surely, this looks up your alley.

1429
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Are you gonna try to make a game in NES Maker?

1430
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It looks interesting.

1431
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I'd be interested to see what it can do.

1432
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
But, yeah, I mean, it looks pretty cool.

1433
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I don't have an NES to play games on, so, I don't know.

1434
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I have three.

1435
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I mean, I could play them in an emulator.

1436
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I know so many people just do emulator these days.

1437
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Well, I was gonna say you could probably borrow a NES.

1438
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Throw it on my NES, or Super NES Classic.

1439
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Could I take the ROM that I make in NES Maker,

1440
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
burn it to a Dreamcast disc with the NES emulator on Dreamcast,

1441
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
and play my NES Maker game on the Dreamcast?

1442
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Probably.

1443
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yes.

1444
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Fuck yeah, how meta.

1445
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And then you could also, like, you know,

1446
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
put it on the SNES Classic or an NES Classic.

1447
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
You can flash it to those.

1448
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Oh, an NES Classic, but it's all games I made up.

1449
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
That'd be cool.

1450
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I like that.

1451
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
It's very cool.

1452
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
We'll call it the Rob ES.

1453
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Anyway, some comments in our...

1454
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
The Rob Entertainment System.

1455
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Some comments, not to be confused with the robot, right?

1456
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Some comments in our Twitch over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1457
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Again, where we do tape live on Sunday nights.

1458
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

1459
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
If you can't finish a game in Unity,

1460
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
you won't be able to finish a game in NES Maker.

1461
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I call shade.

1462
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Although, he's right.

1463
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
It is true.

1464
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It is more...

1465
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
That's a lie.

1466
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I don't find it.

1467
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
It is true.

1468
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I mean, it is, um, it is more restricting to build something in it for an NES cartridge

1469
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
because they have a lot of limitations there.

1470
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
True.

1471
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Because if it's going to run on the actual system, they can't just like...

1472
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Yeah.

1473
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
You have to file these sizes and you have to make sure your sprites are all small enough

1474
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and compact enough.

1475
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And yeah, so there's a lot of limitations.

1476
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
You're only using so many colors in the palette at a time.

1477
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Right.

1478
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And your sprite palette only has...

1479
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
The RAM only has so much to load.

1480
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Exactly.

1481
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Exactly.

1482
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Yeah, it is a challenge.

1483
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
You have to have a...

1484
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
You probably have to have a bigger brain to develop for NES.

1485
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Is that what you're saying?

1486
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
No.

1487
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
You need to be a little smarter.

1488
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
You need to be a little smarter.

1489
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
A lot more planning, I think.

1490
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I'm just being an asshole.

1491
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm just kidding.

1492
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
That's what I was doing this week, by the way.

1493
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Which I haven't been playing any games because I'm fucking playing with Unity, okay?

1494
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
So that's why I haven't been playing games.

1495
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Am I going to talk about what I'm working on?

1496
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
No.

1497
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
No, because many of you people care about that crap.

1498
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Just give me a hard time forever so the hell with you.

1499
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
People watching this stream cannot see how red the two of you both are right now.

1500
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It might be able to see a little bit.

1501
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Me from laughing, him from being angry.

1502
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So is Loki...

1503
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
You look more amused.

1504
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Are we saying, Loki?

1505
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Are we saying, Loki, that you're not going to be talking about Unity Develop anymore

1506
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
because you're sick of all these jokes.

1507
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
You're sick about people joking.

1508
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
You never finish a thing.

1509
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And you're just going to come on here one day and you're going to say,

1510
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I fucking released a game.

1511
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Mic drop.

1512
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
We don't want to drop the mics.

1513
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
They might break them.

1514
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Drop it on the couch.

1515
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Drop it on the couch.

1516
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Put it on Pikachu's little pillow there.

1517
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Drop it on Pikachu.

1518
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
He'll hold it for you.

1519
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
There you go.

1520
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
There we go.

1521
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Let's drop it on Pikachu.

1522
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
We got to think about the mics.

1523
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
All right.

1524
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Okay, so Loki's new plan is to catch you all off.

1525
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It's Beyonce.

1526
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
He's going to do the Beyonce.

1527
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
He's going to be...

1528
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Because now Beyonce is a verb ever since what she did in the music industry.

1529
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
He's going to Beyonce his game on us all someday.

1530
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
So we will eagerly await it.

1531
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,

1532
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
this is why game developers aren't as open with gamers.

1533
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Now you're learning this firsthand.

1534
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Eh, whatever.

1535
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
All right.

1536
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about Final Fantasy Fan Fest in Japan.

1537
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
So you guys know I'm a fan of Final Fantasy XIV.

1538
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I've played that game quite a bit.

1539
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And the new expansion, I went to this in Las Vegas and they announced in Japan,

1540
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
they had their kind of like final Fan Fest because they did one in Paris as well a couple months ago.

1541
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So this one that they did in Japan was kind of the last one that's going to be leading into this expansion,

1542
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Shadowbringers, which is going to be coming out pre-play, I think it's June 28th.

1543
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,000
So for those that pre-order, you can play on June 28th.

1544
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
And so they announced a brand new class that's going to be playable in the game.

1545
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So we know that we already had Gunbreaker was going to be the first class, a new tank.

1546
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And the other job that they have unveiled is Dancer.

1547
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
That's right. You can live out your Mog fantasies and be a Dancer.

1548
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Interesting though, a lot of people predicted the Dancer would be another healer,

1549
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
but Dancer turns out to be a ranged DPS.

1550
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Although they're saying that Dancer will be able to do certain buffs that will have an effect on your party,

1551
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
which is interesting because we kind of thought that's what Bard's going to do.

1552
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Bard does have some limited things, but it's like shared with Machinists.

1553
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,000
But anyway, they have talked about a battle system complete redesign anyway.

1554
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
So we'll probably hear about exactly how that's going to work in a couple months in May or so forth.

1555
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
They announced some new areas for the expansion.

1556
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:14,000
They announced that the new raid, not the one, the 24-man that's the partnership with the folks behind Nier

1557
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and that whole thing. They talked about that in Paris.

1558
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,000
But the new raid here is called Eden, and it actually is going to have characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura

1559
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
from Kingdom Hearts and all that, so that's got a lot of people's attention for sure.

1560
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And then they announced, because a lot of people have been looking forward to,

1561
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:36,000
they announced the Viera in Paris, so the Viera from Fran from Final Fantasy XII.

1562
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
They're going to be in Final Fantasy XIV, but when they showed it off in Paris,

1563
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,000
there was nothing but female Viera and characters that kind of look like Fran, right?

1564
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And so a lot of people were kind of waiting, oh, they're going to show off the male Viera in Tokyo.

1565
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Well, guess what? They dropped the bombshell. There are no male Viera.

1566
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
There are going to be instead the Hrothgar, which is a class that,

1567
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,000
and I'm not going to get too far into the Final Fantasy lore, but basically this whole next expansion

1568
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:12,000
is going to take place in another realm where every race has a mirror race.

1569
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And the mirror race for Hrothgar is the Ronso, which if you guys remember Final Fantasy X, Kilmari.

1570
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So Hrothgars are basically Kilmari from Final Fantasy X, but Hrothgars are male only.

1571
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:34,000
So you cannot be a female Hrothgar, even though female Ronso's were present in Final Fantasy X.

1572
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:43,000
And I got to be honest, when I kind of saw the footage of the Hrothgars, I was like, this looks a little rushed.

1573
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I got the feeling watching this, they made this decision, especially when you look at the words,

1574
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
when they talked about in Las Vegas, we were there about how Viera would be the last race.

1575
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
They're not going to do another race. And then in Tokyo, they say, I know we said Viera was going to be the last race.

1576
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:08,000
We're actually going to do one other race because I have this feeling that in these few months between Vegas and Tokyo,

1577
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:14,000
they made the decision to flip out. And I know there was leaks back and forth. I've heard all that crap.

1578
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But I think somewhere in there, they made the decision they're not doing male Viera for whatever reason.

1579
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
And I think it's a shit decision.

1580
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
They're like the Gerudo then.

1581
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I think it's a shit decision.

1582
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
They have one male every hundred years and then he turns out to be Ganon.

1583
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Do they have male Mithras in this game?

1584
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Yes, they do.

1585
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Here's. Yeah. There's that pretty the pretty boy with the neck tattoo.

1586
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
So here's here's the whole thing.

1587
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:45,000
When they originally went from Final Fantasy 14, so 11 had gender locked races, right?

1588
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
So the equivalent of the Roga and the Galca in Final Fantasy 11 were males only and the Mithra,

1589
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
which are the Makoto and 14, were female only.

1590
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And because 14 was a lazy ass fuck copy paste of 11 in many ways, they kept it the same.

1591
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
14 1.0 what they did, they did, which was a terrible game. They did a lot of the same.

1592
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So when they made Final Fantasy 14 2.0 or Realm Reborn, they were like,

1593
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
why would we gender lock these things? Let's just open it up.

1594
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Let's do. And they did male Makoto and they did female Rogan and it's worked.

1595
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
So when they announced Viera, a lot of people got really excited about.

1596
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Oh, well, Final Fantasy 14 has been like super progressive on a lot of this, like genders.

1597
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,000
They listen to their player base and they made the glamour and the bunny stuff you can put on male or female.

1598
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And Final Fantasy 14 is infamous for the sublegar, right, which is dudes not wearing pants.

1599
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Look it up. Dudes and females not wearing pants.

1600
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
11 as well.

1601
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
But basically in Final Fantasy.

1602
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
11 had that too.

1603
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,000
It did. But basically in Final Fantasy 14, not only do the women look like hoes, but so do the men.

1604
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
And that's what a lot of people love about the game.

1605
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
So it's really fucking weird and off-putting to suddenly hear the development team go,

1606
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,000
we just, you know, male Vieras, we just, it just felt weird.

1607
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
So we're doing this instead.

1608
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:14,000
What? What? You just, but, but everything you did in 2.0.

1609
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And you better believe people are pissed.

1610
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And you know who's pissed?

1611
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
A lot of women.

1612
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
A lot of women out there on Twitter and so are pissed because they were looking forward to playing their bunny boys.

1613
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:34,000
And to be fair, why shouldn't they get to play the sexualized male class or whatever?

1614
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Even though the kitty boys are kind of sexualized as well.

1615
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And honestly, I've got to admit, I was really fucking looking forward to playing a bunny boy.

1616
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I really wanted to see how they were going to do it.

1617
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And I just think the fact that they're now gender locking in 5.0,

1618
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,000
when they realized that that was a bad decision in 2.0 is fucking, period, ridiculous, period.

1619
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Do you have a comment or sorry?

1620
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Just something, a little bit of history thing that I just had to check because I was really curious to see if it was a real thing and it was,

1621
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
or what the real thing was called.

1622
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Subligar was actually called the subligaculum, which basically means little binding underneath.

1623
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Exactly.

1624
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I knew what sub, what some of it meant, but I had to look up the rest of it.

1625
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
That's what a drag queen uses as their trick too.

1626
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Tucking panties.

1627
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Yes.

1628
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
But in this case, it was actually the dress of gladiators, athletes, and actors on stage in Rome.

1629
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
And it was a precursor to the bikini.

1630
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Well, it makes sense because that's how you make sure you're not sewing a moose knuckle when you're on stage.

1631
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
If you're wearing, you know, a dancing thing.

1632
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That's why they have like a dance belt, right?

1633
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
So that it makes it look a little more Kendall.

1634
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

1635
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
All right.

1636
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Now that our viewers have seen and listeners have heard much more than they want.

1637
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Anyway, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1638
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Anyway, just saying it was the precursor to the bikini.

1639
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Yeah, no, I know.

1640
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Thanks, Rome.

1641
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So anyway.

1642
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I have to throw some education in this shit.

1643
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
So I'm just, I think it's, I don't think these Hrothgar look very good at all.

1644
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And I think there's a lot of question marks in the way this news was delivered.

1645
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
There's a lot of fan art out there about male Veras that look great.

1646
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I don't understand why Square can't fucking figure it out.

1647
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
But I kind of think they need to figure it out.

1648
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I think they're like, it's 2019.

1649
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Like, just figure it out.

1650
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Give us the boy bunnies, dammit.

1651
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And honestly, I got to admit, as much as I enjoy Final Fantasy XIV,

1652
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
like, I do feel like a lot of the announcements we're getting is like,

1653
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
here's the new eight man raid.

1654
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Here's the new 24 man raid.

1655
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Here's the new dungeon.

1656
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Here's all the cookie cutters for this expansion

1657
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
that are just like the ones in the last expansion.

1658
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
And we haven't heard enough about what's really, like, game changing.

1659
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I'm going back to WoW.

1660
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
For real.

1661
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft.

1662
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And I don't think that game's perfect.

1663
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I think I get why people are mad at WoW, too,

1664
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
because I think a lot of the lore, the lore in this new expansion is straight up bad.

1665
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Like, what they did to Sylvanas, it's dumb.

1666
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
It's just dumb.

1667
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I've been still working on the previous Illidan stuff just because it's more

1668
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Demon Space Elf Husband Boyfriend.

1669
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
But like this new, I'm sorry, the new expansion, the lore is bad.

1670
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Anyway.

1671
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,000
But I will say, when I log into WoW, I don't feel like a shortage of things to do.

1672
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Like, I'm like, I could go, and the way you can gear up and feel progression in World of Warcraft,

1673
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
and granted, they've had like eight expansions to perfect this.

1674
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Final Fantasy is on what, their fourth?

1675
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
But you can go do a world quest, or you can go run mythic dungeons,

1676
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
or you can raid if you want,

1677
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
or you can do PvP, or, and I feel like there's just like more things to kind of do

1678
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
to feel a sense of progression in World of Warcraft than maybe in Final Fantasy XIV.

1679
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Like, I feel like, even though Final Fantasy XIV, like, especially the expansions have had a great story,

1680
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I feel like kind of like once you beat that story, it's like,

1681
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,000
well, why do I keep paying my monthly fee?

1682
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:01,000
And when I think one of the biggest criticisms about Final Fantasy XIV is that people are like,

1683
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I'd love to play it, I'd love to experience the story, but bummer about that monthly fee,

1684
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
because I ain't going to play it because of that monthly fee.

1685
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I kind of think Final Fantasy XIV really is at a point in its growth,

1686
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
they need to really justify that monthly fee.

1687
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Sure, it's got a great story, you've justified the cost of buying the expansion,

1688
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
now justify that monthly fee.

1689
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And I say that as a long time supporter of Final Fantasy XIV,

1690
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:32,000
but I kind of feel like there's been a lot of decisions made at Square Enix

1691
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
that are very much like, we exist in this bubble, and we're going to make this decision

1692
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
just because we think it's best.

1693
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
They need, like, accounts.

1694
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I mean, they've been pretty good about listing their player base,

1695
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
and I hope they do it on this male VR thing too, anyway.

1696
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Anyway, I've talked long enough, sorry.

1697
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

1698
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Sia Tabiri says, ugh, this bikini talk reminds me that I need to finish catching up on the Ace Attorney anime.

1699
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Garth the Wolf in chat says, I keep thinking of resubbing to XIV,

1700
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
but also got to justify if that fee is worth the time I'm going to spend on it.

1701
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I would say it's super worth it for that month you're going to spend to beat the story,

1702
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
but I'm kind of overrating.

1703
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I don't really do it anymore. I don't do it in WoW, I don't do it in Final Fantasy XIV.

1704
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I'm kind of over that part of it.

1705
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Dungeons are okay because you need far less people to do those,

1706
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:27,000
but I'm not interested, and again, you game how you want to game,

1707
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
and I've been a raider in the past, and there's a lot of joy in it,

1708
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
but for me, I just don't want to sit there for two hours learning a fight anymore.

1709
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
You know what I mean?

1710
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I like having my DBM.

1711
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Oh, the Deadly Boss mods?

1712
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Yeah.

1713
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Yeah, but even then, even with that, you still, when you rage, you got to know.

1714
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But it's still not hard to learn.

1715
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
No.

1716
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I watch one YouTube video, do one practice run, and I usually have it a third time.

1717
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, did they implement the NPC helpers for Dungeons?

1718
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
So that's the big thing in this next expansion.

1719
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
So instead of endgame content,

1720
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:06,000
trusts are the brand new thing in this expansion where they are making a shift.

1721
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
So to be fair to Square Enix, they are kind of listening to feedback

1722
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
where people don't really want to play an MMO as a multiplayer game,

1723
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
which I get it.

1724
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
So they are implementing that as this new expansion.

1725
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,000
So you will be able to beat the Shadowbringers story with just yourself

1726
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,000
and with a little help from your NPC friends instead of your IRL friends.

1727
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
And so for those that are a little more nervous about tanking and things like that,

1728
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
which I don't like to tank either,

1729
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
it'll be a lot easier because you won't be worrying about,

1730
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
oh, I'm going to get other people killed.

1731
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
It's just, oh, I'm getting these NPCs killed.

1732
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
And they're expendable.

1733
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Yes, they are expendable, which is like in Skyrim.

1734
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Hooray, I have Lydia.

1735
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Oh, Lydia died, right?

1736
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
All right, anyway.

1737
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Or they just disappear sometimes.

1738
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
She'll disappear and then all of a sudden she'll come back and be like,

1739
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
oh, where the hell did you come from?

1740
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
All right, let's go back to a time when games were a little simpler

1741
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
and we had to just put trust in the development of the game.

1742
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
It was going to be a good game, but there weren't NPCs following you around,

1743
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
especially not in this game.

1744
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Well, maybe, I guess there were, but maybe a little bit in this game.

1745
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
But anyway, it's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.

1746
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
What is the classic game of the week that you picked for us this week?

1747
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I went into Namco Land and did Winning Run.

1748
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Winning Run is a first-person Formula One racing game.

1749
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It was released in 1998 in Japan and in 1989 January in the European Union.

1750
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Well, actually, that didn't exist back then, so in Europe.

1751
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:44,000
And it was the first game to run on the 3D Namco System 21 polygonizer hardware.

1752
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Music was composed by Kawada Hiroyuki, who had also worked on Galaga 88.

1753
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And since you mentioned music, it's going to shift here.

1754
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
We're going to play some stuff from the soundtrack

1755
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
because the ambient noise of the game is just kind of...

1756
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Pretty much.

1757
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah, so we switched it out for the actual soundtrack here in the video.

1758
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
At any rate, development for this game actually began over three years

1759
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
before the game's release when they were developing the hardware.

1760
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Now, I'm sure people are familiar with Namco System 21,

1761
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
but just to go ahead and tell you what else came on it was

1762
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Winning Run, Winning Run Suzuka Grand Prix, Galaxian 3rd.

1763
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I never want to call it 3 because it's got the cube, so Galaxian Cube.

1764
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Driver's Eyes, Winning Run 91, Starblades, Solavu,

1765
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Air Combat, Cybersled, and Attack of the Zul'gir.

1766
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
So, some pretty big names came out on that.

1767
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:48,000
But anyway, this was the first 3D game that Namco had released on that system.

1768
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
It was the first game on that system.

1769
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
It was also considered a milestone in 3D polygon graphics.

1770
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
It pushed 60,000 polygons per second,

1771
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:02,000
and it used the shapes basically as the building box for the structures within the game.

1772
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:08,000
It's basically in one of those little sit-down cabinets

1773
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
like most of the other Namco racing games at the time.

1774
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And you had two game modes.

1775
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
You had an easy drive with an automatic transition and slower gameplay,

1776
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,000
or a technical drive that was manual transmission with faster gameplay.

1777
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:27,000
It also featured a Dunlop style tire bridge over the track with the text of Namco on it.

1778
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
And, you know, it had many musical things in common with Final Lap.

1779
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
It also had a rear view mirror so you could see what was behind you.

1780
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
And of course it had two sequels, like I mentioned.

1781
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Winning Run, Suzuka Grand Prix, and Winning Run 91.

1782
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Driver's Eyes, also that was on the same hardware,

1783
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:52,000
was a three-monitor game that was considered in the family but not a true sequel.

1784
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,000
At any rate, it was a really, really successful game too.

1785
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Famicon Tsushin, which was the arcade earnings chart,

1786
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:08,000
had it hit number one in August of 1989, so that was almost a year later.

1787
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
The first game that overtook it was actually Super Monaco GP,

1788
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
so another thing at the same time.

1789
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
At any rate, it was also super well received in Europe.

1790
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It got really great reviews.

1791
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
And then, I mean, really it just got so many raves over,

1792
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,000
especially since it did push early 3D back in the day.

1793
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I'm trying to find what other releases came out.

1794
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000
It doesn't have it all listed together.

1795
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,000
But it actually did get a mention in Commodore User back in the day

1796
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
when it was starting to come out in the UK.

1797
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
And basically most of the...

1798
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Yeah, it doesn't look like it ever got any kind of home release from what I can see.

1799
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:58,000
This definitely looks like a game of an era when hard drive-in...

1800
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
You know those very polygon-heavy, creating 3D experiences of these huge polygons?

1801
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I mean, those of you that are kind of watching it on Twitch with us

1802
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
are probably like, boy, this definitely looks dated,

1803
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
but this is definitely a product of its time.

1804
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
There were a lot of similar games, and the consoles couldn't frickin' do it.

1805
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
They did an NES or SNES version of stunt drive-in or one of those.

1806
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It was kind of terrible.

1807
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Well, yeah. But now look at just the playthrough here, right?

1808
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
And just see the general layout and how things are lined up.

1809
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Tell me of another Namco game that this makes you think of.

1810
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
When I saw the map, I thought Pole Position.

1811
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I know that's Atari. But then, of course, obviously the logical step would be Ridge Racer.

1812
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Exactly. A lot of the track layout and elements...

1813
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I firmly believe Ridge Racer would have been a nod back to this one.

1814
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Even though this one's still a Formula One-style game,

1815
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
it has so much in common with it.

1816
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
It even looks like it flows like Ridge Racer does.

1817
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I wouldn't doubt that they looked at this game

1818
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
to bring it into the modern era to make it Ridge Racer.

1819
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,000
By the way, I'm out of footage, so I've got to come back to us to the studio.

1820
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
That's all I have, anyway.

1821
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Well, there it is. Your classic game of the week. Winning run.

1822
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
It was neat because, again, even though it's definitely...

1823
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I think that's an important racing game because without that game,

1824
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
you probably wouldn't have what you have today with Ridge Racer.

1825
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
When was the last time they did a Ridge Racer game? It's been a while.

1826
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Wasn't it R7?

1827
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:32,000
No, they had the one for the Vita, and then they did one for PC and consoles.

1828
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
But it wasn't really the Ridge Racer team.

1829
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:41,000
It was the guys at Bugbearer, I think, that did those games.

1830
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Actually, Dr. Suya in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,

1831
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
actually, pole position was Namco in Japan.

1832
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:55,000
So when I called out that track, maybe pole position led to this in some ways.

1833
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
It's indeed possible.

1834
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I actually will tell you what my inspiration for picking Winning 11 was.

1835
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
You mean Winning Run?

1836
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Winning Run, sorry.

1837
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Winning 11 is a different game, yes.

1838
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:10,000
One of the YouTube channels I like to watch, Retro Core, does Battle of the Ports.

1839
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
And I was watching the pole position Battle of the Ports.

1840
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And I was like, I know Namco did another game that we never got over here,

1841
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
so it sort of sent me down that rabbit hole.

1842
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
And it was Winning Run, so I was like, that's what inspired me to do it.

1843
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And if you guys have never watched Retro Core's stuff,

1844
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I mean, he's funny and some of his assessments are not at all right

1845
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
and his grammar is terrible.

1846
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I'm not judging because, I mean, seriously.

1847
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
But anyway, go definitely watch his videos because they are top notch.

1848
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
All right.

1849
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Classic Game of the Week is Winning Run.

1850
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Good pick.

1851
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
That was a very educational pick this week because, again,

1852
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I think that's a game that a lot of people have heard of.

1853
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Well, I know a game a lot of you guys have been hearing about this week

1854
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
is Blaster Master Zero 2, thanks to the Nindies.

1855
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
So we're going to take a moment here to go to a prerecorded bit here

1856
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
from earlier today with me.

1857
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Okay. Hello, everybody.

1858
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I thought for our prerecorded segment this week,

1859
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:09,000
we could take a look at the just released Blaster Master Zero Part 2,

1860
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
which I'm sure at this point we've talked about earlier in the show

1861
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
as it was kind of that surprise announcement

1862
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
during Nintendo's presentation this week during their Nindies event

1863
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
that this Blaster Master Zero Part 2 was available today.

1864
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
And certainly, you know, for fans of the first Blaster Master game,

1865
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
it probably left folks feeling like, oh, well,

1866
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
the first Blaster Master was a reimagining of, obviously,

1867
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
that first Blaster Master game from the NES so long ago.

1868
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Where are they going to go with the sequel?

1869
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Because, yes, I think many of us know that the original Blaster Master

1870
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,000
had sequels on the Genesis and what there was that Wii game

1871
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
that was a reimagining a while ago.

1872
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I think there was one on the Game Boy as well.

1873
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
But let's be real, none of those were particularly good.

1874
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So I think it kind of left this Blaster Master,

1875
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
and I'm going back into the opening sequence here,

1876
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
where it kind of sets the tone for the game while I'm talking,

1877
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
it kind of leaves Blaster Master Zero Part 2

1878
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
to do something a little bit more original.

1879
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
So if you actually kind of watch this opening sequence

1880
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
where it's basically recapping the events of the first game,

1881
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
you learn that Jason, you know, obviously the frog jumped in

1882
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
and got lost, which I think many classic game fans know

1883
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
is the plot of the original Blaster Master games.

1884
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
But something new that they kind of introduced in Blaster Master Zero

1885
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
when they did the reimagining of the Switch

1886
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
is that there was this other character, Eve,

1887
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
which is funny because Eve was one of the characters

1888
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
that was actually in that Blaster Master book

1889
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,000
when you had those like Worlds of Power books by FX9 some time ago.

1890
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
So it was kind of interesting because that ended up being

1891
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
like a canon thing due to Blaster Master Zero.

1892
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Anyway, it's kind of funky how the whole thing works.

1893
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
But the plot and the setup for this new, I guess, original story

1894
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
that Inti Creates is making with Blaster Master Zero Part 2

1895
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
is that Eve got infected with a parasite.

1896
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Yes, she became Parasite Eve.

1897
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And so she got infected with a parasite,

1898
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
so they're going to go to Eve's homeworld, Sophia,

1899
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
to find the cure, I guess, for this plague.

1900
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
So that's where this game sets up here.

1901
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
So we're looking at the menu,

1902
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
and if you kind of look at the how to play section,

1903
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
and actually this is my very first time looking at it.

1904
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I didn't really prep this in advance.

1905
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I just thought, oh, I'll just kind of do a quick little playthrough

1906
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
since we don't want to spend a whole lot of time during the show,

1907
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
but give ourselves a little break in studio.

1908
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,000
We can kind of look at kind of generally what this game looks like

1909
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
and how it works.

1910
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
And you can even look at from this how to play menu

1911
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
is that you have a lot of the same features

1912
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
that you're kind of used to in Blaster Master.

1913
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
It doesn't look like they invented a lot of original things,

1914
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
except I'm not sure what it's trying to say

1915
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
with one of these screens here where you can see that the,

1916
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
and again, I know there's folks listening on the podcast,

1917
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
you can't see these screens,

1918
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
but there's one where the vehicle is falling

1919
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
all the way down to the bottom,

1920
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
and it's got some type of like,

1921
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I don't know if that's supposed to be like a climb or a move

1922
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
or something.

1923
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I'm just not connecting to a special move from the first game.

1924
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Maybe somebody in chat is probably yelling it out right now.

1925
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,000
But it also looks like they may have changed the top down view a bit,

1926
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
that portion of the game.

1927
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
That's what it looks like in the second menu

1928
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
is that it looks like it's more of like a slanted view.

1929
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So I'm excited to try to at least in this little segment here

1930
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
get to one of those sections

1931
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
because I want to see if that looks any different

1932
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
because this how to play definitely makes it look like

1933
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
it might be a little bit different.

1934
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
So let's get to it.

1935
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I'm going to jump into the game

1936
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
and just kind of see where it throws us off here.

1937
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
So like the first game you have several different save slots

1938
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
and I wonder if they aren't going to be planning to expand it

1939
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
with DLC later on

1940
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
like they did the original Blaster Master Zero

1941
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
is that you can play with all these other characters

1942
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
that weren't really connected to Blaster Master,

1943
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,000
but it was kind of neat to see them in the game anyway.

1944
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
So all right, here we are.

1945
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
So we're going to a new planet

1946
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
and the original cutscenes kind of set that up that we saw earlier.

1947
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
So now we have Jason saying it was close.

1948
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
We touched down right before our energy ran out.

1949
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Eve is the Gaia system holding up

1950
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
and you can see if you're looking on the Twitch stream

1951
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
you can kind of see Eve's got that little

1952
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
she looks sick.

1953
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
She looks like she might be part zombie there.

1954
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
So that's part of the story here.

1955
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
So yes, things are converted

1956
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
and I'm sure it's probably setting things up here

1957
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
to be like, oh, but the thing is powerless.

1958
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
You're going to have to find all the features

1959
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:11,000
that's a true landmark of any Metroidvania game

1960
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
and you're going to have to go around and find everything.

1961
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
So, all right.

1962
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
So it should allow for limitless planet exploration.

1963
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
So I guess when you fall, you get SP

1964
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
and maybe that's what that how to play thing

1965
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
was saying earlier.

1966
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I'm not sure.

1967
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I see no more hover functions.

1968
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
So you're going to have to kind of find that.

1969
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
So, yeah.

1970
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
So as the dialogue is going on,

1971
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
we're kind of learning about that.

1972
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Oh, the car is a little broken, but that makes sense.

1973
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,000
You know, you got to start over since it is a new game.

1974
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So hopefully we'll get through these cut scenes here.

1975
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
All right. There we go.

1976
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Now I can play.

1977
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
So, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1978
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
This feels very similar to the first game

1979
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
where you can drive around in the car right now.

1980
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
You can it looks like immediately right away

1981
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
fire through bricks, which was a power up in the older games.

1982
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So kind of interesting.

1983
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
They give you that feature right off the bat

1984
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
and it looks like there might be some

1985
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
you can see some things on the screen,

1986
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
but they're a little high up.

1987
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
So I can't get them yet.

1988
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
So it's one of those classic.

1989
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
You got to come all the way back to the beginning

1990
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
probably to get those lists.

1991
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
There's something I'm not thinking of,

1992
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
which that very, very possibly could be the case.

1993
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
So now they're kind of setting up some of the story that

1994
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
there are, in fact, aliens on this planet, too,

1995
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
that are bad and you're going to have to kill those.

1996
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:32,000
So there's it's talking about the SP conversion still.

1997
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:38,000
And basically, that's how you power your special attacks,

1998
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,000
it sounds like.

1999
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
So it sounds like that could be an interesting

2000
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
kind of limited feature.

2001
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
So it said, oh, yeah, look at that.

2002
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
When I fell a long way, bam, it converted.

2003
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
That's kind of an interesting little feature.

2004
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I want to see how that plays out.

2005
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Now, how do I?

2006
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Oh, there we go.

2007
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Okay, so you can actually choose by holding the L button

2008
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
what it is you want to fire.

2009
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I don't know if you use the L button to fire.

2010
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Ah, no, it's the A button.

2011
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Gotcha.

2012
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Okay, so I just killed a little crab

2013
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
and I had to hit him with the missiles first

2014
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
and then kind of attack him.

2015
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
So I bet if I fall from the...

2016
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Oh, that's an interesting way to recover special units

2017
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
is to have to fall from a distance to do that.

2018
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Hmm, kind of interesting.

2019
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
All right, so now there's...

2020
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Okay, let's see if we can...

2021
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
So you have to really time this right

2022
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
to hit him with the missiles and then fire at him.

2023
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
All right, let's see.

2024
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Obviously, I can't spend too long looking at this game

2025
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
because I know we're going to want to get back to the show

2026
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
before too long, but I want to see if I can get to one of those

2027
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
top-down sequences to see how that plays.

2028
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
So hopefully there's one of them before too long.

2029
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
All right, there's a save spot.

2030
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
We know those.

2031
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
So that saves the game.

2032
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Aha, there's one of those little doors.

2033
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
So we will have to go hop in there.

2034
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And they're saying that with the dialogue as well.

2035
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
And how convenient.

2036
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Eve can't leave and go with you to help fight.

2037
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
She's stuck in the car because of her sickness.

2038
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
That's what they're kind of saying there in the dialogue there.

2039
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
All right, let's see.

2040
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I get through lots of dialogue, lots of press an A.

2041
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
All right, ribbit, ribbit.

2042
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Okay, let's see.

2043
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Here we go.

2044
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
So I'm making our way down to this little.

2045
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Okay, so there's a ladder here, but it's one that we're going to have to exit.

2046
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
But this also means now Jason can't really fall a great distance.

2047
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Ooh, there we go.

2048
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I had to kneel down there because I got hit with a bullet.

2049
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Oh, tricky.

2050
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I lost a little bit of health doing that, but I made it to the door.

2051
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
So now he can see the top-down sequence.

2052
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
So it's loading, and here we are.

2053
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Oh, it does.

2054
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Okay, it kind of, it does look like the first game in a lot of ways.

2055
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
But Jason definitely looks like overpowered.

2056
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Like he looks like he's definitely grown a lot since the events of the first game.

2057
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And obviously, again, for those on the podcast that are listening

2058
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
and can't see the visuals right now, you know, it's got a definitely unique sort of skin to it

2059
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
that doesn't look like the planet from the first game.

2060
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
It looks a little more like this kind of purpley planet that we fell onto.

2061
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,000
But otherwise, a lot of the gameplay still kind of feels like the first game,

2062
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
although you have things like floating platforms and things.

2063
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Okay, so you had to push that platform down.

2064
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And that's how you get your first item, a map.

2065
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
We found it.

2066
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Oh, and the frog is very happy, and he made a little portal up here

2067
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
that immediately warps me out the door so I don't have to walk all the way back.

2068
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Well, that's a convenient feature.

2069
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I sure like that.

2070
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
So let's see.

2071
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
So he should have given me a map, which where would I see that?

2072
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Would I see that?

2073
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Oh, there we go.

2074
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
So you can actually see now a map of the area,

2075
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
and you can see where the other items are and where the boss is,

2076
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
and we can start to make our way from here.

2077
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
So all right, we got to take just a quick peek,

2078
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
but we wanted to take a look and see what it looks like in motion,

2079
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
and definitely something I want to explore a little bit more later

2080
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
because now Inti Creates kind of has this canvas

2081
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
where they're not beholden to the original story anymore.

2082
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
And even though I think they did a really good job

2083
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,000
with the first Blaster Master Zero of reinterpreting the first game

2084
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
but kind of doing their own thing with it,

2085
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
even though some people criticized it for being too easy,

2086
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I think a lot of us kind of look back at the original Blaster Master and go,

2087
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
that's a really hard game to beat, especially in one sitting

2088
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
like you used to have to do back in the day.

2089
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
So I think Blaster Master Zero kind of tried to make it a little bit easier

2090
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
but then had some more challenging modes with the different characters

2091
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,000
and the difficult modes that they added in there as well.

2092
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
So I'm very interested to see what more they do with this different canvas.

2093
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
It sounds like you might be going between different planets

2094
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
and other things like that.

2095
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
So there it is, a first look at Blaster Master Zero Part 2

2096
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
because apparently the first one sold well enough.

2097
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
So good job, Engine Creates.

2098
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
They're making some great games so far.

2099
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
So we're going to go back to the studio.

2100
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Okay, we are back. Thank you, me.

2101
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio In Progress tonight

2102
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:32,000
on March 24th, 2019, and episode number 769 already in progress.

2103
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
We are going to get into some rapid-fire news here shortly,

2104
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
but I know a few weeks ago on the show here, Dark Soccer,

2105
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
you were giving a shout-out to another podcast doing a little plug there.

2106
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
For our old OLR pals that used to be here a lot, Chris and Meg Z,

2107
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
although they moved.

2108
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
But you got a lot of positive feedback from plugging podcasts,

2109
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
and we always say support indie podcasts.

2110
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Precisely.

2111
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2112
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
So you want to give another one a shout-out tonight?

2113
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I do, and I'm going to be taking suggestions from people on Twitter.

2114
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
So if you've got one that you would like to have a shout-out to

2115
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:07,000
as long as they are like non-hateful asshole podcasts.

2116
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I mean, if they're not asshole podcasts, I will.

2117
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
You know what I mean.

2118
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I had a show called The Asshole Podcast. Oh, well.

2119
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Was it about bleached assholes?

2120
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
No.

2121
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Okay, then. So I don't care. Anyway.

2122
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
But if it was about bleached assholes, you would care?

2123
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
We would point it to Extrofer.

2124
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Let's not ruin the shout-out.

2125
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Anyway, so the suggestion on Twitter comes from SpringTieMe,

2126
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:36,000
and it's a podcast called Riptide Podcast.

2127
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:41,000
It is a pinball podcast for women in pinball, in competitive pinball.

2128
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I'm sorry, I got the name wrong. Riptide Pinball Podcast.

2129
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And it's at Riptide Podcast.

2130
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
You can find them on iTunes.

2131
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I didn't see anything super recent, but I guess it does it during, you know, releases and whatnot.

2132
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:58,000
But at any rate, I definitely want to give them a shout-out.

2133
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
We need more women in pinball, especially competitive pinball.

2134
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
We have a ladies' league up here.

2135
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I'm not competitive, so I don't want to play.

2136
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I just like to play and lose by myself.

2137
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
But at any rate...

2138
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Literally in the privacy of your own home.

2139
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
In the privacy of my own home.

2140
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Even when Dan's not there, or he's asleep, and Midna's in the other room.

2141
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
So she's not judging me with her cat eyes.

2142
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
But anyway, so yeah, give them a check-out.

2143
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Alright, thanks for the tweet, and thanks for the shout-out.

2144
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Send me more suggestions. It's at DarkSakura.

2145
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Or you could probably send them to the show on Twitter, and I could pass them along too.

2146
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
But I want more people to talk to me on Twitter.

2147
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Are you lonely on Twitter?

2148
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
A little bit. I'm trying to give my Twitter more attention,

2149
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,000
and really put more focus on games, unless it's yelling at politicians.

2150
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Alright.

2151
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Okay, let's move on to some rapid-fire news,

2152
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
and talk about some other things going on in the game industry right now.

2153
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Loki, we'll start with you.

2154
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
So Nintendo was doing their directs.

2155
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Microsoft has their little thing that they do.

2156
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Now Sony's joining in the game with their state of play live broadcast.

2157
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Inside Xbox is what you're trying to think of.

2158
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

2159
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
So they have their state of play,

2160
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
and they're doing live broadcasts to talk about different games that are coming out,

2161
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
and their platform announcements and whatnot.

2162
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
So the first state of play is going to be March 25th,

2163
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
at 2 p.m. Pacific time, 5 p.m. Eastern.

2164
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
And they're going to show something.

2165
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Hurray!

2166
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Hurray!

2167
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Well, remember, Sony's not doing E3 this year,

2168
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
so they're going to be showing the PlayStation 5.

2169
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2170
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
But wouldn't that be a gag if they did?

2171
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
No, I think they would give us a little more announcement.

2172
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Probably some unreleased PS4 games,

2173
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
some things to carry them through the summer and the rest of the year.

2174
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Very similar to what we would see if Nintendo said,

2175
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
we've got to direct tomorrow.

2176
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
It would be a very similar sort of thing.

2177
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Yeah, we'll see.

2178
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
And then, of course, as usual, Bethesda's announced

2179
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
that they're going to be doing their E3 press conference

2180
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
right in the middle of our goddamn show.

2181
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
So, 5 p.m. Pacific time on Sunday, June 9th.

2182
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
So, of course, we'll be interrupting for that.

2183
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Hurray!

2184
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Hurray!

2185
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Hopefully, we won't be disappointed by their announcements.

2186
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Alright, moving on, talking about Apex Legends.

2187
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
There is a new patch for Apex Legends on PC.

2188
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:21,000
So, apparently, there were a lot of crashing issues for Apex Legends on PC.

2189
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
So, Respawn went and did some tweaking with the game,

2190
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
and they did a patch.

2191
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,000
So, it's supposed to be some stability, some performance issues.

2192
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:35,000
It also capped the frames per second on PC to 300.

2193
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So, you can get no more than 300 frames a second on PC.

2194
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:43,000
And if you're getting 300 frames a second, you must have a BBBC.

2195
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
But anyway, also, apparently, it will actually,

2196
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
when the game crashes, it will do like a text dump.

2197
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
So, you can learn more about, I guess, why it's crashing.

2198
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
So, that's kind of neat.

2199
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Also, it should be mentioned that there was a new champion,

2200
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
or what is it called, a legend?

2201
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I don't know what they call the fighter's name,

2202
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
but Octane is the newest playable person.

2203
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
No, no, he doesn't look like one of the psychos from Borderlands at all.

2204
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
He also kind of has like the Junkrat thing going on.

2205
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I think his legs are replaced with, they're not like...

2206
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
What did you mean, cybernetic?

2207
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Yeah, I think they're cybernetic legs or something, I don't know.

2208
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
They're not, they don't look like...

2209
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
They look enhanced or something.

2210
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
They've got magic legs.

2211
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Yes, we'll say that.

2212
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
A lot of people are very excited about this news,

2213
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
which was kind of released a long...

2214
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I know I say that GDC is not the place for game announcements,

2215
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
but here's one that was announced during the GDC timeframe,

2216
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2.

2217
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,000
So, there is going to be a second game, that's pretty cool.

2218
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
The game is going to be in 2020.

2219
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:53,000
It is a sequel to the original Bloodlines that was out on PC and console,

2220
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
and if you're a fan of Vampire the Masquerade,

2221
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
this might be something that you're into.

2222
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I know a lot of people I saw on Twitter were excited about that.

2223
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
This game is being developed by Hardsuit Labs,

2224
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
and the story involves a vampire insurrection,

2225
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
where you're going to be making an alliance with warring clans,

2226
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:13,000
and there's politics and volatile climates and all sorts of fun things.

2227
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,000
They had a lot of announcements during GDC, actually, for games.

2228
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Pre-order now for 60 bucks.

2229
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Because I was watching the Unity press event thing that they were doing,

2230
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:27,000
and they showed off a new trailer for System Shock 3,

2231
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
and they announced Call of Duty Mobile.

2232
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
That's kind of the weirdest place to do that, but okay,

2233
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
because it's built on Unity.

2234
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
That's going to be a big mobile thing.

2235
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Yeah, and I'm not to say they never talk about games at GDC,

2236
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
and certainly indie developers get their games out there,

2237
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
but it's just like, it's not E3.

2238
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And I think people kind of have it in the right perspective now,

2239
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
but there was definitely a period of time where people thought,

2240
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
oh, GDC is like a mini E3.

2241
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Not really.

2242
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Not really. It's for the developer audience,

2243
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
but because it's for developers,

2244
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
sometimes you get, these are the new tools to be developed on.

2245
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
But sure, sometimes developers are going to want to show off here,

2246
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
is what we've been working on.

2247
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So you get some game announcements.

2248
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
And again, this is a pretty big deal to some people.

2249
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Questbuster in our chat, yay, Bloodlines 2.

2250
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
And I think there's a lot of people that are saying yay to this.

2251
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
We have a few more rapid-fire stories,

2252
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
but they're coming from Dark Sakura.

2253
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Yep. Well, one might remember that I talked about

2254
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Pierre Taki, who played Hamura Kyouhei in Judgment Eyes in Japan.

2255
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
They pulled the game out of sales because he had been busted for cocaine.

2256
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
They're actually fully removing him from the game,

2257
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
replacing his model with a different character

2258
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,000
in different Japanese voice acting or a different actor

2259
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
to be released in the Western market and redone in Japan.

2260
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:56,000
So those first original release copies, kind of rare. Someone find me one.

2261
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,000
He's being replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog.

2262
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Fucking A.

2263
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Who thought we'd have a highly collectible type of game here

2264
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
in the year 2019 like this, in the age of digital distribution?

2265
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
But this is going to be a rare game

2266
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
if you can get the one that has the original guy in it.

2267
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Someone get it for me.

2268
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
And then in other news, EverQuest turned 20.

2269
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Yay. People are still fucking playing EverQuest.

2270
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It's hard to let it go, man.

2271
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,000
So they're celebrating with new progression servers,

2272
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:33,000
new in-game events, and 50% experience point bonus through March.

2273
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
So, yay.

2274
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:38,000
As Jason kind of alluded to in tonight's intro,

2275
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,000
this is one of those stories where on Facebook all the time

2276
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,000
we see these stories about such and such turns XX today.

2277
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Oh, no. Here's the big one.

2278
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Do you know that in theaters this week,

2279
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
they have Cruel Intentions re-released in theaters?

2280
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,000
The movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe and all that.

2281
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Do you know why they re-released it in theaters this week?

2282
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Because the movie turned 20 years old.

2283
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:05,000
And it's one of those things where we're like, thanks.

2284
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I didn't need a reminder.

2285
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I know, right? I didn't need a reminder how old that was.

2286
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Thanks. Appreciate that.

2287
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
And there you go.

2288
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I know SSG and her mad just replied with a bunch of dots.

2289
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Right?

2290
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
And I was like, wait, wait.

2291
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Cruel Intentions is like 20 years old.

2292
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
You know I've never seen it, right?

2293
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Oh, really?

2294
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
It's like it's not an Oscar movie.

2295
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Should we have like a 90s?

2296
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
We should go to the theater and see it.

2297
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Although, here's the problem.

2298
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I do want to see that.

2299
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:35,000
But I also, now that I know it's not super gory

2300
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
because I asked somebody about it,

2301
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I really want to see us.

2302
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Me too.

2303
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Although I understand that if you are a bunny lover,

2304
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
then there is sadness.

2305
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Oh, no.

2306
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Like Fatal Attraction.

2307
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
That's depressing.

2308
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
I don't know.

2309
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Then my sister should see it.

2310
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Oh, my God.

2311
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
My sister loves bunnies.

2312
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Well, I saw it when someone warned Marissa.

2313
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Okay.

2314
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Because you know she has her spotted bunny named Snoopy.

2315
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Oh, yeah.

2316
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Okay.

2317
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
But apparently it does actually contribute to the storyline.

2318
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Okay.

2319
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Oh, boy.

2320
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
All right.

2321
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
That's one of those.

2322
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Because that's one of those,

2323
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
even though you may not want the minor story spoiler or whatever,

2324
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
it's still one of those things where it's like,

2325
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
why they have websites of does the dog die or what is it?

2326
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
There's some website where you can go

2327
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,000
and you can check on any film to see if the dog dies.

2328
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
So that way, you know,

2329
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
like I ain't seeing this movie because I know the dog.

2330
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I wish I had been warned about Drag Me to Hell.

2331
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Cat.

2332
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Hold up.

2333
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Hold up.

2334
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Hold up.

2335
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
You went to see a movie called Drag Me to Hell.

2336
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Because Tiara wanted to see it.

2337
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,000
But you were shocked by something in a movie called Drag Me to Hell.

2338
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I wasn't shocked.

2339
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,000
The only reason I saw it is because it was a Sam Raimi movie.

2340
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Okay.

2341
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
It wasn't really all that fucking good.

2342
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I mean, she liked it, but I just didn't understand.

2343
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I would have liked to have been warned if a cat was being sacrificed in a movie.

2344
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Okay.

2345
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Oh, yeah.

2346
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Yeah.

2347
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
But at any rate, Drag Me to Hell is really stupid.

2348
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I really did not like that movie.

2349
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Tiger Claw.

2350
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Speaking of old.

2351
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
And then we'll move into release dates.

2352
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Tiger Claw on chat is talking about that it's C2E2,

2353
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
the big Chicago event that was this week.

2354
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
They had a clueless reunion.

2355
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
They sure did.

2356
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Except, rest in peace, Brittany Murphy wouldn't have been able to be a part of that.

2357
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
But I think they had everybody else involved.

2358
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I don't think Stacey Dash was there, but, you know, everybody else was.

2359
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
So, that could be.

2360
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
But rest in peace, Brittany Murphy.

2361
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,000
And in my opinion, although Brittany Murphy is fabulous in the movie Clueless,

2362
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
if you really want an underrated Brittany Murphy role

2363
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:36,000
and an underrated movie in general, you need to go see the cult comedy classic Drop Dead Gorgeous.

2364
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
It's perfect.

2365
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I love that movie.

2366
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
By the way, I just got a black cat in Animal Crossing named Kiki.

2367
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Oh, the universe heard you calling out for more kitties.

2368
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I needed a Kiki.

2369
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
All right.

2370
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some things that are not 20 years old.

2371
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
They're brand new as they are released in different parts of the world, starting with the US.

2372
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
How ironic that you would transition with that.

2373
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Because our first release for this week is none other than the brand new Final Fantasy VII on the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.

2374
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:13,000
And then we have Generation Zero on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2375
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:17,000
MLB The Show 19 on PlayStation 4.

2376
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Outward on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2377
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Space Junkies on PC.

2378
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I guess that's, I thought that was already, maybe that was early access.

2379
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Now it's coming out of early access, which is a VR game.

2380
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel on PC.

2381
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Or I'm sorry, PlayStation 4.

2382
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,000
The Princess Guide on Switch and PlayStation 4.

2383
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
The Walking Dead, the final season, Episode 4.

2384
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Take us back on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and...

2385
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Is that like the former Telltale stuff that got picked up by...

2386
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

2387
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Okay.

2388
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
So they're releasing another episode of it.

2389
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Who picked that up? Somebody, it was a logical...

2390
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Anyway, anyways, PC Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

2391
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Xenon Racer on PC Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2392
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
And we've got a couple more for this week.

2393
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Fun Fun Animal Park on the Switch.

2394
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Assassin's Creed 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2395
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I'm assuming that's the remaster.

2396
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Yeah.

2397
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,000
And finally on the Switch, Yoshi's Crafted World.

2398
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Oh, cool.

2399
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
That's it.

2400
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Alright.

2401
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.

2402
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:38,000
In Japan this week we have, on the PlayStation 4, we have Remilore,

2403
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,000
is a game that's out this week, as well as winning post 9.

2404
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,000
So we've talked about winning run, winning 11,

2405
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
and now winning post 9 is out in Japan this week.

2406
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
And a game called Full Kiss.

2407
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
We just need a game called Winning!

2408
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Starring Charlie Sheen.

2409
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
No, just a game called Winning. Starring me, because I'm winning.

2410
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:04,000
The Lego Movie 2 video game gets a Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 4.

2411
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,000
It's different.

2412
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
It's different.

2413
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Did I mention Full Kiss in a regular and full version that's out this week as well?

2414
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Call of Cthulhu gets a Japanese release this week as well.

2415
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And Memories Off, innocent file for dearest, in a regular and limited edition.

2416
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:26,000
And Utaware Urumono, there's two versions of that releasing this week on the PlayStation 4.

2417
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
And then one other game that's coming out this week, Konosuba,

2418
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:35,000
God's blessing on this wonderful world, the labyrinth of hope and gathering of adventurers.

2419
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
That is the name.

2420
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Sign me the fuck up.

2421
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
That sounds epic as fuck.

2422
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,000
That's a very long title, but that is out.

2423
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I want to fucking climb a mountain now.

2424
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Anyway, the main character is Kazuma and parties alongside Aqua, Megumin, Darkness,

2425
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,000
and one other character to make a five person party.

2426
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:01,000
It looks like a very basic old school RPG, but on the PlayStation 4.

2427
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:04,000
And when you go through the story, you get new costumes.

2428
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Whoopee!

2429
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:09,000
To quote Mystery Science Theater 3000, whoopty shit.

2430
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:16,000
On the Switch this week, Winning Post 9 is out there, Remolore, Diabolic Lovers, Chaos Lineage,

2431
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
and the LEGO Movie 2 video game is out in Japan as well on the Switch.

2432
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Memories Off, innocent file for dearest.

2433
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,000
So a lot of those same games also on the Switch this week.

2434
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

2435
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Oh, a bunch of stuff.

2436
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,000
We have The Walking Dead, the final season.

2437
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
All these that I'm naming right now are on the 25th.

2438
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Outward, we have Space Junkies.

2439
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,000
We have Xenon Racer for the major three.

2440
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,000
We have Generation Zero, looks like a mecha game.

2441
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Dragon Marked for Death, which looks really fun.

2442
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
That's going to be on Switch.

2443
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Squishies.

2444
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Squishy!

2445
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Kingdom Hearts, the story so far on PlayStation.

2446
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Actually, that's the 20th.

2447
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Squishies, Dragon, and Kingdom Hearts are all on the 28th.

2448
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:05,000
And also on the 28th is Nelke and the Legendary Alchemists,

2449
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Tropico 6, and The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel,

2450
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:15,000
and Yoshi's Crafted World, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered.

2451
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
That's it.

2452
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,000
All right, going to some comments in chat,

2453
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Act F is talking about Konosuba.

2454
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
It is an anime.

2455
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
It's very popular.

2456
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
The story is about a guy who dies and gets transported to an RPG-esque world.

2457
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Interesting.

2458
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Speaking of animes, did you know that Ingress anime is finally coming out in the US?

2459
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Yeah, isn't that coming out soon?

2460
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Finally. It was supposed to come out last year in late November.

2461
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
I think it's been out in Japan.

2462
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
It's already done in Japan, I think.

2463
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Finally hitting Netflix, I think, the end of April is when that's finally coming out.

2464
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
It better have the option for subtitles.

2465
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

2466
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Most of the Netflix anime stuff is pretty good about that.

2467
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
So anyway, let's get to our mailbag every week.

2468
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
You guys email us.

2469
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2470
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
and we read our favorite emails here on the air.

2471
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
And do we get it? We got one, right?

2472
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
We got one. There's one.

2473
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Okay, just one. All right.

2474
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
And it's actually subject line is, oh, man.

2475
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Uh-oh.

2476
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I had zero interest in the Toy-Con elephant set

2477
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:18,000
until they showed what was essentially Tilt Brush with it,

2478
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
even if you can't walk around or through your artwork.

2479
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
And that comes from Robert M.

2480
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
That's it.

2481
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
That's it.

2482
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Thank you for keeping it short and sweet.

2483
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I'm sorry, I might have missed,

2484
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
because I was prepping for the next story over here.

2485
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Was there a question in there for us?

2486
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
No.

2487
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Just an observation.

2488
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Yeah. I mean,

2489
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
I guess it would be kind of cool to walk through your artwork,

2490
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
but I don't expect that on Nintendo.

2491
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Yeah.

2492
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I do wonder how, like,

2493
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I've been without this game, without Animal Crossing,

2494
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
for, like, essentially the last three months,

2495
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
and now I'm fucking addicted to it again.

2496
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Just wait until Animal Crossing is on the Switch.

2497
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Oh, fuck.

2498
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Our Switch is never gonna be at the house again

2499
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
while I'm, you know, at work.

2500
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
My wife, since...

2501
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
You didn't have to buy a second Switch.

2502
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
No. No, my wife, since...

2503
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
We didn't buy our first Switch.

2504
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Christmas, I got, you know, the kids their 2DSs,

2505
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
and I got them Animal Crossing on those.

2506
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Guess who's been playing Animal Crossing since

2507
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
they got their system.

2508
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,000
My youngest son hasn't had his 2DS for months now,

2509
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
because she's been playing Animal Crossing

2510
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,000
every day.

2511
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Good for her. Your wife's a gamer after all.

2512
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
How about that?

2513
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
She's gotta do something without any new Excite Truck.

2514
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
You know what you need to do?

2515
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
This is how you get her back.

2516
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
So next time she's sitting there on the couch

2517
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
playing the game, you just walk in there and go,

2518
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
games, games, games, games,

2519
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
because I remember she used to do that to you.

2520
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Well, she's doing that and watching the act on Hulu,

2521
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,000
so, you know.

2522
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Because she needs to get her drama-filled

2523
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
show with, you know.

2524
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I understand.

2525
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
That's why I watch MSNBC.

2526
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I need to get my weekly filled with drama every week.

2527
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Fucking A.

2528
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
There's been a lot of it this weekend.

2529
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
You know what? I can't stand MSNBC.

2530
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
I, I, I don't like it.

2531
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I can't stand MSNBC for the same reason

2532
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I can't stand Fox News.

2533
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
It's too, it's too at least-

2534
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Too skewed. Way too fucking skewed.

2535
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
If you deal with any news source that is too skewed,

2536
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
you are not going to get the whole story,

2537
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,000
so that's why I read BBC.

2538
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I also, I also don't,

2539
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
not to go too far down this road,

2540
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I don't, I also,

2541
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I kind of know that when I watch it,

2542
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
so I kind of have that perspective in mind,

2543
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
so I don't, like, let myself-

2544
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Yeah.

2545
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
be swayed.

2546
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I, the only reason I'm actually saying that

2547
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
is because there are people who take it as much gospel-

2548
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Oh, I'm sure.

2549
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,000
as some people take Fox News.

2550
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Oh, I'm sure.

2551
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
So, as I warn everybody,

2552
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
this is your PSA of the evening

2553
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
and not just educational radio.

2554
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Take everything that you see with a grain of salt

2555
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
and research, research, research.

2556
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
But if it's on Wikipedia, it's true.

2557
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
That's a joke. That's a joke.

2558
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
All right.

2559
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Moving on, we got some more news for you guys,

2560
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
and we're going to try to squeeze in some calls.

2561
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
We're running a little long tonight,

2562
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
just some good discussion here happening in the studio.

2563
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Um, so we will have time for Discord stuff,

2564
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
um, and if you want to call us, uh, the show, uh, via Discord,

2565
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
you can by joining our green room,

2566
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
but I am going to warn,

2567
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
it probably is going to be a short segment tonight

2568
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
for that part, so have your question ready to go,

2569
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
and you can, uh, tell us what you're going to talk about-

2570
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
You also want FUs.

2571
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Huh?

2572
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
I do also want an FU.

2573
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
You want an FU?

2574
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Can we do that closer to the Discord segment?

2575
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Sure.

2576
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Okay, let's get to- remind me,

2577
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
don't let me end the show without it.

2578
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Uh, let's get to some more news.

2579
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Loki.

2580
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Yes, and so Epic had a presentation they did at GDC as well

2581
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
and made a bunch of announcements of games

2582
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
that are exclusive to the Epic Games Store coming soon.

2583
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
So, for example, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls,

2584
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:43,000
and Detroit Become Human are coming to PC,

2585
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
but those are exclusive to the store.

2586
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Aside from that, they announced ten other games as well.

2587
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:54,000
So they have After Party, The Cycle, Dauntless,

2588
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Industries of Titan, Journey to the Savage Planet,

2589
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Kain, Phoenix Point, The Sinking City, Spellbreak,

2590
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:08,000
and Solar Ash are all going to be exclusive on the store,

2591
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:14,000
and Ancestors, The Humankind Odyssey as well.

2592
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
So...

2593
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I'm kind of all about Detroit and that coming to PC.

2594
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
It's not even the Epic Games Store.

2595
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:26,000
I mean, whatever, they're wheeling and dealing or whatever,

2596
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
but the fact that these games are coming out on PC is kind of cool.

2597
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Yeah.

2598
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:33,000
So, because, you know, that was one of those games I meant to play on PS4

2599
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
and I just kind of never got around to.

2600
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
But I wonder if when it comes out on PC,

2601
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,000
they'll cut the price on PS4 just to be like that.

2602
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2603
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:46,000
But anyways, yeah, so there's that.

2604
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Questbuster in chat says,

2605
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Damn, Industries of Titan and Sinking City.

2606
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
So some folks have their eyes on...

2607
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,000
They also threw a lot of shade on Steam as well

2608
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
because they were talking about how they're going to really monitor

2609
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
what gets uploaded to their store.

2610
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
They're not going to include porn or...

2611
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Well, but they also, like, they don't have the door wide open

2612
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
that anybody can publish a game.

2613
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:14,000
And you've got to wonder if when Epic gets more and more games,

2614
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:17,000
there might be calls to have a more open door

2615
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
where you can publish your own thing on Epic

2616
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
and if they'll have a solution.

2617
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Because, you know, Steam's kind of been trying these different solutions

2618
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
like the project.

2619
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I think they really should just go back to the previous solution

2620
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,000
because that was better than it was now.

2621
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
And now it's really not good.

2622
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
You have to know the right people to get in the Epic Store.

2623
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Because there's so much crap on there,

2624
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,000
but I guess neither are the perfect solutions.

2625
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I don't know.

2626
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,000
To be continued, to be developed.

2627
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Also, always under renovations is the game Heroes of the Storm,

2628
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,000
which, you know, the community's been facing a lot of kicks in the butt

2629
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
lately with the whole fact that, you know, the esports

2630
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:03,000
was kind of sunsetted, the official one anyway.

2631
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:06,000
And it sounds like a lot of the development on this game

2632
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
is going to kind of go more into support mode

2633
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
as opposed to like develop a lot of new stuff.

2634
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I mean, not to say they won't ever do new Heroes and stuff,

2635
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
but it has been a while since they've announced a new Hero.

2636
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I don't know.

2637
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
So the game might kind of be moving into a stable state.

2638
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
But anyway, the news this week is that

2639
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
they're going to be changing the way loot boxes work.

2640
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
You know, Heroes of the Storm does have loot boxes,

2641
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
but it was a free game.

2642
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
So I think a lot of people feel,

2643
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
all right, you can do loot boxes or games free.

2644
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:34,000
But you're actually not going to be able to pay for loot boxes anymore.

2645
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Gems, which are the pay currency,

2646
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,000
will no longer be usable to get loot boxes.

2647
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,000
You have to earn loot boxes in game by leveling up and all that stuff,

2648
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
or you use the currency that you get in the game,

2649
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
the gold in the game, to buy those loot boxes.

2650
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:54,000
So you can no longer buy with pay currency loot boxes.

2651
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
So that kind of begs the question,

2652
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
where is this game going to make their money?

2653
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
It's money then.

2654
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Well, don't forget, the things that you get in the loot boxes

2655
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
are still things you can buy piecemeal on the store.

2656
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
You can buy new heroes.

2657
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:11,000
You can buy new skins, new mounts, announcers, things like that.

2658
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
You can buy all those things with the gems.

2659
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,000
It's just they are taking out the random chance fun box,

2660
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,000
which I must admit, I have never purchased.

2661
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Pretty much any time I did drop money on Heroes of the Storm,

2662
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
and I have spent a little money on Heroes of the Storm,

2663
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I bought, they had a sale on an Uber bundle with a hero amount

2664
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
and a couple of things, and I was like,

2665
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
okay, for 20 bucks, I'll get that.

2666
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
And that's about the most money I've spent on Heroes of the Storm.

2667
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,000
I've probably spent about as much money on Heroes of the Storm

2668
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:40,000
as I would have on a retail game release,

2669
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
and I got a lot of enjoyment out of that game.

2670
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I haven't been playing it as much lately,

2671
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:48,000
but there's just been other things, like Overwatch.

2672
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I need to play Overwatch again and play that new hero,

2673
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
which looks really cool.

2674
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

2675
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Well, last but not least of my things here,

2676
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,000
we have The Return of Obra Dinn, which is a fun name.

2677
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,000
It won quite a few awards at Game Developers Conference.

2678
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:11,000
And that one was actually developed by Lucas Pope,

2679
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
who did Papers, Please, and you know how well that game took off.

2680
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Oh, yeah.

2681
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:19,000
But it won, basically the game is about discovering,

2682
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:25,000
you know, just different things that happen while sailing a ship.

2683
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
It won the best narrative.

2684
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:31,000
It also won the IGF Grand Prize in Excellence in Narrative.

2685
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:37,000
And also Game of the Year was, I just had it a second ago,

2686
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
was God of War.

2687
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:43,000
It sounds like as far as the more indie development goes,

2688
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,000
this guy, you know, because Papers, Please was kind of,

2689
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,000
you know, it was a very interesting game.

2690
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
It was kind of a commentary in some ways.

2691
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
So that being directly in your face about it,

2692
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
it was definitely a commentary on some things in culture.

2693
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
So it sounds like this guy is getting pretty good

2694
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
at making thought-provoking games.

2695
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
It sounds like that's what this new one's doing.

2696
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Well, here are the Game Developers Choice winners.

2697
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
For Best Audio, Celeste.

2698
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000

02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000

2700
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000

2702
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Narrative was The Return of Obra Dinn.

2703
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Best Technology was Red Dead Redemption 2.

2704
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I guess it must be all the horse penis.

2705
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
The graphics are pretty stunning in that game, so.

2706
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Best Visuals is Grease,

2707
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
which I'm actually looking to play, GRIS.

2708
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I'm actually planning on trying to stream that one,

2709
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
because I haven't been able to get the Super Nintendo hooked up yet.

2710
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
We have to clean out that office a lot.

2711
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:37,000
The Best VR AR Game is Beat Saber.

2712
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Audience Award is Beat Saber.

2713
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Game of the Year is God of War.

2714
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Pioneer Award, Reiko Kodama.

2715
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Lifetime Achievement Award is Amy Hennig.

2716
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:49,000
And for the Independent Games Festival winners,

2717
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
we have, for the Seamus McNally Grand Prize,

2718
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Return of the Obra Dinn.

2719
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Excellence in Visual Art is Mirror Drop.

2720
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Excellence in Audio is Paratropic.

2721
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Excellence in Design is Opus Magnum.

2722
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Excellence in Narrative is Return of the Obra Dinn.

2723
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,000
A Nuevo Award that's given to unusual experimental games

2724
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
is Black Room, which I wanted to look into.

2725
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
And Best Student Game is After Hours.

2726
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
So, there you go.

2727
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
That's pretty cool that you have an award ceremony

2728
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,000
that really honors student-developed games,

2729
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
all the way to AAA stuff like God of War.

2730
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
So, I really feel like we got a full spectrum

2731
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
of different development sites here.

2732
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Indeed.

2733
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,000
That's cool.

2734
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Questbuster pointing out, as far as Papers, Please go,

2735
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:31,000
the Papers, Please short film on Steam is also really good.

2736
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I heard they were making a movie out of it,

2737
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,000
but it wasn't like a...

2738
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
So, I never saw the finished product.

2739
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,000
I'll have to check that out.

2740
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Sounds interesting.

2741
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Yeah.

2742
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:43,000
But there's just quite a number of things

2743
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
that I'm going to be checking out that came out of GDC.

2744
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,000
So...

2745
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Cool.

2746
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
And hopefully some folks here in studio.

2747
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
That would be great.

2748
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I'd love that.

2749
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Actually.

2750
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Or via Skype, if need be.

2751
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Or, excuse me, Discord.

2752
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Well, I can still do Skype on demand, if need be,

2753
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
if our guests have to do it.

2754
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:02,000
To go ahead and point this out,

2755
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
I'm actually planning on working on something

2756
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
with somebody else, and that's all I can say about it.

2757
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
That was an announcement of an announcement,

2758
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
if I ever heard one.

2759
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
All right.

2760
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
We're going to do something with someone.

2761
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
We're going to do something with somebody at some time,

2762
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:19,000
and you won't know when, but you're going to love it.

2763
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
All right.

2764
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys,

2765
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
then we're going to get to the listener round table.

2766
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
If you have some questions for us in chat,

2767
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
or you want to join our green room in Discord,

2768
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
again, I'm not going to wait all night.

2769
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
So, if the green room stays empty, then so be it.

2770
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
But get in there, if you want to give us a call

2771
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
First, we just have a couple more stories for you guys.

2772
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Loki.

2773
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:43,000
So, you may remember that they had developed at one time,

2774
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,000
I don't know, it wasn't necessarily a mod,

2775
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:52,000
it was more of a multiplayer co-op version of Mario 64.

2776
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Yes, because Nintendo shut that shit down,

2777
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,000
but they put Wario in it, or Waluigi in it.

2778
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Well, they brought it, I think they brought it back too,

2779
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
and Nintendo tried to shut it down.

2780
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I think it's still out there.

2781
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Well, it was one of those once on the internet,

2782
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
always on the internet sorts of things.

2783
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:10,000
So now, there is a new mod, that's now for Zelda,

2784
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Ocarina of Time, they call it OOT Online,

2785
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:18,000
and it allows co-op for two to fifteen players.

2786
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
What would you do with fifteen people in Ocarina of Time?

2787
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I don't know, but they have video footage showing

2788
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
what they could possibly do with it.

2789
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
So, I don't know.

2790
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I watched some of the video, and it was a lot of two people.

2791
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,000
I don't think they showed more than two at a time.

2792
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Yeah, and it's kind of...

2793
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
It was neat.

2794
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Yeah, it looks like it's still early.

2795
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I mean, some of the animations aren't really coming over too well,

2796
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
but it's neat that you can do that.

2797
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Right, for sure.

2798
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
They found a way to shoehorn it in there,

2799
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:53,000
but I'd be curious to see what more they can do with this,

2800
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
and also if Waluigi is going to be in here.

2801
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Well, they just patched Waluigi in.

2802
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Why? Because.

2803
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
All right.

2804
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,000
And this is also very exciting news.

2805
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I don't know why I saved...

2806
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Maybe I saved the best for last.

2807
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I don't know.

2808
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
But it looks like, you know what's coming back?

2809
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Lucasfilm Games is going to be making a comeback.

2810
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
I saw that.

2811
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Loom 2?

2812
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Oh, God.

2813
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
We can only hope.

2814
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Anyway, here's the deal.

2815
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:16,000
No, no.

2816
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Before we just blatantly make stuff up, here's the deal.

2817
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Disney has posted some job listings for some new Lucasfilm games.

2818
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:26,000
And especially when we've heard stories about layoff, layoff, layoff,

2819
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
this could be a great thing for some of those people

2820
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
to hopefully get there on the ground somewhere else,

2821
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,000
and this could be pretty cool.

2822
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:35,000
So Disney Careers, which is the official website for Disney postings

2823
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:39,000
and things like that, they are showing positions at Lucasfilm Games.

2824
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Now, this has been in the news before,

2825
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
because I guess Lucasfilm Games was looking for people in 2017,

2826
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,000
but it does seem like things are picking up,

2827
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:52,000
because some of the job listings actually mention Nintendo Switch

2828
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,000
as a potential platform.

2829
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Now, some places that are running with this story

2830
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,000
get into this whole talk about Star Wars games

2831
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
and how EA's kind of had the lock on Star Wars,

2832
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
and what have they done with it in seven years?

2833
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Like, two Battlefront games, that's it.

2834
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Ruined the Star Wars name?

2835
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Yeah, so some folks are wondering if Disney is either prepping

2836
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,000
for when that contract is over and they're going to make their own stuff.

2837
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I mean, I would assume, actually, they could probably make their own stuff

2838
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
at any time.

2839
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,000
That's probably part of the agreement.

2840
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:23,000
But, you know, still, once this EA thing ends, if it'll be reevaluated.

2841
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
But I also kind of say, you know,

2842
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Lucasfilm Games didn't just make Star Wars stuff.

2843
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I joked about Loom, but that was certainly a memorable game.

2844
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:38,000
They did the Indiana Jones PC adventure games, which was really good as well.

2845
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Maniac Mansion was them, wasn't it?

2846
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Maniac Mansion was them.

2847
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
They also had mercenaries, I think.

2848
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Monkey Island.

2849
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,000
We used to call it Mercenaries back in the day.

2850
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:55,000
So it may not be, even though, yes, it's Lucasfilm,

2851
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
but, you know, also Lucas isn't strictly involved in Star Wars.

2852
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Can we get Maniac Mansion right in Disneyland now?

2853
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
That'd be kind of cool.

2854
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:06,000
But, yeah, I'm curious to see what they're doing,

2855
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
and I'm curious if it's even Star Wars at all.

2856
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Everybody's assuming it is, but maybe it's not.

2857
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Maybe it's going to be something different.

2858
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Why can't we have both?

2859
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Yeah, why not? Why not both?

2860
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:20,000
So, anyway, Questbuster in chat says,

2861
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
the hiring position seemed to show that the new Lucasfilm

2862
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:25,000
is going to be like a branding watchdog, at least for now.

2863
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:28,000
It would be nice to see a new Dark Forces, though.

2864
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:32,000
All right, well, we are to the part of the show

2865
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
where we're going to do the Listen Around table,

2866
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:39,000
and I don't believe I saw anybody in our Discord waiting to call in,

2867
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
but I'll give it just a couple more minutes there.

2868
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Just a couple more minutes for now.

2869
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,000
If you do want to call the show,

2870
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:47,000
go to our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2871
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
That'll get you that invite right away into the server,

2872
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
and you're going to join the green room,

2873
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
and then you can mention in the Orange Launch Radio channel

2874
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
what you want to talk about, and that would be great.

2875
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:59,000
So we have an idea of what you are wanting to talk to us about tonight.

2876
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
But currently nobody's there,

2877
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
and I mentioned we are running a little long anyway,

2878
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
so maybe just people are shy tonight.

2879
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I don't know.

2880
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
But if you have a quick question,

2881
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:12,000
you can also ask in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

2882
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:15,000
While we wait to see if anything pops up there in chat or in Discord,

2883
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
do we have any last-minute stories to cover?

2884
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Yeah, the Atari VCS console's been delayed

2885
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:24,000
because they say they're improving specs of what's going in the console.

2886
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Totally forgot Atari was making a new console thing.

2887
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
So yeah, I totally forgot this.

2888
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:34,000
They say now it's going to be a new Vega graphics-based AMD Ryzen processor.

2889
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:39,000
So yeah, now we don't know when that's coming.

2890
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I think they said the end of 2019 now.

2891
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Alright, we'll have to wait and see if that's even worth it at this point,

2892
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,000
but whatever.

2893
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:54,000
And then kind of once we were talking about indies and stuff like that

2894
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
and different direct type things,

2895
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Microsoft is doing an ID at Xbox Game Pass thing

2896
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:10,000
that's going to be streamed on March 26th at 9 p.m. Pacific

2897
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,000
to showcase some indie games coming to that platform as well.

2898
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:17,000
So we'll have to take a look at those when those come out.

2899
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Yeah, I'm kind of curious what their response will be

2900
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
because Microsoft's got a lot of good indie stuff on it.

2901
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Before we get to the next story, though,

2902
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:26,000
we have a question in our chat for this segment from Dark Tetsuya who says,

2903
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Did y'all see that DDR Ace 20 or A20 finally launched?

2904
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Apparently there's a Konami 50th anniversary song in it

2905
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:37,000
with nods to Gradius and Yirr Kung Fu.

2906
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
I'd love to hear that song.

2907
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Do they still put rips from the arcade online somewhere?

2908
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Yes, yes.

2909
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,000
On like Bimani style or something?

2910
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I'm sure it's on YouTube.

2911
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Oh, yeah, it's probably on YouTube somewhere.

2912
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Check that out. I want to hear that song.

2913
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Have they said anything about when we get that over here in the States?

2914
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Is it just location testing right now?

2915
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Or is it like the official launch?

2916
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I think it's launched already because it's like they've got...

2917
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
I would have thought they'd wait until 20 November.

2918
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Actual cabinets and everything.

2919
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
I think it's just...

2920
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
I don't know if it's like a software upgrade that they're doing

2921
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,000
to some of the other cabinets.

2922
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I know that they have the new gold cabinets as well.

2923
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:14,000
But if all of the Ace machines are going to turn the Ace 20s

2924
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,000
or how that works now that we live in this digital age

2925
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
with even arcade games.

2926
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Yeah, I'd be curious.

2927
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
So Dark Tetsuya says he'll put it on the Discord

2928
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
so we can... and that the game is officially out.

2929
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
It's not a location test. It's officially out.

2930
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,000
I definitely want to hear the song.

2931
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:30,000
I would play it on air, but I've got to be content matching

2932
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,000
and all that. I've got to be careful because I don't want to get

2933
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:37,000
a stream muted for the people that do watch the archives.

2934
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Which you can do, by the way.

2935
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Cheap plug.

2936
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:42,000
If you are a subscriber of our channel here at VOG Network,

2937
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
you get access to the video archives of Orange Ontario,

2938
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:48,000
The Bobby Black Wolf Show, and anything else we might be doing in the future.

2939
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Which, by the way, there may be a special thing on Thursday.

2940
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I'm just waiting on the final kind of thing on that.

2941
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:58,000
But stay tuned to my personal Twitter as well as the VOG Network Twitter.

2942
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
My personal Twitter is at MrRobRoberts.

2943
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:03,000
We may have a thing on the stream on Thursday night.

2944
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,000
And I'm waiting on the T's to get crossed and the I's to get dotted.

2945
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
And a little bit ahead of PAX East.

2946
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:11,000
We're all guessing that Borderlands 3 is going to be announced.

2947
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Yes.

2948
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
But it may not be Borderlands 3.

2949
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
It may be actually Borderlands Game of the Year edition.

2950
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Now, I know what you're saying, but wait.

2951
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Borderlands Game of the Year edition?

2952
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
That already came out several years ago.

2953
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Not on the Switch.

2954
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
It's... no, it's not coming on the Switch.

2955
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,000
PC?

2956
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Well, they say that now it's been rated for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2957
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:34,000
They're saying that it's going to be a remaster, possibly, of the original Borderlands game.

2958
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,000
And I know what you're thinking.

2959
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Well, wait a second.

2960
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Didn't I already purchase a remaster of Borderlands games?

2961
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
The Handsome Jack collection?

2962
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Yes, you did.

2963
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:44,000
But that was two and technically the third game.

2964
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Pre-sequel.

2965
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:48,000
So this is going to be the first game.

2966
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
And then, oh, this is oh so nice.

2967
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:57,000
In-game purchases are a thing that they have flagged on here for Borderlands Game of the Year.

2968
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Which is weird because the Game of the Year edition should have all of the fucking content in it.

2969
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:04,000
So why am I having to make purchases for things?

2970
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Because maybe they're going to still have the two and the pre-sequel remaster available within this game.

2971
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
It's just a touch of a button.

2972
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:17,000
You can get the Handsome Jack collection for less than $15.

2973
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
True, that's true.

2974
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,000
No point.

2975
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Fifth Dream Today says maybe new things.

2976
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Maybe not the same DLC.

2977
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Maybe they're going back.

2978
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I don't really want a remaster for the first game.

2979
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Do Borderlands 3, you cowards.

2980
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Yes, do a third game.

2981
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Or do another, I don't know, a Borderlands prequel or something.

2982
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
They already did a fucking prequel.

2983
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Borderlands 3 or GTFO.

2984
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
No, it was a pre-sequel.

2985
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:42,000
And I say that with the freaking poster hanging behind me here.

2986
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Three or get out.

2987
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I don't want a remaster.

2988
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Anyway, Tigerclass says they're milking that franchise for all it's worth.

2989
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
SG100Matt says Borderlands 2 had that bullshit too.

2990
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:56,000
If Fifth Dream Today said maybe the newer characters in the first game.

2991
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
That'd be cool.

2992
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:03,000
And SG100Matt says if you got the season pass for Borderlands 2, you didn't get the pre-order bonus content.

2993
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:07,000
This has nothing to do with any of that, but it's definitely relevant to our interests.

2994
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Akira Yamaoka just posted on Facebook because I follow him on Facebook.

2995
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Yeah, me too.

2996
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:17,000
A poster. This is Akira Yamaoka, Pantera.

2997
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
So either he's working with Pantera.

2998
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
That's badass, if true.

2999
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Or is something...

3000
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I think he's working with Pantera looking by the logo.

3001
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Is he gonna produce the...

3002
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Dude, it would make total sense as a band. Pantera probably played the old Silent Hill games and was like...

3003
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Far Beyond Driven. Yes, it is. He's working with Pantera.

3004
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Wow. That's pretty cool.

3005
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
So...

3006
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Oh, you know what? Never mind. I know what this is.

3007
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Okay, so I just figured out what it was. I went looking it up and there's a Pantera ad generator.

3008
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
A font generator thing.

3009
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,000
So apparently Akira Yamaoka just played with it.

3010
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
That's...

3011
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
It's a fucking font.

3012
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
My emotional roller coaster here.

3013
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I know.

3014
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:04,000
This is that clip from Roller Coaster Tycoon.

3015
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Where they're like...

3016
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,000
And then the coaster's going, everybody's having fun, and then the track just ends.

3017
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
I was excited about it too.

3018
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Because I was like, holy shit, working with Pantera, that's fucking awesome.

3019
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Akira Yamaoka's working with Pantera.

3020
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:25,000
And then I just double checked the logo.

3021
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,000
And yeah, it looks like it's a Pantera meme generator.

3022
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,000
That's set for Far Beyond Driven.

3023
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Our chat room is laughing their ass off too.

3024
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Yeah, it's...

3025
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
I just double checked it.

3026
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
I'll link the logo generator, but fuck.

3027
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:49,000
And Chad says, what the fuck, I was lied to.

3028
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Act F says, I feel betrayed.

3029
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Look.

3030
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
It's Facebook.

3031
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Nothing on Facebook is real.

3032
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:02,000
I was just like, because usually when people do something like that,

3033
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:07,000
it's just like a splash.

3034
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Something to get you interested in.

3035
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:12,000
And that wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility.

3036
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Yeah, I don't normally buy Pantera albums,

3037
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:18,000
but that one I would probably catch my attention.

3038
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
But it's also like a fucking old ass album.

3039
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Well, old ass, I say this.

3040
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
It's from 1994.

3041
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Fun fact, that would make it 25 years old this year.

3042
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Anyway, all right.

3043
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Well, I don't see anybody else in the green room,

3044
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
and I don't see any other questions in chat.

3045
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
How very dear you all.

3046
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,000
I think it's about time to wrap up the show.

3047
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Unless we have other last minute stories we didn't get to yet. Sorry.

3048
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Oh, no, I'm just watching the new trailer for Earth Defense Force Iron Rain,

3049
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,000
which I totally need to get because it looks very awesome.

3050
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:52,000
My friend's cat's named Pantera.

3051
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
All right.

3052
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
We're going to wrap up the show.

3053
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,000
We're going to wrap up the show, get everybody's final thoughts,

3054
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
and then we'll head on out of here for the night.

3055
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,000
But, again, as always, I want to thank you guys for listening to Orange On Radio.

3056
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Whether you watched us live on Twitch here or Sunday nights

3057
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
at the Voice Geeks Network, VOG Network,

3058
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:14,000
or if you downloaded our show free on iTunes or Google Play

3059
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:18,000
or wherever it is you listen to podcasts, really appreciate it.

3060
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:21,000
As we say here on the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

3061
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3062
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,000
If the voices aren't here in our Discord waiting to be on the show,

3063
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
then we can't share them with the world.

3064
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
So please help us spread the word.

3065
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
I'm posting the poster I just made on my fan page.

3066
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Okay, you do that.

3067
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3068
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Well, is that your final thought, Dark Sakura?

3069
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
I had a F-you, but I forgot.

3070
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Oh, yeah, I'll use it as my final thought then.

3071
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
It's not really a F-you.

3072
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
For all the people who says, oh, I went shopping today,

3073
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:51,000
or, oh, I had my nails done, or, oh, I did this,

3074
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:55,000
and say it's self-care, it's not self-care, that's pampering yourself.

3075
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Self-care is doing the things every day that maintain your physical and mental health,

3076
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:07,000
meaning getting out of bed, taking your vitamins, walking, doing some exercise,

3077
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
leaving the house, getting enough sleep.

3078
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:13,000
What if, and I mean this is a totally legit question, what if,

3079
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:18,000
because I did this last week, what if I like canceled plans with somebody

3080
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:21,000
because I was just so burned out and exhausted?

3081
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:24,000
That is something that contributes to your ongoing well-being.

3082
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Okay.

3083
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Because you have to have, now that's perfect self-care.

3084
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
That's taking care of your mental state.

3085
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:33,000
But just going out and doing something for momentary pleasure,

3086
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:37,000
that does not constitute real self-care.

3087
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
That's just treating yourself, okay?

3088
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,000
You know, if you go, say, get a massage because your back hurts,

3089
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:49,000
that's something that contributes to your ongoing physical and mental health,

3090
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,000
as an example.

3091
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:56,000
And for someone who is personally dealing with trauma, myself,

3092
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:01,000
who has been through a lot of these, doing something nice for yourself is fine,

3093
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
but it's not therapy.

3094
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,000
And Peso Pacas in chat says, treat yourself too, though.

3095
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Treat yourself for sure.

3096
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:09,000
That is something that's a momentary uplifting.

3097
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Did you see a gold sparkly hat that you want to own, by all means?

3098
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Wear it around in Target for 20 minutes and then buy it.

3099
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Or don't.

3100
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:20,000
But I'm saying, but also on the same thing,

3101
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,000
if you are, say, financially struggling and you see the hat,

3102
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,000
and you're like, but you know what, that $5 I'm going to spend on this hat

3103
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,000
could go into my groceries, that also is self-care,

3104
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
being fiscally responsible.

3105
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Just saying.

3106
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,000
All right.

3107
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Some words of wisdom from Auntie Dark Sakura.

3108
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Appreciate that.

3109
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Bitches.

3110
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Let's see, I'll do my final thought and then we'll do Logie's final thought.

3111
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:47,000
My final thought is I need to do about eight more minutes of walking today.

3112
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:51,000
So I'm going to go out on a night walk after the show,

3113
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
and I'm going to hope I don't get stabbed.

3114
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:57,000
What is it with everybody thinking they're going to get stabbed in these neighborhoods?

3115
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:01,000
My wife's like, well, I could go for a walk today, but I might be murdered.

3116
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
I'm like, no one wants to murder you.

3117
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
You won't have any valuables on you.

3118
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
It's daytime.

3119
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
No one's going to murder you.

3120
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,000
I will say that for-

3121
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:12,000
That was a nice thing to say to your wife. Nobody wants to kill you.

3122
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:19,000
I will say for women, it is a very real concern for us that we are at a higher risk than men usually are.

3123
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
But that's not what she's saying it for.

3124
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
She's saying it for her because she wants me to go walk with her,

3125
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:26,000
and I don't want to because I already walked three miles earlier in the day,

3126
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,000
and I don't feel like going out for yet another three-mile walk.

3127
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I think although what Dark Sakura's saying is certainly valid,

3128
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:37,000
I think that is not quite the frame of reference that your wife is using.

3129
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Right.

3130
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,000
I get it. I get it.

3131
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,000
All right.

3132
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
And then that was my final thought.

3133
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
So what's your final thought, Logie?

3134
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:49,000
My final thought is I'll keep working on my game.

3135
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
I'm not going to show you guys.

3136
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Sounds good.

3137
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
You don't get to see it.

3138
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Sounds good.

3139
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Drop it on us like a surprise.

3140
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:58,000
I just want you to come in here one day and go, bam, here's my game.

3141
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Here's my game.

3142
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Well, bam, there's our podcast for this week.

3143
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:05,000
We'll be back to do it in seven days with whatever happens in gaming news next week,

3144
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:09,000
possibly some type of Borderlands news, some we're going to hear about the next week.

3145
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:12,000
PAX is going on next week, right? PAX East?

3146
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Yes, PAX East.

3147
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
So those of you guys still in Boston, right?

3148
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:19,000
I haven't been to PAX East in like, God, six, five, six years.

3149
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
So those of you that are going to Boston this weekend,

3150
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
have a ton of fun and don't get in too much trouble,

3151
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
and we'll have some of the news that comes out of that next week.

3152
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
So we will see you in seven days.

3153
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Good night, everybody.

3154
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:33,000
