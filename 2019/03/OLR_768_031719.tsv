0	28000	This week on the heels of the shakeup of gaming companies as we know them, the Legend of Android Gaming Machines returns. Let's just hope it doesn't follow the same path as Uya did. This is just one new alphabet initiative. Join us for more of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
58000	60000	I got a gamer hat on too, look!
60000	62000	It's a Klonoa hat.
62000	64000	Oh it's a Klonoa hat.
64000	66000	It's an official Klonoa hat.
66000	68000	I thought it was just Pac-Man because I can only see the one side. Awesome.
68000	70000	Very cool.
70000	72000	Because he has Pac-Man on his hat.
72000	74000	And Techmaster Loki of course is here as always.
74000	76000	Nothing video game themed on.
76000	78000	What's your shirt?
78000	80000	I couldn't see on the side.
80000	82000	I'm getting a whole bunch of new shirts this week.
82000	84000	Nothing green. Pinch. Pinch.
84000	86000	You see this?
86000	88000	Do you see this world?
88000	90000	I have green on my Apple Watch.
90000	92000	Happy St. Patrick's Day
92000	94000	to those of you that are in the mood for this season.
94000	96000	Or some of my friends call it
96000	98000	Straight Pride.
98000	100000	Oh it's an oatmeal shirt.
100000	102000	I'll explain this in a minute.
102000	104000	You know whenever gay pride gets brought up
104000	106000	there's always that troll that says
106000	108000	here you go, today's your day.
108000	110000	Celebrate. Enjoy your moment.
110000	112000	Every day.
112000	114000	Is white people straight pride?
114000	116000	All those characteristics are really
116000	118000	on display today. Have you been down to downtown today?
118000	120000	Have you been down K Street?
120000	122000	I avoided it like the plague you.
122000	124000	Anyhow.
124000	126000	So the shirt I'm wearing for the sake of the podcasters.
126000	128000	We are a podcast but we do tape
128000	130000	live at Twitch TV every Sunday night
130000	132000	at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 Eastern
132000	134000	at the Voice of Geeks Network.
134000	136000	VoGnetwork.com or VoGnetwork.com
136000	138000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
138000	140000	So the shirt I'm actually wearing
140000	142000	is a Beat the Blurch shirt
142000	144000	from when they did those marathons a couple years ago.
144000	146000	Okay here's the funny thing behind this.
146000	148000	So I actually didn't run the marathon.
148000	150000	I was all signed up, ready to go.
150000	152000	I got super sick the night before.
152000	154000	And it wasn't one of those like
154000	156000	ugh I'm sick
156000	158000	and I don't think I can go.
158000	160000	No I was like
160000	162000	sick. So it wasn't happening.
162000	164000	So my pal Melody went and she brought back this shirt
164000	166000	so it's really funny because it says I beat the Blurch
166000	168000	and I ran 5k and it's like no you didn't hoe.
168000	170000	But oh well I still have the shirt
170000	172000	and it's one of the only green things I own so
172000	174000	it seemed appropriate to wear tonight.
174000	176000	A little warm for today though. We did get quite
176000	178000	toasty. I have
178000	180000	not been outside all day. How sad is that?
180000	182000	I foraged today. Did you?
182000	184000	For dandelion greens. Okay.
184000	186000	Well it was definitely
186000	188000	eaten a lot in the US during the Depression
188000	190000	because people ain't got no money
190000	192000	for food. But dandelions
192000	194000	the leaves are full of calcium
194000	196000	and iron and the
196000	198000	blossoms are actually edible as
198000	200000	well. Good source of fiber and beta carotene.
200000	202000	Are you vegan? No. Fuck no.
202000	204000	Okay. Hey listeners
204000	206000	do you see this? A little
206000	208000	traditional dish. This is
208000	210000	dead boiled cow.
210000	212000	And it has been in my mouth
212000	214000	it is almost as salty as I am.
214000	216000	Right. Almost. Almost.
216000	218000	Almost. But nothing can meet
218000	220000	those levels besides dead maybe the
220000	222000	ocean. Boiled bovine.
222000	224000	Anyhow. Hello to
224000	226000	everybody in our chat room because again
226000	228000	we do tape live at twitch.tv
228000	230000	slash vog network and we do have
230000	232000	lots of folks in chat. Some folks
232000	234000	also noticing on twitch tonight we did a special
234000	236000	our border tonight is green.
236000	238000	Just a little wink and a nod to the day
238000	240000	today and Bobby joined in on that too
240000	242000	so that was kind of fun. So yeah there you go.
242000	244000	Let's get into some video game discussion.
244000	246000	After all we are a show that talks about video game
246000	248000	and gaming culture. And I
248000	250000	guess this first kick off topic tonight is
250000	252000	a little bit about gamer culture. But this
252000	254000	has been all over the news. In fact I'm looking at an article
254000	256000	that actually came in on Reuters
256000	258000	about this. And it has to do with
258000	260000	influencers.
260000	262000	Influencers. And those people
262000	264000	that can influence people. I hope the camera
264000	266000	can pick up my eyes rolling.
266000	268000	It's a little further back now Loki.
268000	270000	You might have to roll them really good. That's why I'm just
270000	272000	subtitling
272000	274000	that with my eyes are rolling.
274000	276000	Before I even say the name
276000	278000	of the influencer why are you rolling your eyes
278000	280000	over here. Because it's not a non story.
280000	282000	I mean obviously you pay people
282000	284000	like any brand you pay people
284000	286000	to sponsor stuff.
286000	288000	Alright let me tell you what you're talking about.
288000	290000	So long story short
290000	292000	Ninja whose real name is Tyler
292000	294000	Blevins it seems like was
294000	296000	paid one million dollars
296000	298000	to promote
298000	300000	Apex Legends which
300000	302000	one might argue successful
302000	304000	campaign because Apex Legends has
304000	306000	been doing very well for itself. Not necessarily because he did it though.
306000	308000	That's true. You don't know if it's
308000	310000	because of him or just because of the strength of
310000	312000	the game itself. I think it's the game.
312000	314000	I think a big part of it is the game too.
314000	316000	I think
316000	318000	I want to get to the rest of the story but I think a big
318000	320000	part of Apex Legends success is
320000	322000	the fact that people were kind of
322000	324000	like I don't know about you guys but
324000	326000	like I can only be
326000	328000	sustained by one video game for so long.
328000	330000	And I've joked about this on the show before is that
330000	332000	I have and I don't mean to make light of like actual
332000	334000	conditions or anything. So if you can think of
334000	336000	a better name to call this and I'm open to it.
336000	338000	Oh my god. Let's not be so
338000	340000	super PC about everything.
340000	342000	Like we're going to start
342000	344000	now.
344000	346000	I'm just saying.
346000	348000	I have gamer ADD so I'll play
348000	350000	one thing for like five or ten minutes.
350000	352000	I am totally offended by that. My son
352000	354000	has ADD.
354000	356000	Actually ADHD.
356000	358000	I don't care. I'm just joking.
358000	360000	How about just general
360000	362000	lack of attention span.
362000	364000	My point is that I can only play one thing
364000	366000	for like five.
366000	368000	But you guys know I do this. I spend a bunch of
368000	370000	money on a game. I play it for a little bit and then it's like
370000	372000	on to the next game. There's very few games
372000	374000	that are able to hold my attention. Now
374000	376000	before because I'm sure there's chatters already
376000	378000	chiming in. What about the MMOs?
378000	380000	Because I do play things like Warcraft.
380000	382000	I play Final Fantasy 14.
382000	384000	And I kind of tend to stick to those for a long time.
384000	386000	But I think part of what makes those games a lot
386000	388000	different is the more social elements
388000	390000	of those games. But anyway.
390000	392000	I was getting to a point with this with Apex
392000	394000	Legends specifically. So with Apex Legends
394000	396000	the deal is that I think
396000	398000	a lot of folks who are
398000	400000	kind of like ready for the hot new thing after a couple
400000	402000	months. I think they were kind of done with Fortnite.
402000	404000	Not necessarily like done with Fortnite
404000	406000	like oh I'm over this game. But it's like
406000	408000	when this new kid shows up on the block that's
408000	410000	oh it's like a similar
410000	412000	formula but a little
412000	414000	different. And you know a different way of doing it.
414000	416000	Like I think a lot of people were like oh let's move
416000	418000	on to this. Because it's like kind of what I enjoy
418000	420000	but something new. Kind of
420000	422000	what happened to PUBG
422000	424000	once Fortnite came along.
424000	426000	Not to say either of those games are doing
426000	428000	terrible for themselves or not even like do well
428000	430000	but you know you can only be number
430000	432000	one for so long. Or maybe like not even
432000	434000	necessarily
434000	436000	Fortnite but like
436000	438000	maybe even Black Ops 4 or something like that.
438000	440000	There's lots of different games
440000	442000	out there. I think getting
442000	444000	Ninjas because he's very
444000	446000	well known for playing
446000	448000	Fortnite and whatnot.
448000	450000	And maybe the thought was okay
450000	452000	you get an influencer like this who has
452000	454000	a lot of the attention of the Fortnite crowd maybe
454000	456000	they'll see this and then want to try the game
456000	458000	out because it is free to play.
458000	460000	So I think that really helped a lot
460000	462000	is being that it's free and
462000	464000	not trying to sell you a $60 game that they're
464000	466000	going to throw the same type of microtransactions
466000	468000	and sort of monetization
468000	470000	schemes on top of.
470000	472000	Very true. I think the free thing really helps.
472000	474000	Although Bobby Blackwolf in our chat points
474000	476000	out PUBG was the
476000	478000	first big Twitch success story which I would
478000	480000	agree with. It wouldn't have gotten any traction if
480000	482000	they didn't have big Twitch streamers playing it.
482000	484000	Although PUBG wasn't free if I remember
484000	486000	right. It was kind of on the cheaper end of things.
486000	488000	PUBG isn't free yeah. Yeah it was like a $20
488000	490000	game I think when it was first in early access.
490000	492000	It's still. Yeah it's still. It's still like
492000	494000	20. They might have upped it a little bit.
494000	496000	Kind of like Minecraft. Remember Minecraft was cheaper
496000	498000	and then the price went up when it got really popular.
498000	500000	And I think PUBG is a very similar sort of
500000	502000	story. I think it was cheaper in the beginning than it is
502000	504000	now but it's not. It's certainly not $60.
504000	506000	It's still a budget title if you will.
506000	508000	Yeah. So and that
508000	510000	probably helps it as well.
510000	512000	Anyway.
512000	514000	Let's see. It was noted
514000	516000	that Ninja had
516000	518000	excuse me. Ninja
518000	520000	had tweeted about the game on February 5th
520000	522000	and then he had 13 million followers
522000	524000	on Twitch and went to play the game
524000	526000	on Twitch and he was paid for
526000	528000	1 million and this was according to a source
528000	530000	that gave that to Reuters.
530000	532000	I think that's how you pronounce that Reuters.
532000	534000	So anyhow and he may not have been the only one
534000	536000	that was actually paid
536000	538000	for this either.
538000	540000	It sounds like there may have been other folks too.
540000	542000	Yeah. So I mean
542000	544000	but this is the type of thing that they do
544000	546000	though. I mean even with like Battlefield
546000	548000	5 I think they had paid influencers as
548000	550000	well. There's
550000	552000	a lot of games that they have paid influencers
552000	554000	on and I think
554000	556000	the only reason it's notable is because it's like
556000	558000	oh it's a million dollars but I mean honestly
558000	560000	it's the same as like beauty care lines
560000	562000	paying celebrities to promote
562000	564000	their stuff on Instagram or whatever the
564000	566000	case may be. The same thing. Or paying
566000	568000	Kylie Jenner to promote Fyre Festival.
568000	570000	Yes exactly
570000	572000	like that. I'll be honest I mean even though
572000	574000	I'm not like a huge huge influencer
574000	576000	I got offered like
576000	578000	some crazy ass discount to
578000	580000	show off a cat ring.
580000	582000	I wanted to buy one anyway.
582000	584000	I mean the only reason that they were asking
584000	586000	people to pay for it is because the money goes back to charity
586000	588000	for homeless cats. So I was fine
588000	590000	doing it. So basically they were only charging
590000	592000	me the donation.
592000	594000	And
594000	596000	there's another
596000	598000	channel out there that's called Pretty
598000	600000	Pastel Please and she's in Australia
600000	602000	she used to work
602000	604000	actually she still works in advertising I think
604000	606000	but she talked about the whole influencer
606000	608000	thing and how it works behind the scenes too.
608000	610000	So it's exactly
610000	612000	there's a product to sell and there's someone that's streaming
612000	614000	it then
614000	616000	money's gonna go into
616000	618000	it. Right I mean and this isn't
618000	620000	gonna change it and it's a smarter
620000	622000	advertisement anyways because what are you gonna do actually put
622000	624000	out like TV advertisements or anything like
624000	626000	that. I mean it's
626000	628000	this is
628000	630000	this is the easiest way to get
630000	632000	to your target audience is by
632000	634000	going to where you know the
634000	636000	eyes are obviously twitch streamers
636000	638000	YouTube streamers
638000	640000	social
640000	642000	media platforms it's
642000	644000	gonna be it's basically targeted advertising
644000	646000	for this type of stuff and to put
646000	648000	stuff elsewhere
648000	650000	I mean doesn't really make sense
650000	652000	you're not gonna get as much of a return on
652000	654000	investment for that stuff so it just
654000	656000	makes sense. It's like I mean
656000	658000	to take it a lot more simply it's like when people choose
658000	660000	billboard placement they're gonna put
660000	662000	the billboards in the place
662000	664000	that the message needs to get out number one the most
664000	666000	like if it's for advertising not just the
666000	668000	you know y'all suck
668000	670000	you know you homophobes shut up. But I'm
670000	672000	talking about like the advertising ones
672000	674000	they're gonna put them like for restaurants
674000	676000	on the side of a highway so that
676000	678000	hungry people will go on
678000	680000	driving hangry and go get a burger
680000	682000	You know I think in the interest because you were talking
682000	684000	before I was having my coughing fit
684000	686000	sorry guys you were talking a minute
686000	688000	ago about how you've been offered this kind of
688000	690000	influence stuff and I think in the interest of disclosure
690000	692000	so is VOG Network and myself
692000	694000	personally in fact we're talking
694000	696000	about doing a game stream on
696000	698000	VOG Network right now with
698000	700000	a particular smaller publisher
700000	702000	but it's one of the it's a much smaller thing
702000	704000	it's like you know sure you give us an advanced
704000	706000	copy of your game for free we'll play it you know
706000	708000	for a couple hours just you know for the fun of it
708000	710000	you know because hey free game and you know
710000	712000	something that we can you know premiere to an audience
712000	714000	hopefully but I think
714000	716000	what strike I mean there there's also
716000	718000	I think a big step difference between that between
718000	720000	like you know ooh free game for playing
720000	722000	it early on stream and one
722000	724000	million dollars there's a big
724000	726000	big I'd do it for a million
726000	728000	right but
728000	730000	to be fair I mean
730000	732000	I don't want to sound like a bitter Betty either you know
732000	734000	it's very you can see how many people follow VOG
734000	736000	Network in my personal channel versus how many
736000	738000	people followed Ninja and it's very
738000	740000	very different
740000	742000	I would love it if 13 million people actually
742000	744000	I don't know if I would love it if 13 million people
744000	746000	followed VOG Network because then your
746000	748000	every little thing goes under scrutiny and all
748000	750000	that stuff and like you know you joked about
750000	752000	earlier when I was you know choosing my words
752000	754000	carefully well if we had
754000	756000	13 million followers I'd probably have to be
756000	758000	oh my god are you telling me that some of
758000	760000	their feelings are gonna be hurt
760000	762000	oh no people with hurt
762000	764000	feelings who gives a fuck
764000	766000	without going too far I give a fuck
766000	768000	I give a fuck too because I think
768000	770000	maybe not a hundred percent of the time
770000	772000	are these things that we see on
772000	774000	Tumblr and stuff always but some of it is
774000	776000	valid I understand that but like
776000	778000	using common sense aside from
778000	780000	you know the obvious things like
780000	782000	being just like completely insensitive
782000	784000	to people you're
784000	786000	gonna get somebody's gonna get
786000	788000	upset about some opinion you have about
788000	790000	something you can't please everybody
790000	792000	I will say this I think
792000	794000	that and this is just
794000	796000	people don't understand the
796000	798000	the difference between uh
798000	800000	intent and impact
800000	802000	and so
802000	804000	I think that we do have a responsibility
804000	806000	to watch some of what we say or make sure that
806000	808000	we preface it saying this isn't
808000	810000	said with malice here's the story
810000	812000	I mean I think call out culture
812000	814000	is a disease
814000	816000	but that being said there are people out
816000	818000	there who need to fucking be called out because they are
818000	820000	doing it out of malice and I think the best
820000	822000	I want to move back in the story but the best example
822000	824000	I can give of this is that you know like back
824000	826000	early when this show first started
826000	828000	I probably have used a phrase
828000	830000	a few times that I picked up off project
830000	832000	runway when he used to say hot
832000	834000	tea mess right
834000	836000	that used to be a phrase that was in pop culture and you probably saw it on
836000	838000	Saturday Night Live but like now in the
838000	840000	year 2019 I realized that that phrase
840000	842000	ain't cool and there's some people who yes
842000	844000	their feelings get legit hurt when they hear that
844000	846000	and so like you know I respect that so that's
846000	848000	that's what I'm talking about you know what I mean like you know
848000	850000	if somebody's going to get but at the
850000	852000	same time okay I have been a
852000	854000	long time running host of the Rocky Horror Picture
854000	856000	Show right and there's some people
856000	858000	that will write essays about how
858000	860000	Rocky Horror Picture Show is problematic and all this stuff
860000	862000	and I wasn't it meant to be
862000	864000	in a way and I say it is a
864000	866000	product of a different time in
866000	868000	1975 this is all there was but
868000	870000	et cetera et cetera so some people
870000	872000	I think want to
872000	874000	be mad just to be mad but
874000	876000	some of it is legitimate so we have
876000	878000	to navigate this delicate
878000	880000	place in between anyway
880000	882000	where was I oh yes Ninja has 13 million
882000	884000	followers and I don't a Ted Talk
884000	886000	um anyway
886000	888000	some other streamers were paid for this as well
888000	890000	EA paid Shroud who I guess is a popular
890000	892000	Polish Canadian streamer with
892000	894000	6 million Twitch followers
894000	896000	but that guy actually declined
896000	898000	because didn't want to
898000	900000	oh no I'm sorry I'm sorry that guy declined
900000	902000	to disclose the terms of the deal so it sounds like he
902000	904000	did it but we don't know how much money he was paid for it and so
904000	906000	forth but um
906000	908000	interesting
908000	910000	that this is a part of our
910000	912000	gaming culture now is that
912000	914000	some of these people that we do choose
914000	916000	to elevate with our Twitch
916000	918000	follows and the biddies and the subs
918000	920000	and all that stuff some of the people that we
920000	922000	do choose to elevate
922000	924000	um were
924000	926000	are making coin off it
926000	928000	basically I still
928000	930000	don't see why
930000	932000	PDP is still around
932000	934000	that is a whole nother Oprah that I don't
934000	936000	want to get into right now
936000	938000	so I should just really duct tape his tongue
938000	940000	to the top of his mouth and never remove
940000	942000	it anyway
942000	944000	um let me go to our chat over at
944000	946000	twitch.tv slash vog network
946000	948000	um
948000	950000	um let's
950000	952000	see uh some people are talking
952000	954000	about me uh leaving the room
954000	956000	uh bobby's saying we need to influence more so we need you
956000	958000	alive uh quest buster
958000	960000	in uh our twitch chat says
960000	962000	apex legends is something that
962000	964000	uh shroud probably would have paid
964000	966000	played anyway also he was
966000	968000	consulted for the game months ago as a
968000	970000	secret project which he publicly
970000	972000	admitted and you know I've heard of that type
972000	974000	of thing in the gaming industry before not just
974000	976000	with influencers but I've heard of it with
976000	978000	reviewers you know this is a thing
978000	980000	is that some game
980000	982000	websites and some big game websites
982000	984000	will take money
984000	986000	to do a
986000	988000	a review of a game basically that is
988000	990000	confidential between the site
990000	992000	and the publisher it's not the
992000	994000	real review it's a mock review basically
994000	996000	but it's like the actual like the way they would have reviewed
996000	998000	it if they played that product today that
998000	1000000	review is never published it's sent to the publisher and the
1000000	1002000	publisher or the developer uses
1002000	1004000	it to implement feedback and make the game
1004000	1006000	better and then the real game
1006000	1008000	is reviewed by somebody
1008000	1010000	else on the same site obviously
1010000	1012000	you could understand that once somebody takes
1012000	1014000	a deal like that and has reviewed the game
1014000	1016000	one time that's not the same person that can write the
1016000	1018000	review later on but that whole like
1018000	1020000	consulting with a
1020000	1022000	personality is not particularly
1022000	1024000	unique to the gaming industry
1024000	1026000	what I think is unique is that now it's not
1026000	1028000	just like game reviewers but it's game
1028000	1030000	players and people who
1030000	1032000	in some ways you could say
1032000	1034000	review games live on stream
1034000	1036000	I guess that's that's
1036000	1038000	kind of one thing I think I've seen
1038000	1040000	done on Twitch before maybe have done myself
1040000	1042000	is that I'm getting my first impressions
1042000	1044000	of a game live on stream and
1044000	1046000	if I had 13 million followers
1046000	1048000	that's something I might be able to make
1048000	1050000	a little more money doing so
1050000	1052000	I don't know do you guys
1052000	1054000	think this is a dangerous thing for the industry
1054000	1056000	or it seems like based on
1056000	1058000	kind of like what I was hearing a minute ago based on the
1058000	1060000	fact that Instagram influencers are paid
1060000	1062000	and other types of industry
1062000	1064000	leaders are paid for endorsements
1064000	1066000	you know lovely celebrities
1066000	1068000	are paid for makeup campaigns and things like that
1068000	1070000	that maybe we're okay with this because
1070000	1072000	this is what we do
1072000	1074000	as long as they're following the law and the fact that
1074000	1076000	they're disclosing that's an advertisement
1076000	1078000	and that type of thing I don't see a problem
1078000	1080000	with it which they all did
1080000	1082000	so as long as they're doing that not trying to do
1082000	1084000	some shady shit where oh
1084000	1086000	I'm being paid to say something good about this
1086000	1088000	but I'm not telling you that it's an advertisement
1088000	1090000	that that's the only problem
1090000	1092000	which YouTube had a big thing with that
1092000	1094000	I want to say about a year ago
1094000	1096000	yeah it was the FTC
1096000	1098000	coming down on like all sorts
1098000	1100000	of different things and it was
1100000	1102000	it's they've been better about it
1102000	1104000	because I think some people were unaware
1104000	1106000	of what the law was but
1106000	1108000	it's been I think it's been
1108000	1110000	alright as far as people disclosing
1110000	1112000	stuff just as long as it's very upfront
1112000	1114000	like hey this is a paid advertisement
1114000	1116000	or you know paid sponsorship
1116000	1118000	with this you know
1118000	1120000	we're talking about this game
1120000	1122000	here's why um
1122000	1124000	then I'm fine with it
1124000	1126000	I don't know I don't watch Ninja
1126000	1128000	so I don't give a shit you know either way
1128000	1130000	and honestly to
1130000	1132000	I don't think yeah
1132000	1134000	it's good that he did that
1134000	1136000	and he's promoting that
1136000	1138000	but don't think really the game
1138000	1140000	needed that it was pretty
1140000	1142000	strong on its own but
1142000	1144000	do you think maybe that and
1144000	1146000	I don't think we want to say one person alone
1146000	1148000	did this but maybe the influencer
1148000	1150000	campaign as a whole let's say and all these
1150000	1152000	streamers that they may have worked out deals
1152000	1154000	with to do this do you think maybe that helped
1154000	1156000	this punt out the gate
1156000	1158000	because this game landed with a bang
1158000	1160000	as opposed to a slow build
1160000	1162000	maybe a game that took a little while for people
1162000	1164000	to discover and then it kind of
1164000	1166000	I guess but what might be more like
1166000	1168000	a Minecraft type situation it would be interesting
1168000	1170000	to see like how
1170000	1172000	you know how much of an influence those influencers
1172000	1174000	had like how how this
1174000	1176000	boosted the numbers to be interesting to see
1176000	1178000	but I don't know yeah it's a bummer because apex legends
1178000	1180000	they don't ask you where did you hear about our game
1180000	1182000	they don't really well they could have like I don't know there
1182000	1184000	could be maybe a link in the video or something like that
1184000	1186000	that has some sort of like tracking
1186000	1188000	tag or something enough that's the way
1188000	1190000	twitch usually does things if
1190000	1192000	you're playing a certain game maybe I have to
1192000	1194000	admit I wasn't watching those streams so I don't know
1194000	1196000	but I do know that sometimes like as an
1196000	1198000	affiliate there are certain games
1198000	1200000	and it's not all of them there are certain games that
1200000	1202000	if twitch sells them on the store
1202000	1204000	if you're playing them on your stream there'll be a little
1204000	1206000	link right under the stream to buy the game
1206000	1208000	and then that streamer gets a little cut of the money
1208000	1210000	and then I'm sure they can measure all that
1210000	1212000	analytics as well so I don't
1212000	1214000	I don't know but well I guess you know
1214000	1216000	I think they've got that whole twitch prime thing
1216000	1218000	right now is running with apex
1218000	1220000	legends so maybe that's a way that they're
1220000	1222000	trying to measure their audience I don't know
1222000	1224000	there's a lot I don't know I think this is a lot
1224000	1226000	of uncharted territory
1226000	1228000	one other thing I want to bring up in response to what you
1228000	1230000	say because I thought it was interesting because you talked about during
1230000	1232000	the whole YouTube scandal that you had a lot
1232000	1234000	of people who didn't know what the law was
1234000	1236000	which you know well they claim not
1236000	1238000	to know what the law was yeah fair enough
1238000	1240000	but I think when it does come to the law
1240000	1242000	you know not everybody
1242000	1244000	is very good at interpreting the law
1244000	1246000	all the time I think YouTube
1246000	1248000	tried to make strides to
1248000	1250000	dumb down the law and make these
1250000	1252000	videos for creators to help YouTube
1252000	1254000	makers understand the law
1254000	1256000	I think that's part of what they felt
1256000	1258000	their onus was to do which is fine
1258000	1260000	but I mean it also goes to
1260000	1262000	conversations about as our technology moves
1262000	1264000	more and more and more our laws
1264000	1266000	don't always seem to get updated
1266000	1268000	fast enough we talk about this all the time when it comes
1268000	1270000	to copyright, trademark
1270000	1272000	and IP laws
1272000	1274000	you know the dancing thing
1274000	1276000	that's come up before right the Carleton
1276000	1278000	is in the game and how do we handle that
1278000	1280000	right that whole thing
1280000	1282000	is just like this uncharted territory because the
1282000	1284000	laws are being updated as fast as the technology
1284000	1286000	yeah this is causing this
1286000	1288000	very interesting sort of story and they're not going to be unfortunately
1288000	1290000	because you have people that are
1290000	1292000	have a lot more money that want to control things
1292000	1294000	so they can keep all that money and
1294000	1296000	it's not going to change
1296000	1298000	yeah very interesting
1298000	1300000	let's see other comments in chat
1300000	1302000	5th Dream in chat says to me it just seems like
1302000	1304000	business as usual they do it on
1304000	1306000	TV always so
1306000	1308000	and Questbuster follows that up with
1308000	1310000	same here I'd be more surprised if
1310000	1312000	EA didn't do something marketing wise 5th Dream
1312000	1314000	so maybe this is just this interesting
1314000	1316000	new territory maybe you're going to see I think it's
1316000	1318000	kind of happening already but maybe you're going to see more
1318000	1320000	and more folks on
1320000	1322000	Twitch you know getting
1322000	1324000	some sort of
1324000	1326000	maybe either commutation be it
1326000	1328000	you know free game or maybe
1328000	1330000	well maybe we'll see that with EA's
1330000	1332000	Battlefield 5 thing that they've got
1332000	1334000	the new battle they have the new
1334000	1336000	was it
1336000	1338000	Battle Royale mode that's coming to
1338000	1340000	Battlefield 5 that they
1340000	1342000	had a trailer out for this week
1342000	1344000	they'll be showing that off because
1344000	1346000	everybody's got to jump on that
1346000	1348000	bandwagon all I got to say
1348000	1350000	is you can't be an industry leader if you're following
1350000	1352000	people so
1352000	1354000	alright
1354000	1356000	let's move on to what sorts of
1356000	1358000	games have been influencing us
1358000	1360000	this week as we talk about how is our
1360000	1362000	gaming week and the types of video games that we've
1362000	1364000	been playing this week Dark Soccer we'll start with you
1364000	1366000	how was your gaming week I
1366000	1368000	played a bunch of pinball really Pokemon
1368000	1370000	Go I touched
1370000	1372000	Ingress once
1372000	1374000	just to see if it was still there
1374000	1376000	I'm still playing
1376000	1378000	idle pouring I don't really mention it but I'm still
1378000	1380000	playing it
1380000	1382000	I am borrowing
1382000	1384000	Horizon Zero Dawn
1384000	1386000	I haven't started it yet but I figured I would
1386000	1388000	start it on stream or something
1388000	1390000	I was actually planning on starting to
1390000	1392000	stream this week but I have a birthday party
1392000	1394000	on Wednesday night and I'm going to see
1394000	1396000	Renae on Thursday so
1396000	1398000	which by the way thank you so much for
1398000	1400000	that shout out about women in games
1400000	1402000	here in Sacramento that was awesome
1402000	1404000	oh that was something
1404000	1406000	that Bre did right? Oh sorry that was Bre
1406000	1408000	why did I say Renae? I don't know but thank you Bre
1408000	1410000	because Renae was also floating
1410000	1412000	an article this week but it was about a different topic
1412000	1414000	I posted Renae's thing my brain
1414000	1416000	is like broken it's fine sorry
1416000	1418000	I have a donut
1418000	1420000	we miss her though she should come back to OLR
1420000	1422000	when she's ready I miss everybody
1422000	1424000	but no but I'm
1424000	1426000	going to go hang out with Renae and so maybe I'll play
1426000	1428000	games while I'm in San Francisco
1428000	1430000	while I was at
1430000	1432000	did I talk about the
1432000	1434000	Munster's release party at coin op?
1434000	1436000	you did a little bit last week
1436000	1438000	I didn't know if I had mentioned it but that was lit
1438000	1440000	so
1440000	1442000	we actually had a tweet that came in this week
1442000	1444000	about some folks were appreciating the pinball
1444000	1446000	talk that came up on OLR and I was like
1446000	1448000	dark soccer is a big pinball fan how many machines
1448000	1450000	do you have in your house now?
1450000	1452000	three in the house no six in the house
1452000	1454000	I'm at the house
1454000	1456000	collectively no I'm actually having to do the math
1456000	1458000	we are giving back
1458000	1460000	pinbot 2.0 we're borrowing it
1460000	1462000	we're trading back
1462000	1464000	Adam's family to get our twilight zone back
1464000	1466000	so twilight zone creature from the black lagoon
1466000	1468000	judge dread
1468000	1470000	I thought she was counting
1470000	1472000	like the ones in the house versus the ones in the garage
1472000	1474000	and I'm like same thing
1474000	1476000	the shadow and
1476000	1478000	one other I can't remember
1478000	1480000	so we have
1480000	1482000	I think eleven
1482000	1484000	right now it's enough where they're not only in your
1484000	1486000	garage but you have a spare bedroom
1486000	1488000	we move more in the house because Dan's Mustang is coming home
1488000	1490000	so we have to clear out the garage
1490000	1492000	so there's room for the Mustang
1492000	1494000	they're no longer rusting
1494000	1496000	it's a 1969 Mustang coupe
1496000	1498000	so do the math
1498000	1500000	it's huge
1500000	1502000	damn muscle cars though what's your favorite table
1502000	1504000	you own I already know this I actually have two
1504000	1506000	well World Cup soccer
1506000	1508000	is my favorite but my second favorite
1508000	1510000	is theater of magic what's the worst table you own
1510000	1512000	fuck I really hate
1512000	1514000	judge dread is
1514000	1516000	grown on me but I do not
1516000	1518000	like creature from the black lagoon
1518000	1520000	a lot of people love it it's just not
1520000	1522000	that fun for me and probably my least favorite
1522000	1524000	of all time would be the hobbit the new one
1524000	1526000	because it's slow as fuck
1526000	1528000	do not like a slow table
1528000	1530000	but you know it turns out that I have a type
1530000	1532000	with designers well I love everything
1532000	1534000	Steve Ritchie has done I seem
1534000	1536000	to be a John Papa Duke girl so
1536000	1538000	because my two favorites are Papa
1538000	1540000	Duke tables alright
1540000	1542000	I thought I thought it was appropriate to engage
1542000	1544000	in a little pinball talks there you go heck yeah
1544000	1546000	but we have Ghostbusters and I've been playing the
1546000	1548000	crap out of it for me I'm still waiting for
1548000	1550000	pin bot to hit virtual console because I love the
1550000	1552000	NES version of pin bot even though I know a lot of people hate it
1552000	1554000	I loved it they're actually we were
1554000	1556000	watching some pinball game reviews
1556000	1558000	like for NES versions the version
1558000	1560000	of the getaway that came out for
1560000	1562000	for one of the home
1562000	1564000	consoles it was pretty terra bad
1564000	1566000	I think getaway was
1566000	1568000	the NES I think they did that
1568000	1570000	one after pin bot because I know there was a
1570000	1572000	getaway that came out pretty pretty not good
1572000	1574000	yeah Bobby Black Wolf
1574000	1576000	is a little bit inspired
1576000	1578000	perhaps saying I still really really need to finally
1578000	1580000	clean out the room we're turning into our
1580000	1582000	arcade so I can finally start down the path
1582000	1584000	of Dark Sakura and Dan and collect
1584000	1586000	pinball tables absolutely
1586000	1588000	well you need to come over before
1588000	1590000	we get rid of brighter pin bot 2.0
1590000	1592000	yeah I want to come play do you know what that is
1592000	1594000	not the 2.0 I played your
1594000	1596000	you had a regular brighter pin bot at one point
1596000	1598000	oh wow so basically
1598000	1600000	brighter pin bot 2.0 has an extra board added
1600000	1602000	to it that has new rule sets
1602000	1604000	and it's linked to usually a color
1604000	1606000	DMD that has
1606000	1608000	different game modes and different things
1608000	1610000	and a new soundtrack like a digital soundtrack
1610000	1612000	it's pretty freaking amazing
1612000	1614000	so
1614000	1616000	after the show everybody
1616000	1618000	look on YouTube
1618000	1620000	and find video of a brighter
1620000	1622000	pin bot 2.0 just soundtrack
1622000	1624000	the soundtrack makes me think of
1624000	1626000	old Space Mountain
1626000	1628000	and by the way Dick Dale died
1628000	1630000	I heard, sad
1630000	1632000	alright, Loki how was your gaming week
1632000	1634000	what did you play? I didn't play a whole lot because
1634000	1636000	like I said I was working in Unity trying to get myself
1636000	1638000	back into the swing of working
1638000	1640000	in Unity again
1640000	1642000	so I finished my
1642000	1644000	code along tutorial
1644000	1646000	thing it was like some tank combat game
1646000	1648000	so that's done
1648000	1650000	I'm not really doing anything that I'm definitely not
1650000	1652000	publishing that because that's just
1652000	1654000	there's nothing different than what they
1654000	1656000	provide it's just kind of following
1656000	1658000	along to kind of get into the groove
1658000	1660000	of working in Unity
1660000	1662000	and also it kind of showed me a little bit
1662000	1664000	of the audio mixer which is something that they added
1664000	1666000	a while ago but since I haven't used
1666000	1668000	it before I didn't really
1668000	1670000	know what it did so that was kind of cool
1670000	1672000	to learn that a little bit
1672000	1674000	and then let's
1674000	1676000	see I played a little bit of Dance Dance Revolution
1676000	1678000	Extreme I saw your
1678000	1680000	live stream yeah a little bit
1680000	1682000	it was funny because I haven't noticed this
1682000	1684000	because I have a legit
1684000	1686000	extreme but I'm running a mod
1686000	1688000	disc right now because I was playing
1688000	1690000	other mixes but I don't know
1690000	1692000	if it's the drive or the disc I
1692000	1694000	burned but it doesn't run very well
1694000	1696000	on the other mixes so
1696000	1698000	I put it back to extreme because I just didn't
1698000	1700000	want to mess with that crap anymore
1700000	1702000	so I have extreme and I'm running mods
1702000	1704000	in it but I didn't realize that the extreme
1704000	1706000	version that's on that mod disc
1706000	1708000	is a modded extreme
1708000	1710000	so it's got extra modifiers on there
1710000	1712000	like the 0.5 speed
1712000	1714000	wave and there's some
1714000	1716000	other thing it was the stuff that was in like
1716000	1718000	extreme
1718000	1720000	it's not extreme plus because I think
1720000	1722000	extreme plus is the one with the marvelous
1722000	1724000	the marvelous ratings
1724000	1726000	there's one it's
1726000	1728000	what the hell
1728000	1730000	is it called Megamix it's like
1730000	1732000	Megamix but Megamix also had one
1732000	1734000	that I can actually adjust the clock speed
1734000	1736000	of the game so that the songs that speed up or slow
1736000	1738000	down so it's like
1738000	1740000	oh that's like a Beat Saber type of thing
1740000	1742000	so it's Megamix mods so it's got some of those
1742000	1744000	in there but
1744000	1746000	I didn't realize it was in there until I
1746000	1748000	was playing it I was like wait a second 0.5
1748000	1750000	speed that's not normally there like oh
1750000	1752000	crap this is a modded one so
1752000	1754000	I tried that in
1754000	1756000	Max 300 and nope
1756000	1758000	cannot play it like that it's
1758000	1760000	it doesn't work well for me so
1760000	1762000	I was
1762000	1764000	just playing other stuff though so I have been going through the
1764000	1766000	mods some more because I don't
1766000	1768000	remember like some of these
1768000	1770000	and I also have to remove some of the ones I have duplicates
1770000	1772000	on there or just they're broken like I have
1772000	1774000	a dynamite ray of one that I think I
1774000	1776000	made maybe that's off by
1776000	1778000	like at least a whole
1778000	1780000	measure so that kind of sucks
1780000	1782000	and then I
1782000	1784000	played
1784000	1786000	Pokemon Go a little bit
1786000	1788000	I didn't play too much on PC
1788000	1790000	I played
1790000	1792000	a little bit of this game called
1792000	1794000	Jelly Mario which is
1794000	1796000	a weird
1796000	1798000	web game you can play so it's
1798000	1800000	Jelly Mar
1800000	1802000	.io and
1802000	1804000	go check it out it's free
1804000	1806000	and you basically have to
1806000	1808000	traverse Mario and
1808000	1810000	he's just this big jelly thing and everything in
1810000	1812000	the world is very
1812000	1814000	jelly like and it's
1814000	1816000	very hard especially when you get to the
1816000	1818000	castle because you have to dodge
1818000	1820000	all the fire bars and
1820000	1822000	sometimes you just can't get the
1822000	1824000	momentum right to be able to pass
1824000	1826000	through that so let me play that on stream on Tuesday
1826000	1828000	because I'm planning on streaming
1828000	1830000	on PC on Tuesday either
1830000	1832000	maybe Jelly Mario and
1832000	1834000	Saints Row 2 but I wanted to do
1834000	1836000	Saints Row 2 because I love Saints Row 2
1836000	1838000	and it's a great game and I watched some other guy
1838000	1840000	that I follow call me Kevin
1840000	1842000	play it and it looked hilarious I'm like
1842000	1844000	I remember how hilarious that game was I want to play that
1844000	1846000	so we'll be doing that
1846000	1848000	and I'm going to try to stream
1848000	1850000	more DDR during the week
1850000	1852000	I wanted to stream more actually
1852000	1854000	earlier in the week but I was fighting with
1854000	1856000	stupid OBS
1856000	1858000	because it decided that oh hey you don't have permissions
1858000	1860000	to run this anymore for no reason
1860000	1862000	so I had to
1862000	1864000	download it again and it finally worked but it took me
1864000	1866000	30 minutes to figure that out
1866000	1868000	but yeah I need to
1868000	1870000	get back into the swing of playing DDR every day
1870000	1872000	instead of just like once or twice a week
1872000	1874000	alright that's it
1874000	1876000	my giveaway probably a little more scaled
1876000	1878000	back than I'm used to I don't want to talk a lot
1878000	1880000	about this yet until I've really truly
1880000	1882000	made it a habit but I'm trying to
1882000	1884000	change my fitness journey and that all
1884000	1886000	started this week so I'll leave it at that for now
1886000	1888000	until I actually stick with it
1888000	1890000	because I don't want to be that person that's like you know two days
1890000	1892000	into it like I'm making these greats and then
1892000	1894000	I fall off the wagon so check
1894000	1896000	in with me in a few weeks but
1896000	1898000	meanwhile so that's been cutting into my time
1898000	1900000	a little bit but meanwhile I'm still
1900000	1902000	playing the good old MMOs that I have
1902000	1904000	been sticking by like World of Warcraft
1904000	1906000	which is funny because I don't
1906000	1908000	you know when I used to play
1908000	1910000	and was super into wow I would do
1910000	1912000	raiding and I would do all this stuff I've been playing
1912000	1914000	kind of by myself but one thing I've
1914000	1916000	kind of noticed about World of Warcraft that's kind of
1916000	1918000	grown on me is that there's so much more you can do by yourself
1918000	1920000	like I've geared my character up to
1920000	1922000	I hit the point where my resto
1922000	1924000	shaman is now out geared my
1924000	1926000	warlock that I was running for a while
1926000	1928000	and my shaman
1928000	1930000	whose named Porkchop by the way
1930000	1932000	in memoriam of the
1932000	1934000	very first queen to ever be booted from
1934000	1936000	RuPaul's Drag Race
1936000	1938000	so Porkchop is
1938000	1940000	level 300 and plus I just love
1940000	1942000	a panda shaman named Porkchop
1942000	1944000	oh she's still around I haven't like
1944000	1946000	I don't think I've deleted a character
1946000	1948000	that was like above level 10
1948000	1950000	if I play though I'll probably move my
1950000	1952000	dragon huntie
1952000	1954000	I mean honestly
1954000	1956000	demon huntie the only thing that matters about
1956000	1958000	Horde and Alliance or I'm sorry the only
1958000	1960000	thing that matters to play with other people is Horde and
1960000	1962000	Alliance like your server like just doesn't
1962000	1964000	matter anymore it really doesn't
1964000	1966000	I want to like play in areas
1966000	1968000	yeah I know but you get moved over to other servers now
1968000	1970000	like the whole thing like if you and I
1970000	1972000	party you'll suddenly be on my server
1972000	1974000	shit yeah yeah no and like
1974000	1976000	servers don't even fucking matter anymore it's great
1976000	1978000	like I wish Final Fantasy 14 would steal that
1978000	1980000	technology but anyway yeah
1980000	1982000	I do a lot of world quests
1982000	1984000	and I just do a lot of like queuing up by myself and things
1984000	1986000	like that and that's just kind of like my mind numbing
1986000	1988000	thing to do but I have played other games
1988000	1990000	too and one I haven't talked about on the show yet even
1990000	1992000	though I started it last week and I played
1992000	1994000	a little more this week so I'm
1994000	1996000	continuing my PlayStation VR adventures
1996000	1998000	and catching up on my backlog on PlayStation
1998000	2000000	VR I started playing Skyrim
2000000	2002000	VR so I've been playing that a little bit
2002000	2004000	so that's a game that you've actually played that I have yet
2004000	2006000	in the play yet oh right high five
2006000	2008000	okay so
2008000	2010000	well here's the thing once I found out
2010000	2012000	you don't have to actually use the
2012000	2014000	move controllers because I was like
2014000	2016000	that sounds like a ridiculous and like look don't get me
2016000	2018000	wrong like move plus VR
2018000	2020000	is great for like Beat Saber
2020000	2022000	this print
2022000	2024000	vector I was talking about last week
2024000	2026000	I did download that radial G game
2026000	2028000	as well I played that a little bit that actually doesn't
2028000	2030000	use the move so I don't know why I brought that up just then but I did
2030000	2032000	so
2032000	2034000	so but I'm like I don't want to play Skyrim
2034000	2036000	with a freaking move controller it's like this is too
2036000	2038000	much I don't need to this is not how you play
2038000	2040000	Skyrim
2040000	2042000	you don't need to do it that way right so
2042000	2044000	I just want to like controller
2044000	2046000	but just instead of my TV VR
2046000	2048000	because the Skyrim world
2048000	2050000	is gorgeous it always was even
2050000	2052000	from the very first version of the game
2052000	2054000	so I wanted to see what that looked like in VR so
2054000	2056000	I'm playing just with
2056000	2058000	the plain old controller and I'm
2058000	2060000	playing in VR and it is
2060000	2062000	it's a very good looking game like I found myself
2062000	2064000	doing the same thing I think a lot of us did
2064000	2066000	when we first played Skyrim I was stopping
2066000	2068000	to stare at the flowers because I'm like they're so
2068000	2070000	purple and they're 3D and they're
2070000	2072000	cute so here's the interesting thing about
2072000	2074000	VR because obviously VR brings
2074000	2076000	all these you know
2076000	2078000	concerns about is somebody
2078000	2080000	going to get motion sick and things like that
2080000	2082000	so what they do
2082000	2084000	they actually have all sorts of ways
2084000	2086000	you can control it but
2086000	2088000	you can turn by looking
2088000	2090000	and move in those directions but
2090000	2092000	what you do is that the right stick
2092000	2094000	instead of being a full pivot to
2094000	2096000	look around and move instead it like
2096000	2098000	turns you automatically like maybe 30
2098000	2100000	degrees one direction so like if you tap
2100000	2102000	left on the right stick it just turns you
2102000	2104000	30 degrees one direction and I think
2104000	2106000	now I believe you can change it and
2106000	2108000	make it a full rotation
2108000	2110000	but then that means you're rotating it's going to be different from
2110000	2112000	where you're looking and that's what makes people sick so that's
2112000	2114000	not the default but they if you want
2114000	2116000	to play the throw up ride you can I guess
2116000	2118000	but I'm getting
2118000	2120000	kind of used to the whole being able to move
2120000	2122000	on the right stick and like change
2122000	2124000	my perspective and it actually kind of
2124000	2126000	works and I dig it it's
2126000	2128000	you know the way you actually target things
2128000	2130000	then is to look so let's say like I've been playing
2130000	2132000	a mage and let's say I zap a wolf
2132000	2134000	which you know as you're walking down from that first
2134000	2136000	cave you run into a couple wolves so I zapped
2136000	2138000	a wolf with lightning and then
2138000	2140000	to loot the corpse you have to kind of like look at
2140000	2142000	the wolf so that your little crosshair
2142000	2144000	goes on it and then you can loot it so it's
2144000	2146000	That sounds annoying as fuck
2146000	2148000	I'm into it
2148000	2150000	I don't know if I could play the entire
2150000	2152000	20 hour experience this way it's a
2152000	2154000	lot but like
2154000	2156000	20 hours or whatever
2156000	2158000	How long does it take to do the main story?
2158000	2160000	Main story only
2160000	2162000	I don't know I've never finished
2162000	2164000	Let's be clear I meant main story only
2164000	2166000	Have I ever finished the main story?
2166000	2168000	Which main story?
2168000	2170000	Like just the main quest that gets you
2170000	2172000	to the game's ending
2172000	2174000	so to speak
2174000	2176000	There is a main questline and it's separated from side quest
2176000	2178000	when you're looking at your journal there's very clearly a main questline
2178000	2180000	The Alduin main questline
2180000	2182000	or the main questline with the two
2182000	2184000	factions
2184000	2186000	I think the Alduin
2186000	2188000	is considered because the factions
2188000	2190000	can't you do both technically?
2190000	2192000	I think
2192000	2194000	My husband Alan is the expert on that
2194000	2196000	because he has played Skyrim
2196000	2198000	every single
2198000	2200000	every single
2200000	2202000	minus DLC he didn't do all the DLC
2202000	2204000	but every single quest
2204000	2206000	except for the ones that generate
2206000	2208000	because there's like the generating quests
2208000	2210000	Oh god those never end
2210000	2212000	but I'm still pretty impressed at that
2212000	2214000	type of achievement
2214000	2216000	It's interesting and I like watching
2216000	2218000	different scenes so they do some things
2218000	2220000	different so that very first opening scene
2220000	2222000	where you're in the cart and then you watch that
2222000	2224000	guy get killed by the executioner and the dragon
2224000	2226000	shows up they do it a little differently
2226000	2228000	because again they don't want to
2228000	2230000	move you without you
2230000	2232000	having some control over it so what
2232000	2234000	happens is that it kind of just quickly fades out
2234000	2236000	fades in to these different perspectives
2236000	2238000	so like you'll be standing there and it
2238000	2240000	fade out fade in you're looking up at the
2240000	2242000	sky and you see the dragon land fade out
2242000	2244000	fade in you're looking somewhere else
2244000	2246000	and I was kind of like wait a minute I don't remember it
2246000	2248000	being that way in the regular game and then I thought in my head
2248000	2250000	oh they're doing that because they don't want to
2250000	2252000	make somebody sick from motion that
2252000	2254000	they aren't controlling so they can't
2254000	2256000	deliver that the same way that you could in
2256000	2258000	a traditional monitor so it's kind of interesting
2258000	2260000	like those subtle little differences but
2260000	2262000	they didn't like take away anything or whatever
2262000	2264000	in fact I think it's good that they didn't just
2264000	2266000	slap Skyrim in VR and say play
2266000	2268000	they had to think of some of these things I thought was
2268000	2270000	very interesting so
2270000	2272000	um let's see
2272000	2274000	going into chat again at
2274000	2276000	live excuse me at twitch tv
2276000	2278000	slash vog network uh Bobby says
2278000	2280000	I stopped with the move controllers pretty quickly
2280000	2282000	in Skyrim VR but that's how you play
2282000	2284000	Twilight Princess right? Yes
2284000	2286000	but there is also a difference is that
2286000	2288000	Twilight Princess was designed from
2288000	2290000	the ground up for that whereas
2290000	2292000	Skyrim they kind of had to shoehorn the
2292000	2294000	move thing back into it like I'm sure
2294000	2296000	it's a fine experience
2296000	2298000	it's just not what I want to play
2298000	2300000	because I don't associate Skyrim with that
2300000	2302000	whereas Twilight Princess
2302000	2304000	for me quintessentially
2304000	2306000	a Switch game yes I know
2306000	2308000	it was originally developed for Wii U but we all
2308000	2310000	know that they put a lot of thought into
2310000	2312000	the Switch instead on that and that
2312000	2314000	you know it was going to use those types of controls
2314000	2316000	you know at some point
2316000	2318000	early-ish mid-development or whatever
2318000	2320000	they made a conscious choice to
2320000	2322000	have a lot of Switch functionality in there as well
2322000	2324000	so anyway
2324000	2326000	let's see
2326000	2328000	oh I'm sorry I was
2328000	2330000	why was I thinking that you're right they said
2330000	2332000	Twilight Princess and I immediately went to
2332000	2334000	um
2334000	2336000	my mind immediately went to the new one Breath of the Wild
2336000	2338000	my bad
2338000	2340000	so Twilight Princess on Wii well again
2340000	2342000	I still think the same argument applies
2342000	2344000	it was designed with the Wii in mind even though
2344000	2346000	sure it was also a game it was like the exact same
2346000	2348000	thing actually so maybe that's why my
2348000	2350000	brain kind of confused the two for a minute
2350000	2352000	anyway um
2352000	2354000	Bobby says they also fade
2354000	2356000	in the edges of your vision when you
2356000	2358000	move which also helps decrease
2358000	2360000	motion sickness it does not eliminate
2360000	2362000	motion sickness for people who are extremely
2362000	2364000	prone I noticed that too I noticed
2364000	2366000	the edges narrowed in really quickly
2366000	2368000	when you did that and I felt
2368000	2370000	I didn't haze
2370000	2372000	the game for that because I'm like okay there's very much a reason
2372000	2374000	they're doing this like it's very
2374000	2376000	obvious like because when you look around you
2376000	2378000	have freedom so like it's not a system
2378000	2380000	this is a conscious decision I would hope that
2380000	2382000	I could turn that off because like I
2382000	2384000	don't have a problem with motion sickness I played
2384000	2386000	Minecraft on
2386000	2388000	um the Oculus
2388000	2390000	uh
2390000	2392000	Gear VR thing and
2392000	2394000	I used you know the controller
2394000	2396000	like you know you shouldn't really
2396000	2398000	this is not necessarily
2398000	2400000	recommended to use the controller for this and
2400000	2402000	I was like nah this is cool I can't speak
2402000	2404000	to that specifically but I can
2404000	2406000	say there is a pretty extensive VR
2406000	2408000	customization menu and it wouldn't surprise
2408000	2410000	me if that was something you could turn on and off
2410000	2412000	but you know I
2412000	2414000	think it's smart that it uses
2414000	2416000	the safest settings by default
2416000	2418000	yeah if that makes sense so
2418000	2420000	anyway um I'm talking
2420000	2422000	a lot about a game that originally came
2422000	2424000	out many years ago so let's
2424000	2426000	move on I think that's it for our gaming
2426000	2428000	weeks uh I think it's time we get into some
2428000	2430000	gaming news I don't have a lot of housekeeping
2430000	2432000	because I don't know of any shows off
2432000	2434000	Memorial Day but that's way
2434000	2436000	the day before Memorial Day will be our next
2436000	2438000	show off because I won't be here so I'm out of town so
2438000	2440000	we won't have a show that weekend so enjoy your
2440000	2442000	three day Memorial weekend I'm in Chicago that
2442000	2444000	weekend when is this Memorial
2444000	2446000	Day so end of
2446000	2448000	May oh I'll be at DragCon
2448000	2450000	oh okay there you go so
2450000	2452000	I'll be doing
2452000	2454000	I don't know staycation programming
2454000	2456000	streaming playing games
2456000	2458000	kids kids alright
2458000	2460000	let's get into some gaming news Loki
2460000	2462000	so GDC is right around the corner
2462000	2464000	and of course the thought
2464000	2466000	or the tease has been
2466000	2468000	that Google is going to announce some sort of
2468000	2470000	game console or streaming service or
2470000	2472000	both or who knows
2472000	2474000	so of course a little bit more
2474000	2476000	credence to that Google has
2476000	2478000	announced via their Google
2478000	2480000	developers Twitter
2480000	2482000	page that hey guess what
2482000	2484000	id Software is
2484000	2486000	joining them alongside
2486000	2488000	during this whole
2488000	2490000	presentation not only that
2490000	2492000	they've revealed that also Ubisoft
2492000	2494000	is going to be
2494000	2496000	partnering with them as well
2496000	2498000	so definitely
2498000	2500000	seems to hint the fact
2500000	2502000	that hey you had this whole test
2502000	2504000	of like you know streaming
2504000	2506000	Assassin's Creed
2506000	2508000	and now you have them
2508000	2510000	partnering with them and
2510000	2512000	you have other game companies partnering
2512000	2514000	with them that yeah probably
2514000	2516000	there's going to be some sort of announcement at GDC
2516000	2518000	I think that's kind of expected
2518000	2520000	at this point but I guess we'll
2520000	2522000	have to wait and find out March 19th
2522000	2524000	at 1230
2524000	2526000	so by this time next week we'll know
2526000	2528000	we'll be able to talk about it more in depth on the show
2528000	2530000	but any thoughts I mean you talk about
2530000	2532000	this whole streaming thing so does it seem like
2532000	2534000	maybe Google is going for a
2534000	2536000	streaming console that will stream
2536000	2538000	but not is Google making the Phantom
2538000	2540000	that's what I want
2540000	2542000	if it's going to be
2542000	2544000	exactly like the Assassin's Creed
2544000	2546000	thing was I would see it being built into
2546000	2548000	the Chrome browser
2548000	2550000	that may not be the case
2550000	2552000	for like say
2554000	2556000	you know like Android or something like that
2556000	2558000	maybe they'll have an app to go along with that
2558000	2560000	or something maybe it's going to
2560000	2562000	they're going to put out their own standalone
2562000	2564000	app or like kind of Google
2564000	2566000	TV type thing that's going to have
2566000	2568000	that built into it
2568000	2570000	we'll have to wait and see but
2570000	2572000	I think since they were testing the whole browser
2572000	2574000	compatibility with that
2574000	2576000	that that's probably going to be the route at least
2576000	2578000	one of the routes that they're going to go
2578000	2580000	so we'll have to wait and see because I mean think about it
2580000	2582000	most people a lot of people use
2582000	2584000	Chrome and you can just
2584000	2586000	hey install Chrome and
2586000	2588000	boom you have access to these games you know if you want
2588000	2590000	to pay a subscription or
2590000	2592000	whatever the case may be
2592000	2594000	and then you get to play these games
2594000	2596000	on a PC and it doesn't even have to be a high-end
2596000	2598000	PC it can be just one that
2598000	2600000	can run that
2600000	2602000	that has somewhat decent specs I think
2602000	2604000	and a decent internet connection
2604000	2606000	let me ask this kind of weird
2606000	2608000	question is that
2608000	2610000	we know that Google and for those that
2610000	2612000	are on Twitch my watch is yelling at me to stand
2612000	2614000	so I'm going to stand for a little bit so if it looks weird
2614000	2616000	sorry but
2616000	2618000	let me ask you like
2618000	2620000	because we don't know exactly what this
2620000	2622000	console is going to be doing
2622000	2624000	and we would be just
2624000	2626000	theorizing things
2626000	2628000	and we could get proven wrong but what I can
2628000	2630000	ask is what
2630000	2632000	would Google need to do
2632000	2634000	and I open this up to our chatters and Jamie
2634000	2636000	if you have an opinion as well what would
2636000	2638000	Google need to do to convince
2638000	2640000	you to buy another console
2640000	2642000	and have another console in your house what
2642000	2644000	could they do knowing what you know about
2644000	2646000	Google what could Google do
2646000	2648000	differently that hasn't been done
2648000	2650000	before
2650000	2652000	I don't know if there's anything they
2652000	2654000	can do they just have to have good
2654000	2656000	games good exclusive games I'm not going to
2656000	2658000	buy another console to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey
2658000	2660000	or Doom or something
2660000	2662000	like that that's already out on
2662000	2664000	numerous other consoles
2664000	2666000	honestly I don't really
2666000	2668000	see any reason to buy it because I have everything
2668000	2670000	else I already want most of my
2670000	2672000	gaming lately has been on my
2672000	2674000	PC well and to be fair they
2674000	2676000	haven't made the pitch yet so we can say that
2676000	2678000	now but if it's a system what
2678000	2680000	needs to be in that pitch to sway you
2680000	2682000	it's going to take something really
2682000	2684000	huge I mean that's all it is because
2684000	2686000	I mean when Sony came
2686000	2688000	out you know for a first time with a new
2688000	2690000	system they had
2690000	2692000	a lot of good backing they had stuff coming
2692000	2694000	out that people wanted to play although Toshinden
2694000	2696000	doesn't necessarily count but
2696000	2698000	then you know
2698000	2700000	it's really a system is
2700000	2702000	only as good as the games that are on it
2702000	2704000	it's got to have the right
2704000	2706000	games to grab that attention like for example
2706000	2708000	if they had Namco behind
2708000	2710000	them and Namco's like we're going to do
2710000	2712000	Klonoa 3 exclusively for Google's
2712000	2714000	platform I'd be like bitch
2714000	2716000	mine
2716000	2718000	well I mean yeah and to that
2718000	2720000	fact I mean remember Game Center and stuff
2720000	2722000	when they were trying to really hype that up on
2722000	2724000	the whole iOS site I mean they
2724000	2726000	had you know it doing
2726000	2728000	or was it Epic Games
2728000	2730000	I don't remember doing the
2730000	2732000	one medieval
2732000	2734000	like first person game that they had on there and
2734000	2736000	that was just kind of it was cool
2736000	2738000	does anyone remember it now? No
2738000	2740000	so like
2740000	2742000	I
2742000	2744000	it's just hard like saying oh yeah we have
2744000	2746000	all these games that are popular on other
2746000	2748000	platforms but we're creating a new platform why
2748000	2750000	do I need to go to a new platform to play
2750000	2752000	I want to know what
2752000	2754000	you're going to do differently are you how you're
2754000	2756000	going to make this more interesting than these
2756000	2758000	other platforms what are you going to give me that
2758000	2760000	the other platforms can't give me what
2760000	2762000	new like exclusively brand
2762000	2764000	new games are you going to have on this platform
2764000	2766000	that I can't get anywhere else
2766000	2768000	here's my thought and again I don't want to go
2768000	2770000	too far down this path because it's all theorizing
2770000	2772000	anyway but if it's you know
2772000	2774000	being able to play games
2774000	2776000	that are already available what can
2776000	2778000	they do to make you want to do that
2778000	2780000	put out a $40 console
2780000	2782000	and I know that sounds ridiculous but
2782000	2784000	you know keep in mind what that little Google
2784000	2786000	Chromecast those aren't particularly expensive
2786000	2788000	right what if there's something that incorporates
2788000	2790000	gaming with that and it's like super cheap
2790000	2792000	and so it's like hey instead of buying
2792000	2794000	a $300 Xbox why don't you buy
2794000	2796000	this $40 Chromecast I get that
2796000	2798000	if it's that again
2798000	2800000	this is crazy I don't think that they could pull
2800000	2802000	$40 because Chromecast is basically
2802000	2804000	just a receiver your computer your computer
2804000	2806000	is sending the data to Chromecast
2806000	2808000	I feel like I did this exact same thing last year
2808000	2810000	what if there's a Microsoft Xbox
2810000	2812000	they have like Google TV boxes
2812000	2814000	aren't that expensive like my box
2814000	2816000	what was it the my box they have
2816000	2818000	the Huawei one I have
2818000	2820000	it's um
2820000	2822000	it's like 80 bucks I mean it's not that
2822000	2824000	expensive and but and it
2824000	2826000	does like gaming stuff on it
2826000	2828000	like I can purchase games on there like through
2828000	2830000	the Google Play Store I have you can
2830000	2832000	install the Steam Link app on there
2832000	2834000	you can um
2834000	2836000	you can stream to it just like you can
2836000	2838000	with a
2838000	2840000	you know one of those dongles
2840000	2842000	so assuming that that's
2842000	2844000	powerful enough to run whatever app
2844000	2846000	that they have to be able to stream this stuff
2846000	2848000	then yeah that would work just fine
2848000	2850000	um I don't think
2850000	2852000	you can't obviously be a very
2852000	2854000	expensive console if you're gonna do that but
2854000	2856000	once again I don't know
2856000	2858000	if I need to really purchase another thing
2858000	2860000	because I have smart we're in the land of smart
2860000	2862000	TVs nowadays here's the thing too and my
2862000	2864000	wish list would be that I hope Google takes a good
2864000	2866000	hard look at why Steam Link failed but
2866000	2868000	I mean we keep talking about this but I think at the end of the day
2868000	2870000	this is going to be more the streaming and the
2870000	2872000	existing games and all that might be
2872000	2874000	one element of this it might be a way to
2874000	2876000	um buffer the launch library
2876000	2878000	or whatever of Google's games but
2878000	2880000	and I think this is very important isn't it
2880000	2882000	out there now like on Twitter or somewhere that
2882000	2884000	Jade Raymond is at Google that's
2884000	2886000	because you know she left
2886000	2888000	her last thing when the Star Wars right
2888000	2890000	she was on the Star Wars thing that got cancelled right
2890000	2892000	and she disappeared and nobody really
2892000	2894000	kept tabs on where she ended up well it came out
2894000	2896000	this week she's at Google so
2896000	2898000	whatever this is likely
2898000	2900000	involves her and whatever
2900000	2902000	she's working on now so
2902000	2904000	I don't think we're just talking about
2904000	2906000	existing games I mean and I don't know
2906000	2908000	she could be a vision person maybe
2908000	2910000	she's not designing a game I don't know we're not
2910000	2912000	gonna know until we hear this one yeah and I hope
2912000	2914000	that's the case because you're gonna need to
2914000	2916000	have exclusive stuff you having all the other
2916000	2918000	games things are good as well
2918000	2920000	but you need to have something that's
2920000	2922000	exclusive to your platform because you can't just
2922000	2924000	say well we have all these other games
2924000	2926000	that the same those consoles have too and you're like
2926000	2928000	well crap I already have that console
2928000	2930000	that has those games or I have a PC that has those
2930000	2932000	games the only thing I see that it's a pretty
2932000	2934000	decent angle that they could go with is like
2934000	2936000	you know what say you
2936000	2938000	don't have one of those consoles say you own
2938000	2940000	a Nintendo Switch and that's all you own you know
2940000	2942000	and they can't run these in your PC you know
2942000	2944000	you have a decent PC but it's not
2944000	2946000	a gaming PC and you can't run this stuff
2946000	2948000	well this box will help you be able to
2948000	2950000	play those games that you can't play
2950000	2952000	elsewhere and we can do it pretty cheap
2952000	2954000	and then that's you know and
2954000	2956000	hey we'll throw a subscription service in there as well
2956000	2958000	that's how I can see them being
2958000	2960000	successful with it but
2960000	2962000	we'll see I don't know they've tried
2962000	2964000	so many times with doing like exclusive
2964000	2966000	they tried to make like iOS
2966000	2968000	is gonna be like this big gaming
2968000	2970000	centric thing they've had exclusive games coming
2970000	2972000	to it and no one gives a shit about
2972000	2974000	that as far as being like oh my god
2974000	2976000	this is gonna replace my gaming consoles
2976000	2978000	I think what
2978000	2980000	it is is I think
2980000	2982000	my prediction take it or leave it
2982000	2984000	is I do think Google is about to launch
2984000	2986000	they wanna be the Netflix of games as well
2986000	2988000	so they're gonna launch a competitor to Xbox
2988000	2990000	Game Pass essentially I think Google's
2990000	2992000	looking to do that and they're gonna do it through
2992000	2994000	something that probably
2994000	2996000	integrates into your TV pretty easy but
2996000	2998000	maybe something they can also deliver through Android phones
2998000	3000000	although I don't think that will be very great for the gaming experience
3000000	3002000	but we'll see maybe Google
3002000	3004000	will prove me wrong
3004000	3006000	but I think they're going to launch
3006000	3008000	their own type of competitor for that
3008000	3010000	and just like Netflix has to create
3010000	3012000	their own originals which
3012000	3014000	hopefully they don't cancel cause that was in the news this
3014000	3016000	week but I digress but just like Netflix
3016000	3018000	makes their own originals like Stranger Things and
3018000	3020000	shows that buff up the service
3020000	3022000	I think they are creating a few of their own
3022000	3024000	in house type of games to
3024000	3026000	buff up whatever this is
3026000	3028000	but something very interesting
3028000	3030000	Google did have a game developer before
3030000	3032000	Niantic, Google let him go
3032000	3034000	when that whole alphabet split happened
3034000	3036000	now granted what Niantic develops
3036000	3038000	are not things for the television
3038000	3040000	when Niantic's been developing of course Niantic
3040000	3042000	is the developer of Pokemon Go
3042000	3044000	but at the time Ingress was kind of their bread and butter
3044000	3046000	but it turns out they were also
3046000	3048000	creating this Pokemon Go at the time the split happened
3048000	3050000	so you know
3050000	3052000	Niantic's not creating games on the television but
3052000	3054000	I think it is interesting to note
3054000	3056000	that Google did have a game developer
3056000	3058000	that they uh
3058000	3060000	and one that ended up being a pretty big deal
3060000	3062000	after Pokemon Go that they let out
3062000	3064000	they let walk out the door
3064000	3066000	so they may still have an investment level in it
3066000	3068000	I don't know all the finance
3068000	3070000	but I think Nintendo is an investor
3070000	3072000	Google probably still has some money in it
3072000	3074000	we'll see
3074000	3076000	and off topic a little bit did you get to see the screenshots
3076000	3078000	for the new Harry Potter game
3078000	3080000	um
3080000	3082000	oh yes I did
3082000	3084000	I didn't make our show tonight
3084000	3086000	so some screenshots came out for Harry Potter Wizards Unite
3086000	3088000	which is Niantic's next game
3088000	3090000	I still don't know what you do in the game
3090000	3092000	they're partnering with
3092000	3094000	going off script for a little bit
3094000	3096000	so they're partnering with the Warner Brothers
3096000	3098000	the Portkey games
3098000	3100000	and it really looks like based on the screenshots
3100000	3102000	Portkey is helping them with the art assets
3102000	3104000	to give it that Harry Potter look
3104000	3106000	because the game looks pretty nice
3106000	3108000	and it doesn't look anything like Pokemon Go
3108000	3110000	or Ingress for sure
3110000	3112000	and basically there's no teams
3112000	3114000	so Harry Potter will not be a team based game
3114000	3116000	it sounds like you will join a house
3116000	3118000	for your character
3118000	3120000	but it's not something you're locked into
3120000	3122000	and it's not something where it's like
3122000	3124000	Slytherin versus Hufflepuff
3124000	3126000	or whatever
3126000	3128000	it's not going to be like Ingress or Pokemon Go
3128000	3130000	or very team or faction based
3130000	3132000	and it seems like it's about collecting what's called
3132000	3134000	foundables
3134000	3136000	there's a lot of talk of things in the Harry Potter lore
3136000	3138000	that since I don't follow it as closely
3138000	3140000	I didn't get it as much
3140000	3142000	but it sounds like it's kind of like a successor
3142000	3144000	to the ongoing story
3144000	3146000	but not the Cursed Child
3146000	3148000	kind of like in between that
3148000	3150000	and something where you're looking for
3150000	3152000	these foundables because there's some sort of
3152000	3154000	war that's brewing in the world where they have to
3154000	3156000	bring all these collectables
3156000	3158000	back and you play some type of
3158000	3160000	magic force
3160000	3162000	and I apologize to the Harry Potter fans
3162000	3164000	which Jamie I think you follow these books more than I do
3164000	3166000	for sure
3166000	3168000	but you should look up the stuff that came out
3168000	3170000	on the game this week because there was very clearly some sort
3170000	3172000	of Niantic press day
3172000	3174000	that the embargo lifted and all these websites
3174000	3176000	did their previews the same day
3176000	3178000	so there's some more info on the game out there right now
3178000	3180000	I'll take a peek, where my interest has been
3180000	3182000	peaked, aha!
3182000	3184000	I think it's great that
3184000	3186000	they're taking a no teams approach because that tells me
3186000	3188000	it's a very different game from the other two
3188000	3190000	right out the gate
3190000	3192000	I wonder though if they would have your house based on where you live
3192000	3194000	so if you're in the US you get
3194000	3196000	the Ilvermorny
3196000	3198000	it does not sound like that's
3198000	3200000	the case, it does sound like the
3200000	3202000	four traditional houses come into play
3202000	3204000	because in the story
3204000	3206000	you're going out into the world
3206000	3208000	to collect everything, so you could still
3208000	3210000	be like, yeah I think that's how
3210000	3212000	they wrote it in the story, but never say never
3212000	3214000	Dark Soccer and again I am no Harry Potter
3214000	3216000	expert so anything is still possible
3216000	3218000	alright, okay
3218000	3220000	yeah I didn't understand based on the screenshots
3220000	3222000	I know that they showed that you can do spells
3222000	3224000	to attack werewolves and crap
3224000	3226000	you have to save Harry
3226000	3228000	from being attacked by
3230000	3232000	there was this game I played on
3232000	3234000	iOS, it's probably on Android too
3234000	3236000	I think it was called Magica or something
3236000	3238000	I don't know if that was the name, but I remember
3238000	3240000	it was a game where you would trace
3240000	3242000	it was also a real world based
3242000	3244000	game and you would draw spells to
3244000	3246000	cast them in battle and stuff
3246000	3248000	and it seems like that is being included
3248000	3250000	I don't know, we'll see, I mean hey it's free
3250000	3252000	you can try it out
3252000	3254000	let's see, see a Tiberian chat
3254000	3256000	says clearly developed by a Hufflepuff
3256000	3258000	diplomatic looking for things
3258000	3260000	not about Flashy showing off
3260000	3262000	interesting
3262000	3264000	so, well we'll see
3264000	3266000	of course I'm going to try the game when it
3266000	3268000	comes out, I have played really
3268000	3270000	great AR real world
3270000	3272000	games and I have played trash
3272000	3274000	AR real world games, I played Garfield
3274000	3276000	Go for like a minute
3276000	3278000	I played Garfield Go for a couple minutes as well
3278000	3280000	I played that Draconius Go
3280000	3282000	that was like the rip off, actually the
3282000	3284000	Draconius thing brought some different ideas to the table
3284000	3286000	that game wasn't trash, it just
3286000	3288000	was kind of clunky
3288000	3290000	you know what my sister plays a lot
3290000	3292000	actually is that Jurassic parking
3292000	3294000	she's like really into that
3294000	3296000	that wasn't bad, I didn't dislike
3296000	3298000	it, it was just a little, I don't know
3298000	3300000	I don't like it when the stuff is randomly
3300000	3302000	generated, I think part of what's always
3302000	3304000	drawn me to my Niantic games
3304000	3306000	is that they are based on real world things
3306000	3308000	I would have never known were there if I
3308000	3310000	hadn't bothered to look
3310000	3312000	you know, in the early days when I first started
3312000	3314000	playing Ingress, I was like
3314000	3316000	I never had any idea that these things
3316000	3318000	were in my neighborhood and I think that's exactly
3318000	3320000	what Niantic was trying to do with that game
3320000	3322000	is get you out into your
3322000	3324000	neighborhood and know that these things were there
3324000	3326000	now granted, it's all user based
3326000	3328000	so, for example
3328000	3330000	they call the thing down the street, I want to say what they
3330000	3332000	call it, but you know what they call that in the game
3332000	3334000	and I don't think it is what they call it
3334000	3336000	it's certainly not, so
3336000	3338000	I don't think everything is necessarily educational
3338000	3340000	so, it's yeah
3340000	3342000	taking liberties with
3342000	3344000	I'm surprised that the other thing
3344000	3346000	that's at the other park
3346000	3348000	is not something because
3348000	3350000	that's more significant than
3350000	3352000	a box in the ground
3352000	3354000	it has been tried to be submitted
3354000	3356000	multiple times because I keep seeing it
3356000	3358000	and are you talking about a thing
3358000	3360000	that looks like a, and I'm sorry we're having to be cryptic
3360000	3362000	I have a right to my privacy
3362000	3364000	I don't even know what the hell it is
3364000	3366000	does it look like an electrical thing?
3366000	3368000	yes
3368000	3370000	that has tried to be submitted at least three times
3370000	3372000	because I keep seeing it in the freaking OPR
3372000	3374000	and I can tell you without question
3374000	3376000	who's doing it and why they want it
3376000	3378000	but it's
3378000	3380000	look, the playground's fine
3380000	3382000	gazebos are fine, that ain't fine
3382000	3384000	there's hazardous
3384000	3386000	don't go here all around it
3386000	3388000	that can't be a point of interest
3389000	3391000	anyway, Bobby Blackwolf points out
3391000	3393000	what's happening now around here is I'm seeing
3393000	3395000	pokestops for things that no longer exist
3395000	3397000	yeah, that happens too
3397000	3399000	I mean, the game's been out a while
3399000	3401000	you could report them invalid in Ingress
3401000	3403000	I don't know if you could do that natively in Pokemon Go though
3403000	3405000	no, because I had to do that
3405000	3407000	there was some murals and stuff
3407000	3409000	that were near my house
3409000	3411000	that there's no mural there anymore
3411000	3413000	I was kind of wondering
3413000	3415000	that inside, but then you look at the photo
3415000	3417000	and it's outside and it's clearly not there anymore
3417000	3419000	alright, well I want to move on
3419000	3421000	I do want to go to the next story we have here
3421000	3423000	which is about
3423000	3425000	the Valve Store and the Steam Store
3425000	3427000	and a potential kind of
3427000	3429000	privacy sort of issue
3429000	3431000	that may have happened with the Epic Store
3431000	3433000	here's the deal
3433000	3435000	Valve is out there implying that
3435000	3437000	Epic's launcher has copied
3437000	3439000	user data from Steam
3439000	3441000	and now they're going to launch an investigation
3441000	3443000	whatever that means
3443000	3445000	apparently what happened is that Epic
3445000	3447000	did confirm this
3447000	3449000	was taking their launcher and it made an encrypted
3449000	3451000	local copy of your
3451000	3453000	local config.vdf
3453000	3455000	Steam file, because what it was
3455000	3457000	doing is that when you would say yes
3457000	3459000	I want to import my Steam friends
3459000	3461000	into the Epic Store
3461000	3463000	game, it's using that
3463000	3465000	file to do it, but Epic is saying
3465000	3467000	in a quote they said
3467000	3469000	information from
3469000	3471000	this file is only sent to Epic if you
3471000	3473000	choose to import your Steam friends
3473000	3475000	and then only hashed IDs
3475000	3477000	of your friends are sent and no
3477000	3479000	other information from the file
3479000	3481000	and that's only
3481000	3483000	accessing that information after you choose
3483000	3485000	to import Steam friends, but of course
3485000	3487000	Valve, not happy about it
3487000	3489000	in a statement to bleep the computer
3489000	3491000	it's been there forever though, I mean like
3491000	3493000	it's been like that for months
3493000	3495000	in a statement to bleeping computer
3495000	3497000	Valve said, we are looking into
3497000	3499000	what information the Epic launcher collects
3499000	3501000	from Steam, the Steam client locally
3501000	3503000	saves data such as the list of games you own
3503000	3505000	your friends list and saved login tokens
3505000	3507000	similar to information stored
3507000	3509000	in web browser cookies, which makes sense
3509000	3511000	if you have 500 games in your library you don't want
3511000	3513000	Steam loading that every time
3513000	3515000	But isn't that the same as like if I
3515000	3517000	downloaded the Firefox
3517000	3519000	web browser and it wants to import my data
3519000	3521000	and cookies and stuff like that, I mean that's basic
3521000	3523000	Yeah, it's basically the same thing, you're right
3523000	3525000	And why are we throwing a fit about this?
3525000	3527000	I think they're just, whatever
3527000	3529000	You think they're making an issue just to make an issue?
3529000	3531000	I think they're making an issue just to make an issue
3531000	3533000	And maybe that's
3533000	3535000	part of it, I don't know
3535000	3537000	Kaijuto in chat over
3537000	3539000	at twitch.tv slash vog network though says
3539000	3541000	Epic fail
3541000	3543000	I don't know, again, I don't know if this is any different
3543000	3545000	from what other places are doing, but maybe they
3545000	3547000	weren't super transparent in what
3547000	3549000	they were doing, but it would make sense
3549000	3551000	that if you want this
3551000	3553000	launcher, this store
3553000	3555000	to access your Steam's
3555000	3557000	friends list, then you are giving it some
3557000	3559000	sort of permission to access Steam
3559000	3561000	Right? I mean that would be implied, right?
3561000	3563000	It just doesn't just magically know
3563000	3565000	And I don't, I did do the
3565000	3567000	import, because whatever
3567000	3569000	I did it in GOG too, because GOG
3569000	3571000	used to have that thing, I think they sunsetted it
3571000	3573000	But they used to have that thing where like if you own
3573000	3575000	a game on Steam, you'd like get a copy
3575000	3577000	of it on GOG, but it was limited to
3577000	3579000	certain games only, but still there were a few that
3579000	3581000	came over, so like I let my GOG
3581000	3583000	access my Steam, where
3583000	3585000	was the stink about that?
3585000	3587000	I don't remember that
3587000	3589000	It's because it's convenient now, because everyone's
3589000	3591000	upset about privacy
3591000	3593000	and people breaching privacy
3593000	3595000	agreements and stuff like that
3595000	3597000	Hey look it, they're bad
3597000	3599000	Bobby wants to point out the difference, Bobby
3599000	3601000	sometimes understands the tech stuff
3601000	3603000	better than I do, that's for sure, so he
3603000	3605000	explains what the difference is
3605000	3607000	Epic is preemptively getting this
3607000	3609000	data, and then asking
3609000	3611000	if you want to import it
3611000	3613000	Firefox doesn't go after the data
3613000	3615000	until you tell it to, that's the
3615000	3617000	problem, is that Epic is preemptively grabbing
3617000	3619000	that file going, I'm just gonna
3619000	3621000	put this right back over here
3621000	3623000	for when this user says they want to
3623000	3625000	import their Steam friends, because who wouldn't want to do that
3625000	3627000	Fine, I mean I guess they could just
3627000	3629000	easily not
3629000	3631000	do that, I mean that seems like a very easy fix
3631000	3633000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure
3633000	3635000	Are they even saying that Epic has
3635000	3637000	already fixed it? I'm trying to see if in this
3637000	3639000	story they mention that Epic already fixed
3639000	3641000	it, but this might have been too
3641000	3643000	no, I haven't
3643000	3645000	seen any, because this story was just from
3645000	3647000	yesterday on the 16th, so I haven't seen anything
3647000	3649000	yet, but I imagine that's something
3649000	3651000	that Epic's probably gonna do would be the easy
3651000	3653000	fix, would be to just stop grabbing that file
3653000	3655000	until you say yes
3655000	3657000	import my Steam friends
3657000	3659000	Anyway
3659000	3661000	Let's move on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3661000	3663000	This one actually is going
3663000	3665000	to be a little bit of cultural
3665000	3667000	explanation
3667000	3669000	is needed behind it, but
3669000	3671000	there's a game that was coming
3671000	3673000	out, it's part of the Yakuza
3673000	3675000	series in Japan
3675000	3677000	that's called
3677000	3679000	Yakuza slash Ryugagotoku
3679000	3681000	the game's called Judge Eyes
3681000	3683000	and actually it was going to be coming out
3683000	3685000	in the US under the name Judgment
3685000	3687000	it was developed by Sega, well they took
3687000	3689000	it down off of their website because the
3689000	3691000	actor who plays a crime boss
3691000	3693000	in the game, the real life
3693000	3695000	actor, Pierre Taki
3695000	3697000	was
3697000	3699000	caught for possession
3699000	3701000	and use of cocaine
3701000	3703000	and
3703000	3705000	for a scandal
3705000	3707000	like that, drug use scandals are
3707000	3709000	pretty much, they're almost
3709000	3711000	career ending, it's what
3711000	3713000	happens is that instead of here where it
3713000	3715000	could drive sales of something
3715000	3717000	you know, or people want to know more
3717000	3719000	about it and the person's out in the limelight
3719000	3721000	and getting Lindsay Lohan style fame
3721000	3723000	there, people are
3723000	3725000	pretty much erased from the public eye
3725000	3727000	yeah I know, I was like, over here it's like
3727000	3729000	what, Lindsay Lohan's doing cocaine?
3729000	3731000	what a shock, you know
3731000	3733000	I'd be more surprised if she wasn't
3733000	3735000	doing cocaine
3735000	3737000	well in Japan you
3737000	3739000	sort of are publicly erased
3739000	3741000	so in that case
3741000	3743000	the game Judge Eyes
3743000	3745000	has been pulled off of Sega's site, all their
3745000	3747000	marketing, social media has been
3747000	3749000	completely removed, they've halted
3749000	3751000	sales of the game digitally, they've
3751000	3753000	pulled back their shipping orders
3753000	3755000	for the game, they are taking a big
3755000	3757000	hit to take this off the market
3757000	3759000	and then of course whether or not it's going to have
3759000	3761000	US release still
3761000	3763000	remains to be seen
3763000	3765000	I mean it did have, for the main character
3765000	3767000	it was actually handled
3767000	3769000	acted by and voiced by
3769000	3771000	Kimura Takaya who's
3771000	3773000	a member of SMAP
3773000	3775000	so I mean we're talking big names
3775000	3777000	and if anyone
3777000	3779000	might not know
3779000	3781000	Pierre Taki from his own
3781000	3783000	acting, he's also
3783000	3785000	part of a synth pop duo called Denki Groove
3785000	3787000	which I know that some people
3787000	3789000	listen to some of the Japanese
3789000	3791000	synth pop so
3791000	3793000	I mean the game looked to be
3793000	3795000	pretty interesting, I had
3795000	3797000	even heard about it before
3797000	3799000	all this went down, but I'm really not
3799000	3801000	surprised that for
3801000	3803000	how it's going down in Japan that this is happening
3803000	3805000	this way, you know other situations
3805000	3807000	like this
3807000	3809000	is that there's
3809000	3811000	been other actors
3811000	3813000	there was, I'm trying to see
3813000	3815000	Taki was also the voice of
3815000	3817000	Olaf
3817000	3819000	yeah and I was about to say because Sia Tabiri in chat says
3819000	3821000	didn't something similar happen to one of the voice actors from Kingdom Hearts 3
3821000	3823000	yes it's actually the same story
3823000	3825000	but it's only going to affect the Japanese release
3825000	3827000	of the game because the voice acting is not
3827000	3829000	the Japanese voice acting is not
3829000	3831000	in the US release
3831000	3833000	it's another thing too is that anyone who does work
3833000	3835000	for a company is seen
3835000	3837000	almost directly
3837000	3839000	as a representative
3839000	3841000	of the company and so
3841000	3843000	they distance themselves from it
3843000	3845000	which basically is where that
3845000	3847000	public erasure comes from
3847000	3849000	is to protect
3849000	3851000	the reputation of the company
3851000	3853000	oh it's very much a culture thing, I mean not in Japan
3853000	3855000	but in some other countries
3855000	3857000	you can get put to death
3857000	3859000	drug smuggling is like a
3859000	3861000	death penalty charge, didn't you all watch Broke Down
3861000	3863000	Palace?
3863000	3865000	if an American were to go to Japan
3865000	3867000	and have pot on them
3867000	3869000	they would be
3869000	3871000	deported immediately
3871000	3873000	and also usually banned from returning
3873000	3875000	to the country
3875000	3877000	which again, the marijuana
3877000	3879000	perspective is changing significantly
3879000	3881000	in this country, especially where we live
3881000	3883000	we're in California, there's a pot store not that far
3883000	3885000	from here and I drive by every day on my way home
3885000	3887000	from work
3887000	3889000	there was a delay in the release of some Studio Ghibli
3889000	3891000	stuff because
3891000	3893000	the musician Asuka who did
3893000	3895000	some vocals for a music video
3895000	3897000	was arrested for drug possession
3897000	3899000	and another anime, Kill Me Baby
3899000	3901000	were pulled from public circulation
3901000	3903000	because the voice actress
3903000	3905000	Takabei had cocaine
3905000	3907000	speaking of the international
3907000	3909000	thing though, I know we're joking about
3909000	3911000	Lindsay Lohan and I have no idea what her
3911000	3913000	drug status is
3913000	3915000	but does
3915000	3917000	it seem to only affect people
3917000	3919000	and celebrities from that country
3919000	3921000	because isn't there still a lot of
3921000	3923000	you know, like American pop culture
3923000	3925000	stuff that makes its way into Japan
3925000	3927000	and do they still hold
3927000	3929000	the American celebrities to that same standard
3929000	3931000	because I don't think they do
3931000	3933000	I don't think so, I mean I don't know
3933000	3935000	Well that's kind of messed up
3935000	3937000	Either that or it's just only
3937000	3939000	I don't think it matters so much
3939000	3941000	if it's a reflection on
3941000	3943000	an American arm of the company
3943000	3945000	because
3945000	3947000	I guess they expect that shit from us anyway
3947000	3949000	I don't know
3949000	3951000	Stupid Americans and the cocaine
3953000	3955000	But I mean, in the long
3955000	3957000	run it's just like
3957000	3959000	I don't know
3959000	3961000	Yeah
3961000	3963000	It's a completely different
3963000	3965000	It's a cultural difference and we have to be respectful
3965000	3967000	of that but at the same time, you know
3967000	3969000	we are a video game show, it's interesting to talk about how this
3969000	3971000	wow, I mean because of this culture
3971000	3973000	this game that was supposed to come out is being delayed
3973000	3975000	not to make it better
3975000	3977000	Big marketing too
3977000	3979000	The site for this, just looking at how it was built
3979000	3981000	Good lord
3981000	3983000	There was some work that went into that
3983000	3985000	And we're talking about Instagram line
3985000	3987000	Yeah
3987000	3989000	You know, some of the big marketing outlets
3989000	3991000	And honestly enough, there is a part of me
3991000	3993000	that wishes we had that same sort of
3993000	3995000	idea here
3995000	3997000	Because then
3997000	3999000	there wouldn't be such a big
3999000	4001000	I'm going to do this terrible thing
4001000	4003000	because it's going to bring attention to me
4003000	4005000	How far down the rabbit hole
4005000	4007000	do I want to go?
4007000	4009000	But here's why they don't
4009000	4011000	Because we also have a problem in this country
4011000	4013000	about it being equal
4013000	4015000	based on what you look like
4015000	4017000	if you know what I mean, right?
4017000	4019000	Anyway, I got to watch
4019000	4021000	Far Down the Rabbit Hole, but I think
4021000	4023000	that is an issue that we have to
4023000	4025000	deal with here
4025000	4027000	that is why we don't do that
4027000	4029000	I'm saying
4029000	4031000	I think that
4031000	4033000	public and business
4033000	4035000	ostracization
4035000	4037000	for people who are like that
4037000	4039000	until there's been a period of recovery
4039000	4041000	is a good idea
4041000	4043000	so that they aren't having
4043000	4045000	this big public spectacle meltdown and setting
4045000	4047000	an example for other people
4047000	4049000	Well, isn't it also sort of the American way that we protest?
4049000	4051000	I mean, that's kind of what happens
4051000	4053000	That's different. I think that's entirely different
4053000	4055000	They've been having a protest
4055000	4057000	recently in Japan for LGBT rights
4057000	4059000	for a right to marry
4059000	4061000	So, just saying
4061000	4063000	Protesting happens there, too
4063000	4065000	Burn some bras
4065000	4067000	for equal marriage
4067000	4069000	I don't know
4069000	4071000	What I'm saying is that
4071000	4073000	this is a different thing than a protest
4073000	4075000	This is
4075000	4077000	keeping a company
4077000	4079000	reputation
4079000	4081000	clean, and distancing
4081000	4083000	themselves from something like that
4083000	4085000	instead of using it as a marketing tool
4085000	4087000	Some other comments in our chat
4087000	4089000	over at twitch.tv
4089000	4091000	Bobby Blackwolf pointing out
4091000	4093000	you have to get special waivers to take prescription
4093000	4095000	Adderall in Japan
4095000	4097000	Can't buy ibuprofen over the counter
4097000	4099000	Oh, really?
4099000	4101000	But you can get toothpaste that rebuilds the
4101000	4103000	enamel on your teeth, and they don't sell it here
4103000	4105000	But here, you can't get Tylenol 3
4105000	4107000	whereas you can go into Canada
4107000	4109000	and you can't
4109000	4111000	Dear Canadian friends
4111000	4113000	Anyway
4113000	4115000	I hear also in Valve you can't get Tylenol 3
4115000	4117000	either
4117000	4119000	Fuck off
4119000	4121000	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
4121000	4123000	they accept that pot is something that
4123000	4125000	Westerners do, they do not
4125000	4127000	accept that pot is something that Japanese
4127000	4129000	do
4129000	4131000	Interesting way of putting it, and that's probably
4131000	4133000	a very succinct way of saying it
4133000	4135000	SHA100Matt says, I think Russell Brand
4135000	4137000	got deported from Japan
4137000	4139000	for something like this. Whatever happened to that guy?
4139000	4141000	I know someone first hand
4141000	4143000	who I used to work with that got deported, and he's half
4143000	4145000	Japanese
4145000	4147000	I think his was like a limitation
4147000	4149000	that after like six years
4149000	4151000	he could return for family visits
4151000	4153000	But still, that's wowie
4153000	4155000	He got deported for pot
4155000	4157000	Alright
4157000	4159000	Taking drugs into other countries is just
4159000	4161000	generally not a good idea
4161000	4163000	unless you have a prescription
4163000	4165000	and you have all those forms
4165000	4167000	that was brought up previously
4167000	4169000	which is probably best you don't bring drugs
4169000	4171000	Besides, if you're high on drugs, then all those genitals
4171000	4173000	become unblurred, and they can't have that
4173000	4175000	What?
4175000	4177000	For porn
4177000	4179000	Oh, Jesus Christ
4179000	4181000	Remember Final Fuck X
4181000	4183000	I'm like, there's a joke
4183000	4185000	you tried to tell that I'm just
4185000	4187000	not getting
4187000	4189000	Alright, anyway
4189000	4191000	Please can we move on
4191000	4193000	Next story
4193000	4195000	Let's move on. Let's talk about that number three
4195000	4197000	in Valve, shall we?
4197000	4199000	Well, Valve is not going to be putting out
4199000	4201000	a sequel for Left 4 Dead anytime soon
4201000	4203000	but that doesn't mean that you can't live without
4203000	4205000	Left 4 Dead, because it's going to be back
4205000	4207000	Left 4 Dead is coming back
4207000	4209000	as Back 4 Blood
4209000	4211000	It is a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead
4211000	4213000	that is going to be coming out
4213000	4215000	by Turtle Rock and Warner Brothers
4215000	4217000	and
4217000	4219000	it is basically
4219000	4221000	very similar to
4221000	4223000	Left 4 Dead
4223000	4225000	They don't really have many details about it yet
4225000	4227000	not even any pictures, but
4227000	4229000	I'm sure it'll be something we'll be hearing about very soon
4229000	4231000	maybe E3 or GDC
4231000	4233000	So, I'm looking forward to that
4233000	4235000	because Left 4 Dead was a pretty awesome game
4235000	4237000	Too bad we never got a third one
4237000	4239000	But here you go!
4239000	4241000	Well, now we get something that's similar
4241000	4243000	Isn't that interesting when that happens
4243000	4245000	when the publisher
4245000	4247000	doesn't want to make the next game
4247000	4249000	so the team is just like, alright, we'll just
4249000	4251000	go make our own studio and make the game
4251000	4253000	we want to make. Interesting
4253000	4255000	It's been a few years
4255000	4257000	since Left 4 Dead 2, though, so it'll be interesting
4257000	4259000	to see what kind of changes
4259000	4261000	they put in the game
4261000	4263000	new engine, certainly
4263000	4265000	some more social elements, who knows
4265000	4267000	We'll see
4267000	4269000	Alright, especially because
4269000	4271000	Left 4 Dead was one of those first
4271000	4273000	horde mode type of games that ever existed
4273000	4275000	and now there's been a ton of hordes
4275000	4277000	Like a purely co-op
4277000	4279000	type of game
4279000	4281000	Now we've had Gears of War, Mass Effect multiplayer
4281000	4283000	Horde mode was kind of like
4283000	4285000	what we had for a while instead of Battle Royale
4285000	4287000	So it'll be really interesting to see
4287000	4289000	what they
4289000	4291000	now have learned in these years
4291000	4293000	that that genre was really
4293000	4295000	in the spotlight
4295000	4297000	That's something I'm trying to shoehorn
4297000	4299000	Battle Royale in there
4299000	4301000	Shehulk in chat says, yes, big fun
4301000	4303000	Left 4 Dead 3
4303000	4305000	Yeah, no, people really
4305000	4307000	I know Alan was a big fan of Left 4 Dead games too
4307000	4309000	A little scary for me, but I might try it again
4309000	4311000	I might try it again. My tastes in gaming
4311000	4313000	have evolved a little bit
4313000	4315000	and you can make it even worse
4315000	4317000	How so? Like make it scarier?
4317000	4319000	Or can it make it cute?
4319000	4321000	I was going to say rainbows and puppies
4321000	4323000	and kittens
4323000	4325000	Yeah, I saw some pretty weird stuff
4325000	4327000	Okay, that would be alright. If a kitten
4327000	4329000	jumps up and surprises me, I'm okay with that
4329000	4331000	But it's a mean kitten
4331000	4333000	No, I don't like mean kittens
4333000	4335000	It's Goose
4335000	4337000	Did you see it, by the way?
4337000	4339000	See what? Captain Marvel
4339000	4341000	Then I'm not going to spoil
4341000	4343000	I'll never get to the movies
4343000	4345000	No, I'm going to take you to see it
4345000	4347000	One day this week, we're going to go
4347000	4349000	You are going to enjoy
4349000	4351000	Free movie, awesome
4351000	4353000	It is the best
4353000	4355000	Do I have to see the other Marvel movies?
4355000	4357000	No
4357000	4359000	The last Marvel movie I saw was
4359000	4361000	The First Avengers
4361000	4363000	Maybe for one of the after credits
4363000	4365000	But I can explain that because I haven't even seen
4365000	4367000	Age of Ultron
4367000	4369000	I haven't seen the Thanos movie
4369000	4371000	Although everyone spoiled it for me
4371000	4373000	Okay, well yeah, that one's been all over
4373000	4375000	I've not watched it yet
4375000	4377000	But, I mean
4377000	4379000	I haven't watched
4379000	4381000	Black Panther yet either
4381000	4383000	Captain Marvel is the best
4383000	4385000	I do want to see Black Panther
4385000	4387000	No, it is the best
4387000	4389000	You haven't seen it, so you can't say anything about it
4389000	4391000	Okay, fine, I'll watch it and then we'll see that
4391000	4393000	it's not the best
4393000	4395000	It speaks to women's experiences every fucking day
4395000	4397000	And every man should be
4397000	4399000	required to watch it
4399000	4401000	Okay, sure
4401000	4403000	I don't watch a lot of superhero movies
4403000	4405000	at all, but I do want to see what is
4405000	4407000	coming out that I do want to see
4407000	4409000	Is that us? That looks scary
4409000	4411000	as hell
4411000	4413000	That I want to see, that's for sure
4413000	4415000	Alright, um
4415000	4417000	Let's see, going in chat
4417000	4419000	Let's see, Tigerclaw says
4419000	4421000	If you're a cat lover, you must see Captain Marvel
4421000	4423000	My retort would be if you're a cat lover
4423000	4425000	you must see Carly Rae Jepsen's new music
4425000	4427000	video, because
4427000	4429000	that was also a cat thing and it's incredible
4429000	4431000	and so you should see it
4431000	4433000	Okay, let's see
4433000	4435000	Let's move on and talk about the
4435000	4437000	Overwatch League
4437000	4439000	And this was
4439000	4441000	kind of one of those things where I said
4441000	4443000	I jabbed the Overwatch League a little bit
4443000	4445000	I should say jab, I said it was room for improvement
4445000	4447000	when I was first talking about the Overwatch League
4447000	4449000	It's nice to see them taking this
4449000	4451000	step into this next story
4451000	4453000	And the fact
4453000	4455000	that Overwatch League has been successful enough
4455000	4457000	to do this I think is pretty cool as well
4457000	4459000	It says a lot about where esports might be going
4459000	4461000	But next year they are saying
4461000	4463000	according to Commissioner
4463000	4465000	Nate Nasner
4465000	4467000	Overwatch League teams
4467000	4469000	will be playing in their cities
4469000	4471000	next year, so
4471000	4473000	right now if you weren't already aware
4473000	4475000	there's the Blizzard Arena in
4475000	4477000	Los Angeles
4477000	4479000	and that's where all the matches are being
4479000	4481000	played, but for next year
4481000	4483000	if you are the San Francisco Shock
4483000	4485000	which would be the closest team to us
4485000	4487000	there's going to be a place in San Francisco
4487000	4489000	where you go to see them play because
4489000	4491000	Yeah, don't they have like their own esports arena?
4491000	4493000	I mean that's, I thought
4493000	4495000	I know at least Oakland does, I'm sure San Francisco does somewhere
4495000	4497000	I'm just not up and up on where all the places are
4497000	4499000	Who it was that had the
4499000	4501000	arena, because I know that they were doing the
4501000	4503000	DDR tournament from there and
4503000	4505000	That was in Oakland
4505000	4507000	Yeah, which I mean, you know
4507000	4509000	The San Francisco 49ers play in Santa Clara
4509000	4511000	which is like 45 minutes away on a good day
4511000	4513000	so it doesn't always have to match exactly
4513000	4515000	I don't know where they're playing this stuff, we'll find out
4515000	4517000	Yeah, but
4517000	4519000	you know, but what's going to be interesting about this is that
4519000	4521000	you have teams in China
4521000	4523000	you have teams in Europe
4523000	4525000	all over the US and Canada
4525000	4527000	so it's going to be like these time zones
4527000	4529000	I'm like, dang
4529000	4531000	this might be a little rough on
4531000	4533000	some of the players because these time zones
4533000	4535000	are all going to be all over the map, right?
4535000	4537000	So, it'll be interesting
4537000	4539000	to see what the schedule looks like to make this happen
4539000	4541000	but I think this is
4541000	4543000	this is a good next step for esports
4543000	4545000	I think it is important, I think if you want to
4545000	4547000	grow esports to have the availability
4547000	4549000	for people to go watch and see the game in person
4549000	4551000	and really see what it's all about
4551000	4553000	I think that is going to be a great step
4553000	4555000	so, you know, maybe I'll go
4555000	4557000	to San Francisco and see one of these someday
4557000	4559000	and see what it's all about
4559000	4561000	I still have some
4561000	4563000	reservations on what the team
4563000	4565000	rosters look like and so forth, but we'll see
4565000	4567000	maybe that will improve in 2020 as well
4569000	4571000	yeah, so this has always been something
4571000	4573000	that they are going for
4573000	4575000	I'm looking for the original tweet here, here it is
4575000	4577000	from Nate Nasner who says
4595000	4597000	there won't be even more
4597000	4599000	there's 20 teams today, there might be even more
4599000	4601000	by this time next year, so
4601000	4603000	we'll see
4603000	4605000	let's see, Bobby in chat
4605000	4607000	is saying
4607000	4609000	I wonder if it's like the current structure
4609000	4611000	where there will be a weekend where a bunch of teams
4611000	4613000	are in a home team city
4613000	4615000	to play each other, that's what they're doing in
4615000	4617000	Atlanta in June for the Atlanta rain
4617000	4619000	instead of doing home and away matches
4619000	4621000	I'm unsure
4621000	4623000	I don't know what
4623000	4625000	that's, if it's going to be one for one
4625000	4627000	or what they'll do with that, it'll be interesting to see though
4627000	4629000	so
4629000	4631000	let's see, and yeah, as you see 100 Matt
4631000	4633000	as far as the team thing goes points out the New York
4633000	4635000	Giants and Jets play in New Jersey
4635000	4637000	and that's how it works sometimes, yep
4637000	4639000	so, anyhow
4639000	4641000	we'll see what develops with the Overwatch League, I think
4641000	4643000	I think they're on, not that I want you guys to
4643000	4645000	leave, but I think they're on right now
4645000	4647000	and you know, I think they do
4647000	4649000	a lot of stuff throughout the week
4649000	4651000	there's a lot of programming there, so it'll be
4651000	4653000	it's going to be interesting to see if that gets
4653000	4655000	bigger and bigger and where that ends up going
4655000	4657000	so, alright, let's move on
4657000	4659000	Darsakra, you have a kind of neat rumor
4659000	4661000	for us, right?
4661000	4663000	Well, there's been some interesting
4663000	4665000	revelations regarding
4665000	4667000	what should be, what could be the PlayStation 5
4667000	4669000	more rumors, but it's based
4669000	4671000	off of a patent that Sony filed
4671000	4673000	in October last year
4673000	4675000	and also, I think, quickly it's worth mentioning
4675000	4677000	this rumor, you got, you're reading this in like, what
4677000	4679000	Esquire or something, it's a big magazine
4679000	4681000	so, like, this isn't just like some dude said on Twitter
4681000	4683000	this is like, magazines are picking this up and running
4683000	4685000	with it, yeah
4685000	4687000	So, basically, they think that the PlayStation 5
4687000	4689000	is going to include
4689000	4691000	deep learning technology
4691000	4693000	basically using the player's skills
4693000	4695000	and habits to adapt the games
4695000	4697000	the patent reads like this
4697000	4699000	with a quote
4699000	4701000	Generally, a video game and video game
4701000	4703000	assistants are adapted to a player
4703000	4705000	for example, a narrative of the video game
4705000	4707000	is personalized to an experience level of
4707000	4709000	the player, similarly, assistants and interacting
4709000	4711000	with particular content of the video game
4711000	4713000	is also personalized
4713000	4715000	the personalization learns from
4715000	4717000	historical interactions of players
4717000	4719000	with the video game and optionally
4719000	4721000	other video games, in an example
4721000	4723000	a deep learning neural network is implemented
4723000	4725000	to generate knowledge from
4725000	4727000	historical interactions, the personalization
4727000	4729000	is then set according to the knowledge
4729000	4731000	so, basically, it's like Psycho Mantis
4731000	4733000	on steroids
4733000	4735000	Is this real, I mean, it sounds fancy
4735000	4737000	and high tech, but I have to ask the hard question
4737000	4739000	is it really, though? I mean, don't get me wrong
4739000	4741000	this sounds neat, um, you know
4741000	4743000	I love the idea of a game, especially like
4743000	4745000	for kids that are playing it, that like gets easier
4745000	4747000	if they keep dying in the same spot or whatever
4747000	4749000	or maybe if you're really good at it gets harder
4749000	4751000	but then I can't help but think, like, you know
4751000	4753000	like, let's say, like, an elliptical machine
4753000	4755000	can increase
4755000	4757000	or decrease the workout based on how you're
4757000	4759000	performing and where your heart rate is at
4759000	4761000	so, I mean, and that's just
4761000	4763000	a little machine
4763000	4765000	like, it's not a Playstation 5, so I'm just saying
4765000	4767000	like, it sounds like, ooh
4767000	4769000	it's this, like, big technology, but it's like
4769000	4771000	it more sounds like it's a way of thinking
4771000	4773000	a system, a core thing
4773000	4775000	to maybe put in that all games would consider
4775000	4777000	It doesn't seem like that's something that a system
4777000	4779000	should be doing, that's something that a game developer
4779000	4781000	should be putting in if they want to implement
4781000	4783000	that, because... Or maybe the game contains the algorithm
4783000	4785000	but the machine has the hardware for it
4785000	4787000	And maybe it's something like
4787000	4789000	6-axis, not to put a negative spin on it
4789000	4791000	but developers can choose if they just
4791000	4793000	want to put it in or not very easy, right?
4793000	4795000	Or, let's say that Steam
4795000	4797000	gives you easy access
4797000	4799000	to put in mods and achievements and things like that
4799000	4801000	like, it's your choice if you want to, how much
4801000	4803000	you want to run with that type of thing, I could see that
4803000	4805000	but, if it is Sony's
4805000	4807000	thing, you can bet your ass
4807000	4809000	that things like Last of Us 3
4809000	4811000	Uncharted, whatever they do
4811000	4813000	all these games I'm making up, but you know
4813000	4815000	our Sony's powerhouses
4815000	4817000	would likely implement this
4817000	4819000	you know, because they're Sony's games, so of course
4819000	4821000	they want to show off Sony's tech
4821000	4823000	Right, right
4823000	4825000	What do you think, Barasaka?
4825000	4827000	Would you be more interested in
4827000	4829000	PlayStation 5 or something like this?
4829000	4831000	I just said that I think it's going to be implemented
4831000	4833000	through the games, with the hardware being on the system
4833000	4835000	and I honestly think it would be great
4835000	4837000	I mean, but I'd also like the opportunity to be able to
4837000	4839000	turn it off and have it not transmit data
4839000	4841000	Okay
4841000	4843000	I don't want it to learn and then send my
4843000	4845000	habits to Sony
4845000	4847000	Okay, makes sense
4847000	4849000	But that could be something they're thinking about is
4849000	4851000	the portability, so that like if I play at a friend's
4851000	4853000	house, but then you're right, you'd have to
4853000	4855000	send to Sony and maybe that's
4855000	4857000	I don't mind analytics for
4857000	4859000	like anonymous analytics
4859000	4861000	Um, you know
4861000	4863000	in the case of your computer with anonymous analytics
4863000	4865000	they use that to determine how to
4865000	4867000	you know, release software updates
4867000	4869000	how to make the things better, when to do
4869000	4871000	full security updates if a lot of people are
4871000	4873000	reporting the same issue, you know
4873000	4875000	that's fine, crash reports
4875000	4877000	whatever, but I don't want
4877000	4879000	personalized data
4879000	4881000	I don't mind if it's anonymous, like
4881000	4883000	my 23andMe stuff is pretty much anonymous
4883000	4885000	I don't care, but
4885000	4887000	if it has my name on it
4887000	4889000	which I opted out of anything that put my name on it
4889000	4891000	I would have a problem with it
4891000	4893000	Same goes with this, I don't want
4893000	4895000	my habits directly
4895000	4897000	related to me to go out
4897000	4899000	to whatever
4899000	4901000	they can store Let me ask this very
4901000	4903000	real question, because this is actually how
4903000	4905000	I conduct myself on Playstation
4905000	4907000	What if you could put your fake name on it?
4907000	4909000	I still
4909000	4911000	wouldn't want that because my fake name now is
4911000	4913000	so traceable It's still individualized
4913000	4915000	in a way Yeah
4915000	4917000	it would still be, because I mean
4917000	4919000	at the very least they would have whatever billing information
4919000	4921000	that you put in through it, because your real name is on
4921000	4923000	your billing information
4923000	4925000	It's still linked over
4925000	4927000	If you're paying for like pay station network
4927000	4929000	I, you're right
4929000	4931000	I think Sony probably has that for me, but you do
4931000	4933000	since their little hack and that whole thing
4933000	4935000	I believe you do not have to store
4935000	4937000	a credit card on Playstation servers But
4937000	4939000	if you've ever had one stored
4939000	4941000	your name is still there on the account True
4941000	4943000	Historically
4943000	4945000	the information is there
4945000	4947000	You know, I'm what, either Dark Sakura
4947000	4949000	or Kurotsubasa, like every fucking where
4949000	4951000	people usually know that
4951000	4953000	if they see the name, there's a big chance it's me
4953000	4955000	So, just saying
4955000	4957000	Let's see, and yeah, if you see Rob Roberts
4957000	4959000	you know it's me or the gun guy
4959000	4961000	Apparently if you Google
4961000	4963000	Rob Roberts you get a guy that sells guns
4963000	4965000	How about that? Alright, let's see
4965000	4967000	Dungeon Buster I get a porn star for
4967000	4969000	Jamie Summers Do you really?
4969000	4971000	And then some lady in Columbus
4971000	4973000	But you were supposed to be the Bionic Woman
4973000	4975000	Where's the Bionic Woman? Because I spell my name differently
4975000	4977000	Oh, that's right, that's right, okay
4977000	4979000	Dungeon Buster or Quest Buster in our chat
4979000	4981000	at Twitch TV says
4981000	4983000	Xanac, a throwback here, Xanac
4983000	4985000	adapted its difficulty depending on how the player
4985000	4987000	did during the NES days
4987000	4989000	The game would sometimes change in small ways
4989000	4991000	change up patterns, etc.
4991000	4993000	That's true, but that's
4993000	4995000	not really learning
4995000	4997000	Because it wouldn't retain
4997000	4999000	that information and it wouldn't
4999000	5001000	alter it, it wouldn't remember
5001000	5003000	that that was your difficulty level
5003000	5005000	Okay, that's maybe the little click for me that I needed
5005000	5007000	to understand how this is like
5007000	5009000	new and fancy It's just programming
5009000	5011000	In this case, this would be machine learning
5011000	5013000	It would learn your habits and
5013000	5015000	adapt whatever game has the capacity
5015000	5017000	to use that to your habits as a gamer
5017000	5019000	Okay, so like
5019000	5021000	They say, this bitch is a rage quitter, we're only
5021000	5023000	gonna let her play up to level 4
5023000	5025000	Interesting, so how you perform
5025000	5027000	in Uncharted
5027000	5029000	may dictate the difficulty level where
5029000	5031000	Last of Us starts is what this could be
5031000	5033000	Possibly, that's how I translated it too
5033000	5035000	Okay, okay, I get it
5035000	5037000	Going further, if it looks at your habits on the
5037000	5039000	network, are you
5039000	5041000	a rage quitter? Are you
5041000	5043000	someone who gets a lot of abuse
5043000	5045000	from complaints? You could start
5045000	5047000	into whatever game
5047000	5049000	you might be streaming with all of these
5049000	5051000	marks against you, it could really go
5051000	5053000	a lot further than that
5053000	5055000	Interesting, and of course there's sad little man babies
5055000	5057000	out there who'll try to be pissy to female gamers
5057000	5059000	and you know
5059000	5061000	like what happened with movie ratings
5061000	5063000	and everything, who will
5063000	5065000	There's people who've done it to me and the things
5065000	5067000	were completely unfounded, they were just
5067000	5069000	crying little man babies, so
5069000	5071000	I drink male tears, I moisturize with them
5071000	5073000	Keep crying
5073000	5075000	babies
5075000	5077000	Let's try to see if there's other comments in chat
5077000	5079000	Shehulk in our chat says
5079000	5081000	since the big Playstation 3 data lost
5081000	5083000	10 years ago, I still get notices
5083000	5085000	from possible theft from Sony
5085000	5087000	and you know that whole data theft, it is
5087000	5089000	going to have to be something that's in the back of Sony's
5089000	5091000	minds about, you know, again assuming this
5091000	5093000	is true, but you know
5093000	5095000	a lot of magazines
5095000	5097000	and things seem to be running with it, is that
5097000	5099000	Sony will have to be mindful
5099000	5101000	about how it uses that data
5101000	5103000	because it knows it's already been in trouble
5103000	5105000	for a breach of data once before
5105000	5107000	so, I mean
5107000	5109000	but I guess maybe the question would be
5109000	5111000	is how good you are or aren't at a video game
5111000	5113000	sensitive data
5113000	5115000	but I guess it really depends on
5115000	5117000	what is it that the Playstation is actually
5117000	5119000	collecting
5119000	5121000	Anyway, SSJ100 Matt suggests
5121000	5123000	self-destruct the consoles
5123000	5125000	of chronic toxic players
5125000	5127000	Hey, I always like the idea
5127000	5129000	of them getting their own little island
5129000	5131000	Have fun at Toxic Fantasy Island
5131000	5133000	That's exactly what it is
5133000	5135000	Toxic Fantasy Island
5135000	5137000	And then we nuke it from orbit
5137000	5139000	Complete with tattoo
5139000	5141000	We just nuke it from orbit
5141000	5143000	Right. Now then we airdrop a bunch of therapists
5143000	5145000	That could be the intro
5145000	5147000	to one of our future shows
5147000	5149000	Toxic Fantasy Island will not be seen tonight
5149000	5151000	Just airdrop a bunch of therapists
5151000	5153000	that's all
5153000	5155000	Let's move on. Something else to talk about
5155000	5157000	Loki
5157000	5159000	I don't know. The whole Toxic Fantasy Island sounds awesome
5159000	5161000	So this is also
5161000	5163000	something that's pretty awesome
5163000	5165000	and surprising that's coming to Steam
5165000	5167000	Halo the Master Chief Collection
5167000	5169000	is coming to PC
5169000	5171000	and it's also coming to
5171000	5173000	not only the Windows Store
5173000	5175000	or Microsoft Store or whatever we're calling it
5175000	5177000	nowadays, but the Steam
5177000	5179000	Store as well
5179000	5181000	and on top of all of that
5181000	5183000	they're going to be including Halo Reach now
5183000	5185000	So it is
5185000	5187000	going to be
5187000	5189000	it will run at 60 FPS
5189000	5191000	it will support up to 4K
5191000	5193000	and they're going to be adding
5193000	5195000	on Xbox One the Halo Reach multiplayer
5195000	5197000	will be available as a free add-on for anyone
5197000	5199000	that owns the collection
5199000	5201000	and they said the single player campaign will cost extra
5201000	5203000	They don't have a date on the Halo Reach stuff
5203000	5205000	but they're going to be putting out
5205000	5207000	I guess stuff piecemeal
5207000	5209000	so it's going to be
5209000	5211000	Halo Combat Evolved
5211000	5213000	Anniversary, Halo 2, Halo 3
5213000	5215000	Halo 4
5215000	5217000	and then I guess
5217000	5219000	I don't know. Halo 5 will be added later
5221000	5223000	So I think when I bought
5223000	5225000	my Xbox One
5225000	5227000	I got a digital copy of this
5227000	5229000	because I don't think I have the disc
5229000	5231000	I think it's a digital copy
5231000	5233000	so does that mean I'll get it on PC for free because it's digital?
5233000	5235000	Maybe. You can play anywhere
5235000	5237000	I don't know if it's a play anywhere game
5237000	5239000	I thought everything was supposed to be play anywhere now
5239000	5241000	Probably most of their games are play anywhere
5241000	5243000	I hope
5243000	5245000	Kaishido in chat says
5245000	5247000	all they need is Halo Reach 3-2
5247000	5249000	those games were so much fun
5249000	5251000	so yeah a lot of fans are Reach out there
5251000	5253000	so I'm sure very happy to hear that
5253000	5255000	I haven't answered for all that
5255000	5257000	I have an answer for that
5257000	5259000	No
5259000	5261000	You were never a Halo fan anyway
5261000	5263000	The only thing I liked about Halo
5263000	5265000	was Red vs Blue
5265000	5267000	and the shiny stabby weapon
5267000	5269000	I like the shiny stabby weapon
5269000	5271000	Oh yeah I do like the shiny stabby weapon
5271000	5273000	Halo 2 is like a throwback to college for me
5273000	5275000	I used to like to play that online with some of my college buddies
5275000	5277000	and we would use the shiny stabby thing quite a bit
5277000	5279000	My fond memory was
5279000	5281000	Dan's bachelor party
5281000	5283000	because you were at my bachelorette party
5283000	5285000	I was
5285000	5287000	We had to go to the house to get my stuff
5287000	5289000	and they had something like
5289000	5291000	5 TVs hooked up
5291000	5293000	doing Halo LAN
5293000	5295000	Okay
5295000	5297000	Before we get to our next story
5297000	5299000	this question keeps coming up in chat
5299000	5301000	and so I have to address it
5301000	5303000	and they're noticing on the camera there
5303000	5305000	S2100 Matt says
5305000	5307000	Yes I am
5307000	5309000	OLR bringing rivals together
5309000	5311000	Okay
5311000	5313000	Where every foodie has a voice
5313000	5315000	I haven't started my Dunkin yet
5315000	5317000	because I have a little banana for a stomach
5317000	5319000	Thank you surgery
5319000	5321000	I had to finish my corned beef
5321000	5323000	I told myself I was gonna eat so much
5323000	5325000	dead bovine until I got sick
5325000	5327000	Guess who's sick right now
5327000	5329000	That would be me but I'm not like
5329000	5331000	super sick I stopped right before like
5331000	5333000	throwing up sick
5333000	5335000	So I am stuck
5335000	5337000	So the donuts are being saved right?
5337000	5339000	The donuts are being saved they are gonna be breakfast
5339000	5341000	And that was a low key contribution
5341000	5343000	Thank you which I greatly appreciate
5343000	5345000	The Boston cream is gonna be my
5345000	5347000	I'm about to go to bed snack but I need a sugar rush
5347000	5349000	which isn't a good idea before you go to bed
5349000	5351000	And then my double chocolate
5351000	5353000	is gonna be breakfast tomorrow
5353000	5355000	Where I will again
5355000	5357000	get the shakes from reactive hypoglycemia
5357000	5359000	Low key was kind of
5359000	5361000	offer for me too but
5361000	5363000	since I am trying to be better about fitness
5363000	5365000	I decided to pass on the donuts and while I
5365000	5367000	still do drink the coffee
5367000	5369000	I had just had a Starbucks so I
5369000	5371000	didn't want to have lots of coffee
5371000	5373000	By the way though speaking of
5373000	5375000	fitness I am
5375000	5377000	thinking about going back to Nerd Fit
5377000	5379000	Where they use their leveling up system
5381000	5383000	I'm trying to remember what that was
5383000	5385000	That name sounds familiar
5385000	5387000	It was people to eat keto and all this
5387000	5389000	but
5389000	5391000	their exercise program
5391000	5393000	used like levels and then they would do like
5393000	5395000	this like special
5395000	5397000	challenge thing for like certain
5397000	5399000	exercises and you turn it in and you get a badge
5399000	5401000	and some shit but I'm thinking about
5401000	5403000	going back to like a leveling system
5403000	5405000	for working out because I am officially
5405000	5407000	not
5407000	5409000	the first week in April I've got
5409000	5411000	the okay to go back to powerlifting
5411000	5413000	and
5413000	5415000	I'm gonna fill my arm
5415000	5417000	wings, my extra skin that I have
5417000	5419000	left over with meat
5419000	5421000	not just you know dead bovine
5421000	5423000	I've been using the watch tracking
5423000	5425000	for fitness quite a bit that's been doing
5425000	5427000	really good for me which reminds me I was gonna
5427000	5429000	send a private information request to you
5429000	5431000	Jamie but I guess you don't have yours, oh no
5431000	5433000	yours is right there, there it is
5433000	5435000	I'm not competitive
5435000	5437000	Some people have been sharing theirs with me
5437000	5439000	I've been interested in what some
5439000	5441000	other people are doing but I'd rather just talk to people
5441000	5443000	and find out what they're doing
5443000	5445000	cause I like to think I'm fairly adaptive
5445000	5447000	with my fitness regimen
5447000	5449000	I just found out that it will beat people
5449000	5451000	when you close your rings I didn't realize that
5451000	5453000	that was a thing but like so I was at
5453000	5455000	the gym yesterday and as soon as I get
5455000	5457000	off the machine I have multiple text messages
5457000	5459000	from people I'm sharing data with that are saying
5459000	5461000	like congrats or whatever and I'm just
5461000	5463000	like wait did my watch like
5463000	5465000	tell you that I'm so I thought that was
5465000	5467000	it was weird but I was like well that's
5467000	5469000	kinda nice I guess those little
5469000	5471000	those little bits of motivation can always be cute
5471000	5473000	so I just
5473000	5475000	really only
5475000	5477000	track myself
5477000	5479000	cause the only person I can be accountable to is myself
5479000	5481000	yeah being competitive
5481000	5483000	doesn't really do anything for me
5483000	5485000	I'm not competitive with it it's more like
5485000	5487000	I want to
5487000	5489000	these are good goals
5489000	5491000	like the standing thing I was doing earlier
5491000	5493000	they're good goals to have
5493000	5495000	I do it for myself I don't need to share that data
5495000	5497000	with other people to feel good about what
5497000	5499000	I'm doing or maintain my goals
5499000	5501000	I'm not
5501000	5503000	there's some people out there who are truly
5503000	5505000	I would say
5505000	5507000	motivated by competition
5507000	5509000	that's not me that's why most of the time
5509000	5511000	if I'm playing a game I prefer a single person narrative
5511000	5513000	I prefer and so what I'm
5513000	5515000	gonna be doing is as I level
5515000	5517000	up I'm going to be
5517000	5519000	using like a game or something
5519000	5521000	and do say this is my level up game
5521000	5523000	but I will be sharing my level ups
5523000	5525000	with everybody in the form of content
5525000	5527000	alright well speaking of leveling
5527000	5529000	up moving on to
5529000	5531000	a next story before we get to our classic
5531000	5533000	segment the
5533000	5535000	Xbox Live by Microsoft
5535000	5537000	is coming out for iOS and
5537000	5539000	Android so maybe this is another way if you want to be
5539000	5541000	competitive with achievements this is
5541000	5543000	something you could do or you maybe don't want
5543000	5545000	to be competitive you want to just be able to send
5545000	5547000	messages to friends on the on their
5547000	5549000	I'm telling you though this like combined with the
5549000	5551000	Google thing they were talking about before streaming
5551000	5553000	like if I could like purchase Game Pass
5553000	5555000	you
5555000	5557000	know on an Android device
5557000	5559000	and be able to like play those like
5559000	5561000	Xbox games on my TV or
5561000	5563000	on my PC
5563000	5565000	that would be useful
5565000	5567000	to me because I don't want to buy another console
5567000	5569000	well what this is
5569000	5571000	this news is about is that Microsoft is going to allow
5571000	5573000	developers of mobile games to use Xbox
5573000	5575000	Live features it's a new mobile
5575000	5577000	SDK that is part of Microsoft's
5577000	5579000	initiative to allow game developers
5579000	5581000	you know of all sizes indie
5581000	5583000	small large to
5583000	5585000	use Xbox Live on whatever platform you want
5585000	5587000	to create on which we already
5587000	5589000	kind of knew Xbox Live is
5589000	5591000	making strides in going into Switch games
5591000	5593000	which was a big deal when we first talked about that
5593000	5595000	the only place you're probably not going to see Xbox Live
5595000	5597000	is on Sony which you know
5597000	5599000	you understand why that is the way
5599000	5601000	it is but anyway you can choose
5601000	5603000	from features like
5603000	5605000	achievements, clubs, gamerscore
5605000	5607000	friends list, family
5607000	5609000	settings that's interesting too
5609000	5611000	talking about adapting to
5611000	5613000	automatic settings
5613000	5615000	that's very interesting that let's say
5615000	5617000	you know this is a kid account right off the gate
5617000	5619000	so maybe it shouldn't show
5619000	5621000	dramatic blood effects or whatever
5621000	5623000	I don't know it goes with a particular game
5623000	5625000	or because it's Loki you should show
5625000	5627000	extra dramatic blood effects
5627000	5629000	on the game. It's not dramatic if it's not
5629000	5631000	extra so
5631000	5633000	anyway very cool
5633000	5635000	this is coming and I'm sure we're going to hear more
5635000	5637000	about this at Game Developers Conference
5637000	5639000	but it was confirmed that this is
5639000	5641000	happening by the way in kind of a related
5641000	5643000	story of sorts it should be
5643000	5645000	mentioned about this too there is a brand new
5645000	5647000	app that came out for Windows
5647000	5649000	called Wireless Display and it
5649000	5651000	will let you play PC games
5651000	5653000	on your Xbox
5653000	5655000	with varied
5655000	5657000	success it seems like it's something that's still early
5657000	5659000	on now as it is today
5659000	5661000	you can play Xbox stuff on
5661000	5663000	your PC there's a little Xbox
5663000	5665000	app for Windows 10 I've actually done that and it
5665000	5667000	works well enough as long as there's not a lot
5667000	5669000	of other network traffic going on like I don't do it
5669000	5671000	if Alan's trying to play Overwatch because
5671000	5673000	technically I guess you could still do that if
5673000	5675000	you had your output
5675000	5677000	HDMI output from your PC into your
5677000	5679000	Xbox remember they have a pass through sure
5679000	5681000	you could but this
5681000	5683000	is a way to do it through the network
5683000	5685000	through your house basically
5685000	5687000	but they're saying not every game
5687000	5689000	really works very well with this some folks have done
5689000	5691000	some testing and said some games work
5691000	5693000	some games don't
5693000	5695000	but I imagine it's going to be interesting
5695000	5697000	the more and more this technology gets refined
5697000	5699000	although at the same time I don't usually
5699000	5701000	want to play something like World of Warcraft on my television
5701000	5703000	I want to play it on my PC but I guess
5703000	5705000	again for people that are playing things like I don't know
5705000	5707000	the new Devil's May Cry game let's say you're buying that
5707000	5709000	on PC then being able to
5709000	5711000	have that on your TV
5711000	5713000	is interesting but again
5713000	5715000	it's apparently working with some mixed success
5715000	5717000	right now seems like it's technology
5717000	5719000	that will probably get refined in the coming weeks
5719000	5721000	as more and more people complain about things
5721000	5723000	and so forth so
5723000	5725000	anyhow
5725000	5727000	some comments
5727000	5729000	on Microsoft She-Hulk over
5729000	5731000	at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says
5731000	5733000	Xbox Live community is robust
5733000	5735000	much more social
5735000	5737000	than Sony or Nintendo
5737000	5739000	well that's you know I think we've joked here on
5739000	5741000	OLR that maybe Microsoft
5741000	5743000	should just build Nintendo's online forum
5743000	5745000	well Nintendo used to have a pretty robust
5745000	5747000	online forum and then they got rid of it
5747000	5749000	they did well it wasn't
5749000	5751000	you know the whole
5751000	5753000	what do they call it
5753000	5755000	the thing that they discontinued where you could do all the
5755000	5757000	cool pictures and everything oh SwapNote?
5757000	5759000	no not SwapNote they have
5759000	5761000	Miiverse oh Miiverse
5761000	5763000	okay
5763000	5765000	I get what you're saying Miiverse was an interesting idea
5765000	5767000	but it really ran clunky it was kind of
5767000	5769000	it wasn't it was I'll say
5769000	5771000	Miiverse was best when it was integrated
5771000	5773000	directly into the games like Mario Maker
5773000	5775000	that was a good use I will give you that that was
5775000	5777000	a really good use of Miiverse
5777000	5779000	Splatoon kind of had that as well in fact
5779000	5781000	what they did is they just kind of like
5781000	5783000	took that part and put it in
5783000	5785000	the new Splatoon that's on Switch so
5785000	5787000	you know it's interesting
5787000	5789000	I guess you could say the legacy of
5789000	5791000	Miiverse lives on in that regard
5791000	5793000	I don't know but anyway
5793000	5795000	other games continue to
5795000	5797000	live on here at Orange Lounge Radio
5797000	5799000	as we move into a segment we like
5799000	5801000	to call the classic game of the week or
5801000	5803000	as the case may be in 2019
5803000	5805000	once a month Dark
5805000	5807000	Sakura dips into the gaming vault and says
5807000	5809000	hey here's a soundtrack
5809000	5811000	that you should be paying attention to the game
5811000	5813000	may or may not be great but
5813000	5815000	the soundtrack is definitely something
5815000	5817000	worth noticing so what is our special
5817000	5819000	classic soundtrack of the month
5819000	5821000	this is going to
5821000	5823000	be a game I will eventually review
5823000	5825000	but it's Abadox
5825000	5827000	The Deadly Inner War
5827000	5829000	and this
5829000	5831000	particular game
5831000	5833000	okay there we go
5833000	5835000	this particular game
5835000	5837000	came out
5837000	5839000	this music doesn't go for this level
5839000	5841000	I know what I did is I took the base music
5841000	5843000	and I just put it over gameplays they have something to look at
5843000	5845000	alrighty well anyway
5845000	5847000	but it's actually the first level has my favorite music
5847000	5849000	otherwise it's all ground beef
5849000	5851000	yeah it'll cycle through the
5851000	5853000	different songs in the game
5853000	5855000	but yeah the first level is actually my favorite music
5855000	5857000	in the entire game too because the game's hard
5857000	5859000	and I died a lot so
5859000	5861000	but anyway
5861000	5863000	it's I mean it's pretty
5863000	5865000	it's not like one of the best games ever
5865000	5867000	it was by Natsume
5867000	5869000	with the main
5869000	5871000	programmer having worked on Contra
5871000	5873000	actually the music
5873000	5875000	programmer having worked on Contra
5875000	5877000	but it was
5877000	5879000	Sada Kyohei who
5879000	5881000	he did a lot of work for Konami
5881000	5883000	it really
5883000	5885000	was very influenced
5885000	5887000	by Contra
5887000	5889000	and some of the other shooting games
5889000	5891000	and this is the song you were mentioning
5891000	5893000	earlier I believe
5893000	5895000	this was like my favorite piece of music in this whole game
5895000	5897000	and it sounds like a fucking Contra song
5897000	5899000	it does
5899000	5901000	it's like I was showing this to Dan
5901000	5903000	and he's like oh yeah that's definitely a Natsume
5903000	5905000	game I was like yeah but listen to the music
5905000	5907000	he's like that sounds like Contra-ish
5907000	5909000	I'm like yarp
5909000	5911000	you know that heavy
5911000	5913000	rhythm in it that you had from
5913000	5915000	a lot of the Konami games
5915000	5917000	but at any rate I mean
5917000	5919000	my second favorite piece of music in this game
5919000	5921000	is the ending music which I never got to
5921000	5923000	but people in my
5923000	5925000	my papa was really
5925000	5927000	good at this game and he beat the game
5927000	5929000	it was this
5929000	5931000	and you know
5931000	5933000	Jackal that he and I used to play a lot together
5933000	5935000	before he died and so
5935000	5937000	this
5937000	5939000	I just had to pick this music I don't really have too much else
5939000	5941000	about the programming of the music but I thought the soundtrack
5941000	5943000	was worth a mention because for such a
5943000	5945000	you know
5945000	5947000	middle of the road game
5947000	5949000	the music in it was really good
5949000	5951000	yeah and this has been kind of the
5951000	5953000	neat thing about this little feature that you're doing
5953000	5955000	even though the first month you did Guardian Legend
5955000	5957000	which of course is a must right
5957000	5959000	you really kind of have been picking games that are like
5959000	5961000	okay maybe the games were eh
5961000	5963000	but the soundtracks are A
5963000	5965000	plus and I think that's always kind of neat
5965000	5967000	you want to play a game because
5967000	5969000	you just want to hear the damn music
5969000	5971000	it's so good
5971000	5973000	also I was just giving it a look
5973000	5975000	for Famicom information
5975000	5977000	the box art in Japan was so
5977000	5979000	much better than the crap we got here
5979000	5981000	She-Hulk and Child wants to know
5981000	5983000	is the soundtrack on vinyl?
5983000	5985000	I don't think so
5985000	5987000	this game really wasn't a super popular one
5987000	5989000	it was unique in the US
5989000	5991000	because it was a Milton Bradley published game
5991000	5993000	which kind of goes with
5993000	5995000	which you associate more with board games
5995000	5997000	exactly but Milton Bradley
5997000	5999000	did a decent number of releases for
5999000	6001000	games they did but none of them were
6001000	6003000	like A plus
6003000	6005000	like games you remember
6005000	6007000	but I mean wasn't Milton Bradley
6007000	6009000	the Game Genie
6009000	6011000	or not Game Genie that was Galoob
6011000	6013000	the
6013000	6015000	dammit the
6015000	6017000	Power Glove
6017000	6019000	didn't they do I do not recall
6019000	6021000	I
6021000	6023000	don't remember who did Power Glove
6023000	6025000	I don't know I'm looking it up right now
6025000	6027000	so they
6027000	6029000	did the power they were
6029000	6031000	partly responsible for the power pad
6031000	6033000	the power pad? yeah
6033000	6035000	so
6035000	6037000	Milton life force
6037000	6039000	the games that were
6039000	6041000	done by Milton Bradley
6041000	6043000	that were published or distributed
6043000	6045000	Cabal California Games
6045000	6047000	Captain Skyhawk
6047000	6049000	Gordon vs. Bird Marble Madness
6049000	6051000	Time Lord
6051000	6053000	which is sadly a Doctor Who game
6053000	6055000	World Games
6055000	6057000	yeah not very many games
6057000	6059000	but they were and by the way
6059000	6061000	Rob World Games is by Epix
6061000	6063000	I do yeah that I do know
6063000	6065000	trust founder of the Epix
6065000	6067000	game store shut the fuck up
6067000	6069000	god
6069000	6071000	that happened on Bobby's show anyway
6071000	6073000	we're bringing it around
6073000	6075000	and keep in mind Milton Bradley actually
6075000	6077000	had a console in 1979
6077000	6079000	they had the micro vision oh really
6079000	6081000	yep hold on let's see something
6081000	6083000	real quick while we're here this is
6083000	6085000	turned into the Milton Bradley segment of the month
6085000	6087000	well I mean it doesn't
6087000	6089000	hurt to educate people sure
6089000	6091000	so ugh stupid accepting cookies
6091000	6093000	I'd rather have a real cookie
6093000	6095000	thank you um so yeah
6095000	6097000	not much is coming up but yeah you know
6097000	6099000	they they did
6099000	6101000	different stuff I mean like I said
6101000	6103000	they had been in the video game business off and on
6103000	6105000	and had you know purples and things
6105000	6107000	like that but yeah so
6107000	6109000	there you go
6109000	6111000	alright your classic soundtrack
6111000	6113000	of the month how do you say Abadox
6113000	6115000	Abadox oh wait you might
6115000	6117000	remember the commercial it's the kid playing on his
6117000	6119000	bed and then like purple slime shoots
6119000	6121000	out of his TV at him and it was supposed
6121000	6123000	it was advertised
6123000	6125000	as like the most disgusting game
6125000	6127000	oh yeah cause
6127000	6129000	that was all the shit that was on TV it was like
6129000	6131000	the Double Dare
6131000	6133000	Fun House was even grosser and like all the
6133000	6135000	like gross splat and all that
6135000	6137000	stuff this game ain't
6137000	6139000	ain't disgusting I played R-Type
6139000	6141000	alright
6141000	6143000	uh we're gonna move on to a
6143000	6145000	viewer submission I'm very hyped about
6145000	6147000	this cause we haven't had one of these in a while since
6147000	6149000	um Matt did one of these for MAGFest but I did
6149000	6151000	put the call out and I said hey listeners
6151000	6153000	if you're interested in like you know highlighting a game
6153000	6155000	or telling us a little bit about you know a game that you're playing
6155000	6157000	or what have you I'm looking for some listener
6157000	6159000	segments and leave it to good old Flaco
6159000	6161000	Jones who sent us this submission
6161000	6163000	tonight where um he's gonna talk to us a little
6163000	6165000	bit about the game Paladins and
6165000	6167000	uh pay attention cause he gets into the reason why
6167000	6169000	and I think it's uh it's really cool so we're gonna go
6169000	6171000	to uh this segment here courtesy of
6171000	6173000	our pal Flaco Jones
6173000	6175000	Hey everybody this is
6175000	6177000	Flaco Jones uh I wanted to make
6177000	6179000	this video because well first of all Rob asked for it
6179000	6181000	and I thought it'd be cool to focus on a
6181000	6183000	free game cause he said you know focus on free games
6183000	6185000	would be good and this came
6185000	6187000	up recently because on OLR they were talking
6187000	6189000	about Overwatch and how it doesn't
6189000	6191000	support cross play and how could they ever support
6191000	6193000	cross play I'm like well there's a game that does
6193000	6195000	support cross play that's a lot like Overwatch
6195000	6197000	and so this game popped in my head I'm like oh I should
6197000	6199000	make a video for OLR so they can actually see
6199000	6201000	the game in action so
6201000	6203000	uh this is Paladins I'm actually gonna make
6203000	6205000	my camera go away so
6205000	6207000	that I can focus on showing the game play
6207000	6209000	and I'm gonna edit stuff in so it's not just staring
6209000	6211000	at menus the whole time cause I'm pretty much gonna be
6211000	6213000	talking over the menus
6213000	6215000	so uh this is it it's free game
6215000	6217000	and because it's free
6217000	6219000	you can go to the store and you can
6219000	6221000	see all the stuff they try to sell you
6221000	6223000	and there's DLC where you can
6223000	6225000	actually get all the champions
6225000	6227000	current and future for just $30 which I think
6227000	6229000	is a pretty good deal but I personally have never
6229000	6231000	spent a dime on this game I
6231000	6233000	do my daily quests I grind out gold
6233000	6235000	I use gold to unlock champions which are you know
6235000	6237000	like heroes and Overwatch
6237000	6239000	champions in this game I'm gonna be comparing
6239000	6241000	it to Overwatch a lot because the games
6241000	6243000	are very similar it's been accused of being
6243000	6245000	Overwatch clone not gonna
6245000	6247000	fight that accusation but I'm gonna say
6247000	6249000	it still stands on it's own
6249000	6251000	alright so and I wanted to briefly
6251000	6253000	show you since we were talking about
6253000	6255000	cross play you go to controls
6255000	6257000	you go all the way to the bottom and this is where the cross
6257000	6259000	play is uh the settings
6259000	6261000	are right here so you can say I only
6261000	6263000	wanna go against people using a gamepad
6263000	6265000	or I only wanna go against everybody and have
6265000	6267000	shorter queues I do
6267000	6269000	gamepad I think it's more fair and the reason
6269000	6271000	they do that they don't even say console is because
6271000	6273000	based on whether you have a gamepad
6273000	6275000	plugged in or not that's how it queues you
6275000	6277000	and if you try to queue in this gamepad and then pull it
6277000	6279000	out and try to trick everybody
6279000	6281000	and use your keyboard and mouse that won't work
6281000	6283000	it'll kick you out of the
6283000	6285000	games they said so in their patch notes so
6285000	6287000	yeah I play gamepad only
6287000	6289000	I think it's really cool they allow that
6289000	6291000	because it doesn't matter what platform you're playing on
6291000	6293000	PC you're playing on Switch
6293000	6295000	you're playing Xbox One you're playing
6295000	6297000	you know Xbox One supports
6297000	6299000	keyboard and mouse as well so if you're playing keyboard and mouse
6299000	6301000	as Xbox One you still would be with
6301000	6303000	the allow all people not with the gamepad
6303000	6305000	people and it would show on your input method right there
6305000	6307000	um I didn't mention
6307000	6309000	Sony I wonder why that is oh because they're not
6309000	6311000	supporting it right now so they're not supporting
6311000	6313000	cross play right now
6313000	6315000	I think it's gonna happen but
6315000	6317000	you know there's been some controversy over
6317000	6319000	who's fault it is but the developers of this game
6319000	6321000	said they're ready to go the balls
6321000	6323000	in Sony's court so hopefully Sony approves that
6323000	6325000	pretty soon cause I would really like to play this
6325000	6327000	on Playstation uh
6327000	6329000	let's see uh what do we got here
6329000	6331000	oh yeah so if you wanna learn how to play
6331000	6333000	there's uh these training
6333000	6335000	modes over here they have
6335000	6337000	trainings for all the different modes which I'll get into those in a second
6337000	6339000	and they have a shooting range and the shooting range
6339000	6341000	you can practice as any champion and that's
6341000	6343000	kinda cool even champions you haven't unlocked yet
6343000	6345000	so I like that
6345000	6347000	there's no tutorial here and I think
6347000	6349000	that's weird and so I looked it up and sure enough
6349000	6351000	there is a tutorial on the other consoles
6351000	6353000	just on Switch they didn't put it on there because the
6353000	6355000	file size would have been too big so they
6355000	6357000	cut that out
6357000	6359000	that's too bad but you know so if you really
6359000	6361000	wanna learn how to play it is a free to play the game you could
6361000	6363000	download it on a different
6363000	6365000	console and play it on there and if you prefer to play on Switch
6365000	6367000	you can play on there but again it's cross
6367000	6369000	platform and cross progression
6369000	6371000	so anything you do saves across all the platforms
6371000	6373000	except for Playstation
6373000	6375000	so let's see I said I'd get into the modes
6375000	6377000	so here's the different modes let's go to Quick Play
6377000	6379000	and look at our settings so there's Siege
6379000	6381000	there's Onslaught and there's Team Deathmatch
6381000	6383000	Siege kinda plays like the
6383000	6385000	Overwatch hybrid maps those are the maps
6385000	6387000	where you capture the objective and then once you capture the
6387000	6389000	objective you escort the payload
6389000	6391000	Onslaught
6391000	6393000	all that one is is take the objective hold it until
6393000	6395000	whatever team gets 400 points
6395000	6397000	first the longer you stay there you
6397000	6399000	earn points and getting kills also
6399000	6401000	earns you points and then Team Deathmatch
6401000	6403000	speaks for itself 5v5
6403000	6405000	you know just try to kill
6405000	6407000	as many as you can so there's like
6407000	6409000	there's one more big difference between this and
6409000	6411000	Overwatch which is
6411000	6413000	when you start this game first
6413000	6415000	you'll have you pick a talent
6415000	6417000	every champion gets
6417000	6419000	three talents to choose from you select
6419000	6421000	one and it's kind of like your focus for that
6421000	6423000	game after that you
6423000	6425000	get to pick your loadouts now loadouts
6425000	6427000	are here in the game if you go
6427000	6429000	into a champion you can go
6429000	6431000	into their loadouts and you can make
6431000	6433000	new ones or you can use there's always a
6433000	6435000	preset one there so if you're uncomfortable
6435000	6437000	with this just use the pre-made but once
6437000	6439000	you get good at this game you can kinda build your own
6439000	6441000	so I think that's pretty awesome
6441000	6443000	and then after you pick that when the game
6443000	6445000	starts they have this thing called the item shop
6445000	6447000	which I've heard is a lot like League of Legends
6447000	6449000	I don't play leagues I don't know but as you
6449000	6451000	play this game you earn credits for
6451000	6453000	doing well at your character's job
6453000	6455000	if you're healing a lot you'll get credits that way
6455000	6457000	if you stay in the objective a lot you'll get credits that way
6457000	6459000	if you're a damaged player and you're
6459000	6461000	getting a lot of kills you get more credits that way you spend
6461000	6463000	your credits on this thing called
6463000	6465000	the item shop and the item shop
6465000	6467000	is kind of I think this game's answer to
6467000	6469000	hero switching that Overwatch has
6469000	6471000	you can't switch heroes in this game
6471000	6473000	so with the item shop you can kinda see what the
6473000	6475000	other team is running or even
6475000	6477000	compliment what your team is running and get items
6477000	6479000	from the item shop to boast
6479000	6481000	up those certain things so you can have
6481000	6483000	better healing you can
6483000	6485000	take less damage from direct damage if the
6485000	6487000	team has a lot of AoE damage you can
6487000	6489000	lessen the AoE damage just a little bit you can lower
6489000	6491000	your cooldowns you can increase your
6491000	6493000	ultimate you know
6493000	6495000	generation so there's all sorts of things
6495000	6497000	you can buy
6497000	6499000	in the item shop and there's not anything you can
6499000	6501000	pay to win they just you just earn it
6501000	6503000	like everybody else does by playing the game
6503000	6505000	and it's only for that match you don't get
6505000	6507000	they don't carry over so there's no
6507000	6509000	pay to win or anything in this game which is kinda nice
6509000	6511000	so let's look at the champions
6511000	6513000	this is the bread and butter
6513000	6515000	of the game I have a lot of champions as you
6515000	6517000	can see here I have all but it looks like
6517000	6519000	nine right now but there's actually rotating champions
6519000	6521000	which I don't have all of them actually I think
6521000	6523000	I only have one I have two of them
6523000	6525000	so that means I'm missing
6525000	6527000	eleven characters out of the forty
6527000	6529000	forty man roster is really good
6529000	6531000	so again they
6531000	6533000	have these four that rotate every week it's not always
6533000	6535000	gonna be these four I'm gonna focus for this
6535000	6537000	video on the ones you get when you
6537000	6539000	start the game for free you've never played it before
6539000	6541000	and that is the reason
6541000	6543000	it's four is cause there's one support
6543000	6545000	that's their healers
6545000	6547000	one frontline that's their tanks one damage
6547000	6549000	speaks for itself
6549000	6551000	and one flanker which is the damage that
6551000	6553000	attacks from the side or behind
6553000	6555000	let's look at Genos
6555000	6557000	so Genos
6557000	6559000	is the free healer
6559000	6561000	that you get if you've never played paladins before
6561000	6563000	and here's how the abilities
6563000	6565000	break down I'll show
6565000	6567000	some video while I'm talking about it so you're
6567000	6569000	not just staring at this screen the whole time
6569000	6571000	so star splitter is his main attack
6571000	6573000	everybody's main attack is his right trigger
6573000	6575000	it's just like a machine gun
6575000	6577000	you know everybody in this game pretty much
6577000	6579000	shoots even the healers and they do pretty well at
6579000	6581000	it you don't have to do a lot of weapon switching
6581000	6583000	uh which is pretty cool
6583000	6585000	so and then his left one is his heal
6585000	6587000	the left trigger is his heal and that
6587000	6589000	his heal kinda works like Zenyatta
6589000	6591000	so he puts a heal bloom on
6591000	6593000	somebody it stays on him as long as you keep him in line of sight
6593000	6595000	and it does a good job
6595000	6597000	uh Stellar Wind is the
6597000	6599000	right shoulder button the right shoulder button on almost
6599000	6601000	every character I'm pretty sure
6601000	6603000	every character actually is like a quick
6603000	6605000	getaway button it's like some kind of speed button
6605000	6607000	so in this case
6607000	6609000	it's his Stellar Wind he moves 65%
6609000	6611000	faster and you can even
6611000	6613000	get a loadout where you take less damage
6613000	6615000	in that mode which is nice too
6615000	6617000	so it's a really good way
6617000	6619000	to escape from people something I kinda wish Zenyatta
6619000	6621000	and Overwatch had was a way to escape cause he really
6621000	6623000	doesn't he's kind of a sitting duck
6623000	6625000	uh and then the left button there
6625000	6627000	the left shoulder button is his void grip
6627000	6629000	you can also use that to escape with him but it
6629000	6631000	holds enemies up in the air stuns them does a little
6631000	6633000	damage if your teammates around they can kill the person while
6633000	6635000	they're in the air it's really cool kind of support
6635000	6637000	ability and his ultimate
6637000	6639000	is through time and space it channels this
6639000	6641000	tunnel of like death
6641000	6643000	and it shoots anybody that's
6643000	6645000	standing in the tunnel there's like a kind of a cast time
6645000	6647000	so you have time to get away from it if you're paying attention
6647000	6649000	but if he's got you trapped and you're in the middle of a fight
6649000	6651000	if you're standing in that tunnel
6651000	6653000	you're dead okay
6653000	6655000	so let's go to the next free character that's gonna be
6655000	6657000	Lex Lex is the free flanker in the game
6657000	6659000	let's look at his abilities
6659000	6661000	he's got magnums
6661000	6663000	think like reaper's guns they just shoot one
6663000	6665000	at a time bang bang bang bang they're good medium
6665000	6667000	to close range
6667000	6669000	his left trigger is in
6669000	6671000	pursuit that just kind of
6671000	6673000	unloads his weapons even faster
6673000	6675000	in like a short area kind of like McCree's like
6675000	6677000	you know when he shoots off his guns really
6677000	6679000	fast
6679000	6681000	his R is a combat slide again
6681000	6683000	you can use that to escape or you can use it to close in on somebody
6683000	6685000	and finish him off
6685000	6687000	his left shoulder is retribution
6687000	6689000	you cast out on people they take more damage
6689000	6691000	you earn credits when you kill them when they have retribution on
6691000	6693000	you can spec for that to be better as well
6693000	6695000	and then finally his ultimate is the law
6695000	6697000	it's a lot like McCree's ability
6697000	6699000	where you kind of focus
6699000	6701000	on everybody in a little like area
6701000	6703000	when you shoot it off
6703000	6705000	everybody that's in the area
6705000	6707000	if they're 65% health or below
6707000	6709000	they get executed it's great
6709000	6711000	otherwise they take 600 damage still pretty good
6711000	6713000	so let's go to next is
6713000	6715000	Ruckus Ruckus plays a lot
6715000	6717000	like D.Va from Overwatch so you'll hear me say
6717000	6719000	D.Va a lot so Ruckus has these
6719000	6721000	mini guns they're kind of like D.Va's
6721000	6723000	hand cannons
6723000	6725000	they shoot really fast the longer you hold
6725000	6727000	the button the more damage they do it's kind of cool
6727000	6729000	Ruckus's left trigger is
6729000	6731000	a missile launcher so again kind of like
6731000	6733000	D.Va shoots some barrage of missiles
6733000	6735000	at people
6735000	6737000	advance is his quick getaway move
6737000	6739000	you press it and he has rocket boosters
6739000	6741000	again like D.Va that'll get
6741000	6743000	him in or out of combat to find
6743000	6745000	him in the situation a 5 second cooldown is pretty low too
6745000	6747000	you can advance to get in shoot a bunch
6747000	6749000	of people in advance to get back out and go back to your healers
6749000	6751000	it's kind of nice his left shoulder
6751000	6753000	is a shield called emitter
6753000	6755000	gives him like a bubble, absorbs damage
6755000	6757000	it's really nice again if you're in there being
6757000	6759000	a disruptor like you're supposed to do whether you play Ruckus
6759000	6761000	or D.Va they're similar
6761000	6763000	play styles and then his
6763000	6765000	ultimate is Hexafire
6765000	6767000	it's just like a one where he just
6767000	6769000	unloads all his weapons in like
6769000	6771000	pretty much a cone in front of him
6771000	6773000	and it does really good damage
6773000	6775000	if you can focus someone down
6775000	6777000	if you get a lot of people gathered in one area and you
6777000	6779000	unleash that thing and especially if you use your
6779000	6781000	emitter first so you're safe you can take
6781000	6783000	out like a lot of people at once
6783000	6785000	so
6785000	6787000	finally there's Viktor and Viktor
6787000	6789000	plays a lot like Soldier 76 from
6789000	6791000	Overwatch sorry about all the comparisons but it's just
6791000	6793000	easier to describe it this way since more people know
6793000	6795000	Overwatch I know I'm feeding
6795000	6797000	into the whole ripoff thing but you know
6797000	6799000	whatever I don't really care
6799000	6801000	so his assault rifle is like his
6801000	6803000	main gun but on this one if you hit the left trigger
6803000	6805000	you actually look down the sights so you get a little bit more
6805000	6807000	accuracy but he does move
6807000	6809000	slower because you're not just shooting
6809000	6811000	off the hip you're looking right down the sights
6811000	6813000	his R like Soldier's
6813000	6815000	you know right shoulder button is
6815000	6817000	like a hustle so he moves he can run really
6817000	6819000	fast but he can't shoot while he's doing it as soon as you start
6819000	6821000	shooting you come out of your sprint
6821000	6823000	sprint is what they call it for
6823000	6825000	for Soldier and then
6825000	6827000	frag grenade is his left shoulder button
6827000	6829000	he'll throw a grenade it does a lot of damage
6829000	6831000	you can hold the button
6831000	6833000	cook the grenade so that when you release it it
6833000	6835000	blows up more quickly if someone is closer to you
6835000	6837000	it's a really nice ability and then barrage his
6837000	6839000	his ultimate ability is really strong
6839000	6841000	and it just
6841000	6843000	kind of like Soldier again focuses on
6843000	6845000	everybody gets kind of in his sights
6845000	6847000	and if they kind of stand there too long
6847000	6849000	you can unload like a bunch of shells
6849000	6851000	on them and do tons of damage so
6851000	6853000	that's pretty much all the
6853000	6855000	characters that you get
6855000	6857000	when you start the game and they're not bad characters
6857000	6859000	not like they just give you a bunch of pushovers
6859000	6861000	they're very offensive minded
6861000	6863000	characters which makes
6863000	6865000	sense because if you just get into the game and
6865000	6867000	you just want to play a shooter
6867000	6869000	and you're not comfortable healing your tanking
6869000	6871000	well the healer and tank that they give you here are very
6871000	6873000	damage friendly all those characters are
6873000	6875000	really easy to use and you can kind of start
6875000	6877000	building a foundation in the game and
6877000	6879000	then be better after you
6879000	6881000	learn how to do them and you start unlocking other heroes
6881000	6883000	you start figuring out what's better but I'll still go back and play
6883000	6885000	those guys because they still do pretty
6885000	6887000	good damage so again
6887000	6889000	it sounds like a big commercial for Paladins but if you
6889000	6891000	ask me I still think Overwatch is a better game
6891000	6893000	I play it more often
6893000	6895000	I dabble in this game but
6895000	6897000	it is really fun
6897000	6899000	you can't really beat the price of free
6899000	6901000	if you're willing to grind
6901000	6903000	it's a good game and even if you want to pay for it
6903000	6905000	30 bucks isn't bad to get all the heroes
6905000	6907000	and it supports crossplay so if you want to
6907000	6909000	play with your friends this is a good game to play with your friends
6909000	6911000	because no matter what console they're on except Sony
6911000	6913000	you can play with your friends so again
6913000	6915000	I'm Flaco Jones
6915000	6917000	you can find me on Twitch twitch.tv
6917000	6919000	slash Flaco underscore Jones
6919000	6921000	and uh
6921000	6923000	that's it back to OLR
6923000	6925000	hopefully that wasn't too long
6925000	6927000	No it was fantastic
6927000	6929000	thank you Flaco and it's
6929000	6931000	there was a lot of work that I know
6931000	6933000	goes into that video especially because it's very
6933000	6935000	clear he like had to play the game like multiple times
6935000	6937000	and multiple characters to put the right shots in and stuff
6937000	6939000	so I really appreciate the time you took to
6939000	6941000	put together that infomercial high res
6941000	6943000	appreciation time too no
6943000	6945000	I'm just I'm giving a little crap because I
6945000	6947000	that's what I asked for I wanted people to submit games
6947000	6949000	um about uh or submit
6949000	6951000	things uh videos for
6951000	6953000	for games that they're like passionate about that they have
6953000	6955000	you know a lot of um you know
6955000	6957000	enthusiasm about which you know even though kind of
6957000	6959000	Flaco admits eh Overwatch
6959000	6961000	might be kind of the game I go to more often
6961000	6963000	maybe this game is still worth your
6963000	6965000	attention especially when it's something that's free
6965000	6967000	uh and they do these kind of different ideas
6967000	6969000	and things like that so I actually I've played
6969000	6971000	um a little bit of Paladins
6971000	6973000	as well and I thought it was I thought it was
6973000	6975000	interesting I mean it was just again it was just like
6975000	6977000	okay I mean I I kind of
6977000	6979000	went back to Overwatch but I thought
6979000	6981000	you know okay this is something I could get into
6981000	6983000	also maybe I need to try it more on PC
6983000	6985000	because I played it on console and I'm just
6985000	6987000	more of a keyboard mouse guy at the end of the day so I do
6987000	6989000	kind of want to give that another go because
6989000	6991000	one thing that I had a problem kind of figuring out
6991000	6993000	was oh like what do all these
6993000	6995000	heroes kind of do and stuff but Flaco
6995000	6997000	did a very good job kind of demonstrating that in that little
6997000	6999000	video especially for oh these are all the characters
6999000	7001000	that you're going to start with and uh so forth
7001000	7003000	so yeah shout out to our pal Flaco Jones
7003000	7005000	against Flaco underscore Jones
7005000	7007000	over on Twitch you should all go
7007000	7009000	follow him if you aren't already
7009000	7011000	that would be incredible and thanks again Flaco
7011000	7013000	for that submission very cool and if you
7013000	7015000	have a submission get in touch with me on
7015000	7017000	Twitter at Mr Rob Roberts we love
7017000	7019000	seeing the listener submitted stuff
7019000	7021000	um yeah it's great
7021000	7023000	um otherwise we've just been filling in with
7023000	7025000	with video clips of the news or whatever else
7025000	7027000	we can think of but it gives us a chance for us
7027000	7029000	folks here in studio to take a little bit
7029000	7031000	of a break so um
7031000	7033000	also in chat I notice
7033000	7035000	Flaco's actually in chat right now
7035000	7037000	and getting some kudos there in chat
7037000	7039000	and rightfully so
7039000	7041000	Flaco says a 12 minute video
7041000	7043000	and 45 minutes of playing for
7043000	7045000	cover shots yep that's it
7045000	7047000	but it looks like there might be some other
7047000	7049000	Paladins players in chat because Nifty's asking
7049000	7051000	which character do you main so
7051000	7053000	uh pretty cool good stuff
7053000	7055000	alright um let's move on with some other news that we
7055000	7057000	have scheduled for tonight's show uh some rapid fire
7057000	7059000	news let's get some news uh kinda quickly out here
7059000	7061000	uh as we travel around the studio
7061000	7063000	and the world and check out quickly
7063000	7065000	some other uh headlines we might have missed
7065000	7067000	uh I think we're starting tonight with Loki
7067000	7069000	yeah so at the South by Southwest
7069000	7071000	gaming panel they um had some
7071000	7073000	details regarding um a new game
7073000	7075000	from Sega uh Team Sonic
7075000	7077000	Racing uh which I think
7077000	7079000	has been teased before but they showed a little bit more
7079000	7081000	on it so they showed that
7081000	7083000	um you know
7083000	7085000	the different customization they have in the different
7085000	7087000	cars you can do which is kinda cool so there's
7087000	7089000	quite a bit of customization available
7089000	7091000	um
7091000	7093000	I'm assuming based on
7093000	7095000	what they showed they said you know you can
7095000	7097000	encourage and see it allows you to unlock different
7097000	7099000	things in the game and different customizations
7099000	7101000	I almost saw that as like monetization
7101000	7103000	type of thing but apparently you earned it in
7103000	7105000	game so we'll see um yeah I wanna
7105000	7107000	say in previous games it was kinda like that
7107000	7109000	yeah in game in game currency only
7109000	7111000	um there the game is
7111000	7113000	gonna be released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4,
7113000	7115000	Switch and PC on May 21st
7115000	7117000	um the other thing they showed is there's
7117000	7119000	gonna be this Team Sonic Racing
7119000	7121000	Overdrive cartoon
7121000	7123000	that's gonna be coming out now
7123000	7125000	when they say cartoon
7125000	7127000	not necessarily like on TV
7127000	7129000	cartoon but it's more of like a
7129000	7131000	web series or something that they're gonna do
7131000	7134000	um which you know makes sense
7134000	7136000	they've done something similar
7136000	7138000	with like say
7138000	7140000	um Angry Birds have like
7140000	7142000	a little web series and stuff that they did as well
7142000	7144000	which actually ended up on Netflix at some point
7144000	7146000	I know cause I've seen it
7146000	7148000	several times thanks to my kids but they're doing
7148000	7150000	something similar to this there's not actually
7150000	7152000	any spoken dialogue in the show
7152000	7154000	but it's just kind of like
7154000	7156000	grunts and whatever
7156000	7158000	it's just I don't know it's very
7158000	7160000	basic so that they can release
7160000	7162000	it globally without having to localize it
7162000	7164000	um so there's that
7164000	7166000	and I guess that'll be around the time
7166000	7168000	that the game comes out so we'll have to
7168000	7170000	see but the game's being developed by Sumo
7170000	7172000	Digital so
7172000	7174000	I think they were the ones that did um
7174000	7176000	weren't they the ones that did the
7176000	7178000	ModNation Racers and stuff like that
7178000	7180000	the name sounds familiar I just can't remember what
7180000	7182000	else they developed off the top of my head I know that name
7182000	7184000	that name sounds very familiar but it looked neat
7184000	7186000	it looked neat so I'll check it out when
7186000	7188000	it comes out
7188000	7190000	cool and then um
7190000	7192000	D'Artasuya thinks it was Outrun by the way the new Outrun that they did
7192000	7194000	oh maybe
7194000	7196000	um and then of course um
7196000	7198000	Game Pass we talk about that
7198000	7200000	quite a bit uh new game that's gonna be
7200000	7202000	coming well not new game but a new
7202000	7204000	game to the service is coming out
7204000	7206000	April 4th will be Minecraft
7206000	7208000	will be added to Games Pass so you'll
7208000	7210000	be able to jump into Minecraft if you haven't
7210000	7212000	already I mean
7212000	7214000	geez it's like 2019
7214000	7216000	um but you'll be able to do that for free
7216000	7218000	well free on top
7218000	7220000	with excluding of course the
7220000	7222000	$10 a month fee for Game Pass
7222000	7224000	but it's an additional
7224000	7226000	piece that you get with that yeah when's the 4k
7226000	7228000	graphics pack by the way
7228000	7230000	whatever happened to that didn't they announce that at E3 2017
7230000	7232000	where's that 4k graphics pack
7232000	7234000	well I know I'm crazy
7234000	7236000	4k graphics for Minecraft but the stuff they were
7236000	7238000	like the weather and all that stuff is really good
7238000	7240000	like I'm like well if you want to do that it's already
7240000	7242000	available on PC now you just have to
7242000	7244000	do with mods yeah
7244000	7246000	of course of course Java version
7246000	7248000	alright um I don't know how I got
7248000	7250000	the story on Mortal Kombat 11 but how about
7250000	7252000	that um so there's more information
7252000	7254000	on Mortal Kombat 11 came out this
7254000	7256000	week and um
7256000	7258000	apparently they're mentioning that
7258000	7260000	NetherRealm is talking about how player data
7260000	7262000	shows that and this is interesting because
7262000	7264000	Jamie you kind of brought this up earlier about how you prefer
7264000	7266000	to play games but the player data they're getting
7266000	7268000	shows that single player mode is one of the most
7268000	7270000	popular ways for people to access
7270000	7272000	and experience the game so
7272000	7274000	that's why NetherRealm was kind of putting
7274000	7276000	as much for a fighting game which you
7276000	7278000	typically think of as two player this is why NetherRealm
7278000	7280000	puts as much as they do into single player because
7280000	7282000	their data shows a lot of people are playing it that way
7282000	7284000	and Mortal Kombat does have
7284000	7286000	kind of a rich you know compared to other fighting games
7286000	7288000	especially the newer Mortal Kombat
7288000	7290000	games really do have a very rich story
7290000	7292000	to them so I'm not terribly surprised
7292000	7294000	to hear that more people are
7294000	7296000	experiencing it as a result
7296000	7298000	um also believe it or not
7298000	7300000	some fatalities were too over the top
7300000	7302000	and not really functional so they were yanked
7302000	7304000	or redesigned what
7304000	7306000	how about that uh they are not commenting
7306000	7308000	on other characters from other
7308000	7310000	properties so all this
7310000	7312000	BS about Shaggy or any
7312000	7314000	uh IP that is not there
7314000	7316000	Shaggy in Mortal Kombat I mean they could
7316000	7318000	make it happen it is Warner
7318000	7320000	it's not gonna happen but it
7320000	7322000	but Velma on the other hand she came
7322000	7324000	to kick some ass no I'm just kidding they're not
7324000	7326000	putting cartoon characters in a fucking game
7326000	7328000	uh you know no just like Joker
7328000	7330000	no I was gonna say you'd have better
7330000	7332000	luck going for the Injustice series
7332000	7334000	I was gonna say they're not gonna put
7334000	7336000	but they had Ninja Turtles well I was in
7336000	7338000	Justice as well I was in Justice as well so
7338000	7340000	yeah you you should find Shaggy for
7340000	7342000	Injustice 3 take your Shaggy
7342000	7344000	it would be an Injustice not to put
7344000	7346000	him in there
7346000	7348000	and Scooby Doo and
7348000	7350000	OLR is cancelled forever good night and Scrappy
7350000	7352000	in fact Scrappy can just be like one of those
7352000	7354000	bonus games now I know this is
7354000	7356000	this is not necessarily in the same
7356000	7358000	series but you know much like they have
7358000	7360000	and uh Capcom
7360000	7362000	Street Fighter series you know where you destroy the car
7362000	7364000	you can destroy Scrappy
7364000	7366000	mmhmm
7366000	7368000	alright um let's see
7368000	7370000	the story is roughly 8 hours long
7370000	7372000	what? $60 for an 8 hour game?
7372000	7374000	uh
7374000	7376000	nevermind it's a fighting game
7376000	7378000	it's a fighting game exactly um
7378000	7380000	the crypt is back but they're saying
7380000	7382000	a nice surprise for players when you see
7382000	7384000	the direction it's taken uh
7384000	7386000	and let's see features will be added to the game
7386000	7388000	after launch even in the first few months
7388000	7390000	uh and Kronika's mission
7390000	7392000	is in the story involves
7392000	7394000	finding time and starting all over
7394000	7396000	so merging the timeline so that
7396000	7398000	the past meets the present
7398000	7400000	so that could be because Mortal Kombat has a very
7400000	7402000	I don't know if you guys know but Mortal Kombat has like a whole like
7402000	7404000	Prime and Kelvin thing going on
7404000	7406000	the newer games are in the Kelvin universe
7406000	7408000	I'm referencing Star Trek obviously
7408000	7410000	but the newer games are in like a different universe because of what happened
7410000	7412000	in the reboot Mortal Kombat 9
7412000	7414000	mmhmm so interesting
7414000	7416000	it'll be interesting to see how that all goes down universal shenanigans
7416000	7418000	yes so uh
7418000	7420000	anyway that's Mortal Kombat and quickly let me also
7420000	7422000	mention that uh the other story I had here is about
7422000	7424000	the uh indie game The Messenger
7424000	7426000	and I have to admit I didn't know a lot about
7426000	7428000	this game until I was uh scavenging
7428000	7430000	for the news this week and then I kind of watched a trailer
7430000	7432000	and this looks really cool because
7432000	7434000	The Messenger it's kind of like a it's a Metroidvania
7434000	7436000	type of game I know we hear that a lot
7436000	7438000	but it kind of seems a little bit like Ninja
7438000	7440000	Ninja Gaiden kind of
7440000	7442000	but like uh amped up
7442000	7444000	a little bit and um
7444000	7446000	it's um something where you
7446000	7448000	can actually switch between
7448000	7450000	8-bit and 16-bit mode
7450000	7452000	by hitting a certain
7452000	7454000	type of like marker
7454000	7456000	on the like you've hit an orb and like
7456000	7458000	it changes it from 8-bit to 16-bit
7458000	7460000	and that kind of it's a time bubble is what
7460000	7462000	it is and it flips it between it and it changes
7462000	7464000	the graphics and the sound with it and it
7464000	7466000	changes the mechanics as well so I think that's kind
7466000	7468000	of kind of neat anyway
7468000	7470000	it's coming to PlayStation 4 on
7470000	7472000	March 19th so this coming week
7472000	7474000	so maybe it'll be a great time for me
7474000	7476000	to check it out uh
7476000	7478000	but anyway Dark Sakura
7478000	7480000	um I don't know how many people in chat
7480000	7482000	have played Dragon's Dogma I started it
7482000	7484000	and didn't like it um
7484000	7486000	but they are going to be doing
7486000	7488000	a uh anime
7488000	7490000	that will be out on Netflix
7490000	7492000	produced by Sublimation
7492000	7494000	and um basically I mean in the game
7494000	7496000	you fight a dragon and
7496000	7498000	it steals your heart and you die and then you come back
7498000	7500000	to life and so you're trying to
7500000	7502000	get revenge on it well that's the story the
7502000	7504000	plot of the anime
7504000	7506000	um but it was said by um
7506000	7508000	Koishikawa Atsushi
7508000	7510000	who is the representative director
7510000	7512000	of Sublimation they're really looking
7512000	7514000	forward on it and the last line is what
7514000	7516000	gets me we're excited to bring our
7516000	7518000	unique cel-shaded animation that carries
7518000	7520000	hand-drawn textures to anime
7520000	7522000	fans around the world
7522000	7524000	so I think it should look interesting
7524000	7526000	um but anyway
7526000	7528000	uh other news there has been
7528000	7530000	another unearthing apart from ECW
7530000	7532000	Wrestling which everybody fucking knew
7532000	7534000	existed um
7534000	7536000	there was an Alien vs.
7536000	7538000	Predator football game
7538000	7540000	for the Sega Genesis
7540000	7542000	at least there was going to be one
7542000	7544000	like football football or as an American
7544000	7546000	football as in not real football
7546000	7548000	yep we got
7548000	7550000	we're gonna settle our differences
7550000	7552000	on the 50 yard line yep
7552000	7554000	that would have made a better movie I think than
7554000	7556000	the Alien vs. Predator movie and it was just
7556000	7558000	a concept it was actually just on
7558000	7560000	like you know uh
7560000	7562000	a flyer and it was
7562000	7564000	called like Alien vs.
7564000	7566000	Predator Hardball no Cosmic
7566000	7568000	Hardball and
7568000	7570000	yeah it looks pretty stupid but
7570000	7572000	but let's be
7572000	7574000	real some of the greatest video games are
7574000	7576000	really really stupid I think I
7576000	7578000	would have actually enjoyed this
7578000	7580000	um but
7580000	7582000	I mean this would be this is like the best video game
7582000	7584000	never made that's why I gave this story to you
7584000	7586000	because even though I know you're not a big football fan I'm like
7586000	7588000	but I bet she would have played this
7588000	7590000	I would have I like
7590000	7592000	I also like super high impact that's true
7592000	7594000	and I like Tecmo Bowl so even
7594000	7596000	people who aren't into sports games there's always
7596000	7598000	something there's always something that brings you in
7598000	7600000	but the thing that's funny about the tweets about it
7600000	7602000	is people arguing if the Xenomorph would wear a
7602000	7604000	football helmet
7604000	7606000	well for safety they have those big
7606000	7608000	long armored heads I want to see this
7608000	7610000	done as a movie
7610000	7612000	but done in the style of Space Jam
7612000	7614000	did you see Alien vs. Predator
7614000	7616000	where you took the head off of one and used it as a
7616000	7618000	shield no I don't
7618000	7620000	I don't really watch I saw
7620000	7622000	that that movie was rad I've seen
7622000	7624000	I actually think I've seen most of the aliens
7624000	7626000	movies at this point I saw Alien resurrection
7626000	7628000	in the theater with Winona Ryder I needed
7628000	7630000	to see that only because I wanted to
7630000	7632000	listen to what it could have been
7632000	7634000	yeah I don't I didn't
7634000	7636000	know anything about the controversy or any of that stuff I just
7636000	7638000	it was written by it was written by
7638000	7640000	Joss it was changed up a lot and
7640000	7642000	while I am very very very very
7642000	7644000	very disappointed in the person he turned out to be
7644000	7646000	at the time I was like should I need
7646000	7648000	to see this and then I
7648000	7650000	heard they ruined it so I never saw it
7650000	7652000	Cia Tiberi in chat says Freddy vs. Jason vs.
7652000	7654000	Alien vs. Predator Ultimate Football
7654000	7656000	why did you leave out Ash though? I'm just kidding
7656000	7658000	well because he would just own them all with his chainsaw
7658000	7660000	hand and Michael
7660000	7662000	Myers come on Cia Tiberi
7662000	7664000	jeez
7664000	7666000	and now doing seriously on that one I don't
7666000	7668000	think that those are series that could be
7668000	7670000	combined because the slasher
7670000	7672000	movies are different than the creature horror
7672000	7674000	right but Mortal Kombat
7674000	7676000	10 brought or I guess
7676000	7678000	you are supposed to say Mortal Kombat X in that one
7678000	7680000	but it did bring over
7680000	7682000	because Predator is in
7682000	7684000	that right and but it's mostly humanoid
7684000	7686000	yeah I guess that's true so it would work
7686000	7688000	in that and they do have some kind
7688000	7690000	of creature people magic
7690000	7692000	it wasn't one of the Call of Duty
7692000	7694000	games didn't they have like you know
7694000	7696000	this whole thing with like Predator in there and
7696000	7698000	I thought like they also had
7698000	7700000	I don't know I feel like
7700000	7702000	these horror movie icons just randomly pop
7702000	7704000	up in all your favorite video games like I'm waiting
7704000	7706000	for like Hello Kitty world featuring
7706000	7708000	you know yes yes
7708000	7710000	predator I'm done
7710000	7712000	I'm down with let's see that
7712000	7714000	Hello Kitty vs. Predator Team Sonic
7714000	7716000	Racing you know who you need
7716000	7718000	to be in those carts predator
7718000	7720000	the predator why not
7720000	7722000	it's canon because
7722000	7724000	you know we saw in the trailer or something
7724000	7726000	some sort of video we saw that the predator
7726000	7728000	was driving a tank so there you go
7728000	7730000	ok Dar Sacro what video
7730000	7732000	game do you want to insert the predator in to make better
7734000	7736000	DDR
7736000	7738000	dance or die
7738000	7740000	dance or die well could you just
7740000	7742000	I mean I'm sure they've done a skin
7742000	7744000	for like a dancer being the predator
7744000	7746000	but I would just jam with the predator
7746000	7748000	as my avatar on the screen
7748000	7750000	I like dance or die
7750000	7752000	or like 2DX and he would literally scratch
7752000	7754000	the thing
7754000	7756000	and if you lose he like stabs you
7756000	7758000	let's see
7758000	7760000	I want the predator to show up at Mario Party
7760000	7762000	when my friends
7762000	7764000	piss me off Smash Brothers
7764000	7766000	is an assist

7926000	7928000	um good evening everyone
7928000	7930000	so Rob as per our brief discussion
7930000	7932000	ABC is bringing back Card Sharks
7932000	7934000	and Press Your Luck
7934000	7936000	have you thought about streaming on Twitch yourself
7936000	7938000	playing game show video games
7938000	7940000	I think that would be pretty fun
7942000	7944000	yes I
7944000	7946000	well okay yes and no
7946000	7948000	so I have not thought about myself playing
7948000	7950000	game show video games although I think
7950000	7952000	that's a pretty rad idea and I think I'm going to do it
7952000	7954000	I think I will play those games it would be fun
7954000	7956000	to play with people online as well
7956000	7958000	have I thought about streaming
7958000	7960000	game show content before
7960000	7962000	yes
7962000	7964000	that's all I'm going to say for now
7964000	7966000	also my next two questions for the entire
7966000	7968000	staff. One, what game show would you
7968000	7970000	love to host? Fuck me
7970000	7972000	Press Your Luck, I
7972000	7974000	oh my god without hesitation that would be such a fun show
7974000	7976000	to host and I wanted to be a game show host
7976000	7978000	when I grew up by the way and this is about as close
7978000	7980000	as I get to live out that fantasy so
7980000	7982000	I really wouldn't want to do any except
7982000	7984000	maybe Family Feud because I think
7984000	7986000	I could out Steve Harvey, Steve Harvey
7986000	7988000	okay I'm pretty good at
7988000	7990000	looks with the really fake like
7990000	7992000	I can't believe they said
7992000	7994000	that he doesn't do an I can't believe
7994000	7996000	they said that he just gives people this look
7996000	7998000	like bitch what
7998000	8000000	which is what I would say
8000000	8002000	okay bitch what no
8002000	8004000	you can't say that on TV go back
8004000	8006000	to your desk
8006000	8008000	uh Sia Tabiri in chat says would you
8008000	8010000	do like a Jackbox games night that actually
8010000	8012000	seems like a really obvious idea that we just haven't done
8012000	8014000	yet I think we'll have to we should plan like a vog
8014000	8016000	Jackbox night that'd be fun
8016000	8018000	yeah yeah we gotta get your game show
8018000	8020000	Loki my game show
8020000	8022000	what game show do you want to host? I would host
8022000	8024000	Double Dare
8024000	8026000	no
8026000	8028000	Double Dare is kind of boring
8028000	8030000	Bumper Stumpers to come back
8030000	8032000	what? Bumper Stumpers
8032000	8034000	it was like a license plate
8034000	8036000	base game yeah we had to translate the
8036000	8038000	license plate but it was like answering trivia
8038000	8040000	questions with license plates or something like that got it okay
8040000	8042000	um we'll just do like
8042000	8044000	uh I'll say Starrcade
8044000	8046000	yeah well fuck why didn't I say
8046000	8048000	that that should have been my number one pick
8048000	8050000	uh he
8050000	8052000	he put a sandbag on the question
8052000	8054000	by bringing up pressure luck earlier in the email
8054000	8056000	so Starrcade
8056000	8058000	but it's a clue it's a it's a
8058000	8060000	tie both alright two
8060000	8062000	what game show would you like to be on
8062000	8064000	Rob we know at Supermarket Sweep so you can't say that one
8064000	8066000	pressure luck
8066000	8068000	I would also
8068000	8070000	say Starrcade
8070000	8072000	it's not on TV anymore so I guess
8072000	8074000	you can say Supermarket Sweep I'm the only one forbidden
8074000	8076000	from saying Supermarket Sweep I don't know what things
8076000	8078000	cost at the supermarket anymore
8078000	8080000	honestly I want to be on Jeopardy before
8080000	8082000	Alex Trebek dies
8082000	8084000	oh my god Bobby Black Wolf nail on the head
8084000	8086000	The Mole I didn't even think
8086000	8088000	of that as a game show but I guess at its core it is
8088000	8090000	The Mole is the greatest reality
8090000	8092000	show they ever made and it is a crime
8092000	8094000	that it is not on TV because
8094000	8096000	none of you assholes were watching it
8096000	8098000	and it was a great like
8098000	8100000	Anderson Cooper as a fucking bitch
8100000	8102000	hosting a show was
8102000	8104000	divine
8104000	8106000	it was great I love The Mole it was there was
8106000	8108000	never a better reality show I really like those reality shows
8108000	8110000	like that but it's except for Drag Race
8110000	8112000	it's different it's not
8112000	8114000	it wasn't I don't know
8114000	8116000	I can't explain it but a show like
8116000	8118000	The Mole felt more James Bond
8118000	8120000	than it did Real Housewives of Atlanta
8120000	8122000	if that makes sense
8122000	8124000	I mean there was the episode
8124000	8126000	or the revival season where the one
8126000	8128000	chick told the guy I'm gonna kill you in your sleep
8128000	8130000	but that was you know that was
8130000	8132000	just one moment I don't know
8132000	8134000	a good game show would be To Catch a Predator
8134000	8136000	it's not a game show
8136000	8138000	no but I already know
8138000	8140000	prizes but then we could bring the
8140000	8142000	predator in no no no
8142000	8144000	and it's a whole different show then I always
8144000	8146000	feel like the family got
8146000	8148000	something when they caught the shit
8148000	8150000	to catch a predator with the
8150000	8152000	predator well if
8152000	8154000	you see the the the human predator
8154000	8156000	gets stabbed by the predator
8156000	8158000	that would be awesome alright anyway
8158000	8160000	a fifth
8160000	8162000	dream today says Rob should replace
8162000	8164000	Julie Chen on Big Brother I
8164000	8166000	really appreciate that comment but first
8166000	8168000	I don't know what show would y'all see
8168000	8170000	me on cause I don't really
8170000	8172000	think I would be on a game show
8172000	8174000	truth or consequences
8174000	8176000	focus on the consequences
8177000	8179000	it was a very old show
8179000	8181000	I'm just thinking the consequences part
8181000	8183000	what was the other one with Chuck
8183000	8185000	Woolery one of those other USA
8185000	8187000	Network ones not Scrabble
8187000	8189000	there was Bumper Stumpers Scrabble
8189000	8191000	and there was
8191000	8193000	he hosted when
8193000	8195000	Millionaire was really big he'd agreed
8195000	8197000	this was around the same
8197000	8199000	era in the late 80s
8199000	8201000	Love Connection
8201000	8203000	Love Connection wasn't the other one I was thinking of
8203000	8205000	I would be on Hollywood Squares
8206000	8208000	but I want like what's his
8208000	8210000	face to come back from the dead
8210000	8212000	and be on it with me
8212000	8214000	oh god
8214000	8216000	Paul Inn
8216000	8218000	I want to be on there with Paul Inn
8218000	8220000	and Carol Channing
8220000	8222000	if I could do like
8222000	8224000	you would also have to be brought back from the dead
8224000	8226000	you want to do zombie Hollywood Squares
8226000	8228000	no I don't want it to be zombie
8228000	8230000	but you want all these celebrities back from the dead
8230000	8232000	no I want it to be like time travel
8232000	8234000	kidnap Hollywood Squares
8236000	8238000	but somehow
8238000	8240000	drag queens are involved as well
8240000	8242000	and also not only
8242000	8244000	would I have Carol Channing
8244000	8246000	I would have Stalker Channing
8246000	8248000	and Channing Tatum so they could be a diagonal
8248000	8250000	this is the weirdest Bill and Ted
8250000	8252000	I've ever seen
8252000	8254000	we're kidnapping all of these people
8254000	8256000	from different timelines that put them on the Hollywood
8256000	8258000	Squares
8258000	8260000	that should be my comic
8260000	8262000	is the
8262000	8264000	time travel kidnapping Hollywood Squares
8264000	8266000	I don't know why I'm laughing it's so stupid
8266000	8268000	and the top square
8268000	8270000	it's brilliant that's why we need to make it a movie
8270000	8272000	and the bottom square would be the predator
8274000	8276000	it's such a stupid plot
8276000	8278000	but what else are people doing
8278000	8280000	is remaking movies
8280000	8282000	so that's it for now take care
8282000	8284000	and see you all on the flip side
8284000	8286000	oh it was an email of course it was
8286000	8288000	well did you hear how I ended it
8288000	8290000	no I'm sorry I missed it because I was laughing
8290000	8292000	that's it for now take care and see you all on the flip side
8293000	8295000	alright
8295000	8297000	delete and next
8297000	8299000	Dear Orange Lounge Radio
8299000	8301000	I hope this email finds you well
8301000	8303000	as I am currently typing it while in the bathroom at work
8303000	8305000	thank you
8305000	8307000	you're listening to KTMI
8307000	8309000	too much information all the time
8309000	8311000	randomly an OLR quote
8311000	8313000	came to mind that had me giggling
8313000	8315000	uh oh I said it too
8315000	8317000	a long time ago Jamie shouted Uranus
8317000	8319000	during an OLR episode
8319000	8321000	to which Rob countered with something along the lines of
8321000	8323000	not having this conversation
8323000	8325000	as host of the show do you have a
8325000	8327000	favorite funny memory of it that comes to mind
8327000	8329000	every so often thanks for eating
8329000	8331000	and I love you guys sincerely Garth Wolf
8333000	8335000	I don't know oh that's a tough one
8335000	8337000	I like drinking and
8337000	8339000	seeing the wall
8339000	8341000	kicking and
8341000	8343000	oh god I try to forget that
8343000	8345000	eating half a box of waffles
8345000	8347000	thank you Loki
8347000	8349000	can you imagine if episodes 1 through 100
8349000	8351000	like 1 through 100 would be like
8351000	8353000	the pre podcast era
8353000	8355000	when like there was no
8355000	8357000	structure to this show
8357000	8359000	there was absolutely no structure to this show
8359000	8361000	and it was just like we take a break every now and then
8361000	8363000	it was floppy boobs
8363000	8365000	it was a mess can you imagine if that had been on Twitch
8365000	8367000	like that's why I was saying earlier
8367000	8369000	I don't want 13 million followers cause somebody would find
8369000	8371000	those shows
8371000	8373000	it would be like triple D's with no bra
8373000	8375000	that's what they're like
8375000	8377000	painful and floppy
8377000	8379000	I mean but there were some good times there really were some good times
8379000	8381000	in those eras
8381000	8383000	the first thing that comes to mind
8383000	8385000	that I think of regularly
8385000	8387000	and it's still like I'll be in the most
8387000	8389000	random place and I think of it
8389000	8391000	and Deep Fried Rice by Loki
8391000	8393000	it's a Loki moment but it wasn't on the show
8393000	8395000	it was when we were interviewed
8395000	8397000	on the news and the only
8397000	8399000	clip they put in of Loki without
8399000	8401000	even his name on it is just him
8401000	8403000	going oh it's so much fun
8403000	8405000	yeah
8405000	8407000	the greatest thing it's on YouTube
8407000	8409000	somewhere I think on the old ass
8409000	8411000	orange songs radio YouTube channel we haven't touched in like 10 years
8411000	8413000	my old newspaper finally destroyed itself
8413000	8415000	like I had the newspaper I had
8415000	8417000	saved with all that
8417000	8419000	it's all like destroyed
8419000	8421000	mine's very yellow
8421000	8423000	but I have it in like this plastic
8423000	8425000	thing that keeps it kind of straight
8425000	8427000	so where they had a picture of my foot
8427000	8429000	okay real quick
8429000	8431000	for the listeners who haven't heard this story and I apologize
8431000	8433000	cause some of you have heard this several times
8433000	8435000	but many years ago when podcasting
8435000	8437000	was first becoming a thing and like
8437000	8439000	it just got onto iTunes
8439000	8441000	and was getting out there of course everybody
8441000	8443000	wanted to talk about podcasting so our local news
8443000	8445000	station I guess put like
8445000	8447000	Sacramento podcast into iTunes
8447000	8449000	and found us so they came out
8449000	8451000	and we did like a fake show for them
8451000	8453000	that they could shoot and then they interviewed
8453000	8455000	each of us about the show and so each of us
8455000	8457000	kind of have a little talking head moment in the
8457000	8459000	clip about it and I think I'm
8459000	8461000	probably saying something about like why
8461000	8463000	L.R. started dark sakura talks
8463000	8465000	about you know why she does it as a
8465000	8467000	hobby or whatever and then the only
8467000	8469000	thing they usually they don't even put his name at the bottom of the
8469000	8471000	screen or whatever it's like it's some type of follow
8471000	8473000	up to a comment it's just him going oh it's
8473000	8475000	so much fun and then that's it
8475000	8477000	and when we
8477000	8479000	saw that back on the news Loki's reaction
8479000	8481000	that was like fucking really
8481000	8483000	there
8483000	8485000	was at least like several
8485000	8487000	minutes of footage and they like took
8487000	8489000	like this fraction of a second that's what
8489000	8491000	it's like to be on reality TV by the way
8491000	8493000	there's just that that whole anyway
8493000	8495000	um but with the new
8495000	8497000	segment which I really now that we are a video show
8497000	8499000	one of these days I need to like clip it and put it on
8499000	8501000	but I just technically it's not ours
8501000	8503000	let's do it next week who cares no one's
8503000	8505000	gonna care they're not gonna who cares
8505000	8507000	um but what was the other thing I was
8507000	8509000	gonna say with that um
8509000	8511000	is um oh they
8511000	8513000	never also in the story they
8513000	8515000	never mentioned the name of our show
8515000	8517000	remember that yeah that was stupid
8517000	8519000	they never said orange lounge
8519000	8521000	radio is this show they never said
8521000	8523000	the name of our fucking show and the whole thing
8523000	8525000	they show the dude
8525000	8527000	searching for it so you can see
8527000	8529000	him type in orange but they never say
8529000	8531000	these guys host orange lounge radio they say
8531000	8533000	these three they say Rob Roberts and Jamie
8533000	8535000	Summers and Matt all host
8535000	8537000	this show out of the apartment in Rancho
8537000	8539000	Cordova and blah blah blah blah blah
8539000	8541000	but they never say it's orange lounge radio
8541000	8543000	which was just
8543000	8545000	kind of the um
8545000	8547000	the the the the
8547000	8549000	topping of the cake yes
8549000	8551000	anyway
8551000	8553000	somebody thank you tiger claw dug up
8553000	8555000	dug up the article and put it in our chat
8555000	8557000	so there it is
8557000	8559000	oh lord
8559000	8561000	SSG100 Matt reminded
8561000	8563000	me of another moment it was
8563000	8565000	peppermint time and mint but that was
8565000	8567000	a that was a horde house joke
8567000	8569000	I'm really
8569000	8571000	just trying to think of stuff
8571000	8573000	cause it's like just little clips just from
8573000	8575000	around the show but maybe not
8575000	8577000	during the show like like the fried
8577000	8579000	you know corn flaked coated
8579000	8581000	rice balls when
8581000	8583000	Loki got a deep fryer
8583000	8585000	and waffles
8585000	8587000	and dunk
8587000	8589000	see I don't the funny moments
8589000	8591000	are good and and I
8591000	8593000	I appreciate those as well but I also
8593000	8595000	remember like a lot of like a lot of not to be
8595000	8597000	too sappy but a lot of the serious stuff like
8597000	8599000	jumps out like we
8599000	8601000	did a live broadcast
8601000	8603000	from Pier 39 on the internet
8603000	8605000	before anybody
8605000	8607000	did something like that
8607000	8609000	like we did that and that was what probably
8609000	8611000	would have been the year 2003 that we did that
8611000	8613000	uh that's awesome
8613000	8615000	um some of the great emails
8615000	8617000	that have come through the years
8617000	8619000	you know the part of the motivation that's kept me
8619000	8621000	doing the show where who's become our friends
8621000	8623000	oh god for sure friends that we made
8623000	8625000	people that will email and say um
8625000	8627000	I had to help accepting
8627000	8629000	my sexuality because you're out there presenting
8629000	8631000	yourself Rob and I saw some of
8631000	8633000	myself and you and that people telling me to
8633000	8635000	get in the kitchen but that's not a
8635000	8637000	positive thing but you know what
8637000	8639000	I positively think those people are morons
8639000	8641000	well you know what though
8641000	8643000	I think despite the fact that that's shitty
8643000	8645000	and I'm not gonna talk positive
8645000	8647000	you know how much of a shit I give about it well I think
8647000	8649000	but it helped you I think in the beginning you
8649000	8651000	were kind of like what the fuck is
8651000	8653000	like you know but it kind of like I think helped you
8653000	8655000	like I cranked the
8655000	8657000	feminism to 11 yes
8657000	8659000	it's like that art project
8659000	8661000	complicit in my own
8661000	8663000	discrimination and then
8663000	8665000	hyper feminist
8665000	8667000	not shutting up
8667000	8669000	uh see it to bury in chat with
8669000	8671000	a newer moment saying I remember that time
8671000	8673000	rob mangled the carlton dance and
8673000	8675000	loki refused to floss see that's something a little bit newer
8675000	8677000	and uh thanks
8677000	8679000	or no thanks to the twitch clip
8679000	8681000	clipping feature which I just saw my earlier
8681000	8683000	laughing fit popped up as a clip
8683000	8685000	around your butt I'm sure now some
8685000	8687000	of these moments are probably gonna be frozen in time
8687000	8689000	so that'll be it'll be interesting to see the
8689000	8691000	the result of that but that's okay
8691000	8693000	Matt also brings up that we broke the news of bin laden
8693000	8695000	oh yes
8695000	8697000	some of the serious shit that happens like right in the middle
8697000	8699000	of our show we've really had a lot
8699000	8701000	of shit happen though on this show
8701000	8703000	oh we've had some heavy topics we've had

8809000	8811000	story like uh he's he's trying to be
8811000	8813000	professional in the moment or whatever and then I think

8815000	8817000	to say well also
8817000	8819000	dj rama s points out that we spawned other
8819000	8821000	shows oh yeah that's
8821000	8823000	that's quite the compliment abs
8823000	8825000	absolutely she hulk misses the fus
8825000	8827000	well
8827000	8829000	but keep in mind that there was a period of time
8829000	8831000	for sure where gamers
8831000	8833000	didn't necessarily need to be associated with negativity
8833000	8835000	if you want fus just read my twitter
8835000	8837000	we
8837000	8839000	can still do them once in a while we haven't done one in a while

8851000	8853000	capitalism
8853000	8855000	and misogyny
8855000	8857000	your turn uh my fu of the week
8857000	8859000	goes to myself for not going to the gym
8859000	8861000	today because I slept for 10 hours
8861000	8863000	um because I've been so tired today
8863000	8865000	uh and fu to
8865000	8867000	um uh just
8867000	8869000	yeah I think I think today was definitely
8869000	8871000	a crash and burn day I think yesterday and today have
8871000	8873000	both been like just crash and burn days
8873000	8875000	between like Vegas and go go go
8875000	8877000	and all this other stuff like I think I've just
8877000	8879000	like emotionally and physically like
8879000	8881000	crap and then I hosted a show Friday night too so
8881000	8883000	I think I emotionally and physically crashed and
8883000	8885000	burned these past couple days and it's not the best feeling
8885000	8887000	in the world but um
8887000	8889000	doing this show is pepping me up I do have one
8889000	8891000	more cause it's very important alright hurry my uterus
8891000	8893000	for cramps well
8893000	8895000	sorry to hear it okay alright Loki
8895000	8897000	last not least um
8897000	8899000	I guess my fu
8899000	8901000	was uh to
8901000	8903000	my migraine but it's gone now so I don't know
8903000	8905000	I'm glad your migraine is gone
8905000	8907000	you were right the caffeine helped apparently all that
8907000	8909000	caffeine did it along
8909000	8911000	with the other stuff um and that's
8911000	8913000	just for now alright
8913000	8915000	that was it for emails right yes
8915000	8917000	okay then I suppose this video game podcast should
8917000	8919000	get back into some uh video game topics
8919000	8921000	huh let's let's do
8921000	8923000	it back into the gaming news oh uh but please feel
8923000	8925000	free to email us in the future participate at
8925000	8927000	orangesontrader.com but meanwhile Loki
8927000	8929000	so Valve's gonna start cracking down on
8929000	8931000	some of these review bombs that have nothing
8931000	8933000	to do with necessarily
8933000	8935000	um maybe reviewing
8935000	8937000	the games it's more of like
8937000	8939000	I guess people using the platform to
8939000	8941000	um
8941000	8943000	attack other
8943000	8945000	things that they don't like
8945000	8947000	like for example I guess
8947000	8949000	would be if
8949000	8951000	said company was coming
8951000	8953000	out with a decision that somebody didn't
8953000	8955000	like so they took you know their previous
8955000	8957000	game they released and review bombed it because they didn't
8957000	8959000	like a certain decision or something like that
8959000	8961000	so what they're gonna do is try to identify
8961000	8963000	those and then remove those
8963000	8965000	uh from the way it calculates
8965000	8967000	uh the review scores
8967000	8969000	based on those types of reviews
8969000	8971000	uh they're saying that the reviews themselves
8971000	8973000	are being left untouched but
8973000	8975000	and if they want if people want to dig into
8975000	8977000	them you'll still be able to do so but
8977000	8979000	they're making it clear that you know
8979000	8981000	the ones that are
8981000	8983000	gonna be I guess highlighted or whatever are gonna be
8983000	8985000	not those ones that are off
8985000	8987000	topic well good
8987000	8989000	I like when I go in to read game reviews
8989000	8991000	I don't need to hear about what people think about the
8991000	8993000	policies of the company or the
8993000	8995000	company or something that was said on Twitter
8995000	8997000	or some comment that somebody affiliated
8997000	8999000	I just want to know is the game good
8999000	9001000	yes or no that's what I
9001000	9003000	want to hear about so I'm glad they're
9003000	9005000	gonna try to do something about it I mean it seems
9005000	9007000	like that's an awfully big undertaking for a store
9007000	9009000	like Steam which is barely managed as
9009000	9011000	it is to undertake but to do anything I
9011000	9013000	know I was like we'll see
9013000	9015000	it's a nice thought
9015000	9017000	did they ever take down the rape game
9017000	9019000	oh sure of course they did good but
9019000	9021000	the you know the fact that
9021000	9023000	it went up in the first place
9023000	9025000	because Steam
9025000	9027000	doesn't really moderate a lot of things so it's
9027000	9029000	interesting to see that Steam is suddenly gonna moderate this
9029000	9031000	this is yeah a little
9031000	9033000	like hmm how's that gonna
9033000	9035000	work I don't know anyway
9035000	9037000	uh Kaijuto in our chat over at
9037000	9039000	Twitch TV slash vog network says I don't like
9039000	9041000	the review bombs but I think Valve is making a
9041000	9043000	big mistake you have to let the community
9043000	9045000	police that stuff people are smart
9045000	9047000	they know a bomb review from a normal one
9047000	9049000	they need to not attach the game score
9049000	9051000	to the review I think review
9051000	9053000	uh user review should be unscored
9053000	9055000	for sure I think that would be a great way to
9055000	9057000	start but anyway
9057000	9059000	yeah yeah
9059000	9061000	uh interesting retort by Bobby
9061000	9063000	Blackwolf that I think is very succinctly
9063000	9065000	put uh Bobby Blackwolf
9065000	9067000	response to Kaijuto saying a person
9067000	9069000	is smart people are
9069000	9071000	dumb a fucking
9071000	9073000	that is a very succinct
9073000	9075000	good comment
9075000	9077000	gold star comment of the week
9077000	9079000	I can't believe we're gonna
9079000	9081000	keep it in the family so to speak
9081000	9083000	and people will claim that nepotism is coming
9083000	9085000	into play and the fact that he does the show
9085000	9087000	before ours but I think Bobby is deserving of the gold star
9087000	9089000	of the week for that comment
9089000	9091000	alright moving on
9091000	9093000	uh let's move on to uh something that
9093000	9095000	uh ooh it's uh
9095000	9097000	a little rough for the folks involved uh
9097000	9099000	over at Axiom Verge
9099000	9101000	uh it has to do with developer versus publisher
9101000	9103000	uh of course if you haven't
9103000	9105000	played Axiom Verge it's uh really cool
9105000	9107000	it's a little uh super metroid-ish type of game
9107000	9109000	uh it was free on epic store
9109000	9111000	epic game store
9111000	9113000	the epic game store for a little
9113000	9115000	bit um it was free there but
9115000	9117000	not anymore but you could buy it and it would be
9117000	9119000	worth your money if you haven't picked it up one of several
9119000	9121000	other ways um the game is still
9121000	9123000	supposed to get a physical release on Wii U
9123000	9125000	I don't know why you would
9125000	9127000	bother at this point but I guess because they promised
9127000	9129000	it or what have you they're gonna deliver
9129000	9131000	well I think that's through that uh
9131000	9133000	the one company oh limited run? yeah limited run
9133000	9135000	okay so it's a collector release
9135000	9137000	okay that makes a lot more sense uh yes
9137000	9139000	the distributor limited run
9139000	9141000	game and the business manager
9141000	9143000	have said that the publisher Badland
9143000	9145000	game still owes them a quarter million dollars
9145000	9147000	so what happened is that
9147000	9149000	limited run says that Badland owes it
9149000	9151000	$78,000 for physical copies of the game
9151000	9153000	that it never delivered and then Badland
9153000	9155000	did not pay Tom Happ
9155000	9157000	the one man band that made Axiom Verge
9157000	9159000	uh the sum of about $200,000
9159000	9161000	that was also
9161000	9163000	there was supposed to be money that was gonna pay for medical treatments
9163000	9165000	for Tom Happ's kid
9165000	9167000	which I seem to remember has come up with
9167000	9169000	this game before is that you know
9169000	9171000	he's been using the money to pay
9171000	9173000	a lot for medical related things for his
9173000	9175000	kid which you know is obviously
9175000	9177000	you know nobody likes to see a sick kid so a lot of people
9177000	9179000	are happy to support this game to know that that's where
9179000	9181000	some of the money is going uh and so
9181000	9183000	this is you know now it's getting ugly because it's
9183000	9185000	on Twitter and now um let's
9185000	9187000	see uh Adelman who is uh
9187000	9189000	the business manager with limited run
9189000	9191000	the game's Dan Adelman says Badland has
9191000	9193000	literally stolen money from a disabled toddler
9193000	9195000	that's basically what he's saying on Twitter
9195000	9197000	yikes so uh
9197000	9199000	anyhow this is uh very ugly
9199000	9201000	between the two of them nobody was
9201000	9203000	commenting in an article that Kotaku ran earlier
9203000	9205000	this week and uh don't know
9205000	9207000	what this is gonna do if this
9207000	9209000	is gonna impact that Wii U release
9209000	9211000	I don't think it will but um
9211000	9213000	it'll be interesting to see how that whole uh
9213000	9215000	dragging through the mud and all that will
9215000	9217000	possibly change things so they're
9217000	9219000	saying we were still planning on dividing up the proceeds
9219000	9221000	on the original terms
9221000	9223000	so uh 6,000 copies of the Wii U
9223000	9225000	edition were made there's a soundtrack an art book
9225000	9227000	and other extras so it
9227000	9229000	paid Badland oh it's coming on the Wii U
9229000	9231000	yeah I kept thinking Switch
9231000	9233000	it's out on the Switch right man
9233000	9235000	why are you so late on the Wii U? Collectors
9235000	9237000	that's why I said the whole time
9237000	9239000	right so anyway
9239000	9241000	I kept hearing Wii U or like hearing Switch
9241000	9243000	instead of Wii U I was like oh okay Switch that makes sense
9243000	9245000	and it's like Wii U wait what
9245000	9247000	why no
9247000	9249000	alright
9249000	9251000	anyhow
9251000	9253000	oh Bobby is admitting that that quote he said
9253000	9255000	came from some movie but I didn't recognize
9255000	9257000	it cause he's thanking the chat for
9257000	9259000	not saying what movie we may have to revoke the star
9259000	9261000	cause it's not an original quote
9261000	9263000	alright
9263000	9265000	you get a half star alright let's move
9265000	9267000	on uh Dark Sakura what do you have for us
9267000	9269000	we're almost uh to the call segment but not just
9269000	9271000	yet but Dark Sakura well there's been a
9271000	9273000	rash of arrests made um
9273000	9275000	in uh
9275000	9277000	Ahmedabad
9277000	9279000	Ahmedabad I always
9279000	9281000	mispronounce it but there were
9281000	9283000	people who were arrested across the state
9283000	9285000	after playing PUBG
9285000	9287000	um because um several
9287000	9289000	um the games of actually games
9289000	9291000	of that line online multiplayer games
9291000	9293000	were banned on
9293000	9295000	the grounds that it was leading to
9295000	9297000	violent behavior among children and
9297000	9299000	and younger people they arrested
9299000	9301000	three people in different
9301000	9303000	parts um of the
9303000	9305000	area after they were caught playing the game
9305000	9307000	and um the police
9307000	9309000	commissioner issued a notice
9309000	9311000	banning even more of that
9311000	9313000	uh starting uh it actually started
9313000	9315000	on the 14th so they

9381000	9383000	arrested for playing is
9383000	9385000	Where in the World is Carmen
9385000	9387000	San Diego and you can actually play
9387000	9389000	this for free now thanks to Google
9389000	9391000	Earth so if you go to Google Earth
9391000	9393000	um they actually have an option now
9393000	9395000	catch Carmen San Diego
9395000	9397000	and you basically play a little game
9397000	9399000	that's you know Where in the World
9399000	9401000	is Carmen San Diego and follow
9401000	9403000	clues and has it been updated for Modern
9403000	9405000	Maps? Well it's a great
9405000	9407000	advertisement tie-in for
9407000	9409000	the new Netflix series is what it is
9409000	9411000	yeah so it's pretty
9411000	9413000	awesome and you get clues and you go
9413000	9415000	off to find Carmen
9415000	9417000	San Diego and
9417000	9419000	yeah that's pretty cool
9419000	9421000	I think that's a cute modernization
9421000	9423000	I mean you know using Google
9423000	9425000	Earth but still at the core
9425000	9427000	having uh Carmen San Diego
9427000	9429000	be about you know learning about these different cities
9429000	9431000	and the the artifacts and the
9431000	9433000	uh museums and the places
9433000	9435000	of interest that are in these cities and kind of learning
9435000	9437000	what's where what's the capital of what I mean
9437000	9439000	that's you know that's what those games are all about
9439000	9441000	I'm surprised that's not a thing that's
9441000	9443000	like a Niantic game
9443000	9445000	you know like not necessarily
9445000	9447000	world traveling but like within
9447000	9449000	your area within your neighborhood like trying
9449000	9451000	to find Carmen San Diego
9451000	9453000	or one of her henchmen or something like
9453000	9455000	that um I don't think Niantic hasn't done anything
9455000	9457000	like that like you know and maybe they're
9457000	9459000	worried about flooding
9459000	9461000	where in your hood is Cory Santiago
9461000	9463000	yeah I don't know yeah where in your neighborhood
9463000	9465000	where in your neighborhood is this
9465000	9467000	I have heard about live event
9467000	9469000	producers so it's been this article that's
9469000	9471000	been floating around my Facebook um because
9471000	9473000	people think of me when they think of Clue the movie
9473000	9475000	which I appreciate it is my all time favorite movie
9475000	9477000	um but I guess they're doing like
9477000	9479000	a live Clue event here locally
9479000	9481000	like it's like some type of late but it's not
9481000	9483000	it's not really the board game Clue it's just like a murder
9483000	9485000	mystery thing that's like themed on Clue I guess
9485000	9487000	but my point is I think
9487000	9489000	they use a phone app that
9489000	9491000	you like you pay money to play
9491000	9493000	this event and then you get all the updates through the phone
9493000	9495000	app and I've heard of this being a thing
9495000	9497000	lately because this isn't the first thing that I heard of
9497000	9499000	I also remember seeing something for like
9499000	9501000	an amazing race
9501000	9503000	style thing but it's
9503000	9505000	all through the phone but here's what they do
9505000	9507000	like they offer like a big prize to the winner
9507000	9509000	but they let like thousands of people
9509000	9511000	sign up for like 20 bucks a pop
9511000	9513000	and like the winner gets maybe like $10,000
9513000	9515000	so it sounds like a lot of money but it's not nearly
9515000	9517000	as much as these guys are making off it so
9517000	9519000	they give that prize and then not only that
9519000	9521000	but like if you get stumped along the way and some
9521000	9523000	of the clues are like really hard you have to pay
9523000	9525000	for more clues oh that's lame get it
9525000	9527000	so pay to win
9527000	9529000	that's a thing but that isn't
9529000	9531000	keep an eye on that stuff because
9531000	9533000	somebody's making money
9533000	9535000	off these live event games
9535000	9537000	not Niantic but definitely these like
9537000	9539000	neighborhood event
9539000	9541000	day type of things
9541000	9543000	so that's a thing you probably see you probably
9543000	9545000	seen these advertised on Facebook in your neighborhood as well
9545000	9547000	so anyhow
9547000	9549000	alright is that
9549000	9551000	hmm I have regrets
9551000	9553000	oh from eating that donut that you were showing off
9553000	9555000	amazing but like there's a few
9555000	9557000	foods that will always make me sick and I know
9557000	9559000	better and I don't give a shit
9559000	9561000	ice cream
9561000	9563000	and donuts
9563000	9565000	it's like me and coffee my doctor told me to stop
9565000	9567000	drinking coffee and I was like we're gonna have to negotiate this
9567000	9569000	cause you and I both know it's not gonna happen
9569000	9571000	so we negotiated
9571000	9573000	anyway
9573000	9575000	one more story and this is about
9575000	9577000	Snapchat cause I'm sure
9577000	9579000	lots of you guys here in studio use Snapchat
9579000	9581000	right
9581000	9583000	I don't know I guess
9583000	9585000	I've used Snapchat it's very
9585000	9587000	similar to Instagram has the stories
9587000	9589000	which they kind of stole from Snapchat
9589000	9591000	but Snapchat is another way
9591000	9593000	and Snapchat is also kind of like
9593000	9595000	a lot of people associate
9595000	9597000	it with like people
9597000	9599000	sending nudes to each other because they're supposed to
9599000	9601000	self destruct in 24 hours or whatever
9601000	9603000	so this is of course you know
9603000	9605000	cause that's how the internet works
9605000	9607000	that's how anything works right we've talked about the whole
9607000	9609000	time to penis before so of course
9609000	9611000	they put a thing like Snapchat out where it's like
9611000	9613000	the picture self destruct in 24 hours
9613000	9615000	you know that
9615000	9617000	it's supposed to tell you when a screenshot is taken
9617000	9619000	but there's all sorts of ways
9619000	9621000	nothing you send is
9621000	9623000	truly that type of private
9623000	9625000	but whatever
9625000	9627000	oh it's that type of private alright
9627000	9629000	I left myself wide open with that joke
9629000	9631000	alright anyway my point with this
9631000	9633000	is Snapchat they are trying to get away
9633000	9635000	from being known as the app where you send nude pics
9635000	9637000	they're trying to do more event based things
9637000	9639000	and stories like on Instagram
9639000	9641000	and maybe this is something they want to do as well
9641000	9643000	supposedly Snap is going to be launching
9643000	9645000	a gaming platform
9645000	9647000	as well it's
9647000	9649000	it's a rumor right now it's apparently
9649000	9651000	code named Project Cognac
9651000	9653000	within the Snapchat walls
9653000	9655000	externally developed games
9655000	9657000	that will work inside the Snapchat app
9657000	9659000	they are saying that it will be similar to like
9659000	9661000	Facebook's games in the messenger
9661000	9663000	which I think I've talked about and then
9663000	9665000	never played in messenger
9665000	9667000	on the phone like I know it's a thing I did the
9667000	9669000	Pacman thing like once that's it
9669000	9671000	but supposedly Snapchat would be something like that
9671000	9673000	it'd be like an instant game so I guess you could
9673000	9675000	like play it against friends it may also involve
9675000	9677000	streaming of eSports events
9677000	9679000	you know around the world which you know that's
9679000	9681000	a little more like that is one part of
9681000	9683000	Snapchat that's interesting that I don't think
9683000	9685000	I think Instagram
9685000	9687000	does this but it's harder but on
9687000	9689000	Snapchat there's like a big map of the world
9689000	9691000	and if somebody's made their story public
9691000	9693000	you can watch public stories
9693000	9695000	so you can go to places of interest like
9695000	9697000	museums and stuff and see
9697000	9699000	people in real time like submitting Snaps
9699000	9701000	from these places of interest and I think that's
9701000	9703000	one of the cooler features of it
9703000	9705000	but anyway they want to put gaming into it
9705000	9707000	so because Snap has been
9707000	9709000	struggling to increase their user growth
9709000	9711000	probably because Instagram
9711000	9713000	is offering a very similar thing but Instagram
9713000	9715000	is also owned by Facebook
9715000	9717000	which is a whole other thing so anyway
9717000	9719000	it should be noted that Snap had recently
9719000	9721000	acquired an Australian gaming company
9721000	9723000	called Pretty Great
9723000	9725000	and also a web based startup
9725000	9727000	called Play Canvas
9727000	9729000	so they think the unveil
9729000	9731000	could be around April 4th
9731000	9733000	which is when Snap has a
9733000	9735000	developer conference scheduled in Los Angeles
9735000	9737000	but it's certainly possible that
9737000	9739000	something could come up around
9739000	9741000	GDC as well but it seems like
9741000	9743000	Snap may decide to
9743000	9745000	keep that for their own conference
9745000	9747000	that they are having on
9747000	9749000	April 4th so there it is
9749000	9751000	with that
9751000	9753000	that is the last scheduled story we have for tonight
9753000	9755000	so I think we're going to go to some listener
9755000	9757000	calls and participation
9757000	9759000	if you want to ask us a question in chat over
9759000	9761000	twitch.tv slash vog network you sure can
9761000	9763000	but we also want to talk
9763000	9765000	to some of our listeners and take some calls
9765000	9767000	and then we'll get last minute stories as well
9767000	9769000	so I see a call sitting on the
9769000	9771000	line and they've mentioned what they want to talk about
9771000	9773000	and this sounds like a topic I would like to hear
9773000	9775000	about so let's get to it. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
9775000	9777000	Hey this is Marcus
9777000	9779000	or PixelPakas
9779000	9781000	it's so great to hear from you
9781000	9783000	we see you all the time in chat but not
9783000	9785000	as often on the phone it's great to hear from you
9785000	9787000	what's on your mind tonight PixelPakas?
9787000	9789000	Not much
9789000	9791000	I just sort of wanted to talk about this event
9791000	9793000	I went to this weekend
9793000	9795000	called Arcade Expo
9795000	9797000	and it is
9797000	9799000	a convention or whatever basically
9799000	9801000	where they have
9801000	9803000	over 1000
9803000	9805000	pinball machines
9805000	9807000	and arcade machines
9807000	9809000	it's one of these type of things
9809000	9811000	like we have it like California Extreme
9811000	9813000	and I know Bobby
9813000	9815000	really loves the Southern Fried Game Room Expo
9815000	9817000	they do in Atlanta. Where is this expo?
9817000	9819000	So
9819000	9821000	it's in Southern California
9821000	9823000	kind of in the middle of nowhere
9823000	9825000	if you know where Banning is
9825000	9827000	I do because I saw an
9827000	9829000	ad for this on Facebook because I was looking
9829000	9831000	into going to it but I didn't
9831000	9833000	because I had a conflict on Friday night
9833000	9835000	yeah so
9835000	9837000	it's there where there's basically nothing else
9837000	9839000	except for I guess
9839000	9841000	this is actually a
9841000	9843000	museum of pinball where they hosted it
9843000	9845000	which I had never heard of before either
9845000	9847000	at least that one I know there's one in like Vegas
9847000	9849000	but I think they're totally separate
9849000	9851000	either way it was like
9851000	9853000	tons of
9853000	9855000	games
9855000	9857000	open for hours you know from like
9857000	9859000	11 to 2 AM
9859000	9861000	and it was just kind of
9861000	9863000	awesome how much
9863000	9865000	there was and
9865000	9867000	it actually wasn't super crowded basically
9867000	9869000	if you wanted to play a game you wouldn't have to wait
9869000	9871000	in a long line for the most part except for like a
9871000	9873000	couple new pinball machines like were super
9873000	9875000	crowded everything else is
9875000	9877000	you'd be able to either just walk up and stop playing
9877000	9879000	or you would just wait for one person to
9879000	9881000	like finish their game and then you could jump in
9881000	9883000	so
9883000	9885000	it was really great
9885000	9887000	they had a bunch of other stuff you know
9887000	9889000	it wasn't just the
9889000	9891000	pinball and arcade machines they had
9891000	9893000	some panels
9893000	9895000	some like movies that they were
9895000	9897000	showing you know all gaming related
9897000	9899000	chiptune artists were there as
9899000	9901000	well playing music at night
9901000	9903000	they had some arcade machines outside
9903000	9905000	so you could play like Under the Stars
9905000	9907000	or whatever lots of food
9907000	9909000	themed food
9909000	9911000	they had tater tots shaped like
9911000	9913000	tetrominoes
9913000	9915000	so it was
9915000	9917000	just a really cool fun event
9917000	9919000	that I had never heard of before
9919000	9921000	until like this week and
9921000	9923000	decided to go to it
9923000	9925000	well that sounds like a lot of fun
9925000	9927000	it definitely sounds just very similar to
9927000	9929000	the California Extreme event that happens
9929000	9931000	up here Santa Clara
9931000	9933000	right? It was at the same hotel where
9933000	9935000	GamerX4 was at right?
9935000	9937000	right next to the convention center near the stadium
9937000	9939000	I think that Hyatt is where they have it
9939000	9941000	and yeah it's a very
9941000	9943000	similar thing except I thought the gaming
9943000	9945000	out Under the Stars that's unique that sounds
9945000	9947000	really cool
9947000	9949000	now I know like when I go to these types of events
9949000	9951000	I'm like oh my gosh I've never got to play this
9951000	9953000	before and now I did and that's awesome
9953000	9955000	like was there a game that you like had
9955000	9957000	never played before that you got to play at this event
9957000	9959000	that made you excited?
9959000	9961000	yeah so probably
9961000	9963000	the most interesting thing was
9963000	9965000	that I got to play Computer Space
9965000	9967000	which is one of like the oldest
9967000	9969000	arcade games
9969000	9971000	right?
9971000	9973000	and I had seen that
9973000	9975000	online the pictures of that like
9975000	9977000	crazy looking cabinet and stuff
9977000	9979000	but I'd never had the opportunity to actually put my hands
9979000	9981000	on it and play it so that was really cool
9981000	9983000	and then there was just a bunch of like
9983000	9985000	old pinball machines
9985000	9987000	I've never played anything
9987000	9989000	particularly old in the pinball
9989000	9991000	scene so this is like
9991000	9993000	the stuff where they don't have
9993000	9995000	all the fancy audio and graphics
9995000	9997000	going on it was just sort of like
9997000	9999000	a board with some lights and then they just
9999000	10001000	have like dinging bell noises when you hit stuff
10001000	10003000	yeah with the scores
10003000	10005000	on the wheels instead of an LED
10005000	10007000	display yeah old school
10007000	10009000	like 60's style you know we own one like that
10009000	10011000	Spanish eyes oh I didn't know you owned one
10011000	10013000	we loaned it out to somebody but
10013000	10015000	when I was at the Vegas Hall of Fame and I didn't
10015000	10017000	include this in the video last week but there was like a little like
10017000	10019000	ice skaters table that was kind of cute
10019000	10021000	that was like that
10021000	10023000	remember the Buggles?
10023000	10025000	based off the Beatles?
10025000	10027000	really? no I don't remember that one
10027000	10029000	that's one of those 60's ones
10029000	10031000	like if you go to these pinball halls of fame
10031000	10033000	and there's another one
10033000	10035000	I think you can see one in Alameda
10035000	10037000	that I've yet to go to and I really need to
10037000	10039000	I think Dark Soccer and I need to do a road trip out there someday
10039000	10041000	and
10041000	10043000	yeah it's always neat because usually
10043000	10045000	there'll be like one row for tables
10045000	10047000	from the 60's and 70's that are these like
10047000	10049000	old older styles and they're really neat
10049000	10051000	yeah
10051000	10053000	there was a whole bunch of the older style ones
10053000	10055000	and no one was really on them so
10055000	10057000	it was like me and
10057000	10059000	a bunch of them just like ringing
10059000	10061000	bell noise you know constantly
10061000	10063000	in this corner of the hall but it was fun
10063000	10065000	I really enjoyed
10065000	10067000	the whole thing apparently
10067000	10069000	they do other events at
10069000	10071000	this Museum of Pinball
10071000	10073000	so even if you missed it on this one
10073000	10075000	there's going to be something else later this year I think
10075000	10077000	where they have another sort of similar event
10077000	10079000	so I would definitely recommend it to anyone
10079000	10081000	who's anywhere
10081000	10083000	near to Southern California
10083000	10085000	it was a blabber
10085000	10087000	if there's something that you think would interest us
10087000	10089000	here at O.R. you know my Twitter and all that
10089000	10091000	because I mean we're far but we're not
10091000	10093000	that far so like
10093000	10095000	you know for an event like that if I had not
10095000	10097000	already been committed to hosting an event on Friday
10097000	10099000	night which I was I
10099000	10101000	would have seriously considered coming down for that
10101000	10103000	because I saw the ads on Facebook and I
10103000	10105000	looked into it and I was like oh this just sounds like
10105000	10107000	California Extreme but it's in LA
10107000	10109000	ish I know it's like out there but
10109000	10111000	you know us in Northern California
10111000	10113000	we call everything like past
10113000	10115000	the grapevine is LA
10115000	10117000	so
10117000	10119000	so it sounded
10119000	10121000	it sounded really neat I would have gone
10121000	10123000	yeah it's definitely worth it
10123000	10125000	so I just wanted to sort of share that with anyone
10125000	10127000	I was considering
10127000	10129000	doing one of those listener
10129000	10131000	video things but then I was like
10131000	10133000	tired and slept too late so I didn't do it
10133000	10135000	alright that's okay next time next time
10135000	10137000	but yeah I mean a lot
10137000	10139000	of big cities or metro
10139000	10141000	areas have an event like
10141000	10143000	this and you know the size of it
10143000	10145000	probably depends on the size of where you are I just
10145000	10147000	mentioned a moment ago you know Bobby has
10147000	10149000	worked a lot with one in the Atlanta area the Southern
10149000	10151000	Friday game room gaming I always say
10151000	10153000	game room they changed the name gaming
10153000	10155000	so Southern Friday gaming expo
10155000	10157000	and actually vog network
10157000	10159000	sponsors that and if I am not mistaking
10159000	10161000	we'll be doing so again this year
10161000	10163000	so and I know he's a big
10163000	10165000	proponent of that and I would love to go if I didn't already
10165000	10167000	do one like week long trip
10167000	10169000	to Atlanta every year I'd love
10169000	10171000	to go to that event it sounds like a lot of fun but
10171000	10173000	a lot of areas I'm sure there's one in
10173000	10175000	the New York area I'm sure there's one
10175000	10177000	in Chicago somewhere
10177000	10179000	I mean all the big cities have to have something like
10179000	10181000	this I'm sure
10181000	10183000	yeah but that's all I just wanted to let
10183000	10185000	everyone know so thanks for taking my call
10185000	10187000	I appreciate it thanks so much and please
10187000	10189000	keep us in the loop of anything else that space
10189000	10191000	might be doing that we should be interested in
10191000	10193000	for sure alright take care buddy
10193000	10195000	bye bye
10195000	10197000	alright let's get to another call
10197000	10199000	hi you're on Orange Laundry who's this
10199000	10201000	hey it's Bellingham how are you
10201000	10203000	hey good good to hear from you what's up buddy
10203000	10205000	I just had a
10205000	10207000	follow up call to
10207000	10209000	um let's also
10209000	10211000	stay wild and listen
10211000	10213000	uh sure
10213000	10215000	I'm sorry I'm sorry if I'm sounding slow
10215000	10217000	or look confused your audio
10217000	10219000	sounds distant tonight I don't know what
10219000	10221000	is weird but try to get your
10221000	10223000	question or comment out we'll do our best
10223000	10225000	um
10225000	10227000	well if you remember last week
10227000	10229000	I called in about
10229000	10231000	possibly buying Diablo
10231000	10233000	I do
10233000	10235000	remember that yes because we had
10235000	10237000	spotlighted that in the little break segment
10237000	10239000	last week so what happened
10239000	10241000	I well
10241000	10243000	two two things I well I
10243000	10245000	bought it on Thursday
10245000	10247000	this is something I
10247000	10249000	rarely ever say
10249000	10251000	I if a I paid
10251000	10253000	full price
10253000	10255000	which is not
10255000	10257000	full price really for when the
10257000	10259000	game first came out but sure
10259000	10261000	well full price is
10261000	10263000	opposed to what they normally charge
10263000	10265000	you know I charge for the game
10265000	10267000	on the platform
10267000	10269000	which is rarely for me because
10269000	10271000	I usually 99.9%
10271000	10273000	of the time I wait
10273000	10275000	for sales so
10275000	10277000	me paying full price is like
10277000	10279000	extremely
10279000	10281000	okay yes and I do remember we were talking
10281000	10283000	about this and I said you know weigh the pros and the cons
10283000	10285000	and blah blah blah so you jumped in
10285000	10287000	and so uh the question
10287000	10289000	I would have is was it was it
10289000	10291000	worth it though
10291000	10293000	yes you know let's put it this way I've been
10293000	10295000	playing it more than Magic the Galar
10295000	10297000	so
10297000	10299000	I know whoa
10299000	10301000	are you never even
10301000	10303000	my fellow
10303000	10305000	you're not like a secretly a clone are you
10305000	10307000	you know that's something
10307000	10309000	uh
10309000	10311000	that's something I always never
10311000	10313000	say I mean you know I think
10313000	10315000	from like breaks
10315000	10317000	to take care of like IRL
10317000	10319000	stuff I've been playing that
10319000	10321000	constantly so for me
10321000	10323000	you know there's a little bit of a difference
10323000	10325000	between you know the PC
10325000	10327000	version versus uh
10327000	10329000	the PS1 version
10329000	10331000	that I remember from way
10331000	10333000	back in the day
10333000	10335000	you know I'm
10335000	10337000	I'm loving it you know
10337000	10339000	so
10339000	10341000	one thing I would recommend is
10341000	10343000	that you know for
10343000	10345000	people that
10345000	10347000	the game back in the
10347000	10349000	day you know be it the
10349000	10351000	PC version or the PlayStation
10351000	10353000	1 version
10353000	10355000	it's you know it's
10355000	10357000	available again and it works
10357000	10359000	on modern machines
10359000	10361000	are definitely worth recommending
10361000	10363000	idiots you know granted yeah
10363000	10365000	it's you know
10365000	10367000	like the 20 plus year old game and
10367000	10369000	it's not like the latest greatest game
10369000	10371000	it's now
10371000	10373000	you know high risk graphics
10373000	10375000	or anything like that but still it's
10375000	10377000	fun to sell a game it's
10377000	10379000	definitely well worth the price point
10379000	10381000	you know you can't go wrong
10381000	10383000	god
10383000	10385000	you know so
10385000	10387000	well I mean you're cutting out a little bit so I
10387000	10389000	want to jump in just because uh it's it's a
10389000	10391000	little hard to um understand and some folks
10391000	10393000	in chat are confirming it's not just me
10393000	10395000	but it sounds like you know you are
10395000	10397000	uh rediscovering this I still
10397000	10399000	I'm still a little puzzled as to why
10399000	10401000	Blizzard didn't just do it through their own
10401000	10403000	app it seems like a really weird missed
10403000	10405000	opportunity but um okay
10405000	10407000	I mean uh maybe this
10407000	10409000	will convince them to make Diablo 4 a little
10409000	10411000	faster uh as opposed to a
10411000	10413000	Diablo uh mobile phone experience
10413000	10415000	which would be just lovely if they would
10415000	10417000	uh get on that so
10417000	10419000	alright well um uh
10419000	10421000	Metal Mayhem I'm gonna let you go uh just because
10421000	10423000	we're having a little hard time understanding you but thank you so much for the call
10423000	10425000	take care and uh have fun gaming
10425000	10427000	alright
10427000	10429000	uh don't see anybody else in the green
10429000	10431000	room right now so let me
10431000	10433000	see if we have any other
10433000	10435000	uh
10435000	10437000	stories last minute stories yeah to make our show roll
10437000	10439000	but uh No Man's Sky beyond
10439000	10441000	oh my god how did I not get this in show roll
10441000	10443000	yes this is kind of a big deal they announced
10443000	10445000	um so basically it's the next
10445000	10447000	free update that's gonna be coming to No Man's
10447000	10449000	Sky and it's gonna have a ton of stuff
10449000	10451000	to it it looks like they're kind of turning
10451000	10453000	it into a No Man's Sky
10453000	10455000	MMO type of thing
10455000	10457000	um so
10457000	10459000	yeah they basically said we
10459000	10461000	don't consider No Man's Sky to be an MMO
10461000	10463000	it won't require a subscription it won't contain
10463000	10465000	microtransactions and will be free
10465000	10467000	to all existing players
10467000	10469000	um but yeah it's definitely
10469000	10471000	teased and it's a new big significant
10471000	10473000	update that they're gonna be doing
10473000	10475000	and it's gonna be coming out uh around the summer
10475000	10477000	so
10477000	10479000	um it's part of
10479000	10481000	uh yeah and that's just apparently
10481000	10483000	one part of um
10483000	10485000	I guess beyond which is gonna be
10485000	10487000	three different updates
10487000	10489000	so
10489000	10491000	looks pretty cool
10491000	10493000	it's pretty amazing that they're
10493000	10495000	still continuing to support that game as strong
10495000	10497000	as they are especially after such
10497000	10499000	a backlash that that game had they kind of
10499000	10501000	stayed committed to the game that they envisioned
10501000	10503000	putting out and you know I
10503000	10505000	think many folks have been happy with the more
10505000	10507000	recent you know uh changes that were
10507000	10509000	done I know I did some streams a while back
10509000	10511000	as did Bobby uh when the the last
10511000	10513000	No Man's Sky Next or whatever they called
10513000	10515000	that uh the first time it was out came out and you
10515000	10517000	know I think a lot of people were kind of happy with that game
10517000	10519000	and where that's at but to hear that they're going
10519000	10521000	even further is is
10521000	10523000	is so cool I love it
10523000	10525000	looks pretty cool yeah I'll be curious to see how that
10525000	10527000	works as an MMO though I'm not I'm not
10527000	10529000	too sure about it but we'll see we'll see
10529000	10531000	so um
10531000	10533000	Kaijuto says yikes
10533000	10535000	I hope the game can be played offline
10535000	10537000	that's all I care about
10537000	10539000	can't it I don't think No Man's
10539000	10541000	Sky can be played offline can it be played I
10541000	10543000	well cause you can lose connection to the server and you
10543000	10545000	still keep going so I think the game will
10545000	10547000	try to put itself online cause it's for the database
10547000	10549000	of what all the planets are named and the species and things
10549000	10551000	like that even in the earliest versions of the game
10551000	10553000	you weren't necessarily interacting with other people or whatever
10553000	10555000	but like I think the game will
10555000	10557000	function when offline
10557000	10559000	it just won't download
10559000	10561000	the database of what everything is
10561000	10563000	named and so forth and you may have
10563000	10565000	conflicts with names and all okay
10565000	10567000	Kaijuto says yes you can play offline I do it all the time
10567000	10569000	I don't know why they would suddenly shut that off then
10569000	10571000	yeah I don't see why
10571000	10573000	and then there's a new game coming out from
10573000	10575000	Avalanche uh Generation
10575000	10577000	Zero which is like a survival game
10577000	10579000	a co-op survival game it's
10579000	10581000	um similar to I guess a little bit
10581000	10583000	like um Horizon Zero Dawn
10583000	10585000	but you're
10585000	10587000	it takes place in the 80's
10587000	10589000	and you're like these kids that come back from vacation
10589000	10591000	and everybody's gone and there's
10591000	10593000	these like robots hunting people down
10593000	10595000	and it's about you surviving
10595000	10597000	so they said you can play the game single player
10597000	10599000	but it's going to be incredibly hard because it's
10599000	10601000	scaled for you know four player co-op but
10601000	10603000	um it looked interesting
10603000	10605000	uh very similar like the
10605000	10607000	robots you kind of go against look
10607000	10609000	very similar to like Horizon Zero Dawn
10609000	10611000	um but different
10611000	10613000	obviously and that's coming
10613000	10615000	out on the 26th as
10615000	10617000	part of an early access thing
10617000	10619000	I think it's only on PC though
10619000	10621000	doesn't say if it's console but
10621000	10623000	and then finally
10623000	10625000	uh Paxis is right around the corner
10625000	10627000	oh gosh and
10627000	10629000	with Paxis I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened already
10629000	10631000	I thought it was in February when I went
10631000	10633000	no March 28th
10633000	10635000	no the snow was going really late in the year
10635000	10637000	the year I went yeah March 28th
10637000	10639000	in Boston and Gearbox
10639000	10641000	already has a nice little teaser on
10641000	10643000	their official Twitter
10643000	10645000	showing it says March 28th Boston
10645000	10647000	in Massachusetts it's
10647000	10649000	fucking Borderlands 3 or it's
10649000	10651000	another Borderlands thing because it's
10651000	10653000	it's what it looks like somebody pointed out
10653000	10655000	it's Exit 3 on the little
10655000	10657000	teaser image so it's uh yeah
10657000	10659000	it's Borderlands 3 which
10659000	10661000	is anyone surprised that Gearbox is
10661000	10663000	I'm not surprised and I'm excited
10663000	10665000	excellent so alright
10665000	10667000	well I don't see any other um calls in our
10667000	10669000	green room waiting to go um I don't know
