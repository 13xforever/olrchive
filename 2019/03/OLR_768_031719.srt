00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This week on the heels of the shakeup of gaming companies as we know them, the Legend of Android Gaming Machines returns. Let's just hope it doesn't follow the same path as Uya did. This is just one new alphabet initiative. Join us for more of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I got a gamer hat on too, look!

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a Klonoa hat.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh it's a Klonoa hat.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's an official Klonoa hat.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I thought it was just Pac-Man because I can only see the one side. Awesome.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Very cool.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Because he has Pac-Man on his hat.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And Techmaster Loki of course is here as always.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Nothing video game themed on.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What's your shirt?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I couldn't see on the side.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm getting a whole bunch of new shirts this week.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Nothing green. Pinch. Pinch.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You see this?

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you see this world?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I have green on my Apple Watch.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Happy St. Patrick's Day

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to those of you that are in the mood for this season.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Or some of my friends call it

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Straight Pride.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh it's an oatmeal shirt.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll explain this in a minute.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You know whenever gay pride gets brought up

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
there's always that troll that says

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
here you go, today's your day.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Celebrate. Enjoy your moment.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Every day.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is white people straight pride?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All those characteristics are really

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
on display today. Have you been down to downtown today?

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Have you been down K Street?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I avoided it like the plague you.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Anyhow.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So the shirt I'm wearing for the sake of the podcasters.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We are a podcast but we do tape

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
live at Twitch TV every Sunday night

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 Eastern

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
VoGnetwork.com or VoGnetwork.com

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So the shirt I'm actually wearing

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is a Beat the Blurch shirt

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
from when they did those marathons a couple years ago.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay here's the funny thing behind this.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I actually didn't run the marathon.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was all signed up, ready to go.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I got super sick the night before.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And it wasn't one of those like

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
ugh I'm sick

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and I don't think I can go.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No I was like

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
sick. So it wasn't happening.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So my pal Melody went and she brought back this shirt

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
so it's really funny because it says I beat the Blurch

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and I ran 5k and it's like no you didn't hoe.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But oh well I still have the shirt

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and it's one of the only green things I own so

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
it seemed appropriate to wear tonight.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A little warm for today though. We did get quite

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
toasty. I have

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
not been outside all day. How sad is that?

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I foraged today. Did you?

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For dandelion greens. Okay.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well it was definitely

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
eaten a lot in the US during the Depression

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
because people ain't got no money

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
for food. But dandelions

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the leaves are full of calcium

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and iron and the

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
blossoms are actually edible as

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
well. Good source of fiber and beta carotene.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you vegan? No. Fuck no.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay. Hey listeners

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
do you see this? A little

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
traditional dish. This is

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
dead boiled cow.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And it has been in my mouth

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
it is almost as salty as I am.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right. Almost. Almost.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Almost. But nothing can meet

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
those levels besides dead maybe the

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
ocean. Boiled bovine.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Anyhow. Hello to

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
everybody in our chat room because again

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we do tape live at twitch.tv

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
slash vog network and we do have

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
lots of folks in chat. Some folks

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
also noticing on twitch tonight we did a special

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
our border tonight is green.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Just a little wink and a nod to the day

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
today and Bobby joined in on that too

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
so that was kind of fun. So yeah there you go.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's get into some video game discussion.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
After all we are a show that talks about video game

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and gaming culture. And I

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
guess this first kick off topic tonight is

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
a little bit about gamer culture. But this

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
has been all over the news. In fact I'm looking at an article

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that actually came in on Reuters

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
about this. And it has to do with

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
influencers.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Influencers. And those people

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that can influence people. I hope the camera

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
can pick up my eyes rolling.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's a little further back now Loki.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You might have to roll them really good. That's why I'm just

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
subtitling

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that with my eyes are rolling.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Before I even say the name

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
of the influencer why are you rolling your eyes

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
over here. Because it's not a non story.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I mean obviously you pay people

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
like any brand you pay people

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to sponsor stuff.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright let me tell you what you're talking about.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So long story short

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ninja whose real name is Tyler

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Blevins it seems like was

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
paid one million dollars

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to promote

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Apex Legends which

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
one might argue successful

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
campaign because Apex Legends has

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
been doing very well for itself. Not necessarily because he did it though.

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's true. You don't know if it's

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
because of him or just because of the strength of

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the game itself. I think it's the game.

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I think a big part of it is the game too.

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I want to get to the rest of the story but I think a big

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
part of Apex Legends success is

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the fact that people were kind of

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
like I don't know about you guys but

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
like I can only be

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
sustained by one video game for so long.

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And I've joked about this on the show before is that

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have and I don't mean to make light of like actual

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
conditions or anything. So if you can think of

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
a better name to call this and I'm open to it.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh my god. Let's not be so

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
super PC about everything.

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Like we're going to start

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
now.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm just saying.

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have gamer ADD so I'll play

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
one thing for like five or ten minutes.

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I am totally offended by that. My son

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
has ADD.

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Actually ADHD.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't care. I'm just joking.

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How about just general

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
lack of attention span.

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
My point is that I can only play one thing

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
for like five.

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But you guys know I do this. I spend a bunch of

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
money on a game. I play it for a little bit and then it's like

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
on to the next game. There's very few games

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
that are able to hold my attention. Now

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
before because I'm sure there's chatters already

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
chiming in. What about the MMOs?

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Because I do play things like Warcraft.

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I play Final Fantasy 14.

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I kind of tend to stick to those for a long time.

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I think part of what makes those games a lot

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
different is the more social elements

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
of those games. But anyway.

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was getting to a point with this with Apex

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Legends specifically. So with Apex Legends

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the deal is that I think

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
a lot of folks who are

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
kind of like ready for the hot new thing after a couple

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
months. I think they were kind of done with Fortnite.

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Not necessarily like done with Fortnite

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
like oh I'm over this game. But it's like

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
when this new kid shows up on the block that's

178
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
oh it's like a similar

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
formula but a little

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
different. And you know a different way of doing it.

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Like I think a lot of people were like oh let's move

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
on to this. Because it's like kind of what I enjoy

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but something new. Kind of

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
what happened to PUBG

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
once Fortnite came along.

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Not to say either of those games are doing

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
terrible for themselves or not even like do well

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
but you know you can only be number

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
one for so long. Or maybe like not even

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
necessarily

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Fortnite but like

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
maybe even Black Ops 4 or something like that.

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's lots of different games

194
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
out there. I think getting

195
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Ninjas because he's very

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
well known for playing

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Fortnite and whatnot.

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And maybe the thought was okay

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
you get an influencer like this who has

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
a lot of the attention of the Fortnite crowd maybe

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
they'll see this and then want to try the game

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
out because it is free to play.

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I think that really helped a lot

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
is being that it's free and

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
not trying to sell you a $60 game that they're

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
going to throw the same type of microtransactions

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and sort of monetization

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
schemes on top of.

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Very true. I think the free thing really helps.

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Although Bobby Blackwolf in our chat points

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
out PUBG was the

212
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
first big Twitch success story which I would

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
agree with. It wouldn't have gotten any traction if

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
they didn't have big Twitch streamers playing it.

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Although PUBG wasn't free if I remember

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
right. It was kind of on the cheaper end of things.

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
PUBG isn't free yeah. Yeah it was like a $20

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
game I think when it was first in early access.

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's still. Yeah it's still. It's still like

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
20. They might have upped it a little bit.

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Kind of like Minecraft. Remember Minecraft was cheaper

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and then the price went up when it got really popular.

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I think PUBG is a very similar sort of

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
story. I think it was cheaper in the beginning than it is

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
now but it's not. It's certainly not $60.

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's still a budget title if you will.

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah. So and that

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
probably helps it as well.

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Anyway.

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's see. It was noted

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that Ninja had

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
excuse me. Ninja

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
had tweeted about the game on February 5th

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and then he had 13 million followers

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
on Twitch and went to play the game

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
on Twitch and he was paid for

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
1 million and this was according to a source

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that gave that to Reuters.

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think that's how you pronounce that Reuters.

240
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So anyhow and he may not have been the only one

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that was actually paid

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
for this either.

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It sounds like there may have been other folks too.

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah. So I mean

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but this is the type of thing that they do

246
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
though. I mean even with like Battlefield

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
5 I think they had paid influencers as

248
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
well. There's

249
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
a lot of games that they have paid influencers

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
on and I think

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the only reason it's notable is because it's like

252
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
oh it's a million dollars but I mean honestly

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it's the same as like beauty care lines

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
paying celebrities to promote

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
their stuff on Instagram or whatever the

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
case may be. The same thing. Or paying

257
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Kylie Jenner to promote Fyre Festival.

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes exactly

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
like that. I'll be honest I mean even though

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not like a huge huge influencer

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I got offered like

262
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
some crazy ass discount to

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
show off a cat ring.

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I wanted to buy one anyway.

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean the only reason that they were asking

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
people to pay for it is because the money goes back to charity

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
for homeless cats. So I was fine

268
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
doing it. So basically they were only charging

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
me the donation.

270
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
there's another

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
channel out there that's called Pretty

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Pastel Please and she's in Australia

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
she used to work

275
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
actually she still works in advertising I think

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
but she talked about the whole influencer

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
thing and how it works behind the scenes too.

278
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So it's exactly

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
there's a product to sell and there's someone that's streaming

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
it then

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
money's gonna go into

282
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
it. Right I mean and this isn't

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
gonna change it and it's a smarter

284
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
advertisement anyways because what are you gonna do actually put

285
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
out like TV advertisements or anything like

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that. I mean it's

287
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
this is

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
this is the easiest way to get

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to your target audience is by

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
going to where you know the

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
eyes are obviously twitch streamers

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
YouTube streamers

293
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
social

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
media platforms it's

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
gonna be it's basically targeted advertising

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
for this type of stuff and to put

297
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
stuff elsewhere

298
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean doesn't really make sense

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you're not gonna get as much of a return on

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
investment for that stuff so it just

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
makes sense. It's like I mean

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to take it a lot more simply it's like when people choose

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
billboard placement they're gonna put

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
the billboards in the place

305
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
that the message needs to get out number one the most

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
like if it's for advertising not just the

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you know y'all suck

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you know you homophobes shut up. But I'm

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
talking about like the advertising ones

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
they're gonna put them like for restaurants

311
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
on the side of a highway so that

312
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
hungry people will go on

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
driving hangry and go get a burger

314
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You know I think in the interest because you were talking

315
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
before I was having my coughing fit

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
sorry guys you were talking a minute

317
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
ago about how you've been offered this kind of

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
influence stuff and I think in the interest of disclosure

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
so is VOG Network and myself

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
personally in fact we're talking

321
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
about doing a game stream on

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
VOG Network right now with

323
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
a particular smaller publisher

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
but it's one of the it's a much smaller thing

325
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it's like you know sure you give us an advanced

326
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
copy of your game for free we'll play it you know

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
for a couple hours just you know for the fun of it

328
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
you know because hey free game and you know

329
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
something that we can you know premiere to an audience

330
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
hopefully but I think

331
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
what strike I mean there there's also

332
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think a big step difference between that between

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
like you know ooh free game for playing

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
it early on stream and one

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
million dollars there's a big

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
big I'd do it for a million

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
right but

338
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to be fair I mean

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't want to sound like a bitter Betty either you know

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
it's very you can see how many people follow VOG

341
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Network in my personal channel versus how many

342
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
people followed Ninja and it's very

343
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
very different

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I would love it if 13 million people actually

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know if I would love it if 13 million people

346
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
followed VOG Network because then your

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
every little thing goes under scrutiny and all

348
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that stuff and like you know you joked about

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
earlier when I was you know choosing my words

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
carefully well if we had

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
13 million followers I'd probably have to be

352
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
oh my god are you telling me that some of

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
their feelings are gonna be hurt

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
oh no people with hurt

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
feelings who gives a fuck

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
without going too far I give a fuck

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I give a fuck too because I think

358
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
maybe not a hundred percent of the time

359
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
are these things that we see on

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Tumblr and stuff always but some of it is

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
valid I understand that but like

362
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
using common sense aside from

363
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
you know the obvious things like

364
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
being just like completely insensitive

365
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
to people you're

366
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
gonna get somebody's gonna get

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
upset about some opinion you have about

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
something you can't please everybody

369
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I will say this I think

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that and this is just

371
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
people don't understand the

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the difference between uh

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
intent and impact

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and so

375
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think that we do have a responsibility

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
to watch some of what we say or make sure that

377
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
we preface it saying this isn't

378
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
said with malice here's the story

379
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I mean I think call out culture

380
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
is a disease

381
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but that being said there are people out

382
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
there who need to fucking be called out because they are

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
doing it out of malice and I think the best

384
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I want to move back in the story but the best example

385
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can give of this is that you know like back

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
early when this show first started

387
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I probably have used a phrase

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
a few times that I picked up off project

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
runway when he used to say hot

390
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
tea mess right

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that used to be a phrase that was in pop culture and you probably saw it on

392
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Saturday Night Live but like now in the

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
year 2019 I realized that that phrase

394
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
ain't cool and there's some people who yes

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
their feelings get legit hurt when they hear that

396
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and so like you know I respect that so that's

397
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that's what I'm talking about you know what I mean like you know

398
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
if somebody's going to get but at the

399
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
same time okay I have been a

400
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
long time running host of the Rocky Horror Picture

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Show right and there's some people

402
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that will write essays about how

403
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Rocky Horror Picture Show is problematic and all this stuff

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and I wasn't it meant to be

405
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in a way and I say it is a

406
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
product of a different time in

407
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
1975 this is all there was but

408
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
et cetera et cetera so some people

409
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think want to

410
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
be mad just to be mad but

411
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
some of it is legitimate so we have

412
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
to navigate this delicate

413
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
place in between anyway

414
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
where was I oh yes Ninja has 13 million

415
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
followers and I don't a Ted Talk

416
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
um anyway

417
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
some other streamers were paid for this as well

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
EA paid Shroud who I guess is a popular

419
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Polish Canadian streamer with

420
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
6 million Twitch followers

421
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but that guy actually declined

422
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
because didn't want to

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
oh no I'm sorry I'm sorry that guy declined

424
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
to disclose the terms of the deal so it sounds like he

425
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
did it but we don't know how much money he was paid for it and so

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
forth but um

427
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
interesting

428
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that this is a part of our

429
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
gaming culture now is that

430
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
some of these people that we do choose

431
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
to elevate with our Twitch

432
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
follows and the biddies and the subs

433
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and all that stuff some of the people that we

434
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
do choose to elevate

435
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
um were

436
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
are making coin off it

437
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
basically I still

438
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
don't see why

439
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
PDP is still around

440
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that is a whole nother Oprah that I don't

441
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
want to get into right now

442
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
so I should just really duct tape his tongue

443
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to the top of his mouth and never remove

444
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
it anyway

445
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
um let me go to our chat over at

446
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
twitch.tv slash vog network

447
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
um

448
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
um let's

449
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
see uh some people are talking

450
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
about me uh leaving the room

451
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
uh bobby's saying we need to influence more so we need you

452
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
alive uh quest buster

453
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
in uh our twitch chat says

454
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
apex legends is something that

455
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
uh shroud probably would have paid

456
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
played anyway also he was

457
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
consulted for the game months ago as a

458
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
secret project which he publicly

459
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
admitted and you know I've heard of that type

460
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
of thing in the gaming industry before not just

461
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
with influencers but I've heard of it with

462
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
reviewers you know this is a thing

463
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is that some game

464
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
websites and some big game websites

465
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
will take money

466
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
to do a

467
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
a review of a game basically that is

468
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
confidential between the site

469
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and the publisher it's not the

470
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
real review it's a mock review basically

471
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
but it's like the actual like the way they would have reviewed

472
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
it if they played that product today that

473
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
review is never published it's sent to the publisher and the

474
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
publisher or the developer uses

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it to implement feedback and make the game

476
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
better and then the real game

477
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
is reviewed by somebody

478
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
else on the same site obviously

479
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you could understand that once somebody takes

480
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
a deal like that and has reviewed the game

481
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
one time that's not the same person that can write the

482
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
review later on but that whole like

483
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
consulting with a

484
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
personality is not particularly

485
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
unique to the gaming industry

486
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
what I think is unique is that now it's not

487
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
just like game reviewers but it's game

488
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
players and people who

489
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
in some ways you could say

490
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
review games live on stream

491
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I guess that's that's

492
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
kind of one thing I think I've seen

493
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
done on Twitch before maybe have done myself

494
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is that I'm getting my first impressions

495
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
of a game live on stream and

496
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
if I had 13 million followers

497
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
that's something I might be able to make

498
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
a little more money doing so

499
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't know do you guys

500
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
think this is a dangerous thing for the industry

501
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
or it seems like based on

502
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
kind of like what I was hearing a minute ago based on the

503
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
fact that Instagram influencers are paid

504
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and other types of industry

505
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
leaders are paid for endorsements

506
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you know lovely celebrities

507
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
are paid for makeup campaigns and things like that

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that maybe we're okay with this because

509
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
this is what we do

510
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
as long as they're following the law and the fact that

511
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
they're disclosing that's an advertisement

512
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and that type of thing I don't see a problem

513
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
with it which they all did

514
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
so as long as they're doing that not trying to do

515
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
some shady shit where oh

516
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm being paid to say something good about this

517
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
but I'm not telling you that it's an advertisement

518
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
that that's the only problem

519
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
which YouTube had a big thing with that

520
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to say about a year ago

521
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
yeah it was the FTC

522
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
coming down on like all sorts

523
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
of different things and it was

524
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
it's they've been better about it

525
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
because I think some people were unaware

526
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
of what the law was but

527
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
it's been I think it's been

528
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
alright as far as people disclosing

529
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
stuff just as long as it's very upfront

530
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
like hey this is a paid advertisement

531
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
or you know paid sponsorship

532
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
with this you know

533
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
we're talking about this game

534
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
here's why um

535
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
then I'm fine with it

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know I don't watch Ninja

537
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
so I don't give a shit you know either way

538
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and honestly to

539
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't think yeah

540
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
it's good that he did that

541
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and he's promoting that

542
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but don't think really the game

543
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
needed that it was pretty

544
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
strong on its own but

545
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
do you think maybe that and

546
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't think we want to say one person alone

547
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
did this but maybe the influencer

548
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
campaign as a whole let's say and all these

549
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
streamers that they may have worked out deals

550
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
with to do this do you think maybe that helped

551
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
this punt out the gate

552
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
because this game landed with a bang

553
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
as opposed to a slow build

554
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
maybe a game that took a little while for people

555
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
to discover and then it kind of

556
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I guess but what might be more like

557
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
a Minecraft type situation it would be interesting

558
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
to see like how

559
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you know how much of an influence those influencers

560
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
had like how how this

561
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
boosted the numbers to be interesting to see

562
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but I don't know yeah it's a bummer because apex legends

563
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
they don't ask you where did you hear about our game

564
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
they don't really well they could have like I don't know there

565
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
could be maybe a link in the video or something like that

566
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
that has some sort of like tracking

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
tag or something enough that's the way

568
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
twitch usually does things if

569
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
you're playing a certain game maybe I have to

570
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
admit I wasn't watching those streams so I don't know

571
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but I do know that sometimes like as an

572
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
affiliate there are certain games

573
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and it's not all of them there are certain games that

574
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
if twitch sells them on the store

575
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
if you're playing them on your stream there'll be a little

576
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
link right under the stream to buy the game

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and then that streamer gets a little cut of the money

578
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and then I'm sure they can measure all that

579
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
analytics as well so I don't

580
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know but well I guess you know

581
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think they've got that whole twitch prime thing

582
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
right now is running with apex

583
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
legends so maybe that's a way that they're

584
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
trying to measure their audience I don't know

585
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
there's a lot I don't know I think this is a lot

586
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
of uncharted territory

587
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
one other thing I want to bring up in response to what you

588
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
say because I thought it was interesting because you talked about during

589
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the whole YouTube scandal that you had a lot

590
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
of people who didn't know what the law was

591
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
which you know well they claim not

592
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
to know what the law was yeah fair enough

593
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
but I think when it does come to the law

594
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
you know not everybody

595
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is very good at interpreting the law

596
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
all the time I think YouTube

597
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
tried to make strides to

598
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
dumb down the law and make these

599
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
videos for creators to help YouTube

600
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
makers understand the law

601
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think that's part of what they felt

602
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
their onus was to do which is fine

603
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but I mean it also goes to

604
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
conversations about as our technology moves

605
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
more and more and more our laws

606
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
don't always seem to get updated

607
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
fast enough we talk about this all the time when it comes

608
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
to copyright, trademark

609
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and IP laws

610
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
you know the dancing thing

611
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that's come up before right the Carleton

612
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is in the game and how do we handle that

613
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
right that whole thing

614
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
is just like this uncharted territory because the

615
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
laws are being updated as fast as the technology

616
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
yeah this is causing this

617
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
very interesting sort of story and they're not going to be unfortunately

618
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
because you have people that are

619
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
have a lot more money that want to control things

620
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
so they can keep all that money and

621
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it's not going to change

622
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
yeah very interesting

623
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
let's see other comments in chat

624
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
5th Dream in chat says to me it just seems like

625
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
business as usual they do it on

626
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
TV always so

627
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and Questbuster follows that up with

628
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
same here I'd be more surprised if

629
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
EA didn't do something marketing wise 5th Dream

630
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
so maybe this is just this interesting

631
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
new territory maybe you're going to see I think it's

632
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
kind of happening already but maybe you're going to see more

633
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and more folks on

634
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Twitch you know getting

635
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
some sort of

636
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
maybe either commutation be it

637
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you know free game or maybe

638
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
well maybe we'll see that with EA's

639
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Battlefield 5 thing that they've got

640
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
the new battle they have the new

641
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
was it

642
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Battle Royale mode that's coming to

643
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Battlefield 5 that they

644
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
had a trailer out for this week

645
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
they'll be showing that off because

646
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
everybody's got to jump on that

647
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
bandwagon all I got to say

648
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
is you can't be an industry leader if you're following

649
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
people so

650
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
alright

651
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
let's move on to what sorts of

652
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
games have been influencing us

653
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
this week as we talk about how is our

654
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
gaming week and the types of video games that we've

655
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
been playing this week Dark Soccer we'll start with you

656
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
how was your gaming week I

657
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
played a bunch of pinball really Pokemon

658
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Go I touched

659
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Ingress once

660
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
just to see if it was still there

661
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm still playing

662
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
idle pouring I don't really mention it but I'm still

663
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
playing it

664
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I am borrowing

665
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Horizon Zero Dawn

666
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I haven't started it yet but I figured I would

667
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
start it on stream or something

668
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I was actually planning on starting to

669
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
stream this week but I have a birthday party

670
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
on Wednesday night and I'm going to see

671
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Renae on Thursday so

672
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
which by the way thank you so much for

673
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
that shout out about women in games

674
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
here in Sacramento that was awesome

675
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
oh that was something

676
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that Bre did right? Oh sorry that was Bre

677
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
why did I say Renae? I don't know but thank you Bre

678
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
because Renae was also floating

679
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
an article this week but it was about a different topic

680
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I posted Renae's thing my brain

681
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
is like broken it's fine sorry

682
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I have a donut

683
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
we miss her though she should come back to OLR

684
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
when she's ready I miss everybody

685
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
but no but I'm

686
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
going to go hang out with Renae and so maybe I'll play

687
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
games while I'm in San Francisco

688
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
while I was at

689
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
did I talk about the

690
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Munster's release party at coin op?

691
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
you did a little bit last week

692
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I didn't know if I had mentioned it but that was lit

693
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
so

694
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
we actually had a tweet that came in this week

695
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
about some folks were appreciating the pinball

696
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
talk that came up on OLR and I was like

697
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
dark soccer is a big pinball fan how many machines

698
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
do you have in your house now?

699
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
three in the house no six in the house

700
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm at the house

701
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
collectively no I'm actually having to do the math

702
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
we are giving back

703
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
pinbot 2.0 we're borrowing it

704
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
we're trading back

705
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Adam's family to get our twilight zone back

706
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
so twilight zone creature from the black lagoon

707
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
judge dread

708
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I thought she was counting

709
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
like the ones in the house versus the ones in the garage

710
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and I'm like same thing

711
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
the shadow and

712
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
one other I can't remember

713
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
so we have

714
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I think eleven

715
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
right now it's enough where they're not only in your

716
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
garage but you have a spare bedroom

717
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
we move more in the house because Dan's Mustang is coming home

718
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
so we have to clear out the garage

719
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
so there's room for the Mustang

720
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
they're no longer rusting

721
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it's a 1969 Mustang coupe

722
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
so do the math

723
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it's huge

724
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
damn muscle cars though what's your favorite table

725
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
you own I already know this I actually have two

726
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
well World Cup soccer

727
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
is my favorite but my second favorite

728
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
is theater of magic what's the worst table you own

729
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
fuck I really hate

730
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
judge dread is

731
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
grown on me but I do not

732
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
like creature from the black lagoon

733
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
a lot of people love it it's just not

734
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
that fun for me and probably my least favorite

735
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
of all time would be the hobbit the new one

736
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
because it's slow as fuck

737
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
do not like a slow table

738
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but you know it turns out that I have a type

739
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
with designers well I love everything

740
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Steve Ritchie has done I seem

741
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
to be a John Papa Duke girl so

742
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because my two favorites are Papa

743
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Duke tables alright

744
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I thought I thought it was appropriate to engage

745
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
in a little pinball talks there you go heck yeah

746
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
but we have Ghostbusters and I've been playing the

747
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
crap out of it for me I'm still waiting for

748
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
pin bot to hit virtual console because I love the

749
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
NES version of pin bot even though I know a lot of people hate it

750
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I loved it they're actually we were

751
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
watching some pinball game reviews

752
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
like for NES versions the version

753
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
of the getaway that came out for

754
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
for one of the home

755
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
consoles it was pretty terra bad

756
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think getaway was

757
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the NES I think they did that

758
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
one after pin bot because I know there was a

759
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
getaway that came out pretty pretty not good

760
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
yeah Bobby Black Wolf

761
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
is a little bit inspired

762
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
perhaps saying I still really really need to finally

763
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
clean out the room we're turning into our

764
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
arcade so I can finally start down the path

765
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
of Dark Sakura and Dan and collect

766
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
pinball tables absolutely

767
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
well you need to come over before

768
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
we get rid of brighter pin bot 2.0

769
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
yeah I want to come play do you know what that is

770
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
not the 2.0 I played your

771
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
you had a regular brighter pin bot at one point

772
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
oh wow so basically

773
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
brighter pin bot 2.0 has an extra board added

774
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
to it that has new rule sets

775
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and it's linked to usually a color

776
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
DMD that has

777
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
different game modes and different things

778
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and a new soundtrack like a digital soundtrack

779
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
it's pretty freaking amazing

780
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
so

781
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
after the show everybody

782
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
look on YouTube

783
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and find video of a brighter

784
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
pin bot 2.0 just soundtrack

785
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
the soundtrack makes me think of

786
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
old Space Mountain

787
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and by the way Dick Dale died

788
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I heard, sad

789
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
alright, Loki how was your gaming week

790
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
what did you play? I didn't play a whole lot because

791
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
like I said I was working in Unity trying to get myself

792
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
back into the swing of working

793
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
in Unity again

794
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
so I finished my

795
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
code along tutorial

796
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
thing it was like some tank combat game

797
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
so that's done

798
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm not really doing anything that I'm definitely not

799
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
publishing that because that's just

800
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
there's nothing different than what they

801
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
provide it's just kind of following

802
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
along to kind of get into the groove

803
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
of working in Unity

804
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and also it kind of showed me a little bit

805
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
of the audio mixer which is something that they added

806
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
a while ago but since I haven't used

807
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
it before I didn't really

808
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
know what it did so that was kind of cool

809
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
to learn that a little bit

810
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and then let's

811
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
see I played a little bit of Dance Dance Revolution

812
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Extreme I saw your

813
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
live stream yeah a little bit

814
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
it was funny because I haven't noticed this

815
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
because I have a legit

816
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
extreme but I'm running a mod

817
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
disc right now because I was playing

818
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
other mixes but I don't know

819
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
if it's the drive or the disc I

820
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
burned but it doesn't run very well

821
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
on the other mixes so

822
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I put it back to extreme because I just didn't

823
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
want to mess with that crap anymore

824
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
so I have extreme and I'm running mods

825
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
in it but I didn't realize that the extreme

826
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
version that's on that mod disc

827
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
is a modded extreme

828
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
so it's got extra modifiers on there

829
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
like the 0.5 speed

830
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
wave and there's some

831
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
other thing it was the stuff that was in like

832
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
extreme

833
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
it's not extreme plus because I think

834
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
extreme plus is the one with the marvelous

835
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the marvelous ratings

836
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
there's one it's

837
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
what the hell

838
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
is it called Megamix it's like

839
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Megamix but Megamix also had one

840
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
that I can actually adjust the clock speed

841
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
of the game so that the songs that speed up or slow

842
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
down so it's like

843
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
oh that's like a Beat Saber type of thing

844
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
so it's Megamix mods so it's got some of those

845
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
in there but

846
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I didn't realize it was in there until I

847
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
was playing it I was like wait a second 0.5

848
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
speed that's not normally there like oh

849
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
crap this is a modded one so

850
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I tried that in

851
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Max 300 and nope

852
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
cannot play it like that it's

853
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it doesn't work well for me so

854
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I was

855
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
just playing other stuff though so I have been going through the

856
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
mods some more because I don't

857
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
remember like some of these

858
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and I also have to remove some of the ones I have duplicates

859
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
on there or just they're broken like I have

860
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
a dynamite ray of one that I think I

861
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
made maybe that's off by

862
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
like at least a whole

863
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
measure so that kind of sucks

864
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and then I

865
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
played

866
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Pokemon Go a little bit

867
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I didn't play too much on PC

868
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I played

869
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
a little bit of this game called

870
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Jelly Mario which is

871
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
a weird

872
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
web game you can play so it's

873
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Jelly Mar

874
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
.io and

875
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
go check it out it's free

876
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and you basically have to

877
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
traverse Mario and

878
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
he's just this big jelly thing and everything in

879
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the world is very

880
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
jelly like and it's

881
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
very hard especially when you get to the

882
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
castle because you have to dodge

883
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
all the fire bars and

884
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
sometimes you just can't get the

885
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
momentum right to be able to pass

886
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
through that so let me play that on stream on Tuesday

887
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
because I'm planning on streaming

888
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
on PC on Tuesday either

889
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
maybe Jelly Mario and

890
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Saints Row 2 but I wanted to do

891
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Saints Row 2 because I love Saints Row 2

892
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and it's a great game and I watched some other guy

893
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that I follow call me Kevin

894
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
play it and it looked hilarious I'm like

895
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I remember how hilarious that game was I want to play that

896
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
so we'll be doing that

897
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and I'm going to try to stream

898
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
more DDR during the week

899
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I wanted to stream more actually

900
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
earlier in the week but I was fighting with

901
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
stupid OBS

902
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
because it decided that oh hey you don't have permissions

903
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
to run this anymore for no reason

904
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
so I had to

905
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
download it again and it finally worked but it took me

906
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
30 minutes to figure that out

907
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
but yeah I need to

908
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
get back into the swing of playing DDR every day

909
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
instead of just like once or twice a week

910
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
alright that's it

911
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
my giveaway probably a little more scaled

912
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
back than I'm used to I don't want to talk a lot

913
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
about this yet until I've really truly

914
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
made it a habit but I'm trying to

915
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
change my fitness journey and that all

916
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
started this week so I'll leave it at that for now

917
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
until I actually stick with it

918
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
because I don't want to be that person that's like you know two days

919
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
into it like I'm making these greats and then

920
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I fall off the wagon so check

921
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
in with me in a few weeks but

922
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
meanwhile so that's been cutting into my time

923
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
a little bit but meanwhile I'm still

924
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
playing the good old MMOs that I have

925
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
been sticking by like World of Warcraft

926
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
which is funny because I don't

927
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you know when I used to play

928
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and was super into wow I would do

929
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
raiding and I would do all this stuff I've been playing

930
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
kind of by myself but one thing I've

931
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
kind of noticed about World of Warcraft that's kind of

932
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
grown on me is that there's so much more you can do by yourself

933
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
like I've geared my character up to

934
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I hit the point where my resto

935
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
shaman is now out geared my

936
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
warlock that I was running for a while

937
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and my shaman

938
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
whose named Porkchop by the way

939
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
in memoriam of the

940
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
very first queen to ever be booted from

941
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
RuPaul's Drag Race

942
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
so Porkchop is

943
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
level 300 and plus I just love

944
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
a panda shaman named Porkchop

945
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
oh she's still around I haven't like

946
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I don't think I've deleted a character

947
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
that was like above level 10

948
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
if I play though I'll probably move my

949
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
dragon huntie

950
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I mean honestly

951
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
demon huntie the only thing that matters about

952
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Horde and Alliance or I'm sorry the only

953
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
thing that matters to play with other people is Horde and

954
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Alliance like your server like just doesn't

955
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
matter anymore it really doesn't

956
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I want to like play in areas

957
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
yeah I know but you get moved over to other servers now

958
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
like the whole thing like if you and I

959
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
party you'll suddenly be on my server

960
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
shit yeah yeah no and like

961
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
servers don't even fucking matter anymore it's great

962
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
like I wish Final Fantasy 14 would steal that

963
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
technology but anyway yeah

964
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I do a lot of world quests

965
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and I just do a lot of like queuing up by myself and things

966
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
like that and that's just kind of like my mind numbing

967
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
thing to do but I have played other games

968
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
too and one I haven't talked about on the show yet even

969
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
though I started it last week and I played

970
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
a little more this week so I'm

971
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
continuing my PlayStation VR adventures

972
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and catching up on my backlog on PlayStation

973
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
VR I started playing Skyrim

974
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
VR so I've been playing that a little bit

975
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
so that's a game that you've actually played that I have yet

976
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
in the play yet oh right high five

977
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
okay so

978
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
well here's the thing once I found out

979
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
you don't have to actually use the

980
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
move controllers because I was like

981
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
that sounds like a ridiculous and like look don't get me

982
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
wrong like move plus VR

983
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
is great for like Beat Saber

984
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
this print

985
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
vector I was talking about last week

986
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I did download that radial G game

987
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
as well I played that a little bit that actually doesn't

988
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
use the move so I don't know why I brought that up just then but I did

989
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
so

990
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
so but I'm like I don't want to play Skyrim

991
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
with a freaking move controller it's like this is too

992
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
much I don't need to this is not how you play

993
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Skyrim

994
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you don't need to do it that way right so

995
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I just want to like controller

996
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
but just instead of my TV VR

997
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
because the Skyrim world

998
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
is gorgeous it always was even

999
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
from the very first version of the game

1000
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
so I wanted to see what that looked like in VR so

1001
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm playing just with

1002
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the plain old controller and I'm

1003
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
playing in VR and it is

1004
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
it's a very good looking game like I found myself

1005
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
doing the same thing I think a lot of us did

1006
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
when we first played Skyrim I was stopping

1007
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
to stare at the flowers because I'm like they're so

1008
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
purple and they're 3D and they're

1009
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
cute so here's the interesting thing about

1010
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
VR because obviously VR brings

1011
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
all these you know

1012
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
concerns about is somebody

1013
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
going to get motion sick and things like that

1014
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
so what they do

1015
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
they actually have all sorts of ways

1016
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
you can control it but

1017
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
you can turn by looking

1018
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and move in those directions but

1019
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
what you do is that the right stick

1020
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
instead of being a full pivot to

1021
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
look around and move instead it like

1022
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
turns you automatically like maybe 30

1023
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
degrees one direction so like if you tap

1024
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
left on the right stick it just turns you

1025
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
30 degrees one direction and I think

1026
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
now I believe you can change it and

1027
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
make it a full rotation

1028
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
but then that means you're rotating it's going to be different from

1029
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
where you're looking and that's what makes people sick so that's

1030
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
not the default but they if you want

1031
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to play the throw up ride you can I guess

1032
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
but I'm getting

1033
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
kind of used to the whole being able to move

1034
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
on the right stick and like change

1035
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
my perspective and it actually kind of

1036
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
works and I dig it it's

1037
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you know the way you actually target things

1038
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
then is to look so let's say like I've been playing

1039
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
a mage and let's say I zap a wolf

1040
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
which you know as you're walking down from that first

1041
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
cave you run into a couple wolves so I zapped

1042
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
a wolf with lightning and then

1043
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
to loot the corpse you have to kind of like look at

1044
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
the wolf so that your little crosshair

1045
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
goes on it and then you can loot it so it's

1046
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That sounds annoying as fuck

1047
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm into it

1048
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I don't know if I could play the entire

1049
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
20 hour experience this way it's a

1050
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
lot but like

1051
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
20 hours or whatever

1052
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
How long does it take to do the main story?

1053
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Main story only

1054
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't know I've never finished

1055
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Let's be clear I meant main story only

1056
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Have I ever finished the main story?

1057
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Which main story?

1058
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Like just the main quest that gets you

1059
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
to the game's ending

1060
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
so to speak

1061
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
There is a main questline and it's separated from side quest

1062
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
when you're looking at your journal there's very clearly a main questline

1063
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
The Alduin main questline

1064
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
or the main questline with the two

1065
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
factions

1066
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I think the Alduin

1067
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
is considered because the factions

1068
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
can't you do both technically?

1069
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I think

1070
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
My husband Alan is the expert on that

1071
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
because he has played Skyrim

1072
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
every single

1073
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
every single

1074
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
minus DLC he didn't do all the DLC

1075
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but every single quest

1076
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
except for the ones that generate

1077
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
because there's like the generating quests

1078
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh god those never end

1079
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
but I'm still pretty impressed at that

1080
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
type of achievement

1081
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's interesting and I like watching

1082
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
different scenes so they do some things

1083
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
different so that very first opening scene

1084
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
where you're in the cart and then you watch that

1085
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
guy get killed by the executioner and the dragon

1086
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
shows up they do it a little differently

1087
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
because again they don't want to

1088
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
move you without you

1089
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
having some control over it so what

1090
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
happens is that it kind of just quickly fades out

1091
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
fades in to these different perspectives

1092
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
so like you'll be standing there and it

1093
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
fade out fade in you're looking up at the

1094
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
sky and you see the dragon land fade out

1095
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
fade in you're looking somewhere else

1096
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and I was kind of like wait a minute I don't remember it

1097
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
being that way in the regular game and then I thought in my head

1098
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
oh they're doing that because they don't want to

1099
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
make somebody sick from motion that

1100
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
they aren't controlling so they can't

1101
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
deliver that the same way that you could in

1102
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
a traditional monitor so it's kind of interesting

1103
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
like those subtle little differences but

1104
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
they didn't like take away anything or whatever

1105
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
in fact I think it's good that they didn't just

1106
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
slap Skyrim in VR and say play

1107
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
they had to think of some of these things I thought was

1108
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
very interesting so

1109
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
um let's see

1110
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
going into chat again at

1111
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
live excuse me at twitch tv

1112
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
slash vog network uh Bobby says

1113
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I stopped with the move controllers pretty quickly

1114
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
in Skyrim VR but that's how you play

1115
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Twilight Princess right? Yes

1116
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
but there is also a difference is that

1117
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Twilight Princess was designed from

1118
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the ground up for that whereas

1119
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Skyrim they kind of had to shoehorn the

1120
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
move thing back into it like I'm sure

1121
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
it's a fine experience

1122
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
it's just not what I want to play

1123
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
because I don't associate Skyrim with that

1124
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
whereas Twilight Princess

1125
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
for me quintessentially

1126
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
a Switch game yes I know

1127
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
it was originally developed for Wii U but we all

1128
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
know that they put a lot of thought into

1129
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the Switch instead on that and that

1130
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
you know it was going to use those types of controls

1131
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
you know at some point

1132
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
early-ish mid-development or whatever

1133
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
they made a conscious choice to

1134
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
have a lot of Switch functionality in there as well

1135
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
so anyway

1136
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
let's see

1137
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
oh I'm sorry I was

1138
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
why was I thinking that you're right they said

1139
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Twilight Princess and I immediately went to

1140
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
um

1141
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
my mind immediately went to the new one Breath of the Wild

1142
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
my bad

1143
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
so Twilight Princess on Wii well again

1144
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I still think the same argument applies

1145
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
it was designed with the Wii in mind even though

1146
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
sure it was also a game it was like the exact same

1147
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
thing actually so maybe that's why my

1148
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
brain kind of confused the two for a minute

1149
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
anyway um

1150
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Bobby says they also fade

1151
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
in the edges of your vision when you

1152
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
move which also helps decrease

1153
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
motion sickness it does not eliminate

1154
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
motion sickness for people who are extremely

1155
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
prone I noticed that too I noticed

1156
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the edges narrowed in really quickly

1157
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
when you did that and I felt

1158
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I didn't haze

1159
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the game for that because I'm like okay there's very much a reason

1160
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
they're doing this like it's very

1161
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
obvious like because when you look around you

1162
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
have freedom so like it's not a system

1163
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
this is a conscious decision I would hope that

1164
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I could turn that off because like I

1165
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
don't have a problem with motion sickness I played

1166
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Minecraft on

1167
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
um the Oculus

1168
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
uh

1169
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Gear VR thing and

1170
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I used you know the controller

1171
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
like you know you shouldn't really

1172
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
this is not necessarily

1173
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
recommended to use the controller for this and

1174
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I was like nah this is cool I can't speak

1175
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
to that specifically but I can

1176
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
say there is a pretty extensive VR

1177
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
customization menu and it wouldn't surprise

1178
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
me if that was something you could turn on and off

1179
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
but you know I

1180
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
think it's smart that it uses

1181
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
the safest settings by default

1182
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
yeah if that makes sense so

1183
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
anyway um I'm talking

1184
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
a lot about a game that originally came

1185
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
out many years ago so let's

1186
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
move on I think that's it for our gaming

1187
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
weeks uh I think it's time we get into some

1188
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
gaming news I don't have a lot of housekeeping

1189
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
because I don't know of any shows off

1190
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Memorial Day but that's way

1191
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
the day before Memorial Day will be our next

1192
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
show off because I won't be here so I'm out of town so

1193
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
we won't have a show that weekend so enjoy your

1194
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
three day Memorial weekend I'm in Chicago that

1195
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
weekend when is this Memorial

1196
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Day so end of

1197
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
May oh I'll be at DragCon

1198
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
oh okay there you go so

1199
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I'll be doing

1200
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know staycation programming

1201
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
streaming playing games

1202
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
kids kids alright

1203
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
let's get into some gaming news Loki

1204
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
so GDC is right around the corner

1205
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and of course the thought

1206
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
or the tease has been

1207
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
that Google is going to announce some sort of

1208
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
game console or streaming service or

1209
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
both or who knows

1210
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
so of course a little bit more

1211
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
credence to that Google has

1212
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
announced via their Google

1213
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
developers Twitter

1214
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
page that hey guess what

1215
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
id Software is

1216
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
joining them alongside

1217
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
during this whole

1218
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
presentation not only that

1219
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
they've revealed that also Ubisoft

1220
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is going to be

1221
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
partnering with them as well

1222
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
so definitely

1223
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
seems to hint the fact

1224
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
that hey you had this whole test

1225
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
of like you know streaming

1226
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Assassin's Creed

1227
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and now you have them

1228
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
partnering with them and

1229
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
you have other game companies partnering

1230
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
with them that yeah probably

1231
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
there's going to be some sort of announcement at GDC

1232
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I think that's kind of expected

1233
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
at this point but I guess we'll

1234
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
have to wait and find out March 19th

1235
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
at 1230

1236
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
so by this time next week we'll know

1237
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
we'll be able to talk about it more in depth on the show

1238
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but any thoughts I mean you talk about

1239
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
this whole streaming thing so does it seem like

1240
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
maybe Google is going for a

1241
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
streaming console that will stream

1242
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
but not is Google making the Phantom

1243
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
that's what I want

1244
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
if it's going to be

1245
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
exactly like the Assassin's Creed

1246
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
thing was I would see it being built into

1247
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
the Chrome browser

1248
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
that may not be the case

1249
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
for like say

1250
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
you know like Android or something like that

1251
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
maybe they'll have an app to go along with that

1252
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
or something maybe it's going to

1253
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
they're going to put out their own standalone

1254
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
app or like kind of Google

1255
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
TV type thing that's going to have

1256
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
that built into it

1257
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
we'll have to wait and see but

1258
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I think since they were testing the whole browser

1259
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
compatibility with that

1260
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
that that's probably going to be the route at least

1261
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
one of the routes that they're going to go

1262
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
so we'll have to wait and see because I mean think about it

1263
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
most people a lot of people use

1264
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Chrome and you can just

1265
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
hey install Chrome and

1266
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
boom you have access to these games you know if you want

1267
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to pay a subscription or

1268
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
whatever the case may be

1269
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and then you get to play these games

1270
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
on a PC and it doesn't even have to be a high-end

1271
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
PC it can be just one that

1272
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
can run that

1273
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that has somewhat decent specs I think

1274
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and a decent internet connection

1275
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
let me ask this kind of weird

1276
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
question is that

1277
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
we know that Google and for those that

1278
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
are on Twitch my watch is yelling at me to stand

1279
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
so I'm going to stand for a little bit so if it looks weird

1280
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
sorry but

1281
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
let me ask you like

1282
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
because we don't know exactly what this

1283
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
console is going to be doing

1284
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and we would be just

1285
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
theorizing things

1286
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and we could get proven wrong but what I can

1287
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
ask is what

1288
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
would Google need to do

1289
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and I open this up to our chatters and Jamie

1290
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
if you have an opinion as well what would

1291
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Google need to do to convince

1292
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
you to buy another console

1293
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and have another console in your house what

1294
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
could they do knowing what you know about

1295
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Google what could Google do

1296
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
differently that hasn't been done

1297
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
before

1298
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I don't know if there's anything they

1299
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
can do they just have to have good

1300
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
games good exclusive games I'm not going to

1301
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
buy another console to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey

1302
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
or Doom or something

1303
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
like that that's already out on

1304
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
numerous other consoles

1305
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
honestly I don't really

1306
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
see any reason to buy it because I have everything

1307
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
else I already want most of my

1308
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
gaming lately has been on my

1309
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
PC well and to be fair they

1310
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
haven't made the pitch yet so we can say that

1311
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
now but if it's a system what

1312
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
needs to be in that pitch to sway you

1313
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
it's going to take something really

1314
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
huge I mean that's all it is because

1315
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean when Sony came

1316
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
out you know for a first time with a new

1317
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
system they had

1318
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
a lot of good backing they had stuff coming

1319
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
out that people wanted to play although Toshinden

1320
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
doesn't necessarily count but

1321
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
then you know

1322
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
it's really a system is

1323
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
only as good as the games that are on it

1324
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
it's got to have the right

1325
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
games to grab that attention like for example

1326
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
if they had Namco behind

1327
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
them and Namco's like we're going to do

1328
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Klonoa 3 exclusively for Google's

1329
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
platform I'd be like bitch

1330
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
mine

1331
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
well I mean yeah and to that

1332
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
fact I mean remember Game Center and stuff

1333
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
when they were trying to really hype that up on

1334
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
the whole iOS site I mean they

1335
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
had you know it doing

1336
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
or was it Epic Games

1337
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't remember doing the

1338
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
one medieval

1339
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
like first person game that they had on there and

1340
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
that was just kind of it was cool

1341
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
does anyone remember it now? No

1342
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
so like

1343
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I

1344
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
it's just hard like saying oh yeah we have

1345
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
all these games that are popular on other

1346
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
platforms but we're creating a new platform why

1347
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
do I need to go to a new platform to play

1348
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I want to know what

1349
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
you're going to do differently are you how you're

1350
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
going to make this more interesting than these

1351
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
other platforms what are you going to give me that

1352
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
the other platforms can't give me what

1353
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
new like exclusively brand

1354
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
new games are you going to have on this platform

1355
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
that I can't get anywhere else

1356
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
here's my thought and again I don't want to go

1357
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
too far down this path because it's all theorizing

1358
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
anyway but if it's you know

1359
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
being able to play games

1360
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
that are already available what can

1361
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
they do to make you want to do that

1362
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
put out a $40 console

1363
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and I know that sounds ridiculous but

1364
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
you know keep in mind what that little Google

1365
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Chromecast those aren't particularly expensive

1366
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
right what if there's something that incorporates

1367
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
gaming with that and it's like super cheap

1368
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and so it's like hey instead of buying

1369
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
a $300 Xbox why don't you buy

1370
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
this $40 Chromecast I get that

1371
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
if it's that again

1372
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
this is crazy I don't think that they could pull

1373
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
$40 because Chromecast is basically

1374
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
just a receiver your computer your computer

1375
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
is sending the data to Chromecast

1376
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I feel like I did this exact same thing last year

1377
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
what if there's a Microsoft Xbox

1378
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
they have like Google TV boxes

1379
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
aren't that expensive like my box

1380
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
what was it the my box they have

1381
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the Huawei one I have

1382
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
it's um

1383
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
it's like 80 bucks I mean it's not that

1384
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
expensive and but and it

1385
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
does like gaming stuff on it

1386
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
like I can purchase games on there like through

1387
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
the Google Play Store I have you can

1388
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
install the Steam Link app on there

1389
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
you can um

1390
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
you can stream to it just like you can

1391
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
with a

1392
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
you know one of those dongles

1393
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
so assuming that that's

1394
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
powerful enough to run whatever app

1395
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
that they have to be able to stream this stuff

1396
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
then yeah that would work just fine

1397
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
um I don't think

1398
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
you can't obviously be a very

1399
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
expensive console if you're gonna do that but

1400
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
once again I don't know

1401
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
if I need to really purchase another thing

1402
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
because I have smart we're in the land of smart

1403
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
TVs nowadays here's the thing too and my

1404
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
wish list would be that I hope Google takes a good

1405
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
hard look at why Steam Link failed but

1406
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I mean we keep talking about this but I think at the end of the day

1407
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
this is going to be more the streaming and the

1408
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
existing games and all that might be

1409
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
one element of this it might be a way to

1410
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
um buffer the launch library

1411
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
or whatever of Google's games but

1412
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and I think this is very important isn't it

1413
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
out there now like on Twitter or somewhere that

1414
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Jade Raymond is at Google that's

1415
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
because you know she left

1416
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
her last thing when the Star Wars right

1417
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
she was on the Star Wars thing that got cancelled right

1418
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and she disappeared and nobody really

1419
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
kept tabs on where she ended up well it came out

1420
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
this week she's at Google so

1421
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
whatever this is likely

1422
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
involves her and whatever

1423
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
she's working on now so

1424
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I don't think we're just talking about

1425
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
existing games I mean and I don't know

1426
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
she could be a vision person maybe

1427
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
she's not designing a game I don't know we're not

1428
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
gonna know until we hear this one yeah and I hope

1429
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
that's the case because you're gonna need to

1430
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
have exclusive stuff you having all the other

1431
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
games things are good as well

1432
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
but you need to have something that's

1433
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
exclusive to your platform because you can't just

1434
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
say well we have all these other games

1435
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
that the same those consoles have too and you're like

1436
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
well crap I already have that console

1437
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
that has those games or I have a PC that has those

1438
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
games the only thing I see that it's a pretty

1439
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
decent angle that they could go with is like

1440
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
you know what say you

1441
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
don't have one of those consoles say you own

1442
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
a Nintendo Switch and that's all you own you know

1443
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and they can't run these in your PC you know

1444
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
you have a decent PC but it's not

1445
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
a gaming PC and you can't run this stuff

1446
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
well this box will help you be able to

1447
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
play those games that you can't play

1448
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
elsewhere and we can do it pretty cheap

1449
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and then that's you know and

1450
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
hey we'll throw a subscription service in there as well

1451
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
that's how I can see them being

1452
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
successful with it but

1453
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
we'll see I don't know they've tried

1454
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
so many times with doing like exclusive

1455
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
they tried to make like iOS

1456
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
is gonna be like this big gaming

1457
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
centric thing they've had exclusive games coming

1458
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to it and no one gives a shit about

1459
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
that as far as being like oh my god

1460
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
this is gonna replace my gaming consoles

1461
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I think what

1462
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
it is is I think

1463
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
my prediction take it or leave it

1464
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
is I do think Google is about to launch

1465
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
they wanna be the Netflix of games as well

1466
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
so they're gonna launch a competitor to Xbox

1467
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Game Pass essentially I think Google's

1468
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
looking to do that and they're gonna do it through

1469
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
something that probably

1470
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
integrates into your TV pretty easy but

1471
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
maybe something they can also deliver through Android phones

1472
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
although I don't think that will be very great for the gaming experience

1473
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
but we'll see maybe Google

1474
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
will prove me wrong

1475
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
but I think they're going to launch

1476
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
their own type of competitor for that

1477
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and just like Netflix has to create

1478
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
their own originals which

1479
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
hopefully they don't cancel cause that was in the news this

1480
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
week but I digress but just like Netflix

1481
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
makes their own originals like Stranger Things and

1482
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
shows that buff up the service

1483
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think they are creating a few of their own

1484
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
in house type of games to

1485
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
buff up whatever this is

1486
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
but something very interesting

1487
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Google did have a game developer before

1488
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Niantic, Google let him go

1489
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
when that whole alphabet split happened

1490
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
now granted what Niantic develops

1491
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
are not things for the television

1492
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
when Niantic's been developing of course Niantic

1493
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
is the developer of Pokemon Go

1494
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
but at the time Ingress was kind of their bread and butter

1495
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
but it turns out they were also

1496
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
creating this Pokemon Go at the time the split happened

1497
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
so you know

1498
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Niantic's not creating games on the television but

1499
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I think it is interesting to note

1500
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
that Google did have a game developer

1501
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
that they uh

1502
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and one that ended up being a pretty big deal

1503
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
after Pokemon Go that they let out

1504
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
they let walk out the door

1505
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
so they may still have an investment level in it

1506
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I don't know all the finance

1507
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
but I think Nintendo is an investor

1508
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Google probably still has some money in it

1509
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
we'll see

1510
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and off topic a little bit did you get to see the screenshots

1511
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
for the new Harry Potter game

1512
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
um

1513
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
oh yes I did

1514
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I didn't make our show tonight

1515
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
so some screenshots came out for Harry Potter Wizards Unite

1516
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
which is Niantic's next game

1517
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I still don't know what you do in the game

1518
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
they're partnering with

1519
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
going off script for a little bit

1520
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
so they're partnering with the Warner Brothers

1521
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
the Portkey games

1522
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and it really looks like based on the screenshots

1523
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Portkey is helping them with the art assets

1524
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
to give it that Harry Potter look

1525
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
because the game looks pretty nice

1526
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
and it doesn't look anything like Pokemon Go

1527
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
or Ingress for sure

1528
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and basically there's no teams

1529
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
so Harry Potter will not be a team based game

1530
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
it sounds like you will join a house

1531
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
for your character

1532
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
but it's not something you're locked into

1533
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and it's not something where it's like

1534
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Slytherin versus Hufflepuff

1535
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
or whatever

1536
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
it's not going to be like Ingress or Pokemon Go

1537
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
or very team or faction based

1538
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and it seems like it's about collecting what's called

1539
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
foundables

1540
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
there's a lot of talk of things in the Harry Potter lore

1541
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that since I don't follow it as closely

1542
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I didn't get it as much

1543
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
but it sounds like it's kind of like a successor

1544
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
to the ongoing story

1545
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
but not the Cursed Child

1546
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
kind of like in between that

1547
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and something where you're looking for

1548
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
these foundables because there's some sort of

1549
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
war that's brewing in the world where they have to

1550
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
bring all these collectables

1551
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
back and you play some type of

1552
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
magic force

1553
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
and I apologize to the Harry Potter fans

1554
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
which Jamie I think you follow these books more than I do

1555
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
for sure

1556
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
but you should look up the stuff that came out

1557
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
on the game this week because there was very clearly some sort

1558
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
of Niantic press day

1559
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
that the embargo lifted and all these websites

1560
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
did their previews the same day

1561
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
so there's some more info on the game out there right now

1562
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'll take a peek, where my interest has been

1563
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
peaked, aha!

1564
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I think it's great that

1565
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
they're taking a no teams approach because that tells me

1566
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
it's a very different game from the other two

1567
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
right out the gate

1568
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I wonder though if they would have your house based on where you live

1569
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
so if you're in the US you get

1570
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
the Ilvermorny

1571
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
it does not sound like that's

1572
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
the case, it does sound like the

1573
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
four traditional houses come into play

1574
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
because in the story

1575
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
you're going out into the world

1576
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
to collect everything, so you could still

1577
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
be like, yeah I think that's how

1578
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
they wrote it in the story, but never say never

1579
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Dark Soccer and again I am no Harry Potter

1580
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
expert so anything is still possible

1581
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
alright, okay

1582
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
yeah I didn't understand based on the screenshots

1583
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I know that they showed that you can do spells

1584
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
to attack werewolves and crap

1585
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you have to save Harry

1586
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
from being attacked by

1587
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
there was this game I played on

1588
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
iOS, it's probably on Android too

1589
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I think it was called Magica or something

1590
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I don't know if that was the name, but I remember

1591
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
it was a game where you would trace

1592
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
it was also a real world based

1593
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
game and you would draw spells to

1594
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
cast them in battle and stuff

1595
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and it seems like that is being included

1596
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I don't know, we'll see, I mean hey it's free

1597
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
you can try it out

1598
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
let's see, see a Tiberian chat

1599
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
says clearly developed by a Hufflepuff

1600
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
diplomatic looking for things

1601
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
not about Flashy showing off

1602
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
interesting

1603
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
so, well we'll see

1604
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
of course I'm going to try the game when it

1605
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
comes out, I have played really

1606
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
great AR real world

1607
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
games and I have played trash

1608
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
AR real world games, I played Garfield

1609
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Go for like a minute

1610
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I played Garfield Go for a couple minutes as well

1611
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I played that Draconius Go

1612
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
that was like the rip off, actually the

1613
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Draconius thing brought some different ideas to the table

1614
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
that game wasn't trash, it just

1615
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
was kind of clunky

1616
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you know what my sister plays a lot

1617
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
actually is that Jurassic parking

1618
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
she's like really into that

1619
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that wasn't bad, I didn't dislike

1620
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
it, it was just a little, I don't know

1621
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I don't like it when the stuff is randomly

1622
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
generated, I think part of what's always

1623
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
drawn me to my Niantic games

1624
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
is that they are based on real world things

1625
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I would have never known were there if I

1626
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
hadn't bothered to look

1627
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you know, in the early days when I first started

1628
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
playing Ingress, I was like

1629
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I never had any idea that these things

1630
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
were in my neighborhood and I think that's exactly

1631
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
what Niantic was trying to do with that game

1632
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
is get you out into your

1633
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
neighborhood and know that these things were there

1634
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
now granted, it's all user based

1635
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
so, for example

1636
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
they call the thing down the street, I want to say what they

1637
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
call it, but you know what they call that in the game

1638
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and I don't think it is what they call it

1639
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
it's certainly not, so

1640
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I don't think everything is necessarily educational

1641
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
so, it's yeah

1642
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
taking liberties with

1643
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm surprised that the other thing

1644
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
that's at the other park

1645
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
is not something because

1646
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
that's more significant than

1647
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
a box in the ground

1648
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
it has been tried to be submitted

1649
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
multiple times because I keep seeing it

1650
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
and are you talking about a thing

1651
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
that looks like a, and I'm sorry we're having to be cryptic

1652
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I have a right to my privacy

1653
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I don't even know what the hell it is

1654
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
does it look like an electrical thing?

1655
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
yes

1656
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
that has tried to be submitted at least three times

1657
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
because I keep seeing it in the freaking OPR

1658
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and I can tell you without question

1659
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
who's doing it and why they want it

1660
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
but it's

1661
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
look, the playground's fine

1662
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
gazebos are fine, that ain't fine

1663
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
there's hazardous

1664
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
don't go here all around it

1665
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
that can't be a point of interest

1666
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
anyway, Bobby Blackwolf points out

1667
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
what's happening now around here is I'm seeing

1668
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
pokestops for things that no longer exist

1669
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
yeah, that happens too

1670
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I mean, the game's been out a while

1671
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
you could report them invalid in Ingress

1672
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I don't know if you could do that natively in Pokemon Go though

1673
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
no, because I had to do that

1674
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
there was some murals and stuff

1675
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
that were near my house

1676
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that there's no mural there anymore

1677
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I was kind of wondering

1678
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
that inside, but then you look at the photo

1679
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and it's outside and it's clearly not there anymore

1680
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
alright, well I want to move on

1681
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I do want to go to the next story we have here

1682
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
which is about

1683
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
the Valve Store and the Steam Store

1684
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and a potential kind of

1685
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
privacy sort of issue

1686
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
that may have happened with the Epic Store

1687
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
here's the deal

1688
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Valve is out there implying that

1689
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Epic's launcher has copied

1690
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
user data from Steam

1691
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and now they're going to launch an investigation

1692
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
whatever that means

1693
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
apparently what happened is that Epic

1694
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
did confirm this

1695
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
was taking their launcher and it made an encrypted

1696
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
local copy of your

1697
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
local config.vdf

1698
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Steam file, because what it was

1699
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
doing is that when you would say yes

1700
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I want to import my Steam friends

1701
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
into the Epic Store

1702
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
game, it's using that

1703
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
file to do it, but Epic is saying

1704
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
in a quote they said

1705
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
information from

1706
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
this file is only sent to Epic if you

1707
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
choose to import your Steam friends

1708
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and then only hashed IDs

1709
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
of your friends are sent and no

1710
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
other information from the file

1711
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and that's only

1712
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
accessing that information after you choose

1713
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
to import Steam friends, but of course

1714
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Valve, not happy about it

1715
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
in a statement to bleep the computer

1716
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
it's been there forever though, I mean like

1717
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
it's been like that for months

1718
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
in a statement to bleeping computer

1719
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Valve said, we are looking into

1720
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
what information the Epic launcher collects

1721
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
from Steam, the Steam client locally

1722
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
saves data such as the list of games you own

1723
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
your friends list and saved login tokens

1724
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
similar to information stored

1725
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
in web browser cookies, which makes sense

1726
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
if you have 500 games in your library you don't want

1727
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Steam loading that every time

1728
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
But isn't that the same as like if I

1729
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
downloaded the Firefox

1730
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
web browser and it wants to import my data

1731
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and cookies and stuff like that, I mean that's basic

1732
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah, it's basically the same thing, you're right

1733
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And why are we throwing a fit about this?

1734
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I think they're just, whatever

1735
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You think they're making an issue just to make an issue?

1736
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I think they're making an issue just to make an issue

1737
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And maybe that's

1738
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
part of it, I don't know

1739
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Kaijuto in chat over

1740
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
at twitch.tv slash vog network though says

1741
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Epic fail

1742
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I don't know, again, I don't know if this is any different

1743
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
from what other places are doing, but maybe they

1744
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
weren't super transparent in what

1745
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
they were doing, but it would make sense

1746
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
that if you want this

1747
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
launcher, this store

1748
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
to access your Steam's

1749
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
friends list, then you are giving it some

1750
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
sort of permission to access Steam

1751
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Right? I mean that would be implied, right?

1752
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
It just doesn't just magically know

1753
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And I don't, I did do the

1754
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
import, because whatever

1755
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I did it in GOG too, because GOG

1756
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
used to have that thing, I think they sunsetted it

1757
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
But they used to have that thing where like if you own

1758
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
a game on Steam, you'd like get a copy

1759
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
of it on GOG, but it was limited to

1760
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
certain games only, but still there were a few that

1761
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
came over, so like I let my GOG

1762
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
access my Steam, where

1763
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
was the stink about that?

1764
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I don't remember that

1765
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's because it's convenient now, because everyone's

1766
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
upset about privacy

1767
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and people breaching privacy

1768
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
agreements and stuff like that

1769
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Hey look it, they're bad

1770
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Bobby wants to point out the difference, Bobby

1771
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
sometimes understands the tech stuff

1772
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
better than I do, that's for sure, so he

1773
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
explains what the difference is

1774
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Epic is preemptively getting this

1775
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
data, and then asking

1776
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
if you want to import it

1777
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Firefox doesn't go after the data

1778
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
until you tell it to, that's the

1779
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
problem, is that Epic is preemptively grabbing

1780
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
that file going, I'm just gonna

1781
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
put this right back over here

1782
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
for when this user says they want to

1783
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
import their Steam friends, because who wouldn't want to do that

1784
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Fine, I mean I guess they could just

1785
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
easily not

1786
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
do that, I mean that seems like a very easy fix

1787
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

1788
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Are they even saying that Epic has

1789
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
already fixed it? I'm trying to see if in this

1790
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
story they mention that Epic already fixed

1791
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
it, but this might have been too

1792
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
no, I haven't

1793
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
seen any, because this story was just from

1794
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
yesterday on the 16th, so I haven't seen anything

1795
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
yet, but I imagine that's something

1796
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
that Epic's probably gonna do would be the easy

1797
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
fix, would be to just stop grabbing that file

1798
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
until you say yes

1799
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
import my Steam friends

1800
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Anyway

1801
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Let's move on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1802
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
This one actually is going

1803
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
to be a little bit of cultural

1804
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
explanation

1805
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
is needed behind it, but

1806
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
there's a game that was coming

1807
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
out, it's part of the Yakuza

1808
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
series in Japan

1809
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
that's called

1810
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yakuza slash Ryugagotoku

1811
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
the game's called Judge Eyes

1812
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and actually it was going to be coming out

1813
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
in the US under the name Judgment

1814
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
it was developed by Sega, well they took

1815
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
it down off of their website because the

1816
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
actor who plays a crime boss

1817
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
in the game, the real life

1818
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
actor, Pierre Taki

1819
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
was

1820
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
caught for possession

1821
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and use of cocaine

1822
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
and

1823
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
for a scandal

1824
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
like that, drug use scandals are

1825
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
pretty much, they're almost

1826
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
career ending, it's what

1827
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
happens is that instead of here where it

1828
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
could drive sales of something

1829
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
you know, or people want to know more

1830
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
about it and the person's out in the limelight

1831
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
and getting Lindsay Lohan style fame

1832
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
there, people are

1833
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
pretty much erased from the public eye

1834
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
yeah I know, I was like, over here it's like

1835
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
what, Lindsay Lohan's doing cocaine?

1836
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
what a shock, you know

1837
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I'd be more surprised if she wasn't

1838
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
doing cocaine

1839
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
well in Japan you

1840
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
sort of are publicly erased

1841
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
so in that case

1842
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
the game Judge Eyes

1843
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
has been pulled off of Sega's site, all their

1844
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
marketing, social media has been

1845
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
completely removed, they've halted

1846
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
sales of the game digitally, they've

1847
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
pulled back their shipping orders

1848
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
for the game, they are taking a big

1849
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
hit to take this off the market

1850
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
and then of course whether or not it's going to have

1851
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
US release still

1852
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
remains to be seen

1853
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I mean it did have, for the main character

1854
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
it was actually handled

1855
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
acted by and voiced by

1856
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Kimura Takaya who's

1857
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
a member of SMAP

1858
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
so I mean we're talking big names

1859
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and if anyone

1860
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
might not know

1861
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Pierre Taki from his own

1862
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
acting, he's also

1863
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
part of a synth pop duo called Denki Groove

1864
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
which I know that some people

1865
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
listen to some of the Japanese

1866
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
synth pop so

1867
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I mean the game looked to be

1868
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
pretty interesting, I had

1869
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
even heard about it before

1870
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
all this went down, but I'm really not

1871
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
surprised that for

1872
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
how it's going down in Japan that this is happening

1873
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
this way, you know other situations

1874
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
like this

1875
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
is that there's

1876
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
been other actors

1877
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
there was, I'm trying to see

1878
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Taki was also the voice of

1879
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Olaf

1880
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
yeah and I was about to say because Sia Tabiri in chat says

1881
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
didn't something similar happen to one of the voice actors from Kingdom Hearts 3

1882
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
yes it's actually the same story

1883
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
but it's only going to affect the Japanese release

1884
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
of the game because the voice acting is not

1885
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
the Japanese voice acting is not

1886
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
in the US release

1887
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
it's another thing too is that anyone who does work

1888
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
for a company is seen

1889
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
almost directly

1890
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
as a representative

1891
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
of the company and so

1892
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
they distance themselves from it

1893
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
which basically is where that

1894
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
public erasure comes from

1895
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
is to protect

1896
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
the reputation of the company

1897
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
oh it's very much a culture thing, I mean not in Japan

1898
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
but in some other countries

1899
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
you can get put to death

1900
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
drug smuggling is like a

1901
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
death penalty charge, didn't you all watch Broke Down

1902
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Palace?

1903
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
if an American were to go to Japan

1904
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
and have pot on them

1905
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
they would be

1906
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
deported immediately

1907
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
and also usually banned from returning

1908
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
to the country

1909
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
which again, the marijuana

1910
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
perspective is changing significantly

1911
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
in this country, especially where we live

1912
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
we're in California, there's a pot store not that far

1913
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
from here and I drive by every day on my way home

1914
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
from work

1915
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
there was a delay in the release of some Studio Ghibli

1916
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
stuff because

1917
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
the musician Asuka who did

1918
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
some vocals for a music video

1919
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
was arrested for drug possession

1920
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
and another anime, Kill Me Baby

1921
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
were pulled from public circulation

1922
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
because the voice actress

1923
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Takabei had cocaine

1924
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
speaking of the international

1925
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
thing though, I know we're joking about

1926
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Lindsay Lohan and I have no idea what her

1927
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
drug status is

1928
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
but does

1929
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
it seem to only affect people

1930
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
and celebrities from that country

1931
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
because isn't there still a lot of

1932
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
you know, like American pop culture

1933
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
stuff that makes its way into Japan

1934
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
and do they still hold

1935
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
the American celebrities to that same standard

1936
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
because I don't think they do

1937
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I don't think so, I mean I don't know

1938
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Well that's kind of messed up

1939
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Either that or it's just only

1940
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I don't think it matters so much

1941
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
if it's a reflection on

1942
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
an American arm of the company

1943
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
because

1944
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I guess they expect that shit from us anyway

1945
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I don't know

1946
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Stupid Americans and the cocaine

1947
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But I mean, in the long

1948
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
run it's just like

1949
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I don't know

1950
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah

1951
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It's a completely different

1952
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's a cultural difference and we have to be respectful

1953
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
of that but at the same time, you know

1954
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
we are a video game show, it's interesting to talk about how this

1955
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
wow, I mean because of this culture

1956
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
this game that was supposed to come out is being delayed

1957
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
not to make it better

1958
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Big marketing too

1959
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
The site for this, just looking at how it was built

1960
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Good lord

1961
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
There was some work that went into that

1962
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And we're talking about Instagram line

1963
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah

1964
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You know, some of the big marketing outlets

1965
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And honestly enough, there is a part of me

1966
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
that wishes we had that same sort of

1967
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
idea here

1968
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Because then

1969
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
there wouldn't be such a big

1970
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I'm going to do this terrible thing

1971
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
because it's going to bring attention to me

1972
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
How far down the rabbit hole

1973
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
do I want to go?

1974
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
But here's why they don't

1975
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Because we also have a problem in this country

1976
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
about it being equal

1977
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
based on what you look like

1978
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
if you know what I mean, right?

1979
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Anyway, I got to watch

1980
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Far Down the Rabbit Hole, but I think

1981
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
that is an issue that we have to

1982
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
deal with here

1983
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
that is why we don't do that

1984
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I'm saying

1985
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I think that

1986
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
public and business

1987
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
ostracization

1988
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
for people who are like that

1989
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
until there's been a period of recovery

1990
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
is a good idea

1991
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
so that they aren't having

1992
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
this big public spectacle meltdown and setting

1993
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
an example for other people

1994
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Well, isn't it also sort of the American way that we protest?

1995
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I mean, that's kind of what happens

1996
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
That's different. I think that's entirely different

1997
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
They've been having a protest

1998
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
recently in Japan for LGBT rights

1999
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
for a right to marry

2000
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
So, just saying

2001
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Protesting happens there, too

2002
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Burn some bras

2003
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
for equal marriage

2004
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I don't know

2005
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
What I'm saying is that

2006
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
this is a different thing than a protest

2007
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
This is

2008
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
keeping a company

2009
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
reputation

2010
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
clean, and distancing

2011
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
themselves from something like that

2012
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
instead of using it as a marketing tool

2013
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Some other comments in our chat

2014
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
over at twitch.tv

2015
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out

2016
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
you have to get special waivers to take prescription

2017
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Adderall in Japan

2018
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Can't buy ibuprofen over the counter

2019
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh, really?

2020
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But you can get toothpaste that rebuilds the

2021
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
enamel on your teeth, and they don't sell it here

2022
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But here, you can't get Tylenol 3

2023
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
whereas you can go into Canada

2024
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
and you can't

2025
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Dear Canadian friends

2026
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Anyway

2027
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I hear also in Valve you can't get Tylenol 3

2028
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
either

2029
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Fuck off

2030
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

2031
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
they accept that pot is something that

2032
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Westerners do, they do not

2033
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
accept that pot is something that Japanese

2034
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
do

2035
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Interesting way of putting it, and that's probably

2036
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
a very succinct way of saying it

2037
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
SHA100Matt says, I think Russell Brand

2038
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
got deported from Japan

2039
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
for something like this. Whatever happened to that guy?

2040
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I know someone first hand

2041
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
who I used to work with that got deported, and he's half

2042
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Japanese

2043
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I think his was like a limitation

2044
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
that after like six years

2045
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
he could return for family visits

2046
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But still, that's wowie

2047
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
He got deported for pot

2048
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Alright

2049
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Taking drugs into other countries is just

2050
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
generally not a good idea

2051
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
unless you have a prescription

2052
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
and you have all those forms

2053
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
that was brought up previously

2054
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
which is probably best you don't bring drugs

2055
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Besides, if you're high on drugs, then all those genitals

2056
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
become unblurred, and they can't have that

2057
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
What?

2058
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
For porn

2059
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Oh, Jesus Christ

2060
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Remember Final Fuck X

2061
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I'm like, there's a joke

2062
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
you tried to tell that I'm just

2063
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
not getting

2064
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Alright, anyway

2065
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Please can we move on

2066
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Next story

2067
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Let's move on. Let's talk about that number three

2068
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
in Valve, shall we?

2069
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Well, Valve is not going to be putting out

2070
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
a sequel for Left 4 Dead anytime soon

2071
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
but that doesn't mean that you can't live without

2072
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Left 4 Dead, because it's going to be back

2073
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Left 4 Dead is coming back

2074
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
as Back 4 Blood

2075
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It is a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead

2076
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
that is going to be coming out

2077
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
by Turtle Rock and Warner Brothers

2078
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and

2079
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
it is basically

2080
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
very similar to

2081
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Left 4 Dead

2082
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
They don't really have many details about it yet

2083
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
not even any pictures, but

2084
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm sure it'll be something we'll be hearing about very soon

2085
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
maybe E3 or GDC

2086
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
So, I'm looking forward to that

2087
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
because Left 4 Dead was a pretty awesome game

2088
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Too bad we never got a third one

2089
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But here you go!

2090
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Well, now we get something that's similar

2091
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Isn't that interesting when that happens

2092
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
when the publisher

2093
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
doesn't want to make the next game

2094
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
so the team is just like, alright, we'll just

2095
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
go make our own studio and make the game

2096
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
we want to make. Interesting

2097
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It's been a few years

2098
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
since Left 4 Dead 2, though, so it'll be interesting

2099
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
to see what kind of changes

2100
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
they put in the game

2101
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
new engine, certainly

2102
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
some more social elements, who knows

2103
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
We'll see

2104
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Alright, especially because

2105
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Left 4 Dead was one of those first

2106
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
horde mode type of games that ever existed

2107
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
and now there's been a ton of hordes

2108
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Like a purely co-op

2109
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
type of game

2110
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Now we've had Gears of War, Mass Effect multiplayer

2111
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Horde mode was kind of like

2112
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
what we had for a while instead of Battle Royale

2113
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
So it'll be really interesting to see

2114
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
what they

2115
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
now have learned in these years

2116
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
that that genre was really

2117
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
in the spotlight

2118
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
That's something I'm trying to shoehorn

2119
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Battle Royale in there

2120
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Shehulk in chat says, yes, big fun

2121
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Left 4 Dead 3

2122
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Yeah, no, people really

2123
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I know Alan was a big fan of Left 4 Dead games too

2124
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
A little scary for me, but I might try it again

2125
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I might try it again. My tastes in gaming

2126
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
have evolved a little bit

2127
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
and you can make it even worse

2128
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
How so? Like make it scarier?

2129
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Or can it make it cute?

2130
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I was going to say rainbows and puppies

2131
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
and kittens

2132
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah, I saw some pretty weird stuff

2133
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Okay, that would be alright. If a kitten

2134
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
jumps up and surprises me, I'm okay with that

2135
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But it's a mean kitten

2136
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
No, I don't like mean kittens

2137
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's Goose

2138
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Did you see it, by the way?

2139
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
See what? Captain Marvel

2140
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Then I'm not going to spoil

2141
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'll never get to the movies

2142
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
No, I'm going to take you to see it

2143
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
One day this week, we're going to go

2144
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
You are going to enjoy

2145
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Free movie, awesome

2146
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It is the best

2147
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Do I have to see the other Marvel movies?

2148
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
No

2149
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
The last Marvel movie I saw was

2150
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
The First Avengers

2151
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Maybe for one of the after credits

2152
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
But I can explain that because I haven't even seen

2153
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Age of Ultron

2154
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I haven't seen the Thanos movie

2155
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Although everyone spoiled it for me

2156
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Okay, well yeah, that one's been all over

2157
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I've not watched it yet

2158
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But, I mean

2159
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I haven't watched

2160
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Black Panther yet either

2161
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Captain Marvel is the best

2162
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I do want to see Black Panther

2163
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
No, it is the best

2164
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
You haven't seen it, so you can't say anything about it

2165
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Okay, fine, I'll watch it and then we'll see that

2166
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
it's not the best

2167
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It speaks to women's experiences every fucking day

2168
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And every man should be

2169
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
required to watch it

2170
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Okay, sure

2171
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't watch a lot of superhero movies

2172
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
at all, but I do want to see what is

2173
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
coming out that I do want to see

2174
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Is that us? That looks scary

2175
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
as hell

2176
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
That I want to see, that's for sure

2177
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Alright, um

2178
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Let's see, going in chat

2179
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says

2180
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
If you're a cat lover, you must see Captain Marvel

2181
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
My retort would be if you're a cat lover

2182
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
you must see Carly Rae Jepsen's new music

2183
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
video, because

2184
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
that was also a cat thing and it's incredible

2185
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
and so you should see it

2186
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Okay, let's see

2187
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Let's move on and talk about the

2188
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Overwatch League

2189
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And this was

2190
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
kind of one of those things where I said

2191
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I jabbed the Overwatch League a little bit

2192
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I should say jab, I said it was room for improvement

2193
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
when I was first talking about the Overwatch League

2194
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It's nice to see them taking this

2195
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
step into this next story

2196
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And the fact

2197
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
that Overwatch League has been successful enough

2198
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
to do this I think is pretty cool as well

2199
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It says a lot about where esports might be going

2200
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
But next year they are saying

2201
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
according to Commissioner

2202
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Nate Nasner

2203
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Overwatch League teams

2204
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
will be playing in their cities

2205
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
next year, so

2206
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
right now if you weren't already aware

2207
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
there's the Blizzard Arena in

2208
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Los Angeles

2209
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
and that's where all the matches are being

2210
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
played, but for next year

2211
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
if you are the San Francisco Shock

2212
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
which would be the closest team to us

2213
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
there's going to be a place in San Francisco

2214
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
where you go to see them play because

2215
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Yeah, don't they have like their own esports arena?

2216
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I mean that's, I thought

2217
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I know at least Oakland does, I'm sure San Francisco does somewhere

2218
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm just not up and up on where all the places are

2219
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Who it was that had the

2220
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
arena, because I know that they were doing the

2221
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
DDR tournament from there and

2222
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
That was in Oakland

2223
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Yeah, which I mean, you know

2224
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
The San Francisco 49ers play in Santa Clara

2225
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
which is like 45 minutes away on a good day

2226
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
so it doesn't always have to match exactly

2227
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I don't know where they're playing this stuff, we'll find out

2228
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Yeah, but

2229
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
you know, but what's going to be interesting about this is that

2230
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
you have teams in China

2231
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
you have teams in Europe

2232
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
all over the US and Canada

2233
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
so it's going to be like these time zones

2234
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I'm like, dang

2235
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
this might be a little rough on

2236
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
some of the players because these time zones

2237
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
are all going to be all over the map, right?

2238
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So, it'll be interesting

2239
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
to see what the schedule looks like to make this happen

2240
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
but I think this is

2241
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
this is a good next step for esports

2242
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I think it is important, I think if you want to

2243
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
grow esports to have the availability

2244
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
for people to go watch and see the game in person

2245
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and really see what it's all about

2246
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think that is going to be a great step

2247
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
so, you know, maybe I'll go

2248
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
to San Francisco and see one of these someday

2249
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
and see what it's all about

2250
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I still have some

2251
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
reservations on what the team

2252
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
rosters look like and so forth, but we'll see

2253
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
maybe that will improve in 2020 as well

2254
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
yeah, so this has always been something

2255
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
that they are going for

2256
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I'm looking for the original tweet here, here it is

2257
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
from Nate Nasner who says

2258
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
there won't be even more

2259
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
there's 20 teams today, there might be even more

2260
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
by this time next year, so

2261
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
we'll see

2262
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
let's see, Bobby in chat

2263
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
is saying

2264
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I wonder if it's like the current structure

2265
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
where there will be a weekend where a bunch of teams

2266
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
are in a home team city

2267
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
to play each other, that's what they're doing in

2268
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Atlanta in June for the Atlanta rain

2269
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
instead of doing home and away matches

2270
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I'm unsure

2271
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I don't know what

2272
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
that's, if it's going to be one for one

2273
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
or what they'll do with that, it'll be interesting to see though

2274
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
so

2275
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
let's see, and yeah, as you see 100 Matt

2276
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
as far as the team thing goes points out the New York

2277
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Giants and Jets play in New Jersey

2278
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
and that's how it works sometimes, yep

2279
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
so, anyhow

2280
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
we'll see what develops with the Overwatch League, I think

2281
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I think they're on, not that I want you guys to

2282
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
leave, but I think they're on right now

2283
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
and you know, I think they do

2284
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
a lot of stuff throughout the week

2285
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
there's a lot of programming there, so it'll be

2286
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
it's going to be interesting to see if that gets

2287
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
bigger and bigger and where that ends up going

2288
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
so, alright, let's move on

2289
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Darsakra, you have a kind of neat rumor

2290
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
for us, right?

2291
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Well, there's been some interesting

2292
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
revelations regarding

2293
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
what should be, what could be the PlayStation 5

2294
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
more rumors, but it's based

2295
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
off of a patent that Sony filed

2296
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
in October last year

2297
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
and also, I think, quickly it's worth mentioning

2298
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
this rumor, you got, you're reading this in like, what

2299
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Esquire or something, it's a big magazine

2300
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
so, like, this isn't just like some dude said on Twitter

2301
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
this is like, magazines are picking this up and running

2302
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
with it, yeah

2303
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
So, basically, they think that the PlayStation 5

2304
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
is going to include

2305
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
deep learning technology

2306
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
basically using the player's skills

2307
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
and habits to adapt the games

2308
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
the patent reads like this

2309
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
with a quote

2310
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Generally, a video game and video game

2311
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
assistants are adapted to a player

2312
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
for example, a narrative of the video game

2313
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
is personalized to an experience level of

2314
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
the player, similarly, assistants and interacting

2315
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
with particular content of the video game

2316
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
is also personalized

2317
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
the personalization learns from

2318
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
historical interactions of players

2319
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
with the video game and optionally

2320
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
other video games, in an example

2321
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
a deep learning neural network is implemented

2322
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
to generate knowledge from

2323
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
historical interactions, the personalization

2324
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
is then set according to the knowledge

2325
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
so, basically, it's like Psycho Mantis

2326
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
on steroids

2327
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Is this real, I mean, it sounds fancy

2328
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
and high tech, but I have to ask the hard question

2329
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
is it really, though? I mean, don't get me wrong

2330
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
this sounds neat, um, you know

2331
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I love the idea of a game, especially like

2332
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
for kids that are playing it, that like gets easier

2333
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
if they keep dying in the same spot or whatever

2334
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
or maybe if you're really good at it gets harder

2335
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
but then I can't help but think, like, you know

2336
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
like, let's say, like, an elliptical machine

2337
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
can increase

2338
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
or decrease the workout based on how you're

2339
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
performing and where your heart rate is at

2340
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
so, I mean, and that's just

2341
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
a little machine

2342
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
like, it's not a Playstation 5, so I'm just saying

2343
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
like, it sounds like, ooh

2344
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
it's this, like, big technology, but it's like

2345
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
it more sounds like it's a way of thinking

2346
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
a system, a core thing

2347
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
to maybe put in that all games would consider

2348
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It doesn't seem like that's something that a system

2349
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
should be doing, that's something that a game developer

2350
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
should be putting in if they want to implement

2351
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
that, because... Or maybe the game contains the algorithm

2352
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
but the machine has the hardware for it

2353
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And maybe it's something like

2354
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
6-axis, not to put a negative spin on it

2355
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
but developers can choose if they just

2356
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
want to put it in or not very easy, right?

2357
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Or, let's say that Steam

2358
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
gives you easy access

2359
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
to put in mods and achievements and things like that

2360
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
like, it's your choice if you want to, how much

2361
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
you want to run with that type of thing, I could see that

2362
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
but, if it is Sony's

2363
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
thing, you can bet your ass

2364
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
that things like Last of Us 3

2365
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Uncharted, whatever they do

2366
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
all these games I'm making up, but you know

2367
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
our Sony's powerhouses

2368
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
would likely implement this

2369
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
you know, because they're Sony's games, so of course

2370
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
they want to show off Sony's tech

2371
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Right, right

2372
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
What do you think, Barasaka?

2373
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Would you be more interested in

2374
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
PlayStation 5 or something like this?

2375
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I just said that I think it's going to be implemented

2376
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
through the games, with the hardware being on the system

2377
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
and I honestly think it would be great

2378
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I mean, but I'd also like the opportunity to be able to

2379
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
turn it off and have it not transmit data

2380
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Okay

2381
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I don't want it to learn and then send my

2382
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
habits to Sony

2383
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Okay, makes sense

2384
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
But that could be something they're thinking about is

2385
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
the portability, so that like if I play at a friend's

2386
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
house, but then you're right, you'd have to

2387
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
send to Sony and maybe that's

2388
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I don't mind analytics for

2389
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
like anonymous analytics

2390
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Um, you know

2391
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
in the case of your computer with anonymous analytics

2392
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
they use that to determine how to

2393
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
you know, release software updates

2394
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
how to make the things better, when to do

2395
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
full security updates if a lot of people are

2396
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
reporting the same issue, you know

2397
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
that's fine, crash reports

2398
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
whatever, but I don't want

2399
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
personalized data

2400
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I don't mind if it's anonymous, like

2401
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
my 23andMe stuff is pretty much anonymous

2402
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I don't care, but

2403
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
if it has my name on it

2404
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
which I opted out of anything that put my name on it

2405
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I would have a problem with it

2406
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Same goes with this, I don't want

2407
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
my habits directly

2408
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
related to me to go out

2409
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
to whatever

2410
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
they can store Let me ask this very

2411
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
real question, because this is actually how

2412
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I conduct myself on Playstation

2413
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
What if you could put your fake name on it?

2414
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I still

2415
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
wouldn't want that because my fake name now is

2416
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
so traceable It's still individualized

2417
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
in a way Yeah

2418
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
it would still be, because I mean

2419
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
at the very least they would have whatever billing information

2420
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
that you put in through it, because your real name is on

2421
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
your billing information

2422
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's still linked over

2423
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
If you're paying for like pay station network

2424
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I, you're right

2425
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I think Sony probably has that for me, but you do

2426
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
since their little hack and that whole thing

2427
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I believe you do not have to store

2428
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
a credit card on Playstation servers But

2429
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
if you've ever had one stored

2430
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
your name is still there on the account True

2431
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Historically

2432
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
the information is there

2433
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
You know, I'm what, either Dark Sakura

2434
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
or Kurotsubasa, like every fucking where

2435
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
people usually know that

2436
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
if they see the name, there's a big chance it's me

2437
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
So, just saying

2438
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Let's see, and yeah, if you see Rob Roberts

2439
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
you know it's me or the gun guy

2440
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Apparently if you Google

2441
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Rob Roberts you get a guy that sells guns

2442
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
How about that? Alright, let's see

2443
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Dungeon Buster I get a porn star for

2444
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Jamie Summers Do you really?

2445
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And then some lady in Columbus

2446
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
But you were supposed to be the Bionic Woman

2447
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Where's the Bionic Woman? Because I spell my name differently

2448
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Oh, that's right, that's right, okay

2449
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Dungeon Buster or Quest Buster in our chat

2450
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
at Twitch TV says

2451
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Xanac, a throwback here, Xanac

2452
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
adapted its difficulty depending on how the player

2453
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
did during the NES days

2454
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
The game would sometimes change in small ways

2455
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
change up patterns, etc.

2456
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
That's true, but that's

2457
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
not really learning

2458
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Because it wouldn't retain

2459
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
that information and it wouldn't

2460
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
alter it, it wouldn't remember

2461
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
that that was your difficulty level

2462
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Okay, that's maybe the little click for me that I needed

2463
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
to understand how this is like

2464
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
new and fancy It's just programming

2465
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
In this case, this would be machine learning

2466
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
It would learn your habits and

2467
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
adapt whatever game has the capacity

2468
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
to use that to your habits as a gamer

2469
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Okay, so like

2470
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
They say, this bitch is a rage quitter, we're only

2471
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
gonna let her play up to level 4

2472
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Interesting, so how you perform

2473
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
in Uncharted

2474
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
may dictate the difficulty level where

2475
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Last of Us starts is what this could be

2476
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Possibly, that's how I translated it too

2477
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Okay, okay, I get it

2478
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Going further, if it looks at your habits on the

2479
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
network, are you

2480
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
a rage quitter? Are you

2481
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
someone who gets a lot of abuse

2482
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
from complaints? You could start

2483
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
into whatever game

2484
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
you might be streaming with all of these

2485
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
marks against you, it could really go

2486
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
a lot further than that

2487
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Interesting, and of course there's sad little man babies

2488
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
out there who'll try to be pissy to female gamers

2489
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
and you know

2490
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
like what happened with movie ratings

2491
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
and everything, who will

2492
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
There's people who've done it to me and the things

2493
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
were completely unfounded, they were just

2494
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
crying little man babies, so

2495
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I drink male tears, I moisturize with them

2496
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Keep crying

2497
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
babies

2498
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Let's try to see if there's other comments in chat

2499
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Shehulk in our chat says

2500
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
since the big Playstation 3 data lost

2501
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
10 years ago, I still get notices

2502
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
from possible theft from Sony

2503
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
and you know that whole data theft, it is

2504
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
going to have to be something that's in the back of Sony's

2505
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
minds about, you know, again assuming this

2506
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
is true, but you know

2507
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
a lot of magazines

2508
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
and things seem to be running with it, is that

2509
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Sony will have to be mindful

2510
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
about how it uses that data

2511
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
because it knows it's already been in trouble

2512
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
for a breach of data once before

2513
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
so, I mean

2514
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
but I guess maybe the question would be

2515
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
is how good you are or aren't at a video game

2516
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
sensitive data

2517
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
but I guess it really depends on

2518
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
what is it that the Playstation is actually

2519
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
collecting

2520
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Anyway, SSJ100 Matt suggests

2521
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
self-destruct the consoles

2522
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
of chronic toxic players

2523
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Hey, I always like the idea

2524
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
of them getting their own little island

2525
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Have fun at Toxic Fantasy Island

2526
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
That's exactly what it is

2527
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Toxic Fantasy Island

2528
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And then we nuke it from orbit

2529
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Complete with tattoo

2530
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
We just nuke it from orbit

2531
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Right. Now then we airdrop a bunch of therapists

2532
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
That could be the intro

2533
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
to one of our future shows

2534
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Toxic Fantasy Island will not be seen tonight

2535
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Just airdrop a bunch of therapists

2536
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
that's all

2537
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Let's move on. Something else to talk about

2538
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Loki

2539
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I don't know. The whole Toxic Fantasy Island sounds awesome

2540
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So this is also

2541
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
something that's pretty awesome

2542
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
and surprising that's coming to Steam

2543
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Halo the Master Chief Collection

2544
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
is coming to PC

2545
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
and it's also coming to

2546
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
not only the Windows Store

2547
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
or Microsoft Store or whatever we're calling it

2548
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
nowadays, but the Steam

2549
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Store as well

2550
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
and on top of all of that

2551
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
they're going to be including Halo Reach now

2552
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
So it is

2553
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
going to be

2554
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
it will run at 60 FPS

2555
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
it will support up to 4K

2556
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
and they're going to be adding

2557
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
on Xbox One the Halo Reach multiplayer

2558
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
will be available as a free add-on for anyone

2559
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
that owns the collection

2560
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
and they said the single player campaign will cost extra

2561
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
They don't have a date on the Halo Reach stuff

2562
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
but they're going to be putting out

2563
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I guess stuff piecemeal

2564
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
so it's going to be

2565
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Halo Combat Evolved

2566
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Anniversary, Halo 2, Halo 3

2567
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Halo 4

2568
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
and then I guess

2569
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I don't know. Halo 5 will be added later

2570
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So I think when I bought

2571
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
my Xbox One

2572
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I got a digital copy of this

2573
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
because I don't think I have the disc

2574
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I think it's a digital copy

2575
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
so does that mean I'll get it on PC for free because it's digital?

2576
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Maybe. You can play anywhere

2577
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I don't know if it's a play anywhere game

2578
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I thought everything was supposed to be play anywhere now

2579
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Probably most of their games are play anywhere

2580
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I hope

2581
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Kaishido in chat says

2582
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
all they need is Halo Reach 3-2

2583
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
those games were so much fun

2584
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
so yeah a lot of fans are Reach out there

2585
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
so I'm sure very happy to hear that

2586
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I haven't answered for all that

2587
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I have an answer for that

2588
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
No

2589
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
You were never a Halo fan anyway

2590
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
The only thing I liked about Halo

2591
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
was Red vs Blue

2592
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
and the shiny stabby weapon

2593
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I like the shiny stabby weapon

2594
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Oh yeah I do like the shiny stabby weapon

2595
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Halo 2 is like a throwback to college for me

2596
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I used to like to play that online with some of my college buddies

2597
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
and we would use the shiny stabby thing quite a bit

2598
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
My fond memory was

2599
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Dan's bachelor party

2600
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
because you were at my bachelorette party

2601
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I was

2602
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
We had to go to the house to get my stuff

2603
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and they had something like

2604
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
5 TVs hooked up

2605
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
doing Halo LAN

2606
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Okay

2607
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Before we get to our next story

2608
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
this question keeps coming up in chat

2609
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
and so I have to address it

2610
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
and they're noticing on the camera there

2611
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
S2100 Matt says

2612
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yes I am

2613
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
OLR bringing rivals together

2614
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Okay

2615
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Where every foodie has a voice

2616
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I haven't started my Dunkin yet

2617
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
because I have a little banana for a stomach

2618
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Thank you surgery

2619
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I had to finish my corned beef

2620
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I told myself I was gonna eat so much

2621
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
dead bovine until I got sick

2622
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Guess who's sick right now

2623
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
That would be me but I'm not like

2624
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
super sick I stopped right before like

2625
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
throwing up sick

2626
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
So I am stuck

2627
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So the donuts are being saved right?

2628
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
The donuts are being saved they are gonna be breakfast

2629
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And that was a low key contribution

2630
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Thank you which I greatly appreciate

2631
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
The Boston cream is gonna be my

2632
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I'm about to go to bed snack but I need a sugar rush

2633
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
which isn't a good idea before you go to bed

2634
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And then my double chocolate

2635
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
is gonna be breakfast tomorrow

2636
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Where I will again

2637
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
get the shakes from reactive hypoglycemia

2638
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Low key was kind of

2639
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
offer for me too but

2640
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
since I am trying to be better about fitness

2641
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I decided to pass on the donuts and while I

2642
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
still do drink the coffee

2643
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I had just had a Starbucks so I

2644
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
didn't want to have lots of coffee

2645
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
By the way though speaking of

2646
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
fitness I am

2647
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
thinking about going back to Nerd Fit

2648
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Where they use their leveling up system

2649
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I'm trying to remember what that was

2650
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
That name sounds familiar

2651
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
It was people to eat keto and all this

2652
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
but

2653
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
their exercise program

2654
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
used like levels and then they would do like

2655
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
this like special

2656
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
challenge thing for like certain

2657
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
exercises and you turn it in and you get a badge

2658
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
and some shit but I'm thinking about

2659
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
going back to like a leveling system

2660
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
for working out because I am officially

2661
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
not

2662
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
the first week in April I've got

2663
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
the okay to go back to powerlifting

2664
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
and

2665
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I'm gonna fill my arm

2666
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
wings, my extra skin that I have

2667
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
left over with meat

2668
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
not just you know dead bovine

2669
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I've been using the watch tracking

2670
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
for fitness quite a bit that's been doing

2671
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
really good for me which reminds me I was gonna

2672
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
send a private information request to you

2673
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Jamie but I guess you don't have yours, oh no

2674
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
yours is right there, there it is

2675
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I'm not competitive

2676
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Some people have been sharing theirs with me

2677
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I've been interested in what some

2678
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
other people are doing but I'd rather just talk to people

2679
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
and find out what they're doing

2680
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
cause I like to think I'm fairly adaptive

2681
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
with my fitness regimen

2682
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I just found out that it will beat people

2683
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
when you close your rings I didn't realize that

2684
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
that was a thing but like so I was at

2685
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
the gym yesterday and as soon as I get

2686
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
off the machine I have multiple text messages

2687
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
from people I'm sharing data with that are saying

2688
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
like congrats or whatever and I'm just

2689
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
like wait did my watch like

2690
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
tell you that I'm so I thought that was

2691
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
it was weird but I was like well that's

2692
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
kinda nice I guess those little

2693
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
those little bits of motivation can always be cute

2694
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
so I just

2695
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
really only

2696
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
track myself

2697
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
cause the only person I can be accountable to is myself

2698
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
yeah being competitive

2699
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
doesn't really do anything for me

2700
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I'm not competitive with it it's more like

2701
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I want to

2702
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
these are good goals

2703
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
like the standing thing I was doing earlier

2704
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
they're good goals to have

2705
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I do it for myself I don't need to share that data

2706
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
with other people to feel good about what

2707
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I'm doing or maintain my goals

2708
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I'm not

2709
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
there's some people out there who are truly

2710
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I would say

2711
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
motivated by competition

2712
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
that's not me that's why most of the time

2713
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
if I'm playing a game I prefer a single person narrative

2714
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I prefer and so what I'm

2715
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
gonna be doing is as I level

2716
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
up I'm going to be

2717
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
using like a game or something

2718
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
and do say this is my level up game

2719
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
but I will be sharing my level ups

2720
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
with everybody in the form of content

2721
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
alright well speaking of leveling

2722
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
up moving on to

2723
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
a next story before we get to our classic

2724
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
segment the

2725
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Xbox Live by Microsoft

2726
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
is coming out for iOS and

2727
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Android so maybe this is another way if you want to be

2728
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
competitive with achievements this is

2729
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
something you could do or you maybe don't want

2730
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
to be competitive you want to just be able to send

2731
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
messages to friends on the on their

2732
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I'm telling you though this like combined with the

2733
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Google thing they were talking about before streaming

2734
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
like if I could like purchase Game Pass

2735
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
you

2736
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
know on an Android device

2737
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
and be able to like play those like

2738
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Xbox games on my TV or

2739
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
on my PC

2740
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
that would be useful

2741
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
to me because I don't want to buy another console

2742
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
well what this is

2743
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
this news is about is that Microsoft is going to allow

2744
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
developers of mobile games to use Xbox

2745
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Live features it's a new mobile

2746
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
SDK that is part of Microsoft's

2747
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
initiative to allow game developers

2748
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
you know of all sizes indie

2749
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
small large to

2750
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
use Xbox Live on whatever platform you want

2751
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
to create on which we already

2752
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
kind of knew Xbox Live is

2753
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
making strides in going into Switch games

2754
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
which was a big deal when we first talked about that

2755
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
the only place you're probably not going to see Xbox Live

2756
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
is on Sony which you know

2757
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
you understand why that is the way

2758
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
it is but anyway you can choose

2759
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
from features like

2760
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
achievements, clubs, gamerscore

2761
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
friends list, family

2762
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
settings that's interesting too

2763
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
talking about adapting to

2764
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
automatic settings

2765
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
that's very interesting that let's say

2766
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
you know this is a kid account right off the gate

2767
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
so maybe it shouldn't show

2768
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
dramatic blood effects or whatever

2769
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I don't know it goes with a particular game

2770
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
or because it's Loki you should show

2771
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
extra dramatic blood effects

2772
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
on the game. It's not dramatic if it's not

2773
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
extra so

2774
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
anyway very cool

2775
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
this is coming and I'm sure we're going to hear more

2776
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
about this at Game Developers Conference

2777
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
but it was confirmed that this is

2778
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
happening by the way in kind of a related

2779
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
story of sorts it should be

2780
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
mentioned about this too there is a brand new

2781
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
app that came out for Windows

2782
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
called Wireless Display and it

2783
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
will let you play PC games

2784
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
on your Xbox

2785
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
with varied

2786
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
success it seems like it's something that's still early

2787
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
on now as it is today

2788
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
you can play Xbox stuff on

2789
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
your PC there's a little Xbox

2790
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
app for Windows 10 I've actually done that and it

2791
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
works well enough as long as there's not a lot

2792
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
of other network traffic going on like I don't do it

2793
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
if Alan's trying to play Overwatch because

2794
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
technically I guess you could still do that if

2795
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
you had your output

2796
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
HDMI output from your PC into your

2797
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Xbox remember they have a pass through sure

2798
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
you could but this

2799
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
is a way to do it through the network

2800
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
through your house basically

2801
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
but they're saying not every game

2802
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
really works very well with this some folks have done

2803
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
some testing and said some games work

2804
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
some games don't

2805
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
but I imagine it's going to be interesting

2806
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
the more and more this technology gets refined

2807
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
although at the same time I don't usually

2808
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
want to play something like World of Warcraft on my television

2809
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I want to play it on my PC but I guess

2810
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
again for people that are playing things like I don't know

2811
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
the new Devil's May Cry game let's say you're buying that

2812
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
on PC then being able to

2813
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
have that on your TV

2814
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
is interesting but again

2815
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
it's apparently working with some mixed success

2816
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
right now seems like it's technology

2817
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
that will probably get refined in the coming weeks

2818
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
as more and more people complain about things

2819
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and so forth so

2820
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
anyhow

2821
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
some comments

2822
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
on Microsoft She-Hulk over

2823
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says

2824
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Xbox Live community is robust

2825
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
much more social

2826
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
than Sony or Nintendo

2827
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
well that's you know I think we've joked here on

2828
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
OLR that maybe Microsoft

2829
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
should just build Nintendo's online forum

2830
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
well Nintendo used to have a pretty robust

2831
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
online forum and then they got rid of it

2832
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
they did well it wasn't

2833
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
you know the whole

2834
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
what do they call it

2835
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
the thing that they discontinued where you could do all the

2836
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
cool pictures and everything oh SwapNote?

2837
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
no not SwapNote they have

2838
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Miiverse oh Miiverse

2839
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
okay

2840
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I get what you're saying Miiverse was an interesting idea

2841
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
but it really ran clunky it was kind of

2842
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
it wasn't it was I'll say

2843
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Miiverse was best when it was integrated

2844
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
directly into the games like Mario Maker

2845
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
that was a good use I will give you that that was

2846
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
a really good use of Miiverse

2847
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Splatoon kind of had that as well in fact

2848
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
what they did is they just kind of like

2849
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
took that part and put it in

2850
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
the new Splatoon that's on Switch so

2851
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
you know it's interesting

2852
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I guess you could say the legacy of

2853
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Miiverse lives on in that regard

2854
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I don't know but anyway

2855
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
other games continue to

2856
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
live on here at Orange Lounge Radio

2857
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
as we move into a segment we like

2858
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
to call the classic game of the week or

2859
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
as the case may be in 2019

2860
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
once a month Dark

2861
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Sakura dips into the gaming vault and says

2862
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
hey here's a soundtrack

2863
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
that you should be paying attention to the game

2864
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
may or may not be great but

2865
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
the soundtrack is definitely something

2866
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
worth noticing so what is our special

2867
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
classic soundtrack of the month

2868
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
this is going to

2869
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
be a game I will eventually review

2870
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
but it's Abadox

2871
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
The Deadly Inner War

2872
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
and this

2873
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
particular game

2874
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
okay there we go

2875
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
this particular game

2876
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
came out

2877
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
this music doesn't go for this level

2878
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I know what I did is I took the base music

2879
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
and I just put it over gameplays they have something to look at

2880
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
alrighty well anyway

2881
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
but it's actually the first level has my favorite music

2882
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
otherwise it's all ground beef

2883
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
yeah it'll cycle through the

2884
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
different songs in the game

2885
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
but yeah the first level is actually my favorite music

2886
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
in the entire game too because the game's hard

2887
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
and I died a lot so

2888
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
but anyway

2889
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
it's I mean it's pretty

2890
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
it's not like one of the best games ever

2891
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
it was by Natsume

2892
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
with the main

2893
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
programmer having worked on Contra

2894
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
actually the music

2895
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
programmer having worked on Contra

2896
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
but it was

2897
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Sada Kyohei who

2898
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
he did a lot of work for Konami

2899
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
it really

2900
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
was very influenced

2901
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
by Contra

2902
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
and some of the other shooting games

2903
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and this is the song you were mentioning

2904
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
earlier I believe

2905
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
this was like my favorite piece of music in this whole game

2906
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
and it sounds like a fucking Contra song

2907
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
it does

2908
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
it's like I was showing this to Dan

2909
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
and he's like oh yeah that's definitely a Natsume

2910
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
game I was like yeah but listen to the music

2911
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
he's like that sounds like Contra-ish

2912
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I'm like yarp

2913
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
you know that heavy

2914
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
rhythm in it that you had from

2915
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
a lot of the Konami games

2916
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
but at any rate I mean

2917
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
my second favorite piece of music in this game

2918
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
is the ending music which I never got to

2919
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
but people in my

2920
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
my papa was really

2921
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
good at this game and he beat the game

2922
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
it was this

2923
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
and you know

2924
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Jackal that he and I used to play a lot together

2925
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
before he died and so

2926
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
this

2927
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I just had to pick this music I don't really have too much else

2928
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
about the programming of the music but I thought the soundtrack

2929
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
was worth a mention because for such a

2930
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
you know

2931
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
middle of the road game

2932
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
the music in it was really good

2933
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
yeah and this has been kind of the

2934
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
neat thing about this little feature that you're doing

2935
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
even though the first month you did Guardian Legend

2936
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
which of course is a must right

2937
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
you really kind of have been picking games that are like

2938
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
okay maybe the games were eh

2939
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
but the soundtracks are A

2940
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
plus and I think that's always kind of neat

2941
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
you want to play a game because

2942
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
you just want to hear the damn music

2943
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
it's so good

2944
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
also I was just giving it a look

2945
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
for Famicom information

2946
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
the box art in Japan was so

2947
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
much better than the crap we got here

2948
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
She-Hulk and Child wants to know

2949
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
is the soundtrack on vinyl?

2950
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I don't think so

2951
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
this game really wasn't a super popular one

2952
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
it was unique in the US

2953
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
because it was a Milton Bradley published game

2954
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
which kind of goes with

2955
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
which you associate more with board games

2956
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
exactly but Milton Bradley

2957
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
did a decent number of releases for

2958
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
games they did but none of them were

2959
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
like A plus

2960
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
like games you remember

2961
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
but I mean wasn't Milton Bradley

2962
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
the Game Genie

2963
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
or not Game Genie that was Galoob

2964
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
the

2965
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
dammit the

2966
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Power Glove

2967
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
didn't they do I do not recall

2968
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I

2969
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
don't remember who did Power Glove

2970
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I don't know I'm looking it up right now

2971
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
so they

2972
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
did the power they were

2973
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
partly responsible for the power pad

2974
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
the power pad? yeah

2975
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
so

2976
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Milton life force

2977
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
the games that were

2978
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
done by Milton Bradley

2979
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
that were published or distributed

2980
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Cabal California Games

2981
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Captain Skyhawk

2982
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Gordon vs. Bird Marble Madness

2983
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Time Lord

2984
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
which is sadly a Doctor Who game

2985
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
World Games

2986
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
yeah not very many games

2987
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
but they were and by the way

2988
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Rob World Games is by Epix

2989
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I do yeah that I do know

2990
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
trust founder of the Epix

2991
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000

that happened on Bobby's show anyway

2994
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
we're bringing it around

2995
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
and keep in mind Milton Bradley actually

2996
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
had a console in 1979

2997
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
they had the micro vision oh really

2998
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
yep hold on let's see something

2999
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
real quick while we're here this is

3000
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
turned into the Milton Bradley segment of the month

3001
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
well I mean it doesn't

3002
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
hurt to educate people sure

3003
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
so ugh stupid accepting cookies

3004
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000

01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
different stuff I mean like I said

3009
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
they had been in the video game business off and on

3010
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
and had you know purples and things

3011
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
like that but yeah so

3012
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
there you go

of the month how do you say Abadox

Abadox oh wait you might

3016
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
remember the commercial it's the kid playing on his

3017
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
bed and then like purple slime shoots

3018
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
out of his TV at him and it was supposed

3019
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
it was advertised

3020
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
as like the most disgusting game

3021
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
oh yeah cause

3022
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
that was all the shit that was on TV it was like

3023
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
the Double Dare

3024
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Fun House was even grosser and like all the

3025
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
like gross splat and all that

3026
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
stuff this game ain't

3027
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
ain't disgusting I played R-Type

3028
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
alright

3029
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000

3030
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
viewer submission I'm very hyped about

3031
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
this cause we haven't had one of these in a while since

3032
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
um Matt did one of these for MAGFest but I did

3033
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
put the call out and I said hey listeners

3034
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
if you're interested in like you know highlighting a game

3035
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000

3036
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
or what have you I'm looking for some listener

3037
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
segments and leave it to good old Flaco

3038
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Jones who sent us this submission

3039
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
tonight where um he's gonna talk to us a little

3040
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
bit about the game Paladins and

3041
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
uh pay attention cause he gets into the reason why

3042
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
and I think it's uh it's really cool so we're gonna go

3043
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
to uh this segment here courtesy of

3044
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
our pal Flaco Jones

3045
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Hey everybody this is

3046
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Flaco Jones uh I wanted to make

3047
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
this video because well first of all Rob asked for it

3048
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
and I thought it'd be cool to focus on a

3049
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
free game cause he said you know focus on free games

3050
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
would be good and this came

3051
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
up recently because on OLR they were talking

3052
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
about Overwatch and how it doesn't

3053
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
support cross play and how could they ever support

3054
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
cross play I'm like well there's a game that does

3055
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
support cross play that's a lot like Overwatch

3056
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
and so this game popped in my head I'm like oh I should

3057
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
make a video for OLR so they can actually see

3058
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
the game in action so

3059
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
uh this is Paladins I'm actually gonna make

3060
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
my camera go away so

3061
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
that I can focus on showing the game play

3062
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
and I'm gonna edit stuff in so it's not just staring

3063
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
at menus the whole time cause I'm pretty much gonna be

3064
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
talking over the menus

3065
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
so uh this is it it's free game

3066
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
and because it's free

3067
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
you can go to the store and you can

3068
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
see all the stuff they try to sell you

3069
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and there's DLC where you can

3070
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
actually get all the champions

3071
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
current and future for just $30 which I think

3072
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
is a pretty good deal but I personally have never

3073
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
spent a dime on this game I

3074
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
do my daily quests I grind out gold

3075
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I use gold to unlock champions which are you know

3076
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
like heroes and Overwatch

3077
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
champions in this game I'm gonna be comparing

3078
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
it to Overwatch a lot because the games

3079
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
are very similar it's been accused of being

3080
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Overwatch clone not gonna

3081
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
fight that accusation but I'm gonna say

3082
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
it still stands on it's own

3083
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
alright so and I wanted to briefly

3084
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
show you since we were talking about

3085
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
cross play you go to controls

3086
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
you go all the way to the bottom and this is where the cross

3087
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
play is uh the settings

3088
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
are right here so you can say I only

3089
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
wanna go against people using a gamepad

3090
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
or I only wanna go against everybody and have

3091
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
shorter queues I do

3092
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
gamepad I think it's more fair and the reason

3093
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
they do that they don't even say console is because

3094
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
based on whether you have a gamepad

3095
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
plugged in or not that's how it queues you

3096
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
and if you try to queue in this gamepad and then pull it

3097
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
out and try to trick everybody

3098
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
and use your keyboard and mouse that won't work

3099
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
it'll kick you out of the

3100
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
games they said so in their patch notes so

3101
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
yeah I play gamepad only

3102
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I think it's really cool they allow that

3103
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
because it doesn't matter what platform you're playing on

3104
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
PC you're playing on Switch

3105
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
you're playing Xbox One you're playing

3106
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
you know Xbox One supports

3107
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
keyboard and mouse as well so if you're playing keyboard and mouse

3108
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
as Xbox One you still would be with

3109
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
the allow all people not with the gamepad

3110
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
people and it would show on your input method right there

3111
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
um I didn't mention

3112
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Sony I wonder why that is oh because they're not

3113
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
supporting it right now so they're not supporting

3114
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
cross play right now

3115
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I think it's gonna happen but

3116
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
you know there's been some controversy over

3117
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
who's fault it is but the developers of this game

3118
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
said they're ready to go the balls

3119
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
in Sony's court so hopefully Sony approves that

3120
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
pretty soon cause I would really like to play this

3121
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
on Playstation uh

3122
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
let's see uh what do we got here

3123
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
oh yeah so if you wanna learn how to play

3124
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
there's uh these training

3125
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
modes over here they have

3126
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
trainings for all the different modes which I'll get into those in a second

3127
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
and they have a shooting range and the shooting range

3128
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
you can practice as any champion and that's

3129
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
kinda cool even champions you haven't unlocked yet

3130
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
so I like that

3131
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
there's no tutorial here and I think

3132
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
that's weird and so I looked it up and sure enough

3133
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
there is a tutorial on the other consoles

3134
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
just on Switch they didn't put it on there because the

3135
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
file size would have been too big so they

3136
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
cut that out

3137
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
that's too bad but you know so if you really

3138
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
wanna learn how to play it is a free to play the game you could

3139
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
download it on a different

3140
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
console and play it on there and if you prefer to play on Switch

3141
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
you can play on there but again it's cross

3142
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
platform and cross progression

3143
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
so anything you do saves across all the platforms

3144
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
except for Playstation

3145
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
so let's see I said I'd get into the modes

3146
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
so here's the different modes let's go to Quick Play

3147
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
and look at our settings so there's Siege

3148
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
there's Onslaught and there's Team Deathmatch

3149
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Siege kinda plays like the

3150
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Overwatch hybrid maps those are the maps

3151
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
where you capture the objective and then once you capture the

3152
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
objective you escort the payload

3153
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Onslaught

3154
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
all that one is is take the objective hold it until

3155
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
whatever team gets 400 points

3156
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
first the longer you stay there you

3157
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
earn points and getting kills also

3158
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
earns you points and then Team Deathmatch

3159
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
speaks for itself 5v5

3160
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
you know just try to kill

3161
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
as many as you can so there's like

3162
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
there's one more big difference between this and

3163
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Overwatch which is

3164
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
when you start this game first

3165
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
you'll have you pick a talent

3166
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
every champion gets

3167
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
three talents to choose from you select

3168
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
one and it's kind of like your focus for that

3169
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
game after that you

3170
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
get to pick your loadouts now loadouts

3171
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
are here in the game if you go

3172
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
into a champion you can go

3173
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
into their loadouts and you can make

3174
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
new ones or you can use there's always a

3175
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
preset one there so if you're uncomfortable

3176
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
with this just use the pre-made but once

3177
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
you get good at this game you can kinda build your own

3178
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
so I think that's pretty awesome

3179
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
and then after you pick that when the game

3180
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
starts they have this thing called the item shop

3181
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
which I've heard is a lot like League of Legends

3182
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I don't play leagues I don't know but as you

3183
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
play this game you earn credits for

3184
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
doing well at your character's job

3185
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
if you're healing a lot you'll get credits that way

3186
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
if you stay in the objective a lot you'll get credits that way

3187
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
if you're a damaged player and you're

3188
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
getting a lot of kills you get more credits that way you spend

3189
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
your credits on this thing called

3190
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
the item shop and the item shop

3191
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
is kind of I think this game's answer to

3192
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
hero switching that Overwatch has

3193
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
you can't switch heroes in this game

3194
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
so with the item shop you can kinda see what the

3195
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
other team is running or even

3196
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
compliment what your team is running and get items

3197
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
from the item shop to boast

3198
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
up those certain things so you can have

3199
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
better healing you can

3200
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
take less damage from direct damage if the

3201
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
team has a lot of AoE damage you can

3202
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
lessen the AoE damage just a little bit you can lower

3203
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
your cooldowns you can increase your

3204
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
ultimate you know

3205
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
generation so there's all sorts of things

3206
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
you can buy

3207
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
in the item shop and there's not anything you can

3208
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
pay to win they just you just earn it

3209
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
like everybody else does by playing the game

3210
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
and it's only for that match you don't get

3211
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
they don't carry over so there's no

3212
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
pay to win or anything in this game which is kinda nice

3213
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
so let's look at the champions

3214
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
this is the bread and butter

3215
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
of the game I have a lot of champions as you

3216
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
can see here I have all but it looks like

3217
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
nine right now but there's actually rotating champions

3218
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
which I don't have all of them actually I think

3219
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I only have one I have two of them

3220
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
so that means I'm missing

3221
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
eleven characters out of the forty

3222
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
forty man roster is really good

3223
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
so again they

3224
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
have these four that rotate every week it's not always

3225
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
gonna be these four I'm gonna focus for this

3226
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
video on the ones you get when you

3227
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
start the game for free you've never played it before

3228
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
and that is the reason

3229
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
it's four is cause there's one support

3230
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
that's their healers

3231
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
one frontline that's their tanks one damage

3232
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
speaks for itself

3233
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
and one flanker which is the damage that

3234
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
attacks from the side or behind

3235
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
let's look at Genos

3236
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
so Genos

3237
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
is the free healer

3238
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
that you get if you've never played paladins before

3239
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
and here's how the abilities

3240
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
break down I'll show

3241
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
some video while I'm talking about it so you're

3242
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
not just staring at this screen the whole time

3243
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
so star splitter is his main attack

3244
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
everybody's main attack is his right trigger

3245
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
it's just like a machine gun

3246
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
you know everybody in this game pretty much

3247
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
shoots even the healers and they do pretty well at

3248
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
it you don't have to do a lot of weapon switching

3249
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
uh which is pretty cool

3250
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
so and then his left one is his heal

3251
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
the left trigger is his heal and that

3252
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
his heal kinda works like Zenyatta

3253
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
so he puts a heal bloom on

3254
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
somebody it stays on him as long as you keep him in line of sight

3255
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
and it does a good job

3256
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
uh Stellar Wind is the

3257
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
right shoulder button the right shoulder button on almost

3258
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
every character I'm pretty sure

3259
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
every character actually is like a quick

3260
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
getaway button it's like some kind of speed button

3261
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
so in this case

3262
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
it's his Stellar Wind he moves 65%

3263
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
faster and you can even

3264
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
get a loadout where you take less damage

3265
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
in that mode which is nice too

3266
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
so it's a really good way

3267
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
to escape from people something I kinda wish Zenyatta

3268
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
and Overwatch had was a way to escape cause he really

3269
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
doesn't he's kind of a sitting duck

3270
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
uh and then the left button there

3271
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
the left shoulder button is his void grip

3272
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
you can also use that to escape with him but it

3273
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
holds enemies up in the air stuns them does a little

3274
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
damage if your teammates around they can kill the person while

3275
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
they're in the air it's really cool kind of support

3276
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
ability and his ultimate

3277
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
is through time and space it channels this

3278
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
tunnel of like death

3279
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
and it shoots anybody that's

3280
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
standing in the tunnel there's like a kind of a cast time

3281
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
so you have time to get away from it if you're paying attention

3282
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
but if he's got you trapped and you're in the middle of a fight

3283
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
if you're standing in that tunnel

3284
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
you're dead okay

3285
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
so let's go to the next free character that's gonna be

3286
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Lex Lex is the free flanker in the game

3287
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
let's look at his abilities

3288
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
he's got magnums

3289
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
think like reaper's guns they just shoot one

3290
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
at a time bang bang bang bang they're good medium

3291
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
to close range

3292
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
his left trigger is in

3293
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
pursuit that just kind of

3294
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
unloads his weapons even faster

3295
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
in like a short area kind of like McCree's like

3296
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
you know when he shoots off his guns really

3297
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
fast

3298
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
his R is a combat slide again

3299
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
you can use that to escape or you can use it to close in on somebody

3300
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
and finish him off

3301
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
his left shoulder is retribution

3302
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
you cast out on people they take more damage

3303
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
you earn credits when you kill them when they have retribution on

3304
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
you can spec for that to be better as well

3305
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
and then finally his ultimate is the law

3306
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
it's a lot like McCree's ability

3307
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
where you kind of focus

3308
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
on everybody in a little like area

3309
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
when you shoot it off

3310
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
everybody that's in the area

3311
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
if they're 65% health or below

3312
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
they get executed it's great

3313
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
otherwise they take 600 damage still pretty good

3314
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
so let's go to next is

3315
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Ruckus Ruckus plays a lot

3316
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
like D.Va from Overwatch so you'll hear me say

3317
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
D.Va a lot so Ruckus has these

3318
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
mini guns they're kind of like D.Va's

3319
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
hand cannons

3320
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
they shoot really fast the longer you hold

3321
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
the button the more damage they do it's kind of cool

3322
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Ruckus's left trigger is

3323
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
a missile launcher so again kind of like

3324
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
D.Va shoots some barrage of missiles

3325
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
at people

3326
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
advance is his quick getaway move

3327
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
you press it and he has rocket boosters

3328
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
again like D.Va that'll get

3329
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
him in or out of combat to find

3330
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
him in the situation a 5 second cooldown is pretty low too

3331
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
you can advance to get in shoot a bunch

3332
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
of people in advance to get back out and go back to your healers

3333
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
it's kind of nice his left shoulder

3334
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
is a shield called emitter

3335
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
gives him like a bubble, absorbs damage

3336
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
it's really nice again if you're in there being

3337
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
a disruptor like you're supposed to do whether you play Ruckus

3338
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
or D.Va they're similar

3339
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
play styles and then his

3340
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
ultimate is Hexafire

3341
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
it's just like a one where he just

3342
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
unloads all his weapons in like

3343
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
pretty much a cone in front of him

3344
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
and it does really good damage

3345
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
if you can focus someone down

3346
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
if you get a lot of people gathered in one area and you

3347
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
unleash that thing and especially if you use your

3348
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
emitter first so you're safe you can take

3349
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
out like a lot of people at once

3350
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
so

3351
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
finally there's Viktor and Viktor

3352
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
plays a lot like Soldier 76 from

3353
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Overwatch sorry about all the comparisons but it's just

3354
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
easier to describe it this way since more people know

3355
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Overwatch I know I'm feeding

3356
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
into the whole ripoff thing but you know

3357
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
whatever I don't really care

3358
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
so his assault rifle is like his

3359
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
main gun but on this one if you hit the left trigger

3360
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
you actually look down the sights so you get a little bit more

3361
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
accuracy but he does move

3362
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
slower because you're not just shooting

3363
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
off the hip you're looking right down the sights

3364
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
his R like Soldier's

3365
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
you know right shoulder button is

3366
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
like a hustle so he moves he can run really

3367
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
fast but he can't shoot while he's doing it as soon as you start

3368
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
shooting you come out of your sprint

3369
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
sprint is what they call it for

3370
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
for Soldier and then

3371
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
frag grenade is his left shoulder button

3372
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
he'll throw a grenade it does a lot of damage

3373
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
you can hold the button

3374
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
cook the grenade so that when you release it it

3375
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
blows up more quickly if someone is closer to you

3376
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
it's a really nice ability and then barrage his

3377
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
his ultimate ability is really strong

3378
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
and it just

3379
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
kind of like Soldier again focuses on

3380
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
everybody gets kind of in his sights

3381
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
and if they kind of stand there too long

3382
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
you can unload like a bunch of shells

3383
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
on them and do tons of damage so

3384
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
that's pretty much all the

3385
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
characters that you get

3386
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
when you start the game and they're not bad characters

3387
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
not like they just give you a bunch of pushovers

3388
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
they're very offensive minded

3389
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
characters which makes

3390
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
sense because if you just get into the game and

3391
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
you just want to play a shooter

3392
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
and you're not comfortable healing your tanking

3393
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
well the healer and tank that they give you here are very

3394
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
damage friendly all those characters are

3395
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
really easy to use and you can kind of start

3396
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
building a foundation in the game and

3397
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
then be better after you

3398
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
learn how to do them and you start unlocking other heroes

3399
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
you start figuring out what's better but I'll still go back and play

3400
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
those guys because they still do pretty

3401
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
good damage so again

3402
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
it sounds like a big commercial for Paladins but if you

3403
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
ask me I still think Overwatch is a better game

3404
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I play it more often

3405
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I dabble in this game but

3406
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
it is really fun

3407
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
you can't really beat the price of free

3408
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
if you're willing to grind

3409
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
it's a good game and even if you want to pay for it

3410
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
30 bucks isn't bad to get all the heroes

3411
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
and it supports crossplay so if you want to

3412
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
play with your friends this is a good game to play with your friends

3413
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
because no matter what console they're on except Sony

3414
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
you can play with your friends so again

3415
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I'm Flaco Jones

3416
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
you can find me on Twitch twitch.tv

3417
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
slash Flaco underscore Jones

3418
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
and uh

3419
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
that's it back to OLR

3420
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
hopefully that wasn't too long

3421
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
No it was fantastic

3422
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
thank you Flaco and it's

3423
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
there was a lot of work that I know

3424
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
goes into that video especially because it's very

3425
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
clear he like had to play the game like multiple times

3426
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
and multiple characters to put the right shots in and stuff

3427
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
so I really appreciate the time you took to

3428
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
put together that infomercial high res

3429
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
appreciation time too no

3430
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I'm just I'm giving a little crap because I

3431
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
that's what I asked for I wanted people to submit games

3432
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
um about uh or submit

3433
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
things uh videos for

3434
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
for games that they're like passionate about that they have

3435
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
you know a lot of um you know

3436
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
enthusiasm about which you know even though kind of

3437
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Flaco admits eh Overwatch

3438
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
might be kind of the game I go to more often

3439
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
maybe this game is still worth your

3440
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
attention especially when it's something that's free

3441
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
uh and they do these kind of different ideas

3442
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
and things like that so I actually I've played

3443
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
um a little bit of Paladins

3444
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
as well and I thought it was I thought it was

3445
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
interesting I mean it was just again it was just like

3446
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
okay I mean I I kind of

3447
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
went back to Overwatch but I thought

3448
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
you know okay this is something I could get into

3449
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
also maybe I need to try it more on PC

3450
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
because I played it on console and I'm just

3451
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
more of a keyboard mouse guy at the end of the day so I do

3452
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
kind of want to give that another go because

3453
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
one thing that I had a problem kind of figuring out

3454
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
was oh like what do all these

3455
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
heroes kind of do and stuff but Flaco

3456
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
did a very good job kind of demonstrating that in that little

3457
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
video especially for oh these are all the characters

3458
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
that you're going to start with and uh so forth

3459
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
so yeah shout out to our pal Flaco Jones

3460
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
against Flaco underscore Jones

3461
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
over on Twitch you should all go

3462
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
follow him if you aren't already

3463
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
that would be incredible and thanks again Flaco

3464
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
for that submission very cool and if you

3465
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
have a submission get in touch with me on

3466
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Twitter at Mr Rob Roberts we love

3467
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
seeing the listener submitted stuff

3468
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
um yeah it's great

3469
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
um otherwise we've just been filling in with

3470
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
with video clips of the news or whatever else

3471
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
we can think of but it gives us a chance for us

3472
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
folks here in studio to take a little bit

3473
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
of a break so um

3474
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
also in chat I notice

3475
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Flaco's actually in chat right now

3476
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
and getting some kudos there in chat

3477
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
and rightfully so

3478
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Flaco says a 12 minute video

3479
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
and 45 minutes of playing for

3480
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
cover shots yep that's it

3481
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
but it looks like there might be some other

3482
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Paladins players in chat because Nifty's asking

3483
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
which character do you main so

3484
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
uh pretty cool good stuff

3485
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
alright um let's move on with some other news that we

3486
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
have scheduled for tonight's show uh some rapid fire

3487
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
news let's get some news uh kinda quickly out here

3488
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
uh as we travel around the studio

3489
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
and the world and check out quickly

3490
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
some other uh headlines we might have missed

3491
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
uh I think we're starting tonight with Loki

3492
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
yeah so at the South by Southwest

3493
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
gaming panel they um had some

3494
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
details regarding um a new game

3495
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
from Sega uh Team Sonic

3496
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Racing uh which I think

3497
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
has been teased before but they showed a little bit more

3498
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
on it so they showed that

3499
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
um you know

3500
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
the different customization they have in the different

3501
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
cars you can do which is kinda cool so there's

3502
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
quite a bit of customization available

3503
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
um

3504
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I'm assuming based on

3505
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
what they showed they said you know you can

3506
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
encourage and see it allows you to unlock different

3507
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
things in the game and different customizations

3508
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I almost saw that as like monetization

3509
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
type of thing but apparently you earned it in

3510
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
game so we'll see um yeah I wanna

3511
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
say in previous games it was kinda like that

3512
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
yeah in game in game currency only

3513
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
um there the game is

3514
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
gonna be released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4,

3515
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Switch and PC on May 21st

3516
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
um the other thing they showed is there's

3517
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
gonna be this Team Sonic Racing

3518
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Overdrive cartoon

3519
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
that's gonna be coming out now

3520
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
when they say cartoon

3521
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
not necessarily like on TV

3522
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
cartoon but it's more of like a

3523
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
web series or something that they're gonna do

3524
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
um which you know makes sense

3525
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
they've done something similar

3526
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
with like say

3527
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
um Angry Birds have like

3528
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
a little web series and stuff that they did as well

3529
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
which actually ended up on Netflix at some point

3530
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I know cause I've seen it

3531
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
several times thanks to my kids but they're doing

3532
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
something similar to this there's not actually

3533
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
any spoken dialogue in the show

3534
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
but it's just kind of like

3535
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
grunts and whatever

3536
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
it's just I don't know it's very

3537
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
basic so that they can release

3538
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
it globally without having to localize it

3539
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
um so there's that

3540
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
and I guess that'll be around the time

3541
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
that the game comes out so we'll have to

3542
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
see but the game's being developed by Sumo

3543
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Digital so

3544
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I think they were the ones that did um

3545
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
weren't they the ones that did the

3546
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
ModNation Racers and stuff like that

3547
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
the name sounds familiar I just can't remember what

3548
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
else they developed off the top of my head I know that name

3549
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
that name sounds very familiar but it looked neat

3550
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
it looked neat so I'll check it out when

3551
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
it comes out

3552
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
cool and then um

3553
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
D'Artasuya thinks it was Outrun by the way the new Outrun that they did

3554
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
oh maybe

3555
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
um and then of course um

3556
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Game Pass we talk about that

3557
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
quite a bit uh new game that's gonna be

3558
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
coming well not new game but a new

3559
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
game to the service is coming out

3560
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
April 4th will be Minecraft

3561
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
will be added to Games Pass so you'll

3562
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
be able to jump into Minecraft if you haven't

3563
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
already I mean

3564
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
geez it's like 2019

3565
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
um but you'll be able to do that for free

3566
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
well free on top

3567
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
with excluding of course the

3568
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
$10 a month fee for Game Pass

3569
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
but it's an additional

3570
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
piece that you get with that yeah when's the 4k

3571
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
graphics pack by the way

3572
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
whatever happened to that didn't they announce that at E3 2017

3573
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
where's that 4k graphics pack

3574
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
well I know I'm crazy

3575
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
4k graphics for Minecraft but the stuff they were

3576
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
like the weather and all that stuff is really good

3577
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
like I'm like well if you want to do that it's already

3578
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
available on PC now you just have to

3579
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
do with mods yeah

3580
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
of course of course Java version

3581
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
alright um I don't know how I got

3582
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
the story on Mortal Kombat 11 but how about

3583
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
that um so there's more information

3584
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
on Mortal Kombat 11 came out this

3585
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
week and um

3586
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
apparently they're mentioning that

3587
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
NetherRealm is talking about how player data

3588
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
shows that and this is interesting because

3589
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Jamie you kind of brought this up earlier about how you prefer

3590
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
to play games but the player data they're getting

3591
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
shows that single player mode is one of the most

3592
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
popular ways for people to access

3593
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
and experience the game so

3594
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
that's why NetherRealm was kind of putting

3595
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
as much for a fighting game which you

3596
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
typically think of as two player this is why NetherRealm

3597
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
puts as much as they do into single player because

3598
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
their data shows a lot of people are playing it that way

3599
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
and Mortal Kombat does have

3600
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
kind of a rich you know compared to other fighting games

3601
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
especially the newer Mortal Kombat

3602
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
games really do have a very rich story

3603
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
to them so I'm not terribly surprised

3604
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
to hear that more people are

3605
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
experiencing it as a result

3606
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
um also believe it or not

3607
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
some fatalities were too over the top

3608
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
and not really functional so they were yanked

3609
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
or redesigned what

3610
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
how about that uh they are not commenting

3611
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
on other characters from other

3612
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
properties so all this

3613
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
BS about Shaggy or any

3614
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
uh IP that is not there

3615
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Shaggy in Mortal Kombat I mean they could

3616
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
make it happen it is Warner

3617
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
it's not gonna happen but it

3618
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
but Velma on the other hand she came

3619
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
to kick some ass no I'm just kidding they're not

3620
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
putting cartoon characters in a fucking game

3621
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
uh you know no just like Joker

3622
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
no I was gonna say you'd have better

3623
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
luck going for the Injustice series

3624
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I was gonna say they're not gonna put

3625
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
but they had Ninja Turtles well I was in

3626
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Justice as well I was in Justice as well so

3627
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
yeah you you should find Shaggy for

3628
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Injustice 3 take your Shaggy

3629
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
it would be an Injustice not to put

3630
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
him in there

3631
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
and Scooby Doo and

3632
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
OLR is cancelled forever good night and Scrappy

3633
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
in fact Scrappy can just be like one of those

3634
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
bonus games now I know this is

3635
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
this is not necessarily in the same

3636
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
series but you know much like they have

3637
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
and uh Capcom

3638
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Street Fighter series you know where you destroy the car

3639
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
you can destroy Scrappy

3640
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
mmhmm

3641
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
alright um let's see

3642
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
the story is roughly 8 hours long

3643
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
what? $60 for an 8 hour game?

3644
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
uh

3645
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
nevermind it's a fighting game

3646
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
it's a fighting game exactly um

3647
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
the crypt is back but they're saying

3648
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
a nice surprise for players when you see

3649
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
the direction it's taken uh

3650
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
and let's see features will be added to the game

3651
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
after launch even in the first few months

3652
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
uh and Kronika's mission

3653
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
is in the story involves

3654
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
finding time and starting all over

3655
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
so merging the timeline so that

3656
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
the past meets the present

3657
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
so that could be because Mortal Kombat has a very

3658
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I don't know if you guys know but Mortal Kombat has like a whole like

3659
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Prime and Kelvin thing going on

3660
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
the newer games are in the Kelvin universe

3661
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I'm referencing Star Trek obviously

3662
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
but the newer games are in like a different universe because of what happened

3663
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
in the reboot Mortal Kombat 9

3664
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
mmhmm so interesting

3665
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
it'll be interesting to see how that all goes down universal shenanigans

3666
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
yes so uh

3667
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
anyway that's Mortal Kombat and quickly let me also

3668
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
mention that uh the other story I had here is about

3669
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
the uh indie game The Messenger

3670
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
and I have to admit I didn't know a lot about

3671
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
this game until I was uh scavenging

3672
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
for the news this week and then I kind of watched a trailer

3673
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
and this looks really cool because

3674
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
The Messenger it's kind of like a it's a Metroidvania

3675
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
type of game I know we hear that a lot

3676
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
but it kind of seems a little bit like Ninja

3677
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Ninja Gaiden kind of

3678
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
but like uh amped up

3679
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
a little bit and um

3680
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
it's um something where you

3681
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
can actually switch between

3682
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
8-bit and 16-bit mode

3683
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
by hitting a certain

3684
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
type of like marker

3685
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
on the like you've hit an orb and like

3686
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
it changes it from 8-bit to 16-bit

3687
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
and that kind of it's a time bubble is what

3688
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
it is and it flips it between it and it changes

3689
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
the graphics and the sound with it and it

3690
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
changes the mechanics as well so I think that's kind

3691
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
of kind of neat anyway

3692
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
it's coming to PlayStation 4 on

3693
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
March 19th so this coming week

3694
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
so maybe it'll be a great time for me

3695
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
to check it out uh

3696
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
but anyway Dark Sakura

3697
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
um I don't know how many people in chat

3698
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
have played Dragon's Dogma I started it

3699
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
and didn't like it um

3700
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
but they are going to be doing

3701
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
a uh anime

3702
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
that will be out on Netflix

3703
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
produced by Sublimation

3704
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
and um basically I mean in the game

3705
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
you fight a dragon and

3706
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
it steals your heart and you die and then you come back

3707
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
to life and so you're trying to

3708
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
get revenge on it well that's the story the

3709
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
plot of the anime

3710
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
um but it was said by um

3711
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Koishikawa Atsushi

3712
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
who is the representative director

3713
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
of Sublimation they're really looking

3714
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
forward on it and the last line is what

3715
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
gets me we're excited to bring our

3716
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
unique cel-shaded animation that carries

3717
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
hand-drawn textures to anime

3718
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
fans around the world

3719
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
so I think it should look interesting

3720
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
um but anyway

3721
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
uh other news there has been

3722
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
another unearthing apart from ECW

3723
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Wrestling which everybody fucking knew

3724
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
existed um

3725
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
there was an Alien vs.

3726
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Predator football game

3727
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
for the Sega Genesis

3728
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
at least there was going to be one

3729
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
like football football or as an American

3730
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
football as in not real football

3731
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
yep we got

3732
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
we're gonna settle our differences

3733
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
on the 50 yard line yep

3734
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
that would have made a better movie I think than

3735
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
the Alien vs. Predator movie and it was just

3736
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
a concept it was actually just on

3737
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
like you know uh

3738
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
a flyer and it was

3739
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
called like Alien vs.

3740
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Predator Hardball no Cosmic

3741
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Hardball and

3742
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
yeah it looks pretty stupid but

3743
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
but let's be

3744
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
real some of the greatest video games are

3745
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
really really stupid I think I

3746
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
would have actually enjoyed this

3747
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
um but

3748
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I mean this would be this is like the best video game

3749
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
never made that's why I gave this story to you

3750
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
because even though I know you're not a big football fan I'm like

3751
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
but I bet she would have played this

3752
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I would have I like

3753
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I also like super high impact that's true

3754
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
and I like Tecmo Bowl so even

3755
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
people who aren't into sports games there's always

3756
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
something there's always something that brings you in

3757
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
but the thing that's funny about the tweets about it

3758
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
is people arguing if the Xenomorph would wear a

3759
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
football helmet

3760
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
well for safety they have those big

3761
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
long armored heads I want to see this

3762
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
done as a movie

3763
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
but done in the style of Space Jam

3764
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
did you see Alien vs. Predator

3765
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
where you took the head off of one and used it as a

3766
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
shield no I don't

3767
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I don't really watch I saw

3768
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
that that movie was rad I've seen

3769
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I actually think I've seen most of the aliens

3770
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
movies at this point I saw Alien resurrection

3771
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
in the theater with Winona Ryder I needed

3772
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
to see that only because I wanted to

3773
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
listen to what it could have been

3774
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
yeah I don't I didn't

3775
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
know anything about the controversy or any of that stuff I just

3776
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
it was written by it was written by

3777
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Joss it was changed up a lot and

3778
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
while I am very very very very

3779
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
very disappointed in the person he turned out to be

3780
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
at the time I was like should I need

3781
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
to see this and then I

3782
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
heard they ruined it so I never saw it

3783
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Cia Tiberi in chat says Freddy vs. Jason vs.

3784
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Alien vs. Predator Ultimate Football

3785
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
why did you leave out Ash though? I'm just kidding

3786
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
well because he would just own them all with his chainsaw

3787
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
hand and Michael

3788
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Myers come on Cia Tiberi

3789
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
jeez

3790
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
and now doing seriously on that one I don't

3791
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
think that those are series that could be

3792
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
combined because the slasher

3793
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
movies are different than the creature horror

3794
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
right but Mortal Kombat

3795
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
10 brought or I guess

3796
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
you are supposed to say Mortal Kombat X in that one

3797
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
but it did bring over

3798
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
because Predator is in

3799
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
that right and but it's mostly humanoid

3800
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
yeah I guess that's true so it would work

3801
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
in that and they do have some kind

3802
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
of creature people magic

3803
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
it wasn't one of the Call of Duty

3804
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
games didn't they have like you know

3805
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
this whole thing with like Predator in there and

3806
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I thought like they also had

3807
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I don't know I feel like

3808
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
these horror movie icons just randomly pop

3809
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
up in all your favorite video games like I'm waiting

3810
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
for like Hello Kitty world featuring

3811
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
you know yes yes

3812
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
predator I'm done

3813
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I'm down with let's see that

3814
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Hello Kitty vs. Predator Team Sonic

3815
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Racing you know who you need

3816
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
to be in those carts predator

3817
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
the predator why not

3818
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
it's canon because

3819
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
you know we saw in the trailer or something

3820
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
some sort of video we saw that the predator

3821
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
was driving a tank so there you go

3822
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
ok Dar Sacro what video

3823
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
game do you want to insert the predator in to make better

3824
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
DDR

3825
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
dance or die

3826
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
dance or die well could you just

3827
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I mean I'm sure they've done a skin

3828
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
for like a dancer being the predator

3829
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
but I would just jam with the predator

3830
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
as my avatar on the screen

3831
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I like dance or die

3832
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
or like 2DX and he would literally scratch

3833
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
the thing

3834
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
and if you lose he like stabs you

3835
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
let's see

3836
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I want the predator to show up at Mario Party

3837
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
when my friends

3838
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
piss me off Smash Brothers

3839
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
is an assist

3840
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
pulls out Mario's spine

3841
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000

is from Rama. Hi Rama

3920
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
um good evening everyone

3921
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
so Rob as per our brief discussion

3922
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
ABC is bringing back Card Sharks

3923
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
and Press Your Luck

3924
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
have you thought about streaming on Twitch yourself

3925
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
playing game show video games

3926
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I think that would be pretty fun

3927
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
yes I

3928
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
well okay yes and no

3929
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
so I have not thought about myself playing

3930
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
game show video games although I think

3931
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
that's a pretty rad idea and I think I'm going to do it

3932
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I think I will play those games it would be fun

3933
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
to play with people online as well

3934
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
have I thought about streaming

3935
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
game show content before

3936
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
yes

3937
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
that's all I'm going to say for now

3938
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
also my next two questions for the entire

3939
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
staff. One, what game show would you

3940
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
love to host? Fuck me

3941
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Press Your Luck, I

3942
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
oh my god without hesitation that would be such a fun show

3943
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
to host and I wanted to be a game show host

3944
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
when I grew up by the way and this is about as close

3945
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
as I get to live out that fantasy so

3946
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
I really wouldn't want to do any except

3947
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
maybe Family Feud because I think

3948
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I could out Steve Harvey, Steve Harvey

3949
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
okay I'm pretty good at

3950
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
looks with the really fake like

3951
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I can't believe they said

3952
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
that he doesn't do an I can't believe

3953
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
they said that he just gives people this look

3954
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
like bitch what

3955
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
which is what I would say

3956
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
okay bitch what no

3957
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
you can't say that on TV go back

3958
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
to your desk

3959
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
uh Sia Tabiri in chat says would you

3960
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
do like a Jackbox games night that actually

3961
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
seems like a really obvious idea that we just haven't done

3962
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
yet I think we'll have to we should plan like a vog

3963
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Jackbox night that'd be fun

3964
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
yeah yeah we gotta get your game show

3965
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Loki my game show

3966
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
what game show do you want to host? I would host

3967
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Double Dare

3968
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
no

3969
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Double Dare is kind of boring

3970
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Bumper Stumpers to come back

3971
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
what? Bumper Stumpers

3972
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
it was like a license plate

3973
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
base game yeah we had to translate the

3974
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
license plate but it was like answering trivia

3975
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
questions with license plates or something like that got it okay

3976
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
um we'll just do like

3977
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
uh I'll say Starrcade

3978
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
yeah well fuck why didn't I say

3979
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
that that should have been my number one pick

3980
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
uh he

3981
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
he put a sandbag on the question

3982
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
by bringing up pressure luck earlier in the email

3983
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
so Starrcade

3984
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
but it's a clue it's a it's a

3985
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
tie both alright two

3986
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
what game show would you like to be on

3987
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Rob we know at Supermarket Sweep so you can't say that one

3988
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
pressure luck

3989
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I would also

3990
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
say Starrcade

3991
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
it's not on TV anymore so I guess

3992
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
you can say Supermarket Sweep I'm the only one forbidden

3993
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
from saying Supermarket Sweep I don't know what things

3994
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
cost at the supermarket anymore

3995
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
honestly I want to be on Jeopardy before

3996
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Alex Trebek dies

3997
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
oh my god Bobby Black Wolf nail on the head

3998
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
The Mole I didn't even think

3999
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
of that as a game show but I guess at its core it is

4000
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
The Mole is the greatest reality

4001
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
show they ever made and it is a crime

4002
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
that it is not on TV because

4003
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
none of you assholes were watching it

4004
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and it was a great like

4005
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Anderson Cooper as a fucking bitch

4006
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
hosting a show was

4007
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
divine

4008
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
it was great I love The Mole it was there was

4009
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
never a better reality show I really like those reality shows

4010
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
like that but it's except for Drag Race

4011
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
it's different it's not

4012
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
it wasn't I don't know

4013
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I can't explain it but a show like

4014
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
The Mole felt more James Bond

4015
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
than it did Real Housewives of Atlanta

4016
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
if that makes sense

4017
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I mean there was the episode

4018
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
or the revival season where the one

4019
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
chick told the guy I'm gonna kill you in your sleep

4020
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
but that was you know that was

4021
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
just one moment I don't know

4022
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
a good game show would be To Catch a Predator

4023
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
it's not a game show

4024
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
no but I already know

4025
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
prizes but then we could bring the

4026
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
predator in no no no

4027
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
and it's a whole different show then I always

4028
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
feel like the family got

4029
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
something when they caught the shit

4030
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
to catch a predator with the

4031
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
predator well if

4032
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
you see the the the human predator

4033
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
gets stabbed by the predator

4034
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
that would be awesome alright anyway

4035
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
a fifth

4036
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
dream today says Rob should replace

4037
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Julie Chen on Big Brother I

4038
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
really appreciate that comment but first

4039
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
I don't know what show would y'all see

4040
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
me on cause I don't really

4041
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
think I would be on a game show

4042
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
truth or consequences

4043
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
focus on the consequences

4044
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
it was a very old show

4045
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I'm just thinking the consequences part

4046
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
what was the other one with Chuck

4047
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Woolery one of those other USA

4048
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Network ones not Scrabble

4049
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
there was Bumper Stumpers Scrabble

4050
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
and there was

4051
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
he hosted when

4052
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Millionaire was really big he'd agreed

4053
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
this was around the same

4054
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
era in the late 80s

4055
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Love Connection

4056
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Love Connection wasn't the other one I was thinking of

4057
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I would be on Hollywood Squares

4058
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
but I want like what's his

4059
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
face to come back from the dead

4060
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
and be on it with me

4061
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
oh god

4062
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Paul Inn

4063
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I want to be on there with Paul Inn

4064
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
and Carol Channing

4065
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
if I could do like

4066
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
you would also have to be brought back from the dead

4067
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
you want to do zombie Hollywood Squares

4068
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
no I don't want it to be zombie

4069
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
but you want all these celebrities back from the dead

4070
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
no I want it to be like time travel

4071
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
kidnap Hollywood Squares

4072
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
but somehow

4073
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
drag queens are involved as well

4074
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
and also not only

4075
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
would I have Carol Channing

4076
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I would have Stalker Channing

4077
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
and Channing Tatum so they could be a diagonal

4078
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
this is the weirdest Bill and Ted

4079
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I've ever seen

4080
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
we're kidnapping all of these people

4081
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
from different timelines that put them on the Hollywood

4082
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Squares

4083
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
that should be my comic

4084
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
is the

4085
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
time travel kidnapping Hollywood Squares

4086
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
I don't know why I'm laughing it's so stupid

4087
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
and the top square

4088
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
it's brilliant that's why we need to make it a movie

4089
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
and the bottom square would be the predator

4090
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
it's such a stupid plot

4091
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
but what else are people doing

4092
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
is remaking movies

4093
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
so that's it for now take care

4094
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
and see you all on the flip side

4095
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
oh it was an email of course it was

4096
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
well did you hear how I ended it

4097
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
no I'm sorry I missed it because I was laughing

4098
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
that's it for now take care and see you all on the flip side

4099
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
alright

4100
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
delete and next

4101
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Dear Orange Lounge Radio

4102
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
I hope this email finds you well

4103
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
as I am currently typing it while in the bathroom at work

4104
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
thank you

4105
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
you're listening to KTMI

4106
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
too much information all the time

4107
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
randomly an OLR quote

4108
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
came to mind that had me giggling

4109
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
uh oh I said it too

4110
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
a long time ago Jamie shouted Uranus

4111
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
during an OLR episode

4112
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
to which Rob countered with something along the lines of

4113
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
not having this conversation

4114
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
as host of the show do you have a

4115
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
favorite funny memory of it that comes to mind

4116
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
every so often thanks for eating

4117
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
and I love you guys sincerely Garth Wolf

4118
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I don't know oh that's a tough one

4119
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I like drinking and

4120
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
seeing the wall

4121
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
kicking and

4122
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
oh god I try to forget that

4123
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
eating half a box of waffles

4124
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
thank you Loki

4125
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
can you imagine if episodes 1 through 100

4126
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
like 1 through 100 would be like

4127
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
the pre podcast era

4128
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
when like there was no

4129
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
structure to this show

4130
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
there was absolutely no structure to this show

4131
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
and it was just like we take a break every now and then

4132
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
it was floppy boobs

4133
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
it was a mess can you imagine if that had been on Twitch

4134
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
like that's why I was saying earlier

4135
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I don't want 13 million followers cause somebody would find

4136
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
those shows

4137
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
it would be like triple D's with no bra

4138
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
that's what they're like

4139
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
painful and floppy

4140
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I mean but there were some good times there really were some good times

4141
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
in those eras

4142
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
the first thing that comes to mind

4143
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
that I think of regularly

4144
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
and it's still like I'll be in the most

4145
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
random place and I think of it

4146
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
and Deep Fried Rice by Loki

4147
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
it's a Loki moment but it wasn't on the show

4148
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
it was when we were interviewed

4149
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
on the news and the only

4150
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
clip they put in of Loki without

4151
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
even his name on it is just him

4152
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
going oh it's so much fun

4153
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
yeah

4154
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
the greatest thing it's on YouTube

4155
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
somewhere I think on the old ass

4156
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
orange songs radio YouTube channel we haven't touched in like 10 years

4157
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
my old newspaper finally destroyed itself

4158
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
like I had the newspaper I had

4159
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
saved with all that

4160
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
it's all like destroyed

4161
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
mine's very yellow

4162
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
but I have it in like this plastic

4163
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
thing that keeps it kind of straight

4164
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
so where they had a picture of my foot

4165
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
okay real quick

4166
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
for the listeners who haven't heard this story and I apologize

4167
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
cause some of you have heard this several times

4168
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
but many years ago when podcasting

4169
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
was first becoming a thing and like

4170
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
it just got onto iTunes

4171
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
and was getting out there of course everybody

4172
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
wanted to talk about podcasting so our local news

4173
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
station I guess put like

4174
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Sacramento podcast into iTunes

4175
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
and found us so they came out

4176
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
and we did like a fake show for them

4177
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
that they could shoot and then they interviewed

4178
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
each of us about the show and so each of us

4179
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
kind of have a little talking head moment in the

4180
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
clip about it and I think I'm

4181
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
probably saying something about like why

4182
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
L.R. started dark sakura talks

4183
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
about you know why she does it as a

4184
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
hobby or whatever and then the only

4185
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
thing they usually they don't even put his name at the bottom of the

4186
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
screen or whatever it's like it's some type of follow

4187
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
up to a comment it's just him going oh it's

4188
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
so much fun and then that's it

4189
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
and when we

4190
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
saw that back on the news Loki's reaction

4191
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
that was like fucking really

4192
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
there

4193
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
was at least like several

4194
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
minutes of footage and they like took

4195
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
like this fraction of a second that's what

4196
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
it's like to be on reality TV by the way

4197
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
there's just that that whole anyway

4198
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
um but with the new

4199
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
segment which I really now that we are a video show

4200
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
one of these days I need to like clip it and put it on

4201
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
but I just technically it's not ours

4202
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
let's do it next week who cares no one's

4203
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
gonna care they're not gonna who cares

4204
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
um but what was the other thing I was

4205
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
gonna say with that um

4206
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000

02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000

02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
never mentioned the name of our show

4209
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
remember that yeah that was stupid

4210
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000

they show the dude

4214
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
searching for it so you can see

4215
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000

but they never say it's orange lounge radio

4222
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
which was just

4223
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
kind of the um

4224
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
the the the the

4225
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
topping of the cake yes

4226
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
anyway

4227
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
somebody thank you tiger claw dug up

4228
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
dug up the article and put it in our chat

4229
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
so there it is

4230
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
oh lord

4231
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
SSG100 Matt reminded

4232
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
me of another moment it was

4233
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
peppermint time and mint but that was

4234
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
a that was a horde house joke

4235
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
I'm really

4236
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
just trying to think of stuff

4237
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
cause it's like just little clips just from

4238
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
around the show but maybe not

4239
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
during the show like like the fried

4240
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
you know corn flaked coated

4241
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
rice balls when

4242
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Loki got a deep fryer

4243
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
and waffles

4244
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
and dunk

4245
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
see I don't the funny moments

4246
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
are good and and I

4247
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I appreciate those as well but I also

4248
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
remember like a lot of like a lot of not to be

4249
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
too sappy but a lot of the serious stuff like

4250
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
jumps out like we

4251
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
did a live broadcast

4252
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
from Pier 39 on the internet

4253
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
before anybody

4254
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
did something like that

4255
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
like we did that and that was what probably

4256
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
would have been the year 2003 that we did that

4257
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
uh that's awesome

4258
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
um some of the great emails

4259
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
that have come through the years

4260
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
you know the part of the motivation that's kept me

4261
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
doing the show where who's become our friends

4262
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
oh god for sure friends that we made

4263
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
people that will email and say um

4264
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I had to help accepting

4265
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
my sexuality because you're out there presenting

4266
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
yourself Rob and I saw some of

4267
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
myself and you and that people telling me to

4268
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
get in the kitchen but that's not a

4269
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
positive thing but you know what

4270
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I positively think those people are morons

4271
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
well you know what though

4272
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I think despite the fact that that's shitty

4273
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
and I'm not gonna talk positive

4274
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
you know how much of a shit I give about it well I think

4275
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
but it helped you I think in the beginning you

4276
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
were kind of like what the fuck is

4277
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
like you know but it kind of like I think helped you

4278
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
like I cranked the

4279
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
feminism to 11 yes

4280
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
it's like that art project

4281
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
complicit in my own

4282
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
discrimination and then

4283
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
hyper feminist

4284
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
not shutting up

4285
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
uh see it to bury in chat with

4286
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
a newer moment saying I remember that time

4287
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
rob mangled the carlton dance and

4288
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
loki refused to floss see that's something a little bit newer

4289
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
and uh thanks

4290
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
or no thanks to the twitch clip

4291
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
clipping feature which I just saw my earlier

4292
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
laughing fit popped up as a clip

4293
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
around your butt I'm sure now some

4294
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
of these moments are probably gonna be frozen in time

4295
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
so that'll be it'll be interesting to see the

4296
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
the result of that but that's okay

4297
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Matt also brings up that we broke the news of bin laden

4298
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
oh yes

4299
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
some of the serious shit that happens like right in the middle

4300
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
of our show we've really had a lot

4301
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000

02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
metal mayhem says I still remember

4344
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
rob's epic diva fit

4345
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
you know that's not a moment I really look back on

4346
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
fondly but and do you that all

4347
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
was on um

4348
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
justin tv yeah that was

4349
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
the time when we were doing this for the first time on justin

4350
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
tv that whole diva fit happened and I

4351
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
remember cause part of what made that so

4352
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
funny slash interesting is that I

4353
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
stormed off and loki just

4354
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
without skipping a beat goes alright

4355
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
then let's go on to the next snake

4356
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
story like uh he's he's trying to be

4357
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
professional in the moment or whatever and then I think

4358
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
he reads the story and then I come back and I'm like I've got something

4359
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
to say well also

4360
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
dj rama s points out that we spawned other

4361
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
shows oh yeah that's

4362
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
that's quite the compliment abs

4363
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
absolutely she hulk misses the fus

4364
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
well

4365
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
but keep in mind that there was a period of time

4366
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
for sure where gamers

4367
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
didn't necessarily need to be associated with negativity

4368
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
if you want fus just read my twitter

4369
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
we

4370
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
can still do them once in a while we haven't done one in a while

4371
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
what are you doing real quick I don't have the music

4372
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
we'll just do a quick one you wanna do a quick fus

4373
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000

4374
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
insert music here

4375
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
okay alright so

4376
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
fu goes to

4377
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
capitalism

4378
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
and misogyny

4379
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
your turn uh my fu of the week

4380
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
goes to myself for not going to the gym

4381
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
today because I slept for 10 hours

4382
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
um because I've been so tired today

4383
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
uh and fu to

4384
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
um uh just

4385
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
yeah I think I think today was definitely

4386
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
a crash and burn day I think yesterday and today have

4387
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
both been like just crash and burn days

4388
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
between like Vegas and go go go

4389
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
and all this other stuff like I think I've just

4390
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
like emotionally and physically like

4391
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
crap and then I hosted a show Friday night too so

4392
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
I think I emotionally and physically crashed and

4393
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
burned these past couple days and it's not the best feeling

4394
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
in the world but um

4395
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
doing this show is pepping me up I do have one

4396
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
more cause it's very important alright hurry my uterus

4397
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
for cramps well

4398
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
sorry to hear it okay alright Loki

4399
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
last not least um

4400
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
I guess my fu

4401
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
was uh to

4402
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
my migraine but it's gone now so I don't know

4403
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I'm glad your migraine is gone

4404
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
you were right the caffeine helped apparently all that

4405
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
caffeine did it along

4406
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
with the other stuff um and that's

4407
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
just for now alright

4408
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
that was it for emails right yes

4409
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
okay then I suppose this video game podcast should

4410
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
get back into some uh video game topics

4411
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
huh let's let's do

4412
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
it back into the gaming news oh uh but please feel

4413
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
free to email us in the future participate at

4414
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
orangesontrader.com but meanwhile Loki

4415
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
so Valve's gonna start cracking down on

4416
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
some of these review bombs that have nothing

4417
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
to do with necessarily

4418
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
um maybe reviewing

4419
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
the games it's more of like

4420
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I guess people using the platform to

4421
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
um

4422
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
attack other

4423
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
things that they don't like

4424
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
like for example I guess

4425
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
would be if

4426
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
said company was coming

4427
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
out with a decision that somebody didn't

4428
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
like so they took you know their previous

4429
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
game they released and review bombed it because they didn't

4430
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
like a certain decision or something like that

4431
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
so what they're gonna do is try to identify

4432
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
those and then remove those

4433
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
uh from the way it calculates

4434
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
uh the review scores

4435
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
based on those types of reviews

4436
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
uh they're saying that the reviews themselves

4437
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
are being left untouched but

4438
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
and if they want if people want to dig into

4439
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
them you'll still be able to do so but

4440
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
they're making it clear that you know

4441
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
the ones that are

4442
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
gonna be I guess highlighted or whatever are gonna be

4443
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
not those ones that are off

4444
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
topic well good

4445
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I like when I go in to read game reviews

4446
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
I don't need to hear about what people think about the

4447
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
policies of the company or the

4448
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
company or something that was said on Twitter

4449
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
or some comment that somebody affiliated

4450
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I just want to know is the game good

4451
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
yes or no that's what I

4452
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
want to hear about so I'm glad they're

4453
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
gonna try to do something about it I mean it seems

4454
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
like that's an awfully big undertaking for a store

4455
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
like Steam which is barely managed as

4456
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
it is to undertake but to do anything I

4457
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
know I was like we'll see

4458
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
it's a nice thought

4459
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
did they ever take down the rape game

4460
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
oh sure of course they did good but

4461
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
the you know the fact that

4462
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
it went up in the first place

4463
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
because Steam

4464
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
doesn't really moderate a lot of things so it's

4465
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
interesting to see that Steam is suddenly gonna moderate this

4466
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
this is yeah a little

4467
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
like hmm how's that gonna

4468
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
work I don't know anyway

4469
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
uh Kaijuto in our chat over at

4470
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Twitch TV slash vog network says I don't like

4471
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
the review bombs but I think Valve is making a

4472
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
big mistake you have to let the community

4473
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
police that stuff people are smart

4474
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
they know a bomb review from a normal one

4475
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
they need to not attach the game score

4476
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
to the review I think review

4477
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
uh user review should be unscored

4478
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
for sure I think that would be a great way to

4479
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
start but anyway

4480
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
yeah yeah

4481
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
uh interesting retort by Bobby

4482
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Blackwolf that I think is very succinctly

4483
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
put uh Bobby Blackwolf

4484
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
response to Kaijuto saying a person

4485
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
is smart people are

4486
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
dumb a fucking

4487
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
that is a very succinct

4488
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
good comment

4489
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
gold star comment of the week

4490
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I can't believe we're gonna

4491
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
keep it in the family so to speak

4492
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
and people will claim that nepotism is coming

4493
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
into play and the fact that he does the show

4494
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
before ours but I think Bobby is deserving of the gold star

4495
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
of the week for that comment

4496
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
alright moving on

4497
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
uh let's move on to uh something that

4498
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
uh ooh it's uh

4499
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
a little rough for the folks involved uh

4500
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
over at Axiom Verge

4501
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
uh it has to do with developer versus publisher

4502
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
uh of course if you haven't

4503
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
played Axiom Verge it's uh really cool

4504
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
it's a little uh super metroid-ish type of game

4505
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
uh it was free on epic store

4506
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
epic game store

4507
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
the epic game store for a little

4508
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
bit um it was free there but

4509
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
not anymore but you could buy it and it would be

4510
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
worth your money if you haven't picked it up one of several

4511
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
other ways um the game is still

4512
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
supposed to get a physical release on Wii U

4513
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
I don't know why you would

4514
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
bother at this point but I guess because they promised

4515
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
it or what have you they're gonna deliver

4516
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
well I think that's through that uh

4517
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
the one company oh limited run? yeah limited run

4518
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
okay so it's a collector release

4519
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
okay that makes a lot more sense uh yes

4520
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
the distributor limited run

4521
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
game and the business manager

4522
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
have said that the publisher Badland

4523
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
game still owes them a quarter million dollars

4524
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
so what happened is that

4525
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
limited run says that Badland owes it

4526
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
$78,000 for physical copies of the game

4527
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
that it never delivered and then Badland

4528
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
did not pay Tom Happ

4529
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
the one man band that made Axiom Verge

4530
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
uh the sum of about $200,000

4531
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
that was also

4532
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
there was supposed to be money that was gonna pay for medical treatments

4533
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
for Tom Happ's kid

4534
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
which I seem to remember has come up with

4535
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
this game before is that you know

4536
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
he's been using the money to pay

4537
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
a lot for medical related things for his

4538
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
kid which you know is obviously

4539
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
you know nobody likes to see a sick kid so a lot of people

4540
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
are happy to support this game to know that that's where

4541
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
some of the money is going uh and so

4542
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
this is you know now it's getting ugly because it's

4543
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
on Twitter and now um let's

4544
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
see uh Adelman who is uh

4545
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
the business manager with limited run

4546
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
the game's Dan Adelman says Badland has

4547
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
literally stolen money from a disabled toddler

4548
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
that's basically what he's saying on Twitter

4549
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
yikes so uh

4550
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
anyhow this is uh very ugly

4551
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
between the two of them nobody was

4552
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
commenting in an article that Kotaku ran earlier

4553
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
this week and uh don't know

4554
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
what this is gonna do if this

4555
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
is gonna impact that Wii U release

4556
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
I don't think it will but um

4557
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
it'll be interesting to see how that whole uh

4558
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
dragging through the mud and all that will

4559
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
possibly change things so they're

4560
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
saying we were still planning on dividing up the proceeds

4561
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
on the original terms

4562
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
so uh 6,000 copies of the Wii U

4563
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
edition were made there's a soundtrack an art book

4564
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
and other extras so it

4565
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
paid Badland oh it's coming on the Wii U

4566
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
yeah I kept thinking Switch

4567
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
it's out on the Switch right man

4568
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
why are you so late on the Wii U? Collectors

4569
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
that's why I said the whole time

4570
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
right so anyway

4571
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
I kept hearing Wii U or like hearing Switch

4572
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
instead of Wii U I was like oh okay Switch that makes sense

4573
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
and it's like Wii U wait what

4574
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
why no

4575
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
alright

4576
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
anyhow

4577
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
oh Bobby is admitting that that quote he said

4578
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
came from some movie but I didn't recognize

4579
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
it cause he's thanking the chat for

4580
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
not saying what movie we may have to revoke the star

4581
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
cause it's not an original quote

4582
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
alright

4583
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
you get a half star alright let's move

4584
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
on uh Dark Sakura what do you have for us

4585
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
we're almost uh to the call segment but not just

4586
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
yet but Dark Sakura well there's been a

4587
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
rash of arrests made um

4588
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
in uh

4589
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Ahmedabad

4590
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Ahmedabad I always

4591
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
mispronounce it but there were

4592
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
people who were arrested across the state

4593
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
after playing PUBG

4594
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
um because um several

4595
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
um the games of actually games

4596
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
of that line online multiplayer games

4597
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
were banned on

4598
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
the grounds that it was leading to

4599
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
violent behavior among children and

4600
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
and younger people they arrested

4601
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
three people in different

4602
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
parts um of the

4603
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
area after they were caught playing the game

4604
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
and um the police

4605
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
commissioner issued a notice

4606
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
banning even more of that

4607
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
uh starting uh it actually started

4608
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
on the 14th so they

4609
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
were booked under section 188

4610
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
the disobedience to

4611
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
fully uh to order

4612
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
duly promulgated by public servant

4613
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
of the Indian Penal Code

4614
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
so stupid but that's

4615
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
what's going on in the world this is like the movie Footloose

4616
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
all of a sudden you can't so you can't

4617
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
play PUBG in public

4618
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
any first person online multiplayer game

4619
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
wow

4620
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
yep interesting cultural

4621
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
differences being discussed tonight

4622
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
that's for sure between March

4623
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
12th and 13th Rajkot

including six college students

4626
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000

wow

4628
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
alright I guess uh

4629
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
for all the things we complain about

4630
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
sometimes it sure could be a lot worse

4631
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
we may not even be able to play video games

4632
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000

4633
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000

02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Earth so if you go to Google Earth

02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
um they actually have an option now

4648
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
catch Carmen San Diego

4649
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000

4650
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
that's you know Where in the World

4651
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
is Carmen San Diego and follow

4652
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
clues and has it been updated for Modern

4653
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Maps? Well it's a great

4654
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
advertisement tie-in for

4655
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
the new Netflix series is what it is

4656
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
yeah so it's pretty

4657
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
awesome and you get clues and you go

4658
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
off to find Carmen

4659
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
San Diego and

4660
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
yeah that's pretty cool

4661
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
I think that's a cute modernization

4662
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I mean you know using Google

4663
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Earth but still at the core

4664
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
having uh Carmen San Diego

4665
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
be about you know learning about these different cities

4666
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
and the the artifacts and the

4667
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
uh museums and the places

4668
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
of interest that are in these cities and kind of learning

4669
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
what's where what's the capital of what I mean

4670
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
that's you know that's what those games are all about

4671
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
I'm surprised that's not a thing that's

4672
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
like a Niantic game

4673
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
you know like not necessarily

4674
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
world traveling but like within

4675
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
your area within your neighborhood like trying

4676
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
to find Carmen San Diego

4677
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
or one of her henchmen or something like

4678
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
that um I don't think Niantic hasn't done anything

4679
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
like that like you know and maybe they're

4680
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
worried about flooding

4681
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
where in your hood is Cory Santiago

4682
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
yeah I don't know yeah where in your neighborhood

4683
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
where in your neighborhood is this

4684
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I have heard about live event

4685
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
producers so it's been this article that's

4686
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
been floating around my Facebook um because

4687
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
people think of me when they think of Clue the movie

4688
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
which I appreciate it is my all time favorite movie

4689
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
um but I guess they're doing like

4690
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
a live Clue event here locally

4691
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
like it's like some type of late but it's not

4692
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
it's not really the board game Clue it's just like a murder

4693
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
mystery thing that's like themed on Clue I guess

4694
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
but my point is I think

4695
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
they use a phone app that

4696
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
you like you pay money to play

4697
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
this event and then you get all the updates through the phone

4698
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
app and I've heard of this being a thing

4699
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
lately because this isn't the first thing that I heard of

4700
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I also remember seeing something for like

4701
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
an amazing race

4702
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
style thing but it's

4703
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
all through the phone but here's what they do

4704
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
like they offer like a big prize to the winner

4705
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
but they let like thousands of people

4706
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
sign up for like 20 bucks a pop

4707
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
and like the winner gets maybe like $10,000

4708
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
so it sounds like a lot of money but it's not nearly

4709
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
as much as these guys are making off it so

4710
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
they give that prize and then not only that

4711
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
but like if you get stumped along the way and some

4712
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
of the clues are like really hard you have to pay

4713
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
for more clues oh that's lame get it

4714
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
so pay to win

4715
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
that's a thing but that isn't

4716
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
keep an eye on that stuff because

4717
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
somebody's making money

4718
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
off these live event games

4719
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
not Niantic but definitely these like

4720
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
neighborhood event

4721
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
day type of things

4722
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
so that's a thing you probably see you probably

4723
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
seen these advertised on Facebook in your neighborhood as well

4724
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
so anyhow

4725
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
alright is that

4726
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
hmm I have regrets

4727
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
oh from eating that donut that you were showing off

4728
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
amazing but like there's a few

4729
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
foods that will always make me sick and I know

4730
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
better and I don't give a shit

4731
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
ice cream

4732
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
and donuts

4733
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
it's like me and coffee my doctor told me to stop

4734
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
drinking coffee and I was like we're gonna have to negotiate this

4735
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
cause you and I both know it's not gonna happen

4736
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
so we negotiated

4737
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
anyway

4738
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
one more story and this is about

4739
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Snapchat cause I'm sure

4740
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
lots of you guys here in studio use Snapchat

4741
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
right

4742
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I don't know I guess

4743
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I've used Snapchat it's very

4744
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
similar to Instagram has the stories

4745
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
which they kind of stole from Snapchat

4746
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
but Snapchat is another way

4747
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
and Snapchat is also kind of like

4748
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
a lot of people associate

4749
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
it with like people

4750
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
sending nudes to each other because they're supposed to

4751
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
self destruct in 24 hours or whatever

4752
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
so this is of course you know

4753
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
cause that's how the internet works

4754
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
that's how anything works right we've talked about the whole

4755
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
time to penis before so of course

4756
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
they put a thing like Snapchat out where it's like

4757
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
the picture self destruct in 24 hours

4758
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
you know that

4759
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
it's supposed to tell you when a screenshot is taken

4760
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
but there's all sorts of ways

4761
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
nothing you send is

4762
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
truly that type of private

4763
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
but whatever

4764
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
oh it's that type of private alright

4765
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I left myself wide open with that joke

4766
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
alright anyway my point with this

4767
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
is Snapchat they are trying to get away

4768
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
from being known as the app where you send nude pics

4769
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
they're trying to do more event based things

4770
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
and stories like on Instagram

4771
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
and maybe this is something they want to do as well

4772
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
supposedly Snap is going to be launching

4773
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
a gaming platform

4774
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
as well it's

4775
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
it's a rumor right now it's apparently

4776
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
code named Project Cognac

4777
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
within the Snapchat walls

4778
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
externally developed games

4779
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
that will work inside the Snapchat app

4780
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
they are saying that it will be similar to like

4781
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Facebook's games in the messenger

4782
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
which I think I've talked about and then

4783
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
never played in messenger

4784
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
on the phone like I know it's a thing I did the

4785
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Pacman thing like once that's it

4786
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
but supposedly Snapchat would be something like that

4787
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
it'd be like an instant game so I guess you could

4788
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
like play it against friends it may also involve

4789
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
streaming of eSports events

4790
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
you know around the world which you know that's

4791
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
a little more like that is one part of

4792
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Snapchat that's interesting that I don't think

4793
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
I think Instagram

4794
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
does this but it's harder but on

4795
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Snapchat there's like a big map of the world

4796
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
and if somebody's made their story public

4797
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
you can watch public stories

4798
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
so you can go to places of interest like

4799
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
museums and stuff and see

4800
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
people in real time like submitting Snaps

4801
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
from these places of interest and I think that's

4802
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
one of the cooler features of it

4803
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
but anyway they want to put gaming into it

4804
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
so because Snap has been

4805
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
struggling to increase their user growth

4806
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
probably because Instagram

4807
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
is offering a very similar thing but Instagram

4808
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
is also owned by Facebook

4809
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
which is a whole other thing so anyway

4810
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
it should be noted that Snap had recently

4811
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
acquired an Australian gaming company

4812
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
called Pretty Great

4813
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
and also a web based startup

4814
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
called Play Canvas

4815
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
so they think the unveil

4816
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
could be around April 4th

4817
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
which is when Snap has a

4818
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
developer conference scheduled in Los Angeles

4819
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
but it's certainly possible that

4820
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
something could come up around

4821
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
GDC as well but it seems like

4822
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Snap may decide to

4823
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
keep that for their own conference

4824
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
that they are having on

4825
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
April 4th so there it is

4826
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
with that

4827
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
that is the last scheduled story we have for tonight

4828
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
so I think we're going to go to some listener

4829
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
calls and participation

4830
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
if you want to ask us a question in chat over

4831
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
twitch.tv slash vog network you sure can

4832
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
but we also want to talk

4833
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
to some of our listeners and take some calls

4834
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
and then we'll get last minute stories as well

4835
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
so I see a call sitting on the

4836
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
line and they've mentioned what they want to talk about

4837
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
and this sounds like a topic I would like to hear

4838
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
about so let's get to it. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

4839
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Hey this is Marcus

4840
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
or PixelPakas

4841
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
it's so great to hear from you

4842
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
we see you all the time in chat but not

4843
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
as often on the phone it's great to hear from you

4844
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
what's on your mind tonight PixelPakas?

4845
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Not much

4846
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
I just sort of wanted to talk about this event

4847
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
I went to this weekend

4848
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
called Arcade Expo

4849
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
and it is

4850
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
a convention or whatever basically

4851
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
where they have

4852
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
over 1000

4853
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
pinball machines

4854
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
and arcade machines

4855
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
it's one of these type of things

4856
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
like we have it like California Extreme

4857
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
and I know Bobby

4858
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
really loves the Southern Fried Game Room Expo

4859
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
they do in Atlanta. Where is this expo?

4860
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
So

4861
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
it's in Southern California

4862
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
kind of in the middle of nowhere

4863
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
if you know where Banning is

4864
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I do because I saw an

4865
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
ad for this on Facebook because I was looking

4866
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
into going to it but I didn't

4867
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
because I had a conflict on Friday night

4868
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
yeah so

4869
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
it's there where there's basically nothing else

4870
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
except for I guess

4871
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
this is actually a

4872
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
museum of pinball where they hosted it

4873
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
which I had never heard of before either

4874
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
at least that one I know there's one in like Vegas

4875
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
but I think they're totally separate

4876
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
either way it was like

4877
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
tons of

4878
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
games

4879
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
open for hours you know from like

4880
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
11 to 2 AM

4881
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
and it was just kind of

4882
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
awesome how much

4883
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
there was and

4884
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
it actually wasn't super crowded basically

4885
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
if you wanted to play a game you wouldn't have to wait

4886
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
in a long line for the most part except for like a

4887
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
couple new pinball machines like were super

4888
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
crowded everything else is

4889
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
you'd be able to either just walk up and stop playing

4890
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
or you would just wait for one person to

4891
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
like finish their game and then you could jump in

4892
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
so

4893
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
it was really great

4894
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
they had a bunch of other stuff you know

4895
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
it wasn't just the

4896
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
pinball and arcade machines they had

4897
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
some panels

4898
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
some like movies that they were

4899
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
showing you know all gaming related

4900
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
chiptune artists were there as

4901
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
well playing music at night

4902
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
they had some arcade machines outside

4903
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
so you could play like Under the Stars

4904
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
or whatever lots of food

4905
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
themed food

4906
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
they had tater tots shaped like

4907
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
tetrominoes

4908
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
so it was

4909
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
just a really cool fun event

4910
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
that I had never heard of before

4911
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
until like this week and

4912
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
decided to go to it

4913
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
well that sounds like a lot of fun

4914
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
it definitely sounds just very similar to

4915
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
the California Extreme event that happens

4916
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
up here Santa Clara

4917
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
right? It was at the same hotel where

4918
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
GamerX4 was at right?

4919
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
right next to the convention center near the stadium

4920
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
I think that Hyatt is where they have it

4921
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
and yeah it's a very

4922
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
similar thing except I thought the gaming

4923
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
out Under the Stars that's unique that sounds

4924
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
really cool

4925
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
now I know like when I go to these types of events

4926
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
I'm like oh my gosh I've never got to play this

4927
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
before and now I did and that's awesome

4928
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
like was there a game that you like had

4929
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
never played before that you got to play at this event

4930
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
that made you excited?

4931
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
yeah so probably

4932
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
the most interesting thing was

4933
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
that I got to play Computer Space

4934
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
which is one of like the oldest

4935
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
arcade games

4936
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
right?

4937
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
and I had seen that

4938
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
online the pictures of that like

4939
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
crazy looking cabinet and stuff

4940
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
but I'd never had the opportunity to actually put my hands

4941
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
on it and play it so that was really cool

4942
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
and then there was just a bunch of like

4943
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
old pinball machines

4944
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I've never played anything

4945
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
particularly old in the pinball

4946
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
scene so this is like

4947
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
the stuff where they don't have

4948
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
all the fancy audio and graphics

4949
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
going on it was just sort of like

4950
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
a board with some lights and then they just

4951
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
have like dinging bell noises when you hit stuff

4952
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
yeah with the scores

4953
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
on the wheels instead of an LED

4954
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
display yeah old school

4955
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
like 60's style you know we own one like that

4956
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Spanish eyes oh I didn't know you owned one

4957
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
we loaned it out to somebody but

4958
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
when I was at the Vegas Hall of Fame and I didn't

4959
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
include this in the video last week but there was like a little like

4960
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
ice skaters table that was kind of cute

4961
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
that was like that

4962
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
remember the Buggles?

4963
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
based off the Beatles?

4964
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
really? no I don't remember that one

4965
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
that's one of those 60's ones

4966
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
like if you go to these pinball halls of fame

4967
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
and there's another one

4968
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
I think you can see one in Alameda

4969
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
that I've yet to go to and I really need to

4970
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
I think Dark Soccer and I need to do a road trip out there someday

4971
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
and

4972
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
yeah it's always neat because usually

4973
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
there'll be like one row for tables

4974
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
from the 60's and 70's that are these like

4975
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
old older styles and they're really neat

4976
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
yeah

4977
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
there was a whole bunch of the older style ones

4978
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
and no one was really on them so

4979
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
it was like me and

4980
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
a bunch of them just like ringing

4981
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
bell noise you know constantly

4982
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
in this corner of the hall but it was fun

4983
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
I really enjoyed

4984
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
the whole thing apparently

4985
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
they do other events at

4986
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
this Museum of Pinball

4987
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
so even if you missed it on this one

4988
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
there's going to be something else later this year I think

4989
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
where they have another sort of similar event

4990
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
so I would definitely recommend it to anyone

4991
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
who's anywhere

4992
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
near to Southern California

4993
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
it was a blabber

4994
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
if there's something that you think would interest us

4995
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
here at O.R. you know my Twitter and all that

4996
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
because I mean we're far but we're not

4997
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
that far so like

4998
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
you know for an event like that if I had not

4999
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
already been committed to hosting an event on Friday

5000
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
night which I was I

5001
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
would have seriously considered coming down for that

5002
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
because I saw the ads on Facebook and I

5003
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
looked into it and I was like oh this just sounds like

5004
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
California Extreme but it's in LA

5005
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
ish I know it's like out there but

5006
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
you know us in Northern California

5007
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
we call everything like past

5008
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
the grapevine is LA

5009
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
so

5010
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
so it sounded

5011
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
it sounded really neat I would have gone

5012
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
yeah it's definitely worth it

5013
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
so I just wanted to sort of share that with anyone

5014
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
I was considering

5015
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
doing one of those listener

5016
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
video things but then I was like

5017
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
tired and slept too late so I didn't do it

5018
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
alright that's okay next time next time

5019
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
but yeah I mean a lot

5020
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
of big cities or metro

5021
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
areas have an event like

5022
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
this and you know the size of it

5023
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
probably depends on the size of where you are I just

5024
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
mentioned a moment ago you know Bobby has

5025
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
worked a lot with one in the Atlanta area the Southern

5026
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Friday game room gaming I always say

5027
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
game room they changed the name gaming

5028
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
so Southern Friday gaming expo

5029
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
and actually vog network

5030
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
sponsors that and if I am not mistaking

5031
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
we'll be doing so again this year

5032
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
so and I know he's a big

5033
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
proponent of that and I would love to go if I didn't already

02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
do one like week long trip

5035
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
to Atlanta every year I'd love

5036
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
to go to that event it sounds like a lot of fun but

5037
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
a lot of areas I'm sure there's one in

5038
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
the New York area I'm sure there's one

5039
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
in Chicago somewhere

5040
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
I mean all the big cities have to have something like

5041
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
this I'm sure

5042
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000

02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
or look confused your audio

5060
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
sounds distant tonight I don't know what

5061
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
is weird but try to get your

5062
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
question or comment out we'll do our best

5063
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
um

5064
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
well if you remember last week

5065
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I called in about

5066
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
possibly buying Diablo

5067
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I do

5068
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
remember that yes because we had

5069
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
spotlighted that in the little break segment

5070
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
last week so what happened

5071
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
I well

5072
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
two two things I well I

5073
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
bought it on Thursday

5074
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
this is something I

5075
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
rarely ever say

5076
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
I if a I paid

5077
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
full price

5078
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
which is not

5079
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
full price really for when the

5080
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
game first came out but sure

5081
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
well full price is

5082
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
opposed to what they normally charge

5083
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
you know I charge for the game

5084
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
on the platform

5085
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
which is rarely for me because

5086
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
I usually 99.9%

5087
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
of the time I wait

5088
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
for sales so

5089
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
me paying full price is like

5090
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
extremely

5091
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
okay yes and I do remember we were talking

5092
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
about this and I said you know weigh the pros and the cons

5093
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
and blah blah blah so you jumped in

5094
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
and so uh the question

5095
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
I would have is was it was it

5096
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
worth it though

5097
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
yes you know let's put it this way I've been

5098
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
playing it more than Magic the Galar

5099
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
so

5100
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
I know whoa

5101
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
are you never even

5102
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
my fellow

5103
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
you're not like a secretly a clone are you

5104
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
you know that's something

5105
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
uh

5106
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
that's something I always never

5107
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
say I mean you know I think

5108
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
from like breaks

5109
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
to take care of like IRL

5110
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
stuff I've been playing that

5111
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
constantly so for me

5112
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
you know there's a little bit of a difference

5113
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
between you know the PC

5114
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
version versus uh

5115
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
the PS1 version

5116
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
that I remember from way

5117
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
back in the day

5118
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
you know I'm

5119
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
I'm loving it you know

5120
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
so

5121
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
one thing I would recommend is

5122
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
that you know for

5123
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
people that

5124
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
the game back in the

5125
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
day you know be it the

5126
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
PC version or the PlayStation

5127
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
1 version

5128
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
it's you know it's

5129
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
available again and it works

5130
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
on modern machines

5131
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
are definitely worth recommending

5132
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
idiots you know granted yeah

5133
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
it's you know

5134
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
like the 20 plus year old game and

5135
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
it's not like the latest greatest game

5136
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
it's now

5137
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
you know high risk graphics

5138
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
or anything like that but still it's

5139
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
fun to sell a game it's

5140
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
definitely well worth the price point

5141
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
you know you can't go wrong

5142
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
god

5143
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
you know so

5144
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
well I mean you're cutting out a little bit so I

5145
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
want to jump in just because uh it's it's a

5146
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
little hard to um understand and some folks

5147
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
in chat are confirming it's not just me

5148
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
but it sounds like you know you are

5149
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
uh rediscovering this I still

5150
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
I'm still a little puzzled as to why

5151
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Blizzard didn't just do it through their own

5152
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
app it seems like a really weird missed

5153
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
opportunity but um okay

5154
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I mean uh maybe this

5155
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
will convince them to make Diablo 4 a little

5156
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
faster uh as opposed to a

5157
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Diablo uh mobile phone experience

5158
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
which would be just lovely if they would

5159
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
uh get on that so

5160
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
alright well um uh

5161
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
Metal Mayhem I'm gonna let you go uh just because

5162
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
we're having a little hard time understanding you but thank you so much for the call

5163
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
take care and uh have fun gaming

5164
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
alright

5165
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
uh don't see anybody else in the green

5166
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
room right now so let me

5167
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
see if we have any other

5168
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
uh

5169
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
stories last minute stories yeah to make our show roll

5170
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
but uh No Man's Sky beyond

5171
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
oh my god how did I not get this in show roll

5172
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
yes this is kind of a big deal they announced

5173
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
um so basically it's the next

5174
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
free update that's gonna be coming to No Man's

5175
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Sky and it's gonna have a ton of stuff

5176
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
to it it looks like they're kind of turning

5177
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
it into a No Man's Sky

5178
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
MMO type of thing

5179
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
um so

5180
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
yeah they basically said we

5181
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
don't consider No Man's Sky to be an MMO

5182
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
it won't require a subscription it won't contain

5183
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
microtransactions and will be free

5184
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
to all existing players

5185
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
um but yeah it's definitely

5186
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
teased and it's a new big significant

5187
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
update that they're gonna be doing

5188
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
and it's gonna be coming out uh around the summer

5189
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
so

5190
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
um it's part of

5191
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
uh yeah and that's just apparently

5192
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
one part of um

5193
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
I guess beyond which is gonna be

5194
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
three different updates

5195
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
so

5196
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
looks pretty cool

5197
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
it's pretty amazing that they're

5198
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
still continuing to support that game as strong

5199
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
as they are especially after such

5200
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
a backlash that that game had they kind of

5201
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
stayed committed to the game that they envisioned

5202
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
putting out and you know I

5203
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
think many folks have been happy with the more

5204
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
recent you know uh changes that were

5205
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
done I know I did some streams a while back

5206
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
as did Bobby uh when the the last

5207
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
No Man's Sky Next or whatever they called

5208
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
that uh the first time it was out came out and you

5209
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
know I think a lot of people were kind of happy with that game

5210
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
and where that's at but to hear that they're going

5211
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
even further is is

5212
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
is so cool I love it

5213
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
looks pretty cool yeah I'll be curious to see how that

5214
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
works as an MMO though I'm not I'm not

5215
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
too sure about it but we'll see we'll see

5216
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
so um

5217
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Kaijuto says yikes

5218
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
I hope the game can be played offline

5219
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
that's all I care about

5220
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
can't it I don't think No Man's

5221
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Sky can be played offline can it be played I

5222
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
well cause you can lose connection to the server and you

5223
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
still keep going so I think the game will

5224
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
try to put itself online cause it's for the database

5225
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
of what all the planets are named and the species and things

5226
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
like that even in the earliest versions of the game

5227
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
you weren't necessarily interacting with other people or whatever

5228
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
but like I think the game will

5229
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
function when offline

5230
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
it just won't download

5231
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
the database of what everything is

5232
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
named and so forth and you may have

5233
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
conflicts with names and all okay

5234
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Kaijuto says yes you can play offline I do it all the time

5235
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
I don't know why they would suddenly shut that off then

5236
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
yeah I don't see why

5237
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
and then there's a new game coming out from

5238
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Avalanche uh Generation

5239
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Zero which is like a survival game

5240
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
a co-op survival game it's

5241
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
um similar to I guess a little bit

5242
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
like um Horizon Zero Dawn

5243
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
but you're

5244
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
it takes place in the 80's

5245
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
and you're like these kids that come back from vacation

5246
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
and everybody's gone and there's

5247
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
these like robots hunting people down

5248
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
and it's about you surviving

5249
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
so they said you can play the game single player

5250
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
but it's going to be incredibly hard because it's

5251
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
scaled for you know four player co-op but

5252
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
um it looked interesting

5253
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
uh very similar like the

5254
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
robots you kind of go against look

5255
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
very similar to like Horizon Zero Dawn

5256
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
um but different

5257
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
obviously and that's coming

5258
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
out on the 26th as

5259
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
part of an early access thing

5260
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
I think it's only on PC though

5261
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
doesn't say if it's console but

5262
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
and then finally

5263
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
uh Paxis is right around the corner

5264
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
oh gosh and

5265
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
with Paxis I'm kind of surprised that hasn't happened already

5266
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
I thought it was in February when I went

5267
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
no March 28th

5268
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
no the snow was going really late in the year

5269
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
the year I went yeah March 28th

5270
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
in Boston and Gearbox

5271
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
already has a nice little teaser on

5272
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
their official Twitter

5273
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
showing it says March 28th Boston

5274
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
in Massachusetts it's

5275
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
fucking Borderlands 3 or it's

5276
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
another Borderlands thing because it's

5277
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
it's what it looks like somebody pointed out

5278
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
it's Exit 3 on the little

5279
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
teaser image so it's uh yeah

5280
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
it's Borderlands 3 which

5281
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
is anyone surprised that Gearbox is

5282
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
I'm not surprised and I'm excited

5283
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
excellent so alright

5284
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
well I don't see any other um calls in our

5285
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
green room waiting to go um I don't know

5286
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000

up for the night uh Loki your final thought we'll

5315
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
start with you my final thought is I'm

5316
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
gonna keep working on

5317
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
game development it's

5318
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
really hard but finally

5319
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
I don't know I'm just

5320
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
I'm trying to stick with something

5321
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
uh my final thought

5322
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
is I wanna keep going with this routine

5323
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
that I've set for myself but I also

5324
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
wanna make sure I get in some gaming time

5325
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
um this week cause I haven't

5326
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
really been playing enough single player games

5327
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
uh so I'll try to work on that this week

5328
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
last but certainly not least dark soccer

5329
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
your final thought I want a nap

5330
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
I'll just go to bed

5331
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
except reasons

5332
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
you should come over and play DDR

5333
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
I I would be happy to

5334
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I need to I need to work that out I really

5335
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
know what I was talking about but now especially now

5336
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
the weather is less shitty and before it gets too hot

5337
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
yes we need to make that happen yes absolutely

5338
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
okay well that's it

5339
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
I feel like I'm about to

5340
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
explode you're gonna explode from

5341
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000

some later yeah that's what's gonna happen

5346
