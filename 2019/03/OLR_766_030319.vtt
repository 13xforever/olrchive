00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, gaming continues its new era of pivot, Microsoft is ditching exclusivity,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Nintendo is both mobile and big screen, and Sony officially ends its handheld gaming machine.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
We don't know where gaming will end up, but we'll explain where it is.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
This, along with the rest of the gaming news, starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio,

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
live tonight with episode number 766 for this March 3rd of 2019.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as he does every week here on the show is Techmaster Loki.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm here.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm multitasking.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
You are multitasking.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
We're having to kind of make some arrangements on the fly tonight.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
So, not joining us tonight, unfortunately, is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
I do know this was supposed to be the first week that she was back with the show.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Unfortunately, guys, I was just informed a couple hours ago, there's been a death in her family.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Unfortunately, her husband's stepdad, and they were close, passed away.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
So, obviously, a lot of our thoughts and well wishes to DarkSakura, and I've let her know.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Anything we can do to help, we will do, but sometimes in situations like these,

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
you just need some time to do, process, think, and do all of that.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
So, that is exactly what we're going to let DarkSakura do.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
So, we'll hold down the fort with just myself and Loki tonight,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
and if she's ready to come back next week, then we'll be all ready for that.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
But joining us adjacent to the studio is Mr. Smoosh, making a ruckus of noise here.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
So, I apologize if that gets picked up by the mic.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't know why he's bonkers crazy tonight.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes, he's fed. We take excellent care of him here. I think he just gets bored.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I think he wants another cat, but I'm like, ugh.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Don't get me wrong, I want another cat.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
I just don't want to deal with all the landlord stuff that comes with having another cat.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
But soon, soon, we'll figure all that out.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Anyhow, you guys, of course, can join us live, because we do tape live every Sunday night,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
but broadcasting live on Twitch, at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
We are on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, every Sunday night,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
right after our pal, The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Bobby Black Wolf and his show.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
And, yes, thank you guys in chat. I see all the love pouring out from our chat room.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Definitely will pass that along to Miss Summers.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Anyhow, DarkSakura in chat says,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Sounds like my wife, she was thinking of getting another cat to keep hers company.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I think it's the only thing that'll calm some cats down.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And Mr. Smoosh is such a social cat that I'm sure he wants somebody else.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
But then you have to deal with the whole, you got to bring, you know, he's already,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
when we rescued him, he was three years old, so now he's going on four years old.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
So he's kind of already, you know, at a certain age, it's kind of hard to mix cats together sometimes.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
You have to make sure it's going to be a good fit.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
The whole reason we got Mr. Smoosh in the first place is that the person who originally rescued him,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
because somebody, the original owners, just left him outside, which is really tragic, obviously.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
But the original person who rescued him tried to bring him in,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
but the existing cat that she had was not having it.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
So, you know, it's kind of a big risk in that regard.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
It kind of helps if they're already together when they're littler.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
But anyway, I don't mean to turn it into a cat discussion show.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
After all, I just saw one of those shows on Netflix this past week.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
There's a cat discussion show?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
No, it was, well, like a cat rescue show. It looked like it was Rescue 911 for cats.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Rescue Cats?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I think that's what it was. Something like that.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
I don't know, it was definitely a British show.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Now, is it the cats rescuing people? Because that would be more interesting.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
No, it was the people.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Yes, I don't know what the actual is. Somebody in chat will shout it out.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
There was a show all about cats.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
But there's also a cat fashion show one, or something.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Like best in show, you remember that movie?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Like a documentary on that stuff for cats? For real?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
So it's like with cats, except they're trying to get them to do the obstacle course,

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
and the cat's like, I'm not doing that.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
But there's another one. There's another cat documentary that just hit Netflix as well.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So, what can you do?

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, we finally picked up Hulu, so now I'm going through the entire series of

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Good choice.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Because that's awesome.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
And then I needed to do the same with South Park, because I'm several seasons behind in South Park.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
In fact, I'm feeling that tonight. Does your cat make too much noise?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Anyways, that's my favorite episode of Always Sunny.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
No, actually my favorite episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is the night man and the day man.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Everybody knows that episode if you've ever seen.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
That's the best one. But anyway.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
We could be a TV discussion show, I suppose, but we're actually here to talk about video games.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It's gaming culture!

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It is. It is gaming culture.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
If I-

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
There's It's Always Sunny.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
Listen, they have all of these shows have memorabilia in GameStop. GameStop is a game store.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Therefore, this is perfectly fine.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Okay, fine. Alright.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
But let's get into the kickoff topic tonight, which is a little bit depressing.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
I mean, it's one of those things we've kind of been talking about for a little while.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
We knew it was coming, but official this week.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Officially done this week, right, Loki?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Sure, it's officially done. The Vita. It's no more.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
They've ended the-

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
They were down to like, I think last week when we reported on, they were down to two of the SKUs that were still available.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And now those are done.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
So the Vita is no longer being sold by Sony any longer.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
And they have no plans for another portable system as of yet that we're aware of.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I bet you anything Switch does really well.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
Everybody likes to copy Nintendo, so we'll see.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
What do you think, and I'm going to open this up to our chatters as well in our Twitch TV chat room at VOG Network.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
What do you guys think were the good moments of the PlayStation Vita and the bad moments of the PlayStation Vita?

06:04.000 --> 06:13.000
Like why it's not continuing when the 3DS still has game releases coming out in the coming months with Luigi's Mansion and all that.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
What were the good things about the Vita?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Because we're not going to be one of those podcasts that's only negative about games.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
So what were the good things, and then what were the not so good things that Sony could have done better?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I'm going to open this to chat to them.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
The good things were, I would say, the hardware was nice.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I mean it was a nice system altogether.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
They tried to pull like that back tap thing, which was not- that wasn't working out.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
I think some of the games that they had released on it were really nice.

06:41.000 --> 06:52.000
It was a powerful system as far as being able to play PlayStation 1 games, PSP games, the PlayStation Mobile stuff, the indies.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
They had the Vita TV, which was also- it was cool, but no one really picked it up.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't know, I think overall it was a pretty decent system.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, I think the Vita was a really nice piece of hardware, like it really was.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
It was a solid system, it was good to look at, very beautiful screen, great for like watching Netflix and things like that.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
And they did some cool things like originally with it, but I don't know if it like- because I sold my Vita pretty quickly.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
I had picked one up at one time, and then I was like, I'm just not playing this, and so I ended up selling it for something.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I don't remember what it was, I just ended up getting rid of it.

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
And one of the things I remember it doing was kind of like showing you players that were nearby, like locally.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
Like it would just say, hey, this person's interested in this, or you can like exchange things between people.

07:46.000 --> 07:54.000
It was almost like kind of a spot pass for 3DS, but not quite. I don't really know how to describe it.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
And I think that while you're on that, that was one of the big negatives on the PlayStation Vita for me, was that things like that didn't make sense.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
Sony never did a really good job explaining some of these features and why some of these features were needed.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
And I think the biggest example of that, Loki, was 3G. Do you remember that the PlayStation Vita had 3G?

08:14.000 --> 08:23.000
So here was PlayStation Vita 3G. Does 3G allow you to play multiplayer over a cell phone connection? No, it does not.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Okay, so what does it do?

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
And I don't think there was ever like a real, no, no, you're stream did not just die. I don't think there was ever a real answer.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
No, it didn't really do anything. It was just, it was too...

08:38.000 --> 08:47.000
Doesn't that scream missed opportunity? Like there should have been a Sony developed game that was capable of playing over 3G.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
And I realized maybe because of the unreliability of the cell networks or whatever, maybe like a first person shooter type of game at the time would not have been it.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
No, no, no. You remember, there are some games that allowed you to play over 3G.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
And this is where the whole asynchronous multiplayer bullshit came into play.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Okay, what? Because I'm forgetting.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
It's like taking turns or ghost data or some shit like that.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
Well, I was going to say like a card game or a board game. Eye of Judgment for Vita would have been great because it would have...

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Had Eye of Judgment for Vita.

09:19.000 --> 09:34.000
Maybe I want to correct the record, but you know what I mean? Like those types of games, like as much as you say, you know, the A secret, you know, if again, if they had maybe marketed that a little more, you know, because Nintendo has a way of being able to market those kinds of games and make you understand why you need them like clubhouse games.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Can you imagine if Nintendo's clubhouse games was like a Vita?

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
And it also had, I think, a front and rear camera on the thing too, which...

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
It did, which also never really made sense.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
But they have that on the DS and stuff as well, so that didn't make any sense.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I don't know. There's just a lot of tech in there that like, like the back touch sensor, I never understood the need for that.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Aside from there's a couple games that use it, but it's kind of gimmicky.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
Some Sony things are hit and miss sometimes, like 6-axis didn't end up being a thing, but DualShock, like now you can't imagine life without it.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
The tilt sensor stuff, they still use that in some games. A lot of people don't really care for it, but they use it sometimes.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Let's get some comments from chat over at VOG Network over on Twitch.

10:18.000 --> 10:26.000
YYR comments, I still own the 3G Vita, and if it could have been used as a phone, I would still be using it as my smartphone.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
It was my first portable internet-enabled device. I used it for Twitter, Foursquare, and web browsing.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
So, I mean, yes, it could do all those things, but, you know, Sony never really, at least in this country, you know, it's hard for me to say...

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
I really think that they could come out with a new portable system.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I think so, too. I think Sony should try again.

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
And actually, like, just, you know, get a decent, you know, cell processor in there so you can actually do, like, 4G, you know, calling and data or whatever.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
I think if Sony were to try this again, though, I think one thing I would really want to advise them to do is don't have a one-year plan.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Do not have a one-year plan on what this console is going to do.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh, that's the other thing, too.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Have a three-year plan. Because it feels like Sony, like, completely abandoned it.

11:06.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh, no, no, no. I remember now, the 3G thing, too, about that. You were locked with AT&T, and they had cell phone plans with that as well, and they were expensive.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
Yes, but I don't... I'm not going to fault Sony as hard for that because iPhone was in the first situation.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
Remember, iPhone was AT&T exclusive for the longest time, and it still managed to be okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
So, I mean, that's something that could have grown as time went on.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Maybe they had an agreement where AT&T was going to push the Vita in their own stores, and that's why they signed onto it.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
That's why these companies make those types of agreements sometimes.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
Just like why an indie game would sign onto PlayStation exclusive in the first place.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
Because, like, a game like No Man's Sky, because Sony was going to help them market and help push them for better or for worse than that particular case.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
And it was also a great device for remote play as well.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
You know, they used to do that pretty well.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah, and I just feel like this device was capable of so much more than Sony really ever did a good job of communicating,

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
or really had the faith in pushing forward with their first-party games.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Because, you know, again, one thing Nintendo always does well is that they really sell it with their first-party games.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
They kind of... I know some of the games that they put out on it were pretty good, but like the ones you would...

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
And that was it.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
No, but the ones that were supposed to be really good, like Killzone, or I think they had a Call of Duty game on there,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
they were like outsourced to third parties to do that.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
And not even saying like the Call of Duty one was outsourced to the normal Call of Duty teams.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
It was like outsourced to some smaller company to put these games together, and they weren't that great.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And that was kind of the problem.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
It's like these big games that you really want to draw people in for, they just didn't really have them.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Going to chat for some more comments.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Kaijuto disagrees and says, no, Sony, don't do another portable.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
PSVR. Work on getting a flippin' theater app for PSVR.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
As Joe 100 Matt says, I'm with Kaijuto, actually, they should never do another handheld and just focus more on PSVR.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
And storage. They're proprietary memory cards.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
That was a choice.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
That was probably a bad call.

13:08.000 --> 13:16.000
Let's see, and then YYR also said in chat, anyone releasing a dedicated portable at this point is suicidal.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Interesting.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I don't think that's necessarily true.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
I mean, is it because phones, I'd like to kind of dissect that comment a little bit.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Is it because phones are more and more becoming like that's the only device you need and it plays games?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
No.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Because are tablets even selling, because I would say, but tablets, people are still buying tablets.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
But are they? Because iPads, you don't hear about those.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Well, iPads are expensive.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
iPads are trying to sell those as almost like computer laptop replacements or something like that.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay, but Android tablets too. I don't really hear about those selling like they did five years ago.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
Right. I don't think necessarily because, you know, a lot of people still have their tablets from five years ago.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
That's the problem with a tablet like that. You don't really need to, like, my kids have cheap ass tablets.

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
I mean, they were like $70 tablets that they have and they're just fine.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
I mean, those things can't do shit. They can't play anything.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I mean, they can play some things. They play Minecraft and Roblox, but they can't play shit.

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
So, granted, we could upgrade to a better tablet or, you know, for less money than buying an Android tablet,

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
we can buy a Nintendo Switch or a 3DS, you know, or something like that.

14:30.000 --> 14:38.000
Do you think the answer is for PlayStation 5 to look like a Nintendo Switch where you can play it on your TV and it's portable?

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, that would certainly help me in the situations where I don't have access to my TV.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I don't think it's necessary.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, it would be a little weird to see Sony and Microsoft, like, go full-on.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
Let's just go full-on bizarre. Let's just do that it's all AR. It's just an AR headset to play that shit.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
I think it would be smarter for these companies to adapt Switch-like technology and something that could beam to your cell phones.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Like, you could play, like, on your iPhone, you know, they just, or Android, whatever, both devices.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
There's just an app that allows you to do the remote play on your app.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
Although, granted, like, obviously, I don't think PlayStation games will play very well on a touch-only screen as well.

15:18.000 --> 15:28.000
Like, you really need a controller. But maybe there's some things you could do through your, you know, Box, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Next, whatever it is,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
that, you know, you could beam over to your iPhone.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
I just think they should stop introducing new tech, or new, like, not necessarily new tech, new gimmicks to the hardware,

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
like new control schemes and stuff like that, unless they have some good uses for it.

15:43.000 --> 15:50.000
Like, don't, you know, even with, like, the 3D stuff. The 3D stuff with the 3DS is pretty awesome, but no one ended up using it.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
It was kind of a gimmick. And then, and it wasn't really a gimmick, it was because of the stupid health warnings.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
Because they're like, oh, it's gonna hurt people's eyes! The young children are gonna go blind!

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
And then, it's that bullshit that fucking ruined the 3D stuff. That's what it was, it's that bullshit. Otherwise, it would've been cool.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
And then, um, the rear touch thing, they have a front touch and rear touch on it, that's a little stupid.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
I, I get the front touch screen, the rear touch, is that, that's just a fucking gimmick.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
A little bit. It just, maybe they just didn't have the game that really sold you on the concept.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Because I can understand, and somebody in chat had said it, I'm sorry, I forget who.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
But that, like, when you're using front touch, your fingers are getting in the way of the screen.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
When you're using back touch, you can still see the entire screen, and yet, you know, be using your fingers in the back.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I just don't think they really had the game to really show that strongly.

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
Again, you would think that Sony would develop that game, but Sony and Nintendo don't really design games the same way.

16:46.000 --> 16:53.000
And are able to show off the hardware, and I think that's one big place where Sony, Vita, you know, kind of didn't do us well here.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
But then again, you know, one thing we have to remember, in Japan, this is a very different story.

16:57.000 --> 17:05.000
The Vita continued to do well over there for quite some time, uh, still being, I think even still today, there's still some Vita games coming out.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
But it's gonna, it's gonna dry up pretty quick now that...

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
But why is that?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I don't, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if I know the answer to that.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
Is it because, uh, you know, I think it, is it because the fact that a lot of their pop...

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Maybe they explained it better there?

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
A lot of their population is using mass transit, so like portable devices are more popular.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Sure, sure.

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
Or the fact that, you know, maybe, you know, a home theater setup might be a little bit more rare because of spacing issues.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I don't know what the case may be, but whatever that was, the messaging wasn't over here.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I don't think they really pushed it that hard over here either.

17:38.000 --> 17:49.000
I think you're more on to something with the fact that there's more, there's a bigger market for portable gaming in Japan because, you know, everything, you know, people can more walk to a point or they take mass transit.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
It's not, you know, quite the same culture 100% as it is here from getting from point A to point B for many people.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I don't know.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah. So, anyway, um, let's see, YYR says in our chat, Japanese developers supported the Vita much, much better.

18:04.000 --> 18:13.000
And that's another thing that it kind of comes down to is that, you know, those types of games that we don't see as much of here, like visual novels and, you know, those sorts of things.

18:13.000 --> 18:21.000
Those continue to have a strong life on the Vita and, you know, those types of games just don't really have the same market here as they do in Japan.

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
Um, let's see, uh, and YYR says, if you look at the games released in North America for Vita over the last few years, it's Indies and Japanese games.

18:30.000 --> 18:42.000
And yeah, that's pretty much all that's been carrying the Vita for a while is those Japanese games do get translated and Indies because, you know what, if I'm not mistaken, Unity had like a Vita output type of feature.

18:42.000 --> 18:53.000
So, I mean, it's, you know, as long as the door's been open for Indies to be able to publish their stuff on Vita, of course, they're going to keep doing it because, you know, if I'm an indie developer, I just want to get my game out there just as many places as possible.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
And so the Vita has always kind of been, I think, an attractive, you know, option.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah. So, uh, for sure. Um, let's see, uh, Sia Tabiri pointing out that also the mini disc had a huge life in Japan.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
So, you know, some things just, I think sometimes not always explainably do better over there than they do over here for whatever reason.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
Um, let's see, Kaijuto saying the Vita doesn't have an R3 or L3, so the back touch was needed.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Uh, that kind of took the place of the clicking, uh, the, the analytics.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, it doesn't have an R2, yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Uh, oh, maybe that's what, yeah.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
R2, yeah, it's R2, L2. It did have the clicking on the, the controller.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
And I think you tapped, you tapped the top for one and the bottom for another. Like, I think you...

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
You couldn't push in the, oh, maybe you couldn't push in the LX. I don't know, it's been a long time.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
I think, I think you tapped the top for two and the bottom for three or something like that. I think that's how it worked.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
Um, if our, it's been a little bit, obviously, but, uh, if you were doing remote play, you kind of had to do that.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
That would stand in for some of those buttons that was missing on the, uh, Vita otherwise versus a PlayStation 4.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm just so surprised that they didn't push the Vita TV or even, like, rebrand the...

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
I mean, honestly, like, the Vita TV, they could have pushed that with...

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I think that was a huge mistake, too.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Like a PlayStation, like a PlayStation Classic, because the PlayStation Classic is like $99.99.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
Just throw in a fucking DualShock in the PlayStation TV and, like, change up how they store it.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
I mean, maybe USB storage or something to it and you have a solid device that can not only play PlayStation Classic games,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
but, oh, hey, look, there's this library of Vita titles.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
Hugely missed opportunity. They should have just rebranded the Vita TV as a PlayStation Classic, loaded it with 20 pre-done games,

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
and then sold it for $99.99. I think that was a huge missed opportunity.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
Uh, granted, it could have come a year sooner, because I think the Vita was already on its way out the door

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
at the time PlayStation, the actual PlayStation Classic, got out the door.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
Speaking of PlayStation Classic, I want to make sure I get this comment from Bobby, who says,

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
as far as the Vita, it was my Suikoden and Final Fantasy PlayStation 1 machine.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
It made a great PlayStation Classic.

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
So, um, yeah, and it made a great PSP player, too, because you could download things that,

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
as long as you bought it digitally on PSP, you could download it on Vita as well, or, you know, they did sales and things like that.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
So, like, I remember my Vita had that Final Fantasy IV remake they did on PSP that's great.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
Like, that version doesn't exist anywhere else but the PSP, because they went the 3D route when they did it for the DS,

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
and then they made that version, the one that they sold on Steam and PC and all the other places, on tablets and stuff.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
So, like, that 2D remake of Final Fantasy IV, which includes the After Years stuff, too,

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
that's only on PSP and Vita, thanks to the PSP compatibility.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
So, yeah, what a bummer.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
So, alright, well, you know, just some memories of the Vita.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
I just, man, you just think if they'd just done a couple other things differently, it might have gone a lot further,

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
and it'll always kind of baffle the mind why they didn't maybe just try to put a little more in it.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
I don't know if it would have ever outsold the 3DS, but I think, you know, the Vita could have been a bigger brand than it was,

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
and I think that example of the PlayStation Classic piggybacking on existing Vita technology is a great example.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Which is why I think with the technology being where it is, I don't think it's impossible for them to come out with another handheld device.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
I mean, I don't know. They may not do that. They don't want to take risks.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
YYR in chat says, the other reason PlayStation TV was a failure, where were the streaming apps?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
No, Netflix was a huge blow.

22:23.000 --> 22:29.000
And SSG100Matt, with a very interesting comment that follows that up, they were too busy trying to develop the Vue at the time,

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
and PlayStation Vue does very, very well still.

22:32.000 --> 22:41.000
Interesting thought on that is that maybe Sony's desire, because by the nature, Sony is not just a gaming company.

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
We know that, right? Sony is a TV building company. They are a movie-making studio. Sony Pictures, right?

22:48.000 --> 22:58.000
Sony does a lot more than games, and maybe sometimes the desire to keep everything Sony, Sony, Sony, maybe works against them in some of these places.

22:58.000 --> 23:06.000
Which, that's a very, very fair thought, is that maybe they didn't want to do Netflix or Hulu because Sony was trying to push their own thing,

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
and that it ended up working so well because that's not always what the market wants.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Sometimes it works in their favor. Blu-ray worked out for them.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
Beta versus VHS didn't work out so well for them, right? Because they were the beta team, wasn't Sony the beta team?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, I think so.

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
Yeah, and I think beta was still used in broadcast news for a long time, but that's about, you know, even now, that's all digital, and that beta and VHS are long gone,

23:29.000 --> 23:39.000
but that brief period of time when I was interning at a news station, they were using beta tapes for sure, so that's a very niche thing.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
So, anyway, let's see, a couple other comments in chat, and then we're going to move on to our gaming weeks here.

23:44.000 --> 23:51.000
Let's see, Bobby Bockel says, Vita had a YouTube app, but took it offline when YouTube upped the API. Interesting.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
And YYR says, I feel like it was missing a lot of popular video apps.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
PodCulture saying, Vita did have a Netflix app. So, and yeah, just maybe it took a little time to come out,

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
but you know what else doesn't have a Netflix app and seems to be doing very well for itself? The Switch.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
Still no Netflix app on the Switch. It has Hulu, but no Netflix, and still seems to be doing okay.

24:16.000 --> 24:24.000
But of course, obviously, you can't really one for one the Switch and the Vita because it's just different stuff.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
The whole fact that you can take it with you, you know, it's a console and a portable, and just the fact that, you know,

24:30.000 --> 24:41.000
Nintendo making the strong, strong first party libraries that you can only play, you know, you can only play Breath of the Wild on a Nintendo product.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
You know, because technically you can play it on the Wii U, but we know most people playing on the Switch, right?

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
You can only play Mario Kart 8 and Mario Maker and stuff on a Nintendo product.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
You can't play any of those.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Officially.

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
Well, yes, officially, of course. All right. Anyway. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about what we've been doing with our gaming weeks.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
Maybe we've been playing the Vita or maybe not. Well, how was your gaming week, Loki? What have you been playing this week?

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
I haven't played much of anything, to be honest. I played a little bit of Pokemon Go this week.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
I haven't really been playing any games this week. I've been trying to get back into programming again.

25:20.000 --> 25:32.000
So I was going through, like, one course online just to kind of a code log thing, and then I got bored with it really fast because it was just too basic stuff.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
I really had to skip ahead on it, and I was like, nah, no, I'm not going to waste my time on this. I'm just going to do something else.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
So that's what I'm going to do is I'm doing something else. But I was messing with that for a while.

25:42.000 --> 25:56.000
And then what else did I play? I played... I downloaded the LEGO Movie 2 game, which is actually very different than the other LEGO games that they have out right now.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
It's more like open world. It's kind of similar to LEGO Worlds versus any of the other LEGO games.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
So I haven't gotten a chance to dive into too much of that because my kid's been hogging the Switch.

26:09.000 --> 26:17.000
He was playing LEGO Movie 2, and then he got bored with that too. Or got frustrated with it, I should say, and he's been still playing through LEGO Incredibles.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
So I've been doing that. Haven't played any DDR this week. I've been really bad about that.

26:24.000 --> 26:33.000
The problem is at work I've been so busy I've been skipping lunches, and so I'm under my calorie count just without the exercise.

26:33.000 --> 26:43.000
And also this week has been crazy with the rain and everything. So I've been under my calories exercise-wise, or without exercise, and then when I come home I end up having to cook or do something.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
So all my time is gone at that point.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
So I haven't played any DDR this week, unfortunately, but I've been meaning to get back to it.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Eventually it'll happen.

26:55.000 --> 27:05.000
Anyone else? I did play a little bit of Crackdown 3. Just still grinding out the last few bits of my skill points I need.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
And then, yeah, that's pretty much it for right now. I mean, I'm hopefully getting to maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 at some point.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Or I'll just completely forget about the game. You know, that may happen too.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
Don't do that. I mean, you've still got a good, what, 12 years until you do another game.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Well, Final Fantasy XV too. I still haven't even-

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Oh my god, get on that. It's a fun game.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Most of that. So I don't know.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Anyway, let's see, my gaming week. So I'll kind of follow up your calorie chat and what to do when it's raining and stuff,

27:32.000 --> 27:40.000
because I've actually found this week I kind of got sucked into PlayStation VR, which I think you'll be happy with.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
You know, because I, for whatever reason, just I was kind of waiting for that killer app that I wanted on VR,

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
and now I've been playing more and more Beat Saber on PlayStation VR.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
I did a little stream on Tuesday where I was playing it, and one thing that I've noticed as I've been playing more Beat Saber

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
is that I'm actually getting exercise, and I'm burning calories, and it's counting on my watch for all the calories burned.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
My heart rate is getting up. I'm hurting my back like crazy because I'm probably not stretching properly before I play,

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
and I don't know if it's something about the motion of swiping when you play Beat Saber or whatever,

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
but it's been a good workout, so that's been something to do when it's been raining to still get a little bit of exercise.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
I've been playing more PlayStation VR. Beat Saber specifically, I'm up to, I think I've cleared three expert level songs now,

28:26.000 --> 28:32.000
so it's kind of like, wow, I'm progressing in a music game that I have a lot of enthusiasm about.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
I haven't felt this since, like, back when I played DDR regularly, you know?

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Well, maybe like Rock Band. I don't know. When I played Rock Band pretty hard, I think I,

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
there's a lot of stuff in those games I really wanted to clear out, but yeah, it's been nice to get up and moving.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Another kind of like exercise related game, I actually put like a question on my Twitter.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
I was like, hey, what other types of like exercise games or what other VR games give you a really good workout,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
because I'm really loving this idea that like I'm playing, you know, Beat Saber and I'm getting,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
and don't say just dance, give me like some games I haven't heard of.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
So somebody on Twitter recommended to me, I play a game called Sprint Vector.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
So I downloaded that as well, and I've been playing that a little bit, and that one's really interesting too,

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
because you, it's like a racing game, but not with cars. You're like, I guess I would compare it to like skiing.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
It's kind of like, or like rollerblading is kind of like what you're doing in that game.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
Like futuristic, but like what you do is you use, like you're holding the controllers

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
and you do this motion like left, right, and like alternating.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
Like imagine like you're kind of like skiing or something. You're on like a Stairmaster or something

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
where you're going back and forth with the different move controllers.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
And that's kind of how you control the character, and then which way you look kind of depends on which way you drive.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
And you can get a really cool, like you can hit both center buttons to like jump,

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
and it's a really kind of cool sensation in VR. And yeah, I've been enjoying that.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
I ran into a few issues, especially, and you could see this when I was live streaming,

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
a cheap plug for my personal channel, Rob Roberts, when I was doing my personal stream earlier this week.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
One problem I was running into is like, I thought I was going the wrong direction on the course

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
because all these arrows showed up saying, hey idiot, go this way.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
And it took me a little bit to figure out what the reason why that error was showing up

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
is because I turned to the right. So I'd started to look this way because I was going this way.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
But what was happening is that the camera couldn't see the VR headset anymore.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
So it was saying you need to turn and look at the camera so I can see which way you're going

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
because I should have been using the quick turn buttons to actually do the turn.

30:38.000 --> 30:46.000
So my only complaint about Sprint Vector is I don't think that mixing of the real turning with your head

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
and the quick turning, I don't think that works as well as the developers intended.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
It wasn't as intuitive. And the fact that it took me a long time to figure out

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
why is the game yelling at me like it should have said out of camera range

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
or it should have had some type of error or something, they came up to tell me

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
and I would have figured that out a lot faster. So I feel like that was one place where I was like,

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
ooh, this Sprint Vector could have, maybe the tutorials could have been a little better in the beginning

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
to tell me about that type of stuff. In all fairness, I did not play as far as the intermediate tutorials

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
but I kind of felt like I didn't need to to beat the first couple courses.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
If I need to go that far in tutorials, then maybe the tutorials are too long

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
and that's something else that should be because the tutorials I did do were kind of,

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
but it takes a little bit to explain. It's like, push the button, then release,

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
and I got it, but obviously I was still having problems.

31:36.000 --> 31:45.000
But otherwise, that little complaint aside, I do enjoy the real, I think that idea of how to control it

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
is a great idea for an exercise type game and it feels great to play.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
I love the sensation of jumping and coasting and there are some levels where you fall down a hole

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
and it's kind of like, whoa, it almost kind of makes you, like, if you're a motion sick type of person,

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
you ain't going to have a good time playing it, but if you're able to stomach it,

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
okay, I think it's a lot of fun, actually. So, again, that's Sprint Vectors.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
That's another VR game I checked out this week.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Other games I've been playing, I've been continuing my adventures in Phantasy Star online.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
If you, again, have been watching my first channel.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
The original one?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah, the original, Blueburst.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Okay.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
We're playing on a private server that exists out there and it's very, just go to Google, y'all.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You'll probably find the same one we're playing on.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
But, you know, Sega doesn't really care about Blueburst anymore.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
So is Blueburst the same as, like, the Dreamcast Phantasy Star?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Pretty much, it has Episode 4.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Oh, okay.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
And it was the PC one.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
I thought it was a sequel or something.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
No, it's, PSO Blueburst is just the PC version of PSO.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
So, and it was the last version they put out, I think.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
It was after GameCube, for sure, I know that, and probably Xbox as well.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
So that's where the private servers are.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
So my buddy Delvin over at VG Realness.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah, I see them, I see the notifications every time we stream.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Yeah, well, because it's been a few times.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
We were streaming last week and then we did a couple nights this week.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
And that's been fun because he's been like, oh no, you're gonna beat this game.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I'm in it, you never beat games, you're beating this.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
So we've been having a good time just getting through the story.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
And it's good because, you know, it's not a very complicated game.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
So it's fun to just sit there and be adventuring together and just talk about other stuff.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
And that's what usually happens, is that thanks to chat,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
thanks to other people that will randomly join the stream,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
like Bobby was with us one night, Shane was on Discord with us one night.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
And so we would just talk about other random stuff.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
And I think it makes for great streams.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
I don't, I don't, hopefully you guys agree.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
But for those of you that have watched, hopefully you guys have been enjoying those streams.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
Because it's not even like just about PSO, but just, you know, having fun.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Kicking back and playing a game and talking a little smack.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
So yeah, that's been a big part of my week as well.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
And then, I'm trying to think, I've still been playing a little bit of World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV as well.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
I had to log in to save my house.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
Otherwise, I can't think of a lot of like new stuff I've really been playing.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
I did do the new raid boss in Pokémon GO since you brought that up.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
I did that.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
And I was having, I was on a field day in Pokémon GO the other day.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
What's really funny is that one of my long time Pokémon GO playing friends

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
just got into Ingress finally after all these years and started playing that.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
And like right at that same time, I was like, I want to play more Pokémon GO and get more gold gym badges.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
Because I've been ignoring the gym game in that game for so long outside of raids.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
And like as far as Ingress goes, and I mentioned this on a previous episode.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I'm just kind of, I'm really bored.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
The day-to-day game in Ingress hasn't changed in like four years.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Despite the prime client.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
So I'm kind of like just bored of it.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
Because, you know, again, how do you defeat that? Which has no life.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
And that's what it boils down to.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
But the live events are a lot of fun. So I still do the live events.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
But that's kind of it for me in that game right now.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
So anyway, that's pretty much it.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
That's what I've been playing for my gaming weeks.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So I guess we'll move on.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Yes.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
A little bit of housekeeping tonight.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
DarkSakura, as I mentioned, she's not here tonight because she had a family emergency.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
And we do hope the best for her and Dan.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
But please bear with us a little bit because since we did just find that out a couple hours ago.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
So everything was planned for there to be three hosts tonight.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
And now there are two. So if things feel a little bit disorganized, sorry about that.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
But we're trying to fix things on the go.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
That being said, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Also, we would appreciate follows at our Twitch channel.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network is where you can find us on Sunday nights.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
And we really appreciate, again, those of you that have been given the biddies and the subscriptions as well.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
To see the video on demand.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
I've been very, very flattered and thankful to those of you that have been contributing in that forum.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Thank you so much.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Let's get to some news.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
Yes. So apparently there is going to be Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Because, you know, they're a company and they have to make a lot of money.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
And they need to make more money than just selling the game.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
So how else to do that?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Well, you develop DLC for it.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
So that's going to be a mix of kind of free and paid DLC.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
I'm not really sure exactly what's going to be available.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
But they said, you know, they're going to add some free DLC over time.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
And a paid DLC with several elements in one batch.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
And this is according to an article in Dengeki Online.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
Where Tetsuya Nomura was talking about the DLC and whether there's going to be a re-released final mix edition.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And how they're going to do that.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
So I guess we'll wait and see what they add to it.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
Maybe New Worlds. Maybe more Cup Noodle sponsorship.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Who knows?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
A New World would be quite the undertaking.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I would see maybe...

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
A lot of people have been asking where are the Final Fantasy characters in Kingdom Hearts 3.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
I mean, yes, the Moogles are there.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
But like, as far as like, you remember in the original Kingdom Hearts games, you had like, you know...

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Cloud.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Cloud was there.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
And I don't know why they didn't call him Squall.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
They called him Leon.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Aerith was there.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
And yeah, they changed his name for whatever reason.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Which it does play into the Final Fantasy VIII story.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
But it is weird that we called him Squall there.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Anyway.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
And then Sephiroth. Remember Lance Bass as Sephiroth in the original Kingdom Hearts?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That's missing from Kingdom Hearts 3 as well.

37:17.000 --> 37:23.000
So you would think it would be a little bit easier maybe for Square to develop on a Final Fantasy themed story.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
Then maybe having to go back to the table with Disney and negotiate for whatever else.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
Although I would think if I was Disney and I had a new movie coming out that I really wanted to promote.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
Maybe I would allow a new world to be made for it.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
But then again, what's the big Disney movie this winter?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
It's live action remake world.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Oh, there is that.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
But I was thinking Frozen 2 was the big thing they were pushing this holiday.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
But we already had Frozen, so I don't know if it really makes sense to do it again.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
But it's live action remake world where it's the same as the old worlds.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
It's just done with live actors now.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
That's right, because we're getting Lion King this year.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Is Aladdin this year too?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Or is Aladdin next year?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah, I think Aladdin's this year.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Wow, okay.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Isn't there another one too?

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
I know Little Mermaid is something they're talking about.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
Because didn't they already cast Zendaya for Ariel?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Am I crazy on that?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Fuck if I remember.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
I don't know.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
But anyway, I think that's something.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Yeah, but Little Mermaid is probably next year.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
But yeah, they're revisiting all the 90s.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
We're running out of ideas.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Remake all the...

38:23.000 --> 38:29.000
If we're reviving 90s ideas, how about Kingdom Hearts goes to the 90s Lion King game from the Genesis.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
How about that?

38:31.000 --> 38:38.000
How about Kingdom Hearts goes to the 90s Disney Afternoon lineup?

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Oh, like Gummy Bears and stuff?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Gummy Bears, Darkwing Duck.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
There's the Gummy Ship.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Yeah, there you go.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Darkwing Duck, DuckTales.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Hell, even the new DuckTales is pretty good.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Okay, act deft with all the receipts and chat.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
Aladdin is May, Lion King is July, Dumbo is this month.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
I knew there was another one.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Dumbo is happening too.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Anyway, let's see.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
At least that one is like, you know, it's Tim Burton, so it's a little bit different.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
A Marvel idea, of course.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
This is Joe 100 Matt says, how long will DLC take though?

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
They will be deep into Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 4 when it finally comes out, but certainly the Marvel.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
But again, that's all going to be agreements and signing.

39:18.000 --> 39:26.000
And does Marvel want to be involved in a Kingdom Hearts world when we know that there is a secret Marvel game project being worked on?

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Over at Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics, right?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Crystal Dynamics, Tomb Raider is doing that game.

39:32.000 --> 39:41.000
Yeah, so they're developing that game and you would think, based on the Tomb Raider reboot, that this Marvel game they're doing is probably going to be a more gritty, realistic type of game.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
That, I mean, we don't know.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
We're just guessing based on, you know, what Tomb Raider looked like.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
Would they want to be in Kingdom Hearts at the same time? Maybe not. I don't know.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
Let's see, Act F pointing out that Scrooge McDuck does appear in Kingdom Hearts 3.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
That's right, he's the owner of the cafe, right?

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
Where Ratatouille cooks all the dishes.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I haven't played the game, so I don't know.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
You should get on that. Alright.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
And then see a Tiberian chat that suggests things like Lizzie McGuire and That's So Raven.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
There you go.

40:15.000 --> 40:22.000
I mean, Raven Simonie is only, what, like in her 40s now, so it'd be really funny to see her come back and play that.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
Or like they could do, you know, I don't know. There's a lot of things that they could do.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
None of which are good, but you know.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
We'll see, we'll see.

40:32.000 --> 40:40.000
Let's see. Oh, excuse me, Act F is saying at the top of his lungs in chat, Remi, the name of the rat is Remi.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Sorry, that's one of the few Pixar movies I actually didn't see.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I have not seen Ratatouille as well.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
I haven't either, it's just the one I missed. So, it happens.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
That and Brave. I haven't seen that or Brave.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
But Bobby, in our defense, saying the game does never name him, he's just the chef.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
They never give him a name, he's just the chef.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I thought that was the case.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
That they just give him a very vague name. Anyway.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Alright, let's move on to some more news.

41:05.000 --> 41:11.000
Some big announcements this week out of Nintendo as they have unveiled Pokémon Generation 8.

41:11.000 --> 41:22.000
Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield is the new Pokémon 8th generation of games as they announced in a very brief 7 minute Nintendo Direct this week.

41:22.000 --> 41:31.000
Not Pokémon Gun, as some magazines in other countries have picked up and run with what the Twitterverse has done.

41:31.000 --> 41:37.000
Or there was a whole lot of parodies that were shown on our VOG Network Discord at vognetwork.com.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Somebody posted a compilation.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Journalism, what's that?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
I know, right? My favorite that I saw on Facebook was Pokémon Chonkala.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Where the, uh, you know.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
I saw Pokémon Trebuchet.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Okay. Right, or Catapult.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Pokémon Aero I saw as well, which would kind of fit in with the Sword and Shield theme.

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
But anyway, we got to see a little glimpse at the world, which appears to be a little more like, I think they're saying Scottish.

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
Some are saying, kind of somewhere in there. Something like an old, Old Kingdom sort of look there.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
Um, to the games. I thought they looked really nice.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
But I did notice what a lot of y'all noticed, where the random encounter Pokémon seem to be back.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
Where you don't see them on the overworld like you would in the Go games.

42:22.000 --> 42:28.000
You still are back to random encounters. So some people kind of dissecting what could that all mean and all this.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.000
Of course, there's seven minutes of Pokémon Direct, which leads to the two hour discussion of the seven minute direct.

42:35.000 --> 42:42.000
Not that, I mean, we're a three hour weekly podcast on games, so I really have no reason, no room whatsoever to talk smack.

42:42.000 --> 42:48.000
But it is interesting how much dissection you can find on these, uh, little trailers.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
So anyway, and of course, there were brand new Pokémon unveiled, the starter Pokémon.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
Which is customary when they unveil a Pokémon generation, they say, and these are the three new Pokémon.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
These are the Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
It's always the same three types too. It's always a water plant and fire.

43:08.000 --> 43:14.000
It is, I think that's part of the tradition, but when they evolve, they usually get a second typing.

43:14.000 --> 43:21.000
Like Blaziken was a fire fighting type. So, and the reason why I bring that up specifically is a lot of people are wondering.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
Is this new fire type that we have in this game, uh, Scorbunny, who's a little bunny that's a fire bunny.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
Is he a fire fighting type as well? And I don't, we don't know.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Because we haven't seen what the evolutions look like.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
That hasn't stopped very creative artists out there from coming up with their own ideas on what the evolutions could look like.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
But we really won't know until Nintendo unveils all of that in a later Direct.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
Maybe at E3, but the Pokémon games really have always tended to do their own thing on their own timetable.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
They don't follow any type of normal announcement standard with the rest of Nintendo.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
So, you know what? They will show the evolutions and all that when they're damn good and ready.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
But the other starters, a shout out for Grookey, which is the little grass monkey.

44:05.000 --> 44:11.000
Which is adorable. Did you see the Photoshop where somebody put a gun in his hand? That made me laugh.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
The internet does funny things sometimes.

44:13.000 --> 44:21.000
And, um, let's see, Sobble. If I'm saying that right. Sobble? Sobble? Sobble? Sobble. One of the two.

44:21.000 --> 44:28.000
A water type lizard Pokémon who hides himself in water and there's a lot of folks talking about, uh,

44:28.000 --> 44:36.000
it's the depression Pokémon and a lot of DATME over on Twitter and looking at that Pokémon, which I'm sure.

44:36.000 --> 44:46.000
Is there a typing of the three that you prefer, Loki? Is there one of these that is jumping out at you as one that you want to pick?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
No. I don't want any of them.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Are you not going to pick up Pokémon Gen 8?

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
No, I will. I don't know none of them. Probably the fire bunny.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Uh, I would say, I'm on Team Grass Monkey.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Grass Monkey. That funky monkey.

44:59.000 --> 45:05.000
Yes, but it depends on what the evolutions look like. That's going to really sway me one way or the other, I think.

45:05.000 --> 45:17.000
I really want to know what the evolutions look like because if they're ridiculous, um, like, you know, I was not the biggest fan of, um, this guy's final evolution in the last series of games.

45:18.000 --> 45:26.000
So if it looks like that again, uh, then, you know, I might pick something else. Obviously I went for Litten last gen because I'm going to pick Firecat, of course.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
But, we'll see. We'll see what the, uh, maybe they'll come out with more plushies.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
Oh, what? Them merchandise? Never!

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
My kids have the socks, by the way.

45:38.000 --> 45:45.000
Um, s2100matt says, that Beastie Boys reference flew over Rob's head. No, it didn't. I've just heard it 5,000 times this week.

45:45.000 --> 45:52.000
Bobby Blackwell says, for the podcast audience, who is that guy? Oh, I'm sorry. This is Popplio. I'm sorry. Thank you.

45:52.000 --> 46:03.000
Sorry, podcasters. I was doing a visual there. Popplio is the, um, Pokemon I was holding up there and then Litten was the one I was saying, oh, this is the, this is the one that I, uh, uh, ended up choosing at the end of the day.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
Though the, um, Rowlet is super cute too. So, um, let's see.

46:07.000 --> 46:17.000
Siya Tiberian Chat says, you just need to start buying Pokemon Loafs. Don't I have enough Pokemon shit in this house? Like, you can already see it. This isn't even everything. I have other stuff too that's not, uh, displayed on the Twitch stream.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I see several Pokemon already.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah, right? So, uh, it's enough.

46:21.000 --> 46:31.000
Uh, Tyre Colin Chat says, you think he'll show up in the movie? Of course, there'll be 500 Pokemon movies. There's a Pokemon movie every year and the new starters will show up in the movie as well at some point.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Of course, of course there will be.

46:33.000 --> 46:50.000
Alright, anyway, uh, that's the early stuff on Pokemon Sword and Shield and, uh, I'm, I'm happy they moved to Switch. I know there's some people that are, like, feeling kind of negative about the graphics and the changes and stuff, but I don't, I think it's way too early to make a snap judgment on the game.

46:50.000 --> 47:05.000
Like, there's gonna be plenty more directs over the coming months that show us more and more details. Pokemon games are always full of things to do. In fact, one of my criticisms about Pokemon, I sometimes get overwhelmed with that there is too much shit to do.

47:05.000 --> 47:15.000
And I'm left feeling, like, I don't know what to do because, because there's Pokemon Fashion Show as, like, a side thing that you're supposed to do and it's, like, I don't, I don't have time for this or, or growing the trees and all this stuff.

47:15.000 --> 47:24.000
Which apparently you don't have to do any of that stuff, but I, I feel like, I don't, I just can't not do it when it's there. It's too much to do. Anyway.

47:24.000 --> 47:31.000
So we'll see. We'll see, uh, what they announce more for Pokemon in the coming directs, uh, in the coming months.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
In the meantime, uh, Loki, you got this next one, right?

47:34.000 --> 47:50.000
Yes. So PUBG is getting a parental lock on the game, basically, that requires, uh, children under the age of 13 to unlock it, uh, with the help of their parents. Of course, this is not in all regions.

47:50.000 --> 48:00.000
This is mainly just in, uh, it's being piloted for Chinese versions of the game. Um, they're actually doing this with, uh, PUBG Mobile and Honor of the Kings.

48:00.000 --> 48:14.000
And so with this, they have, I guess, a way for your parents to basically go and sign in, uh, with, like, a parental code or something like that to unlock the game so that, you know, give your children permission to be able to play it.

48:14.000 --> 48:21.000
Because, you know, games are horrible and will cause your children to become stupid.

48:21.000 --> 48:28.000
Well, I think this is more like when the kid, and maybe your kids aren't quite at that age yet, but they're going to be there pretty soon.

48:28.000 --> 48:38.000
When the kid takes the tablet to bed with them and they're up all night playing games on the tablet. I know this is a struggle I've heard from other parents that have kids of a certain age.

48:38.000 --> 48:47.000
It's like they take their phone to bed with them and they're up all night on the fucking phone. So there should be a way to, like, shut down the game so they can't do that stuff after a certain hour.

48:47.000 --> 49:02.000
Yeah, and along with that, you know, it's basically saying that the new controls, um, it limits whether they can be played online, um, they have rules to reduce screen time, um, different ways to kind of curb that stuff, so.

49:02.000 --> 49:10.000
You know what doesn't have, uh, parental locks? Books. So you could take a book to bed and read it.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
That's just an actual lock. Just put it in a safe. Can't read it through the safe.

49:15.000 --> 49:23.000
But yeah, um, interesting that they're rolling this out in China, although I think there's laws and governance in China that have come into play with why they've chosen to do it there first.

49:23.000 --> 49:39.000
Um, but I think one interesting thing, if they do end up rolling out a feature like this in America, which wouldn't be a big deal. I mean, many of the folks listening to this show and watching the show on Twitch, you're not using these types of lock features and stuff like that because you want to play all the games you want.

49:39.000 --> 49:51.000
If you want to stay up all night playing Fortnite on your phone, then you're an adult and you've earned it. But so many of you probably just don't use parental locks, but things like the Switch and stuff have parental locks that are very similar.

49:52.000 --> 50:14.000
Um, it's just a matter of, do the parents know how to use them? Because I don't know, you know, I come from a certain generation as do probably many of y'all were like, my parents didn't know how to use those locks or use the setting on the TV that would prevent me from watching Cinemax after 9pm. If you know what I mean, right? Like our parents didn't know how to use those locks.

50:14.000 --> 50:26.000
Well, right. And I don't think for me, like I know how to use that stuff, but I don't think it's necessary because I just, you know, they don't have the game system with them and we can tell when they have screens on.

50:26.000 --> 50:39.000
So it's just, it's not needed, I guess. But I mean, if, if you're letting them have the device in the room and keep it, you know, and it is an issue, then I guess you could do the parental locks if you need to.

50:39.000 --> 50:50.000
Or I just do what I do. And since my, you know, internet is all based on Mac address filtering, I just take them out of the filter and then they can't connect to the internet. Oh, darn. That breaks everything.

50:50.000 --> 51:01.000
Okay. That's a good thought. Uh, let's see. And some comments in chat. I love this VG realness and chat says, Oh my God, take their fucking phones away. LOL. Sorry to be an old man, but we didn't have that in our day.

51:01.000 --> 51:11.000
So back in my day, we didn't have Fortnite on phones. So I don't know why kids under 13 are going to bed with a phone, let alone having one. And Bobby Blackwell says, isn't it past your bedtime?

51:11.000 --> 51:24.000
Well, if 1980 cinema supposed to teach me anything and I didn't have this when I was growing up, but back then children had their walkie talkies that they would talk to each other with.

51:25.000 --> 51:36.000
You know, back in, you know, we did back in my day, you're ready for all the crazy shit we got into as kids. Okay. You know what we did back in my day? We left the house after bedtime.

51:36.000 --> 51:48.000
That's what we did. Like when it was like, you know, or can I, I'm going to bed, you know, you go to bed and then you'd hear when your parents go to bed. And then it's like, you know, your friend and you had agreed that you were going to meet at like 11 o'clock somewhere.

51:48.000 --> 51:58.000
So you snuck out of the damn house and you went and met, met up and got into the trouble the kids got into, uh, at that age. And then went and played with your phones out there.

52:00.000 --> 52:08.000
We didn't have phones then we had, uh, we had, um, I don't know, TPing people's houses or whatever we did back in the day. We had vandalism.

52:09.000 --> 52:21.000
This is so much better than, you know, staying up late and sometimes it wasn't necessarily that you were doing anything at all, except the thing that your parents didn't want you to do. Right.

52:21.000 --> 52:31.000
Whatever you do, no vandalism. Now that you're in bed, don't worry mother. I will not do vandalism in bed.

52:31.000 --> 52:39.000
Little does she know I am going to sneak out and do all of the vandalism. Bobby and Chad says we did actual illegal shit.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.000
We burn things. Kids today that do completely legal things. What a bunch of lame-os.

52:46.000 --> 52:59.000
Oh God. Um, SSG100Matt says every damn kid had a beeper in middle school. I didn't have a fucking beeper in middle school. Why did kids, I don't know, forget it.

52:59.000 --> 53:08.000
Anyway, we're getting into old man stuff. Let's move on and talk about, speaking of old man stuff, here's this new fangled game.

53:08.000 --> 53:18.000
Who's calling you in the middle of school day? Like on the pay phone, you know, they call you like, hey, give me a call. That doesn't make any sense.

53:18.000 --> 53:26.000
I only knew how to call with 1-800-COLLECT. Anyway, next story, Loki.

53:26.000 --> 53:39.000
Anyways, so Anthem is apparently working on their loot system, which some consider broken because it's frustrating with the balance of what they drop towards the end game stuff.

53:39.000 --> 53:49.000
So some of the fixes that they're going to be doing include common and uncommon equipment are no longer going to be dropped during end game activities.

53:49.000 --> 53:57.000
Which apparently is, you know, having an issue with, people are having an issue before where they're just ending up with all of a sudden they keep grinding at it.

53:57.000 --> 54:07.000
The resources needed to craft certain masterwork items from blueprints will be reduced from 25 masterwork embers to 15. Wow, that's 10 less.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
And none of this makes any goddamn sense to me because I don't play this game. And then they said many inscriptions.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
The grinding has been reduced.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
But the details. The audience needs the details of this game that they're probably not playing.

54:22.000 --> 54:31.000
Yeah, so they're making it less grindy so people aren't pissed off so that people will drop more money on their game and they'll make more money because they're EA and that's what they want to do.

54:31.000 --> 54:38.000
Because remember, if you support EA and buying all those microtransactions, then BioWare gets to live another day.

54:38.000 --> 54:57.000
So yeah. Other fun stuff about Anthem is, unfortunately with the whole loot stuff, not only is that an issue, but overall it hasn't done that great.

54:57.000 --> 55:05.000
In fact, Anthem's physical sales are half of that of Mass Effect Andromeda, which I think was not even that great compared to...

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
In Europe, I believe.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
In Europe.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
But this is a snapshot though.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
Is the pendulum really going to swing that hard in America versus Europe?

55:14.000 --> 55:20.000
Yeah, and it's physical sales. Granted, digital sales are up, so there's that.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
But are they up that much in two years since Andromeda?

55:22.000 --> 55:33.000
No, and I want to say they were looking at also, they're saying that Anthem sold roughly a quarter of Destiny 2's week one physical sales as well from back in September of 2017.

55:33.000 --> 55:45.000
They were also comparing the physical sales were both lower from Kingdom Hearts 3 and Resident Evil 2, which are recent games as well, so you can kind of compare the physical sales of that.

55:45.000 --> 55:51.000
So... I don't know. It's not off to a good start.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
We'll see when the numbers come out. I mean, EA is going to have to...

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
They're not going to share the numbers if the numbers are bad.

55:57.000 --> 56:04.000
They have to answer to their investors, so we're either going to see some numbers or we're going to see some real interesting wordsmithing happening.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
We'll see some numbers of people being laid off.

56:06.000 --> 56:12.000
Let's hope not. I would be very sad about that. I don't want to see BioWare go under, but...

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
And I don't want to turn into the dog pile on Anthem Show, because I know some people are having fun playing it.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Questbuster in chat says,

56:28.000 --> 56:35.000
And I know most people I know that are playing the game are saying the combat is really fun, but it does sound like there's just, you know...

56:35.000 --> 56:42.000
Again, I can't help but get the sense, yet again, it's a game that wasn't fully baked before it came out of the oven.

56:42.000 --> 56:48.000
And unfortunately, this is a reoccurring theme with a lot of EA things, except for somehow Apex Legends.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
But in some ways, Apex Legends isn't exactly a fully-fledged game either.

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
There's only, like, eight characters in Apex Legends. It's not that many characters for a game in 2019, right?

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Right.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
For that game, it does not seem to matter.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
You know? And I'm not hating on Apex Legends.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
What did Overwatch start with?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
It's fun.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Overwatch just got its 30th hero this week, I think.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
So they probably had, like, 16 at least.

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
No, it was more than that. It was probably 24, I want to say.

57:18.000 --> 57:25.000
We had what? We had Ana, Sombra, Orisa, Brigitte, Moira, and now Baptiste.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
I think 24, unless I'm missing somebody that came out. I think it's 24.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
So...

57:31.000 --> 57:37.000
And YYR points out if EA does have to do layoffs, which, again, we hope they don't, because there's been plenty of layoff news already,

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
they'll have to share those numbers. They kind of have a legal obligation to their shareholders and everything with that.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
Questbuster says, the combat is great. I just wish it was wrapped in a better game.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
S2100matt says, I just started playing Apex Legends yesterday. It's really cool.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
Although I feel bad for the people I'm teamed up with each game because I'm still learning it.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
YYR says, Overwatch had 21 heroes when the game launched.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
So I completely left out three people in what I was counting right there.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
But that happens. I don't have everything.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
Oh yeah, I left out. I did leave out because I forgot Doomfist was one of them as well.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
So yeah, there's some I forgot. Sorry!

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
So anyway, but yes, I know Batista's Hero 30 because I was just talking about it earlier today.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
So there you go.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Anyway, let's move on.

58:21.000 --> 58:28.000
Let's talk about some news regarding Final Fantasy XII and some of the changes that you're going to see with Final Fantasy XII,

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
the Zodiac Age, when it comes out on the Switch and on the Xbox One.

58:32.000 --> 58:38.000
Because, you know, the game already came out on PlayStation 4 and PC a little while ago.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
So for those people that are thinking about double dipping, especially when it comes to the Switch and the portability,

58:43.000 --> 58:48.000
what's kind of new? What are they bringing to the table that hasn't been done before?

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
There's going to be a license reset function. This is needed. I'm very happy to hear this.

58:54.000 --> 58:59.000
You can talk to Mont Blanc, the clan's interior leader in Rabanastre.

58:59.000 --> 59:06.000
You can reset and change your party member's jobs, allowing you to customize the jobs of the party that you want.

59:06.000 --> 59:14.000
So if you feel like you screwed up in building your characters, you don't have to start all over or reload in old state. You can reset.

59:14.000 --> 59:21.000
I think that alone is a badly, like, in saying it out loud, I'm like, God, this was needed.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
I'm surprised this wasn't here before. So a reset will be very nice.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Also additional, more than one Gambit set. This is pretty cool.

59:28.000 --> 59:37.000
Gambits are how you kind of program the AI, because you control one character, but the other two kind of do things based on a logic system known as Gambits.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
But you're kind of locked into whatever you design. If you want to change it, you need to go in there and change it.

59:42.000 --> 59:49.000
Well, now there's going to be extra Gambit sets. So you can do three unique sets to kind of switch between sets for different situations.

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
That's a great idea, because maybe you don't want your other party members using big spells unless it's a boss.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
You know, things like that. So that's really smart. That's going to be neat.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And then they're also talking about an improved New Game Plus, where you'll be able to have party members at level 90 and carry over items like weapons, magic, and gil.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And then specific on the Xbox One X version, 60 frames a second. You'll be able to play at that.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Nice.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah, very cool. I thought you could do that on PC version.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
You should be able to. It's a PC.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I think that's a new console feature, but still a pretty cool one at that.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Let's see. This would be if I were to buy Final Fantasy 12 on Switch, which I'm going to admit, Loki, I'm thinking about it.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It would be my fourth time buying Final Fantasy 12 because I had the original, I bought it on PS4, I bought it on PC during a sale.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So this would be the fourth time. But now I can have it portable and I can reset characters and kind of, I don't know.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I don't know, Loki. What do you think?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
You should do it.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Do you even own it one time?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Nope.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
All right. I'm going to chat over at twitch.tv slash Evaga Network.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Some love in the chat.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Oh, VG Realness says Doomfist, Ash, the cowgirl, and Hamster Hammond were the heroes I forgot.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Thank you. Wow, that was a fun game.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Who is Rob too old to remember?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Let's see.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Also in chat.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
darktoothy says last time I tried to beat 12, it did not go well.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Probably going to skip the Switch one.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Oh, well.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Bobby Blackwolf says I liked it.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Oh, that's about Final Fantasy 9.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
They're on a tangent on Final Fantasy 9 because that also came out on Switch very recently.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So some folks in chat are talking about that as well.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
ActDeftInChat says Rob, you're saying that like you haven't done it before.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
That's the whole joke. I'm notorious for buying a game multiple times.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Again, let's recall, how many times did I buy Mass Effect 3?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It was the PC, the Xbox trilogy, the PlayStation trilogy, and the Wii U.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So I bought that game four times.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And that wasn't even a remaster.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
That was just the original Mass Effect.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
If they do a remaster, I'll buy it again, for sure.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Anyway.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Enough about me. Stop trying to do an intervention.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Let's go to a new story. Loki.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yes, so this is kind of an interesting bit of trivia,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
but apparently one of the producers on the new Toejam and Earl game,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
which actually just got released, I think.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Oh yeah, I forgot they were bringing that back. That's cute.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Yeah, I know we mentioned that last week during releases,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
but Macaulay Culkin, yes, of Home Alone fame,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and now he's doing a lot more stuff,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
but apparently he is quite the retro game nerd,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and he is one of the executive producers on the game,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
because he was a huge fan of the original game,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
mentions that he used to play competitive,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
or he turned it into a competitive game with his friends,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
because he used to troll each other in the game,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and they even made a drinking game out of it.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But apparently, you know, he met with the developers,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
and has he actually done real work on this game,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
or is it more like a ceremonial type of title,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
where it's like, we're just going to call you a producer

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
to get that little celebrity, to have stories like this

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
around the internet that get the knowledge of our game out there.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Did he actually do stuff on the game?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
You know, basically, he...

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Gave feedback.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
He gave feedback, yeah.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
So he met with the developers in their office,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
and he got to play the game.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
He had the beta for a few days, he got to play that.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
He said he beat it, and he talked about some of the glitches

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
that him and his friends had discovered in the original game,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and they said including a move that granted players infinite rocket skates,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and in return, they showed him some concept art and stuff like that.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So I don't think he actually contributed anything to the game, per se.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Besides his feedback.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah, it was more of just kind of a fun thing to do.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
SG100Matt says, the ToeJam in our old game looks good.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yeah, I hear it's actually getting pretty good reviews

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
as far as retro revival type things go.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I think it's doing pretty well for itself, so that's pretty exciting.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
SG100Matt says, executive producer in title implies

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
that he helped fund it in some way.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Maybe he did.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Well, maybe. Maybe. We don't know.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I mean, they don't. Who knows?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Let's see.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Dartitsuya says, never got into ToeJam in our old,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
but I have the Genesis collection on Switch, so maybe I'll check it out.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And Questbuster says, definitely one of the weirdest games

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I've played on the Genesis.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Well, ToeJam in our old was kind of like a roguelike on the Genesis, wasn't it?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So for that to be coming back is, you know, it's timely.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So I guess he started off helping out the campaign

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
with his social media following to, you know, help promote the game,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
is one of the things, too, that kind of got his attention.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So he helped fund it by promoting it, I guess.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
So it's kind of like what Kylie Jenner did for Fyre Festival,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
is what Macaulay Cokin did.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Except this actually came out.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It is actually pretty decent.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
It's actually decent.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I did that for Bobby, who mentioned in chat that he watched

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
the Fyre documentary this weekend on Netflix, which I still haven't seen.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah, I haven't watched it either.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
My wife watched it without me, which I was disappointed.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
But have you in the way?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I don't mean to tangent here, but a cheap plug for if you're not aware,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
my one of my spinoff shows, Shaking and Crying with Aria Snark is back.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
We were on hiatus for a little bit, but it's back.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
There's been three new episodes since we came back.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And one of the hot topics has come up there that's worth asking about here

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
is the documentary Abducted in Plain Sight.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I did not watch it. My wife watched it.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
You really need to see Abducted in Plain Sight.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
She explained the whole thing to me.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It sounded ridiculous.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I watched part of the last episode, but I wasn't really into it.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I'm sure it would be funny from the beginning, but...

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
It's not really funny, actually.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It's kind of disturbing.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Funny as in, like, just...

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Shock and horror, yes.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
The hell?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yeah, the hell, exactly.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Alright, anyway.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
VeeGee Realness saying, oh my god, you guys need to watch it,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
is insane. I will at some point.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Maybe that's what I'll watch before the next episode. We'll see.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Anyway, let's move on to another one of your favorite topics,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Loki Mods and Skyrim.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Yes, Skyrim.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And this is also kind of tying a little bit in with Fallout 76, I guess.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
So, there's a mod that's been worked on for a while now

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
called Skyrim Together.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
That's basically a co-op mod for Skyrim.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
They'll allow you to play Skyrim up to, I think, it was like four to eight people.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
So, but there's a little bit of drama going on behind the scenes

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
because apparently the people that put together the team

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
behind the Skyrim Script Extender

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
have been claiming that the Skyrim Together people

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
are stealing their code for this project.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And so, because of that, you know,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
they've even written in a code license for Skyrim Script Extender.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Due to continued intentional copyright infringement

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
and total disrespect for moderate etiquette,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
the Skyrim Online team is explicitly disallowed

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
from using any of these files for any purpose.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You know, and this project's getting, you know,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
they've got, you know, $33,000 a month

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
from their Patreon backers to help fund this project.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
That's a lot of money.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And basically...

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
A fan project.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Yeah, and so, you know, in response, I guess,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
there was a Skyrim Together team member

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
that posted a comment in Reddit talking about, you know,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
the Skyrim Script Extender drama and says,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
We've had disagreements with the SKSE folks in the past,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
and I've tried to communicate with them,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
but they've never replied, so we stopped using their code.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
There may be some leftover code from them that was overlooked.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
When we removed it, it isn't as simple as deleting a folder.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Mainly our fault is because we rushed some parts of the code.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Anyways, we're gonna make sure to remove

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
what might have slipped through the cracks for our next patch.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And to be clear, you know, things they said,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
you know, of course, the SKSE members replied, you know.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So to be clear, you started using our code,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
asked for permission, never got permission,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
continued using it, eventually removed part of it,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
yet somehow left some of it in there,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
continued the charge for access the entire time,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
promised to totally clean up a now licensed tainted project.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Okay?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So there's still drama is basically what's coming out of the end of the day.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
My TLDR is, I don't give a shit what's going on behind these things,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I just want to play this mod,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
whatever you got to do to get this shit finished,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I don't care whose code you're in.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And how much money are you contributing?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I'm contributing zero.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And that's exactly how much money I'm going to contribute to this.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But I still want to play it.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So can we make that happen?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I want something for free.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Exactly.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Alright.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Well, I hope they can work all their dramas out

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
for the betterness of the player base.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I mean, can't both sides to some extent admit,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
but we didn't make Skyrim.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
We wouldn't have had to put so much goddamn code into it

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
if it wasn't so fucking buggy anyways.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Bethesda.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Alright.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Something that I actually logged into Fortnite today

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
to take a look at this,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
because the band Weezer,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
you know Weezer, right?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Yes.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Say it ain't so.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Alright, yeah.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Weezer made a new island in Fortnite to promote their new album.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
So the new album that just came out is the Black Album,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
although I think more people are talking about,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
was it the Teal Album or something?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
That has their cover.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It's like an All Covers album.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It has their cover of Africa, which has been on the radio.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
No Scrubs is on it.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
So I think more people are talking about the Teal Album.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
They're talking about the Black Album.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
But anyway, maybe this is why they need to go to Fortnite.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
So you can go to Weezer World,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
but it's in creative mode.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And I think a lot of people,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
when they're reading these headlines

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
and making their snap judgments on these,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
they're thinking,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
oh, you do battle in Weezer World now.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
No, it's this expansion, you may not be aware,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
but Fortnite doesn't just have the one versus 100 mode

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and some of the other, you know, the team modes and things,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
but you can actually have a creative mode.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
So they kind of tried to do a Minecraft-esque type of mode in the game.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Yeah, they also have a PvE mode too now.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
It's like battle...

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Well, you know what's funny?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
That was always supposed to be Fortnite.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Right, yeah.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
That was supposed to be the fucking game.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
No, I know that.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yeah.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I remember when it was before the battle.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Battle Royale was just like the afterthought type of thing.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
there's a part of me that wants to check out Fortnite creative mode,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
but that would require me playing Fortnite.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It's free.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I did.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I checked it out and you can just go in there and mess around.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And I took a look at the Weezer World.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And yeah, so it actually plays songs from the album.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
That's the one reason I didn't do it as a clip here.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I actually went into it intending to record a clip for this.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And then I realized,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
oh, that's a bad idea because it has all this Weezer music here.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And that's going to be copyright.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Strip the audio out.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Strip the audio out.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So sorry.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That's why I did not do B-roll for that tonight.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So you'll just have to look at it yourself, I suppose.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Or there's plenty of YouTubes and things like that.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Maybe other people on Twitch that are streaming it as well.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
But that's, I mean, it's a very clever marketing idea,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I suppose, to team up with this mega popular video game

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
to kind of get your album out there.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I mean, I'm sure there's lots of artists

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
that would love to get more promotion like this.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
But, you know, Weezer is of a certain level.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So it's a very interesting combination there.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
So anyway, it is part of the Season 8 update.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
So you do want to make sure you're updated

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
to the latest version of Fortnite,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
which has a bunch of new creative maps.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Weezer's just one of many new maps that are in there,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
which is also, yeah, I noticed when I went in there,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I was like, oh, Weezer World's like this first one of like,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
there's like seven of different worlds up here on the platform.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
That you can go visit.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So, yeah, kind of one way that Fortnite is trying to expand itself a little bit

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
is to tap into a little bit more of the Minecraft-esque side of things.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Very interesting.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Vidpower573 in chat says,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Weezer World sounds like a place Cheech and Chong would go to...

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Bobby Blackwolf also continues and says,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
yes, but I can be snobbish and say,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I've never played Fortnite,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
just like how I can say I've never played WoW.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I like to at least try everything once, especially, you know,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
because I do know that a ton of people are playing Fortnite.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I've even tried playing League of Legends, even though I'm not very good.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
That's why I went into Apex Legends as well,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
because these are all very big ranking games on Twitch,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
and I know lots of games that people are talking about.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So, I want to at least have a base understanding

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
of what these games are all about, even if I fully admit,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
but I don't really have time to sink all the hours into it myself,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
because I'd rather be playing XYZ,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
which I think is also perfectly acceptable.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I would say maybe the one place where I failed to do this is

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I haven't played a Madden game in a very long time.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I have before, but it's been a very long time.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I'm not going to drop 60 bucks to try out Madden.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Apex, Fortnite, League of Legends, those are all free games.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So, they're very easy to jump in there and try.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
You know, very, very minimal stuff,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
but I'm not going to drop 60 bucks on a game just to try it for that sake.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So, anyway.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Let's move on.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I think we're going to go and now visit the classic game of the week.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
So, we're going to take a trip into the gaming vault

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
and find a game that we think,

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
hey, you guys should be checking out the game this week.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Dark Soccer, obviously not here tonight.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
She had picked a game.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
We're going to roll that over to a future week.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So, I hastily got some footage together for a substitute game for tonight,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
which is one that I fondly remember,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and we're going to talk about tonight.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
We are going to talk about the game Super Adventure Island,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
is what we're going to talk about tonight,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and I think, yes, we have some footage of this game.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
So, this is the classic game of the week, Super Adventure Island,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
which, of course, was for the Super Nintendo.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
So, Super Adventure Island was released on the Super Nintendo,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
and part of the reason that I remember this game

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
and love this game so much was that the music is amazing.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I don't know how well you can hear it in the background there,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
but it was done by Yuzo Koshiro,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and it's one of his final soundtracks that he did, yeah.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
This game was released in Japan in January of 92,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
and it was released in North America in April of 92.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
In Japan, it was called Master Takahashi's Great Adventure Island.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
It also was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2011,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and it was the starter of a Super Adventure Island series

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
because there was a Super Adventure Island 2 that came out later.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
There were three of the regular Adventure Island games on the regular NES.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
There was also a mobile phone game called Super Adventure Island,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
but it is not the same game, so it is not what I'm talking about here tonight.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So, the plot of the game is that you are trying to find Tina,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
even though they mistranslated, I guess, the name to Genie Jungle

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
in English materials.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
That's kind of interesting that the name completely changed

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
based on translation issues.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So, it's kind of your very typical 90s save the princess

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
from disaster type of games.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
That whole, you know, I think we've seen this many times before.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
But anyway, an evil sorcerer plans to turn Tina into a stone statue for eternity,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and you're not going to let that happen.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
You're going to venture through five stages, four areas in each stage

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
for a total of 20 levels to make sure that doesn't happen.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
In the first three areas, you go through like an obstacle course,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
which is what's happening in the video that we're seeing right now.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And then the final area is a boss battle,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
which we should see one of those coming up here in a little bit.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Obviously, some of the differences between this Adventure Island

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
and the Adventure Island on the NES that made it very different

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
was much improved visuals.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I mean, this game looks phenomenal, especially considering it's kind of early on

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
in the Super Nintendo's life.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Like, the sound especially, and again, I call that out,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
the sound is so good, and it's not just Yuzo Koshiro.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I mean, that's a huge part of it.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
But just like the sampling and kind of what they did

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
with the Super Nintendo's built-in hardware is really great,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and it's really something you should check out.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
So in the game, much like before, you can use an axe,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
but you also get fireballs as you upgrade your weapon.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You also get a boomerang.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So you can either throw an axe that moves in like an arc-type pattern,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
or you can throw a boomerang.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And you're trying to collect fruit that fills up a life bar

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
that slowly counts down as you move through the level.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You can think of it kind of like a built-in timer.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And the fruit helps restore on that timer.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
There is a score in the game as well.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So as you grab fruit, kill enemies and things like that,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
you increase your score.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
So if you want to play for score, that is something you can do as well.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So yeah, that's a little bit about Super Adventure Island.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I guess it is also one of the games that is featured in a manga

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
that was called Cyber Boy that came out between 1991 and 1993.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
So I think we're just about to get into one of the boss battles

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
here on the video that we're looking at on our Twitch stream.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Yeah, so you can kind of see.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And again, another thing that really set this game apart,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
being that it's on the Super Nintendo hardware versus the Nintendo hardware,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
is that these bosses are gigantic.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
They were pretty big on the Nintendo version, taking up multiple sprites.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
But these bosses were definitely bigger.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
You had these transparent ghost things,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
and the head and the hand kind of are all moving separately.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's pretty intricate and pretty awesome.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And as far as me, one place that I remember this game

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
is I remember this was one of the very first Super Nintendo games

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
that I rented, right?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Because you could actually rent stuff in the video store.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And I have fond memories of renting this game.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And again, a lot of it was just kind of after the first time I rented it,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I remember renting it again because I wanted to hear the soundtrack

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
because it was so awesome.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
So years later, when I put together like, oh, it was Yuzuru Koshiro

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
that did this.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And of course, Yuzuru Koshiro did what, like Streets of Rage.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
He did a lot of the Midnight Maximum Tune racing games.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
You know, he's a great composer.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
So, I mean, I just I'm a big fan of his work.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
So I'm not surprised at all that a game like Super Adventure Island

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
was something that kind of caught my eye and ears

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
because he was a part of that.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
So there it is.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Did you ever play this game?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah, I did.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Yeah. What'd you think?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
It was all right. I liked it.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Yeah. It was a fun game.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So, I mean, the game itself, you know, it's not Mario World

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
or some of the must have Super Nintendo games of its time.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
But I think it's fun enough.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It still holds up.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Yeah, it still holds up.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And it looks really good.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
You know, it's still, as far as like graphics and stuff like that,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
it really holds up after all this time.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
So there it is, your classic game of the week,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Super Adventure Island for the Super Nintendo.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And I'm looking in our chat over at twitch.tv slash fog network.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Dark Tetsuya points out, I know he did the soundtrack

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
to Dungeons and Dragons, Eye of the Beholder,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
the Sega CD version.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Fantaz points out Skateboard Boy.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Oh, yes, there are those parts of the game where he gets on a skateboard

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
and he's kind of like automatically moving.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And in those parts, your life isn't draining.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So that's part of like the trade off is that if you kind of move

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
into a constant state of motion, you don't get the penalty

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
of your life slowly draining away.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
VidPower573 in chat says, I wish they would revisit

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
the Adventure Island series, whoever owns the IP.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Well, I know the developer of this game, let's see, was Hudson Soft.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Wasn't it Hudson?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
That's Konami.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Konami.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
So there will not be any more Adventure Island games,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
but there might be a pachinko machine in the near future.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
You can always scratch your fingers.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
OK, obviously, I'm being a little bit silly, but well,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
fruit and slaughter machines.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Yeah, right.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Or am I?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
All right.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Anyhow, we're going to go to our next story,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
which was something that I actually taped a little segment

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
about earlier today.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
OK, so also in the news this week, Overwatch unveiled their 30th hero

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
that they're planning on adding to the game.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
So as you can see in the background here, we're taking a look

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
at Overwatch and this is Batiste, who is the brand new hero

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
that they're adding to Overwatch.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
So the way I'm able to actually look at Batiste right now,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
you may not know this depending on what platform you play Overwatch on,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
but on the PC, there's this version of the game called

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
the Public Test Region, where you can actually log in

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
and take a look at new characters as they're being developed.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
This is probably a good way for the Overwatch development team

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
to actually see, you know, how are they performing in a game,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
you know, are they too strong, are they overpowered,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
do they need to be rebalanced, and that sort of thing.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And that's the kind of thing you can really only tell probably

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
from doing live play.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
They can do all the stuff they want in the office,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
but this is, you know, really a good way to figure it out.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
But it's neat because it actually gives the rest of us

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
kind of a way to get a sneak peek at the hero

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
and see everything that they're doing.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
This is not something that you can actually do on the PlayStation 4

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
or the Xbox One version of the games, at least not today,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
not to say that it'll never ever be the case moving forward,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
but we'll see in the future.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
So anyways, you can actually, you know, see they have them

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
in the hero gallery and you can kind of get a little closer look at them,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
except they don't actually have everything here in the test region yet,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
they just have some of the basic things, like you can see, you know,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
some heroic type emotes here for when they win matches and stuff.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
You can also, let's see, the little highlight intros,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
which are, you know, always kind of fun to watch,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
but these are the very basic things.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
They're not going to show you, give you a real sneak peek at the advanced stuff,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000
like what kind of skins might Batiste kind of have extra for, you know,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
in matches and winning match poses and things like that.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
They're not going to really add that until probably, you know,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
about another week or two when they get a little closer

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
to actually putting him in the full game.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So let's actually take a look.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
We can actually go into a training match,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
which is a good way to kind of get a taste of the character for the first time.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I know I use this practice range a lot to try to just get the feel

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
for characters I'm not very familiar with.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
CLC Batiste is over here with the support classes,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
and he can actually go into the match,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
and you can actually kind of get to use him a little bit here.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You can see that he has a gun there, a very loud gun,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
that I can shoot these little training bots with.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
That's one thing to do with it.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So his left click, and I'm going to be speaking in PC terms

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
just because that's the way I'm used to playing the game,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
although I'm sure, you know, it's very easy to figure out what this would map to

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
if you're a PS4 or you're an Xbox One person.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
But the left click is going to be that button that attacks other robots,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
but the right click is actually this kind of like, it's like a bomb type of thing.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It kind of reminds me of like maybe what Junkrat would use with his weapon,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
but it's actually like a heal bomb.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
So when you use that, it's actually like heal bombing these friendly bots,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
so you can see those little tiny graphs are actually increasing their health a little bit.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And then of course, when I run out of heal bombs,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
or if I run out of the little regular ammunition to attack guys with,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
he's actually going to go into his reload animation,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
which he can also trigger at any time by hitting the reload button or pressing R.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Now, some of the real fun stuff would be some of the other abilities that he has access to.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
So I'm going to wait for these little bots that died to come back.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
But I will mention that you can always at any time see the abilities.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I think it's, is it F1 or F12?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I can't remember what it is on PC all of a sudden.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Oh yeah, you hold down F1, and you can actually see what some of the different abilities are,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
and it kind of gives you a little recap.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Oh, these are going to do, you know, if you hit shift, it's going to do this.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And again, I'm pretty sure PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have similar features as well.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
So you'll notice the shift key, which is kind of like, I guess his first ability,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
is like a regenerative sort of aura.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So if I hit that button, you'll notice the bots suddenly start to increase health very slowly,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
and it lasts for a few seconds.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So it was able to absorb some of the hits that were coming in from the bots,

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and you can see it kind of heals.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And I'll do it one more time here.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
If they don't die, you can really get a sense of how much they heal.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
You can also see he kind of threw out a little bit of an aura there,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
so you can get a sense for the range.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I notice it doesn't draw on the ground what the range looks like.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Like, say, if you were playing Lucio, and you can actually really see the range of heals and so forth,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
it would actually show there, but it doesn't show with that.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Now, some of the other abilities that he has,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
this E key is actually going to do an ability that they call the immortality field,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
and it's actually going to prevent these bots altogether from dying.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So, oops, I did that too soon.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I thought I had a chance to place it.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
That's part of the reason why you do the test realm,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
because you get to know your different abilities there.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So he actually just threw it.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I thought I would actually get to place it first.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So now I've got to wait for that ability to recharge,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
which will only be a couple more seconds here.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
So you see a little cool down there, which will give those guys time to...

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
So this bot on the right here is getting very close to death.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
So when he gets very close to death, what I'm going to do is throw down that immortality field.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Okay, so now watch.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Next time he gets shot, his health is not going to drop past a certain point,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
because that immortality field is up,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
so it'll give me a chance to heal him up, do whatever I need to do,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
once that field is down, because obviously it's not going to last forever.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Immortality is kind of a very powerful ability.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But it'll give me a chance to drop that field, heal up, do what I need to do,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
especially if there's another support character.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
If there's a Mercy or something, you could really use that immortality field to heal somebody up to full,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000
so that it'll take a long time to get them killed again.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Alright, so that's just about all the abilities, except he does have a jumping kind of ability.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000
If you use this control, he can kind of hold down control, and it actually lets him fly up.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
So he can't really fly, but it's kind of neat that he has this high jump ability

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
that you can kind of charge with control, and then you can kind of get up to these higher platforms

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
that most characters wouldn't be able to do.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
So that's just kind of a neat little extra thing.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
High jump boots, if you will.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And then of course, lastly, is his ultimate ability, which is kind of a little different.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I like it. It's something you're really going to have to pair with other abilities.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
But the Q ability for his ultimate is the amplification matrix.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So that's going to do a matrix, and it's going to double damage, but also healing effects,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
depending on what's passing through the matrix where.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
So for example, if I put the matrix down, and this is the one you actually get to place.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
This is how I got confused earlier.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
But let me show you. I'm going to kill this bot on the left.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And you can see, it took about three hits to do him in.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
But with this field, look at that. It just took one.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And if I go to the other side and do my heals, look how much healing he got as that passes through that field.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And you'll notice it doesn't last long at all.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
So that's going to be interesting to see how that works,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
because you're really going to have to take coordination to make the most out of that thing.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Just imagine a Bastion turret on the other side of it or something like that

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
that's going to really shred the heck out of the other team if it's timed right.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
So it'll be interesting to see if Batiste has a place in the competitive mode.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
It's something you're going to see in the Overwatch League.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Not all heroes seem to get equal representation in the Overwatch League,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
so I know it's something the developers are probably working a little bit on balancing.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
But I know it's just a matter of time before Batiste makes it to the game.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I know I love to play support characters. I like to play Mercy, Lucio.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Not so good with Ana, because I'm not a very good sniper, but I do like to play support characters.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And I also like playing Junkrat as DPS, so just this heal bomb thing.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
This is going to be awesome and a lot of fun to play.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
So I'm definitely looking forward to Batiste hitting live realms very soon.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.000
So there you go, a little sneak peek at Batiste, the 30th hero coming to Overwatch,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
announced by the team this week.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
And now we'll go back to the show live in the studio.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
All right, we are back here live in the studio with episode number 766 of our show,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
already in progress for tonight, March 3rd of 2019.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I can't believe it is already March.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Yep.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Wow. I don't know how much of that clip you saw there of the Batiste in Overwatch.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
You don't really play Overwatch at all, do you?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
No, I have it, but I don't play it.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
It's yet another one of those games you just have.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
My co-worker, he peer pressured me into buying it.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And then I played it a little bit and I was like,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I can't really dedicate a ton of time to this, so I'm not going to play it anymore.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
It's one of those things I play obviously very casually.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I never get into the competitive stuff.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I know season 15 just started in Overwatch,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
so there's a lot of people really getting into the competitive stuff right now

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
and talking about placement matches and stuff.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
That's never really been my thing in Overwatch,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
but at least in a while I enjoy a casual match, especially with friends.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Again, that's another one of those games that's kind of fun to stream with friends

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
or just get online and play multiplayer with friends.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
But it is a bummer that things are so split up,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
like I have some friends on PC,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
but I have other friends that only play on PlayStation 4,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and then yet others that play on Xbox.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I really understand why Blizzard didn't want to pull that all together,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
especially when it comes to mouse and keyboard versus controller,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
because the games are actually tuned separately because of that.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
But did they have PlayStation and Xbox, though?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Do they have cross-play with those?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
No, not yet.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Maybe it won't be that way forever, but that'll be up to them.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
But anyway, I'm excited about the new hero.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I think he's got a lot of very interesting moves

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
and looks like somebody that I could actually enjoy playing,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
although I'm sure for the first couple weeks that he's out,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
everybody is going to be playing,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
because that's always what happens with the new heroes,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
that everybody picks them.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And you can only pick a hero one time in a match

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
unless you're doing that special mode, the no-limits mode in the arcade.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Then you can pick as many as you want.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
But for the most part, you can only do the one.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So anyway, let's move on with some rapid-fire news

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and talk about some other things happening around our industry

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
a little quicker tonight.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Let's talk a little bit about what we're going to be getting

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
for our free games for the month of March.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So starting off on the Xbox side of the house,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.000
we've got Adventure Time Pirates of the Enchiridin.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I don't know how you pronounce that,

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
but that's going to be coming out for the month of March.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:54.000
And then for the second half of March through the middle of April,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
we have Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And then for the first half of March for the Xbox 360

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
backwards compatible games, Star Wars Republic Commando.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And then for the second half, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
So that's pretty nice, four games there.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
On the PlayStation side of the house,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
this is the first month that they're not giving away games

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
for other systems aside from PlayStation 4.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Well, when you just killed one of them.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
So the only games you get this month,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
you get Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered,

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
which is pretty great, and The Witness.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Ooh, that's one of those games I never got around to playing

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
that everybody's like, you need to play The Witness,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
and I just never did, so that's cool.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
So those will be available starting March 8th.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
So, cool. I mean, I still, though, as a contrast,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I understand that Call of Duty, that's a pretty decent game.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.000
But in contrast to just reading four games on the Xbox platform

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:06.000
versus the two, you know, it doesn't skew it in their favor, I should say.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Okay, fair enough. Let's travel over to some news about Evo.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Hey, hey, hold on.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Oh, do you have one more?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
We got one more thing to talk about,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:20.000
and very important news regarding a very popular adventure game franchise,

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
the Leisure Suit Larry franchise.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
So we have Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams, Don't Dry.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.000
That's rated now for the PlayStation 4 and the Switch,

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and should be coming out at some point,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
but we don't know much about it aside from the fact that, you know.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And new people are doing this now.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I think there's new people involved in making this.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I don't think it's the developers that did that last game that didn't do so well.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
No, it's not.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And based on the screenshot, it looks pretty decent.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
It kind of has a 90's Sierra aesthetic look to it.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I'm into it.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I'll check it out.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I even played the shitty ones.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I mean, it's fine.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Well, Magna Cum Laude, that was the one that was not great, right?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Wasn't that the name of it?

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
There was one that had a funny dialogue system that you were talking to women

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
in your little sperm and you had to dodge stuff,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
and that was funny, but the game was not good.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out, I'm pretty sure Al Lowe still isn't involved.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.000
It's probably a safe bet that this, you know, it's now just about the IP

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
and trying to sell games just based on the strength of the name,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Leisure Suit Larry, and what that means about the type of raunchy humor

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
you're going to get in a game.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
It means absolutely nothing to the people that were probably, you know,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
buying the games nowadays.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Anyway, now I'll talk about Evo 2019.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
The official lineup for Evo has been announced,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
and the games that will be a part of it,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
including Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Dragon Fighters, Dragon Fighter Z,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
if you will, Street Fighter V, Tekken 7, Mortal Kombat 11,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Soul Calibur VI, Samurai Showdown.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Did you know that they're making a new Samurai Showdown?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
No.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
This is not the old school Neo Jewel.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I mean, it is still, it's like that series,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
but now they're doing like a new one.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So, yeah, it looks pretty good.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
There was some other news that I don't think many of our show wrote tonight,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
but, yeah, I'll mention it now.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
There's a new Samurai Showdown coming.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
It looked kind of neat, so that's going to be a part of it.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
But it's not what's a part of the lineup that people are talking about.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
It's what's not a part of the lineup, because guess what got bumped this year?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Melee.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So, Super Smash Brothers Melee is no longer in the top nine,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
the main games that are in contention there.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
And there's many people that are saying, finally,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
but, you know, there's other people that are like, but, but, but, you know.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
But I kind of think now that you have Smash Brothers Ultimate,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I'm not hearing a lot of, like, it's bad or I don't like Ultimate.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Like, I do feel like most people accept Ultimate as kind of like the definitive edition,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
because it does have every character.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And, sure, there's always going to be people that want their retro throwbacks.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Right.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Yeah, there's always going to, I understand, I respect that,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
but, you know, as far as, you know.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
That's why you don't see like Street Fighter II on there.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I mean, you have five.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
It's true.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
So, anyway, it is the year 2019.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So, this is the first time Melee will not be featured since 2012,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000
because there was another, I think it did take a hiatus at another point,

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
not long after the game came out before the competitive scene kind of built itself back up.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
So, there you go.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
It is not happening there.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Let's see.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Some folks in chat.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
YYR says, still, Melee was fun to watch.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Act F says, finally.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, the people that still like Melee is because they found glitches that were never intended,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
and that's why they own everyone else in Melee, and Ultimate doesn't have said glitches.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Well, I mean, it's not like the Melee community suddenly can't exist simply because they're not in EVO.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I bet somebody is streaming that game on Twitch right now, and go for it.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000
And there's still going to be tournaments, and it will be part of, it's just not going to be on the EVO stage this year.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
So, that doesn't mean the game, you know what else isn't on the stage?

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Dance Dance Revolution.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
But I still know people to this day that don't shut up about that game, and that is just fine, too.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
So, it's not going to kill the community just because it isn't there.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Unfortunately, this story is not loading for me, but I think I know the gist of what this was about.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
There's a Sega Mega Drive Mini that's happening.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
So, they're doing another one of those mini consoles.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
This is for the Mega Drive, and they want you to vote.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
What do you want?

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Which Sonic the Hedgehog, which Puyo Puyo, or which Shining Force title do you want to make sure is in this?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And I would think the correct answer would be all of them, but for some reason Sega is looking at limiting this.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I don't know why they want to do that.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Because those ROM file sizes are so huge!

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
We can only fit so much onto one console.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Fucking dumb.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I know, I know. Anything, I saw you got the story.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Is there anything important that I missed in that?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
No, it's just basically they have three poles right now.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Sonic the Hedgehog, or Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Puyo Puyo.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
It's this or that.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Yeah, Puyo Puyo, or Puyo Puyo Sue.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And then they have Shining Force Legacy of the Great Intention, or Shining Force 2.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Porque no los dos, if I can call up a famous gif that's out there.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Why not both, as for all those questions.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Alright, anyway.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:16.000
If you have not picked up Final Fantasy Dissidia, or Dissidia Final Fantasy NT if you will.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
A free version of the game is coming out for Playstation 4 and PC on March 12th.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
But of course since it's free, you can't play everybody.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
You will only get a rotating weekly roster of heroes and villains.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
But of course, you can purchase characters if you'd like.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And you can buy more weapons a la carte as well.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.000
If you are already playing the game, this should be breathing new life into the multiplayer section of the game.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And giving this game a second chance.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Because I'm not sure, I don't know where the financials are at for this game.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:52.000
But I gotta admit, I played the demo that they put out and I had to file it in the I don't get it category.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Like sorry, maybe if you're a Dissidia fan out there, put together one of those seven things that explains the game to me.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
The original Dissidia, I was kinda like that too.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I was like okay, so I slide around on these things sometimes and then I hit people and stuff is happening and I'm not really sure.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
But granted, the original Dissidia was back on the Playstation portals.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
So, I don't know.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I think it was the PSP or was it the Vita? Jesus, I don't even remember.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
The original was the PSP.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Okay, so it was the PSP.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
So we actually had it as a classic game not that long ago actually, funny enough.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But you know what?

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Despite all sales shade aside, what a great new way.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I mean the game has been out for a little bit now.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
It's been out for several months.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So I think all the people that were gonna buy it at face value have probably done it at this point.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
So what a good way to breathe like a second life into the game by doing a free version.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And you know what?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Maybe now I can give it another shot.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Maybe something didn't click for me in the demo, but it will in the full game.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000
But at the price of free, I could go in and take that risk and check it out.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
So, we'll see.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Some other things that are coming out this week.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Loki.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Well, this week we've got a game, Alien League, that's out on PC.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Dead or Alive 6 coming out on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Actually, I'm sorry, this is the first.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
That would have already come out.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Okay, let's do this week.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Not much, actually.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Left Alive on PC and Playstation 4.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Devil May Cry 5 coming out on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
And then Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn on the 3DS.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Alright, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases over there.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Not a lot, a lot of stuff.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
We have just a couple games on the Playstation 4.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Flowers, Les Quatre Cezanne.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I think it's got a French name, but it's a Japanese release.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
That game is out this week on March the 7th, but I think the big game is Devil May Cry 5,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
which is the same day.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000
It's a worldwide release, so it's the same day we're getting it in the US as well as, spoiler alert, sorry, Europe.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
So that's the big one on the Playstation 4 this week.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Playstation Vita's obviously starting to slow down a little bit, but it's not dead yet.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
They've got a release on March 14th, but I guess I'll get to that next week.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Quickly checking the Nintendo Switch to see if they've got anything big coming out there.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
No, it's a slow week.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I mean, Devil May Cry 5 is obviously the big release and kind of taking the attention,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
but not a very competitive week in Japan this week.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
That's it.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
How about Europe?

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Europe, you have a few games coming out, so starting off with Left Alive.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
That's going to be out on Playstation 4.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
The Occupation on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn on 3DS.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And Devil May Cry 5 on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
That's it.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Any titles in the next week or anytime soon that you're looking at picking up, Loki?

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Do you have your backlog of things you won't play?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Actually, I was thinking about maybe picking up Trials,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
because they had a new Trials game that came out this week.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
But I'm not sure if I'm going to play that right away.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I actually went back and was looking at playing the last Trials game,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
because I still have that.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I don't remember what they called it.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
They had that spin-off Trials game.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Well, they had Trials of the Blood Dragon that I checked out.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It was kind of lame, but it was just okay.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And then they had the Trials, and they had the extra special Trials

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
with the unicorn and the flaming cat.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
It was crazy stuff, so I need to go back and play that.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
But the new Trials game looks alright.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I don't know if I want to pick it up right now.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I may wait for a sale for that.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Alright. Well, let's go to the mailbag.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Every week, we invite your emails.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Participate at orangeloundtrader.com.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
It's the place to send emails,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
and we read some of our favorite emails here on the show.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Actually, we got a great response to mailbag last week.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
We have four emails.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Sweet!

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Yeah, we got a lot to talk about tonight, so let's get into it.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
So we're going to do our first email tonight,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
which comes to us from Meermuse, is the one that sent in this email,

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
saying, Dear OLR, I've been listening for 12 years

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
at my factory job here in Baltimore.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
That's a long time. Thank you very much.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
It helps pass the time, but I was always half-listening in a very passive way.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Some info was missed. Sorry, because work came first.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
You got nothing to apologize for.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Sorry, I half-listened the show, too, so it's fine.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
We're fine being background noise. It's all good.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And especially if you're trying to listen to us at work,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I completely understand if work comes first.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Yeah, but like Loki jokes.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I mean, he jokes, but sometimes, you know,

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
as we're trying to do a live show, other things are going on.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Like, we might have to completely adjust what we're doing on the fly

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
because, you know, we unexpectedly had a host out.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Or my cat will be causing terror in the other room,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
and I've got to go tend to it.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
So sometimes we have to multitask as well. It's all good.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Anyway, Meermuse continues.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Now with Twitch, I watch what I can live.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I love reading the chat scroll, and if I ever think of something to add,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I can on the spot.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Better yet, when I finish watching on the archives,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
my husband is often right next to me,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
and we watch and talk together about the gaming news.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Let's be honest. The only news that really matters. LOL.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Bottom line is I think the Twitch move was fantastic.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I feel more connected, more interactive, and more represented.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I've told more friends about the show because they don't listen to podcasts,

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
but do watch Twitch streams.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Keep up the good work.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Meermuse, whose name is noted there, is Emily.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So thank you. Thank you so much for that.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I mean, we were always a live show with the audio part of it,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
but I do think there's something about the Twitch community

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and being able to see the chat on demand, which you couldn't do before.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I mean, you could be in chat if you're there live,

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
but if you weren't able to be there live.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
But a lot of people are kind of watching the live experience

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
when they can during the week,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
because if you are a subscriber at VOG Network,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000
which you can use your free Twitch Prime if you're so inclined,

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000
to subscribe to VOG Network, you get the chat stuff and the video side by side.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Although I will caution you, chat only saves for like two weeks, I think,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.000
because you could watch any episode since we moved to Twitch.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
So you could go all the way back to the December episodes,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
but chat's no longer there.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
And that's a Twitch decision, not us.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
They only save the chat scrolls for like two weeks.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
So you don't want to watch it.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
We'll just have to incorporate it in the bottom somewhere.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
You can add to the chat, too, if you feel so inclined.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
So even though it won't be there live, we actually see the comments later.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
So, you know, especially if you have something really profound

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
or something you want to say, like, you know, if it's something that catches my eye,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I'll bring it up on a later show.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Like, maybe you play a game like Dissidia,

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and so you want to leave a comment about it as to what we're all missing out on.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
The trailer looked cool.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
It did.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
It's just the game.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I just don't understand.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I thought it would just be a fighting game, and it's kind of not that.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
All right. Anyway, let's see.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
There's a P.S. to this.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I'm a very sick person, so I have a few ideas for your starting panels.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Oh, those little things we do at the beginning of the show.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Again, that's part of the Twitch thing, but the little will not be seen tonight.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
So I'm not going to read those, because I might.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
There's actually one of these that's really, oh, wait, they're all good.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
But one of them is like, I'm going to use it next week, because it's timely good.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Well, I thought for sure we would have one with,

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
oh, what the hell is the meme, the trolly thing that's going around?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Oh, my God, the kids.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Oh, Momo?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
The Momo challenge.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I swear, I thought they were going to have a moment.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I got one for, I'll just say it now, and then you all act surprised

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
so you see it later, cooking Momo.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
How about that? You like that?

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
We'll do it.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
That would have been a good one for tonight.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I wish I thought of that.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Maybe in a future week.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
We'll do cooking Momo in a future week.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
All right.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
All right.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
All right.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Moving on.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Don't worry.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Momo will fix it.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Let's get to an email from Flaco Jones, who said,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
just wanted to clarify something that came up on the last show about Ninja.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
While I do take some issues with the guy, he seems like an overall entertaining strainer,

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
but he has not, as Loki said last week, dropped the homophobic F-word on stream.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Perhaps Loki was thinking of the recent story

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000
where the DJ Deadmau5 dropped that slur on his Twitch stream

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
than just non-apology apologized for it.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
I can't remember who the hell is dropping the F-bomb everywhere.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I mean, Jesus Christ.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Too many people that need to stop, that's for sure.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
But I do think last week when he said that, I said,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I don't know if that's true, Loki.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So I'm glad Flaco Jones is here to correct it

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
because we shouldn't attribute shitty things

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
if somebody didn't actually say those things.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
So our apologies on that.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
But otherwise, everything else we said I think still holds true.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Which I don't remember what we said.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Anyway, Flaco Jones continues,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Oh, and I also wanted to answer Metal Mayhem's question from the call last week

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
about what critically panned game do you love?

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000
My favorite critically panned game is Game & Wario for the Wii U.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
It's one of my favorite Wii U party games, despite its 61 on Metacritic.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Now, that's mostly because I love the Pictionary-style sketch game,

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000
but I even found a lot of the other included minigames quite fun.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Way better than the 61 score would have you believe, at least.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Anyway, thanks for the streams, and as always, have a great show, Flaco Jones.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Well, thank you. I appreciate that because it's a little polite correction,

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
but followed by a participation, so that's good.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
And I remember Flaco being a fan of Game & Wario

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
because I think that's where I played it, was at his place.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
So it makes sense to me. Great.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Alright.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
ActDeaf does want to point out, 61 isn't bad.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
It's just average.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I still think it works as an answer, though, because sometimes, you know, an average.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
On the Nintendo bell curve, it's probably true.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
That's true, on the Nintendo bell curve, yeah.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Alright, we have another email tonight, and this email is from Retertainment,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
who says, Dear Mr. Smoosh and other people,

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
by now you've probably talked about the decision Apple made

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000
to delist episodes of podcasts that include the episode number of that podcast.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
If you haven't discussed this decision yet, please feel free to rant.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Okay, so here's what's up.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
So Apple sent an email to all the podcasters that talked about some good guidelines

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
and I think some tags that they generally saw that people weren't really using.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And I don't think the email was worded as well as it could have been

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
because part of the email kind of made it sound like, or gave that impression,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
that if you're putting episode numbers in your titles because you're not using the tags,

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
we're not going to accept your podcasts on iTunes

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
or we're going to delist your podcasts from iTunes.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And as you can imagine, a lot of people threw a fucking fit over that

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
because a lot of people put episode numbers in their descriptions.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Of course, including us at Orange Lounge Radio, but many different shows do that.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Now it is very important to note, because, you know, before you guys that have been following the news

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
sent me the emails and chat, Apple did reverse course on this decision.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So they saw the tweets, they got the emails, the calls, or what have you,

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
and Apple sent out a follow-up email that made it very clear in bold, large font,

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000
we will not delist your show if you have your episode number in the title.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
But then went on to kind of say, we're talking about the tags

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
and we want you guys to explore the tags.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
And so for the sake of this email, too, because I don't think in the email

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
we ever talk about that Apple did reverse course on the decision,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I think it is an important thing to put out there.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000
But, you know, it does bring up this point that whereas Apple brought podcasting to the forefront,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000
you know, podcasting existed before iTunes, but Apple definitely brought that to a huge...

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I mean, our numbers here at Orange Lounge Radio were never bigger than that first month

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.000
that Apple launched iTunes, because we were a gaming podcast that existed beforehand.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000
And so we were on iTunes that first week, and so we were doing really, really well.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Our numbers were, like, higher than they've ever been.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000
But why aren't they still that high? I guess our show sucks. I don't know.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
All the big websites and all the celebrities and everybody else started getting into it

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
and kind of diluting the pot.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000
And, you know, I love indie podcasts and I'm all for more people

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000
and more diverse perspectives on games, so I'm not butthurt about it, I swear.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
But I do think it's important that now at this point in 2019,

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I don't think everybody's getting their podcasts on iTunes.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
No.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
We have Spotify, we have TuneIn, we have Google has their own,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
and there's other ones as well.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And you can listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
We're not on Spotify yet, but I am going to correct that.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
That is merely an intentional problem.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
It's nothing against Spotify but about an upcoming move,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
and I don't want to have the Spotify there until the move happens.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
So there is a reason for that.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
The only one we intentionally held back on was Stitcher.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I will not have this show on Stitcher because for way too long,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Stitcher was not updating this feed and they were not doing anything about it,

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
which caused our listeners to send us emails saying,

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Where is your show? Why aren't you updating the show?

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
And so I said, You know what? Fuck it.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
And I pulled it from Stitcher because if Stitcher can't accurately represent this show,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
then I'm going to put the listeners somewhere else.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
And this is what it kind of came down to for me with Apple as well,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
and I wrote some tweets about this, and I was like,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
You can't kick all of us off iTunes.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Like NPR is putting episode numbers.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
A lot of nonfiction people put episode numbers in there.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
You know what? Apple cannot kick us all off.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
They really can't. Let them try.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000
We'll simply advise our listeners to go somewhere else.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Would you guys be willing to go somewhere else besides iTunes to listen to this show?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I bet many of you would be happy to be here on Twitch or somewhere else.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:50.000
And I'm just saying that I saw way too many people have that gut reaction of,

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Fuck, I've got to go through my entire feed and update everything right now

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
because I don't want to get kicked out of Apple.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000
And I was kind of like, I let my cigarette and cross my legs and said,

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Let them fucking come.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Let them fucking come.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000
And I think if more of us would band together like that,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
any podcasters would stick together.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And when a website tries to control what the podcasting standard should be,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
which no company owns,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I think we do need to band together and put our foot down and say,

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Not on my watch.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Just because Siri doesn't want to get confused.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Well, no, it's about the tags.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000
And from their perspective, I get what they were getting at,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
but they just didn't communicate it right.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And so they heard that loud and clear that they didn't.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And I think they kind of did a good job fixing that, at least on the back end.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
So there you go.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I'm trying to think if there's anything else on that whole debacle I need to say.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I don't think so.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Anyway, I do want to finish Redertainment's thought, though.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
It is beyond evident that the decision made by Apple is

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
and was a dumb fucking decision made before anybody fully even bothered

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
to think of the wide-ranging consequences of this dumb fucking decision.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Can you think of any others?

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I mean, other than the decision 62 million plus people made in 2016.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Any reasonable person knows that the morally abhorrent racist charlatan

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
is a mistake and has been since its conception.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I'm just reading the email.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
That was, again, from Redertainment.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
So thank you very much for the email.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
But, yeah, at the end of the day,

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I don't think any one company should control the podcasting standard.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
And if they try to do it, then we should.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
We made you, and we can break you just as easily.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
All right, anyway.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I'm trying to see if we have any chat comments on that whole thing.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Yeah, OnlySonic says, just need an RSS feed.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
That's what podcasting is.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Podcasting is audio RSS.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
That's what it is.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
It's just podcasting was kind of a catchier name for it or what have you.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
S2100Matt says, I mean, metadata is important in media.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
It helps things get organized and be seen.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I get Apple's point, but then again,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Apple hasn't really updated their tagging system well.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Swongtong points out, that happened to me with Stitcher.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I couldn't listen for about a year until I found you again.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Totally thought you quit podcasting.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
See, that pissed me off when Stitcher did that.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
So, I mean, I think they got bought again.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
And so they're probably under somebody.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
But I'm sorry.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
If Stitcher would like to have Orange On Radio on their player,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
they can come ask for it.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
That's where I'm at.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
They're a who?

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Yeah, exactly. I know.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I know it's not going to happen.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I know damn well it's not going to happen.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
But I can, you know, I can sit here and go, you know what?

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
And I'm going to ask, will you update my feed in a timely manner this time?

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
And who, what direct person can I contact if it's out of whack?

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Anyway.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000
TigerCon chat says, even though there are options to stream,

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
the option to listen to podcast,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I'm very careful at how much data I use.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
So I download them on iTunes first

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
and then use software to sync them to my Android phone.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I'm curious, why aren't you using the Google store if you have an Android?

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Because they have podcasting as well.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
At least I thought they did.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Google Play has podcasting.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It's through the Play Music app.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
That's what I use.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Yeah, so anyway.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Yeah, obviously there's tons of, tons of podcasting apps at this point.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
So I don't think anyone can really dictate the standard anymore.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It is not the year 2005 or 2006.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Anymore.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Anyway.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Let's get to our last email tonight, which is from DJ Rama S.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Who says, hey everyone, Rama here.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I've been having this thought lately.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I've looked at my gaming and anime collections,

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
realizing that at times I'm buying these items more for the sake of having them,

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
as opposed to playing or watching these discs.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I look at, sorry, I just, I just thought of Loki suddenly.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I look at my collection and realize that I have not finished most of the series

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
or played through what I've collected.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
So what I'm asking is this.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Have you ever looked at your collection

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
and think that you're buying these games more for the sake of collecting them

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
because they'll become hard to find or not?

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Thanks for taking my email.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Now I'm off to rebuilding my website.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Hopefully it'll be up and fixed by the time y'all get this email.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Rama.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And good luck on the website relaunch there, Rama.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
So Loki, are you buying games just for the sake of buying them?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Um, no.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Sometimes I'll buy them because I'm like, oh, I want to play that.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And then I just move on to something else and don't end up playing it.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Like, um, or usually if it's on sale, like sometimes I'll pick up stuff.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Like I have Dragon Age Inquisition.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Still haven't touched that.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Um, I have Titanfall 2.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
A lot of EA games, actually.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And Need for Speed, those are all on deep sales

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000
and I purchased them and sold them and played them.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Wolfenstein, I have probably had such a huge library of games

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
both on the PlayStation Store and through Steam

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
that I have just not played most of them.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
And yet I'll still keep continuing to buy them

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
and sometimes not even on sale.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Like in the case of Kingdom Hearts 3, I just bought it

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
because I was like, oh, hey, that'd be fun to stream.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
And then I didn't play it.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
You know, I just like to have physical games.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Um, and maybe part of that is about collecting or so forth.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
But I always think in my mind, what if I want to sell it back someday?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I can't tell you the last time I sold a video game.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
But I can tell you the last time I loaned out video games.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
And so I know that's a big thing, too, is that, you know,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
a friend of mine will be like, oh, you're done with that?

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Like one of my friends borrowed Mass Effect recently

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
just to start playing through that, especially with

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
backwards compatible and Xbox One now and everything.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
So they've been playing that.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
So, um, I think that's kind of the biggest perk to having digital.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
But you're right, there's a lot of like,

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000
wow, wow, Rob, physical versus digital.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Um, but, um, yeah, I mean, digital is starting to look more and more,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
you know, especially when it's like on the case of Xbox.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Um, if I buy a digital, I can play it on my PC or my Xbox.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
You know, and I've talked about this before about the whole,

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
like, what's the, you know, value of the game?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
What's the equity about the disc you hold and so forth?

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
You know, if digital can offset that value,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
be it through a deep cut sale through.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:05.000
But if something is $60 to buy a digital or $60 to buy a physical,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
you know what, I'm going to buy a physical.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Because at least I have the option to loan it out, sell it back.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I have all of that. I don't have that when it's digital.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
True. Um, the way I look at it though,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
like especially when I'm looking at physical and digital,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
it's normally I'm just purchasing it.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I'm probably not going to end up selling it back because let's be honest,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
like if you sell something back, like way down the line,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
say when you trade in your system or something like that,

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
it's probably not worth anything anyways at that point.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Um, and you're really not getting much.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
It takes a space in the house.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Like for me, I'll decide, Oh, Hey, I want this game.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I'll download it, you know, or I'll purchase it digitally

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
and I'll set it to download on my system remotely and then come home and play it.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Maybe that's assuming actually play the game I purchased.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:56.000
But you know, same, same thought process there is I could do that.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Um, I, I purchase a lot of games digitally.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I purchased the Lego game digitally.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I mean, um, most of the games I have on the switch are digital.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I do have some physical games, but those it's, um,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
sales and getting stuff used usually.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Um, I don't know.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I walk into the store all the time,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
like GameStop when my kids are playing the demo kiosk,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
because God forbid they play the switch they have at home.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
They want to play the demo, whatever.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Um, so I'm actually looking at used games all the time.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Like I'm like, is there anything I want?

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
And I just kind of like, no, not really.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I'm not gonna, nothing really stands out like, Oh my God,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I need to pick this up.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Um, I don't know.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I, I just eventually someday when I retire, you know,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I'll have all these games I can play and then I'll be able to do that.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.000
She Hulk in chat says, uh, physical is going away for good someday.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
No, I don't know if it would be a hundred percent though.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I get what you're getting at.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I do think we may see like disc drives go away.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
We, we thought for a little bit,

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
some of the early rumors about the Xbox one is that there may be a

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000
version with no drive.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Uh, and that could be true, could be true emphasis on could be about

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
PlayStation five of the next Xbox.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000
But I do think if the system can handle physical media,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
there's still going to be that.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:15.000
And I think there will always be, even if it went a hundred percent digital

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000
GameStop or those types of stores would still have like,

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.000
here's this collectible plushie you can get for Pokemon gen eight.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And it comes with a digital code to get the game online so that there's

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:34.000
still like a physical something, something integrated with the digital.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I just bought, funny enough,

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.000
a brand new microphone for my studio computer because I did, uh,

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I did one of those package things. Like I did the overwatch,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.000
like I taped that in advance. I did one a couple of weeks ago. I did a, um,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I did one for a, what was the, I did Tetris 99 a couple of weeks ago.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
And I was like, God, my audio is fucking horrible on this.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I'm going to just get a new microphone. So I went and got a new microphone.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
And guess what? I got a Yeti microphone.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Guess what it came with? A $50 gift certificate to the Ubisoft store.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I was going to say,

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I thought it came with Assassin's Creed origins cause they had that originally.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Close. Okay. So like it's like 50,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
$50 off a $60 game on the Ubisoft store or whatever that is.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
So that's the kind of stuff I think you may still see in the future.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Is that really physical going away though?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
But maybe the way we think about what physical games are,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
that could maybe change in the future.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000
But, you know, Loki joked about it earlier in the show,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
but it's still very true, especially when it comes to a series like Pokemon.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.000
The merchandising, the physical shit, that is all still very important.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And I think as video games is more and more a part of our society,

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
that isn't just this underground thing that nerds play.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.000
As Fortnite has an aisle dedicated to it and Target and things like that,

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.000
there's always going to be some sort of physical manifestation of gaming

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000
in the world, even if it isn't in the future,

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
a disc that goes in the drive, if that makes sense.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
So, but good discussion.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
So great emails tonight. Thank you guys so much for the emails.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
We hope more of you will send emails.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Don't be shy. Send your emails for next week.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Participate at orangelandrater.com is the place to send those emails.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Let's move on and get to the next story that we have on deck. Loki.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:32.000
So GOG has quietly let go of a dozen of their staff, apparently, this last week here.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000
They didn't say why the layoffs happened,

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.000
but there was some financial issues that caused the layoff.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Basically, there is a rep that said that letting people go is never easy.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
We have been rearranging certain teams since October 2018,

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000
affecting in the closure of around a dozen positions last week.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.000
The same time since the process started, we have welcomed nearly twice as many new members

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
and currently hold 20 open positions.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
So it just sounds like restructuring right now.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Still not the best thing to hear about.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I feel like every week, literally every week since this year started,

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000
maybe two weeks into the year, we've had some story about layoffs.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:20.000
And they were saying that there was a staffer that had been, I think, let go,

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000
and they said that it was about 10% of the staff that was affected by layoffs.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:30.000
I don't know. Whatever. I mean, it's restructuring.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
So, I don't know. This isn't as big as a software company or something.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I mean, it's still a platform, people being let out.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Aren't they still kind of trying to come out and say,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.000
because of this increased competition with game makers getting a larger share of the profits,

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.000
which we all know the Epic Store came in and kind of took a swing at that whole thing.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Isn't that kind of all stuff they're trying to blame for why they're just going to have to scale back?

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Because they have to give more money to the game developers to be competitive.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Well, competition's hard, so that's going to be an issue that they have to do,

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
give people a larger cut of their profits.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I'm disappointed that GOG kind of left the retro stuff behind.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
I know it's still there.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Because everybody in chat is going to scream it out, I know.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
The retro stuff just isn't as lucrative. You don't make as much money.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
You're selling it for less money.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000
It doesn't mean I don't miss it and that there's so many things that I feel like are missing.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
But rights, et cetera, I get that I can't just have my dream list of games

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
and that that's going to suddenly happen on GOG.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000
But it is just a bummer that more of that couldn't have been fleshed out.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
But obviously, they had to get into the newer stuff to stay competitive.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Yeah.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000
And it's competitive, and so we're starting to see.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.000
But maybe the silver lining is that, OK, so unfortunately, GOG had to let 12 people go,

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.000
but maybe something like the Epic Store is going to have to hire 12 people because it's getting bigger.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Well, they just said they let go of 12 positions, but they are hiring for 20.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000
It's just that those positions, they're restructuring.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So 12 of the positions that they had, say they were customer service or something,

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
maybe they need 20 positions to fill in development of a new platform

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
or enhancements to their online platform or whatever.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Yeah, it's just needed in different parts.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
They can't just shuffle some of those people.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Maybe the skill sets didn't quite line up with what they needed for those other positions.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
So I don't know.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Sg100Matt in our chat says, well, PR-wise, GOG didn't do themselves any favors last year.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I'll just leave it at that.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000
You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but since you said it, I just didn't want to be tacky about,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
you know, maybe this was the PR department that had to.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:50.000
But since you said it, unfortunately, companies really need to watch it when it comes to their PR

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000
and who represents them because all that stuff can have a repercussion on the rest of the company

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000
and people that maybe had nothing to do, hardworking artists and programmers

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:08.000
and people that had nothing to do with those types of discussions on how to be edgy or cool or things like that.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:17.000
So PR companies really need to, and PR divisions and departments and so forth, really need to watch themselves.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000
And that's all I'm going to say about this week as well as last year.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So let's move on, shall we, to our next story, which has to do with a Konami 50th Anniversary Collection

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Arcade Classics rating that showed up.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Nothing's been officially announced by Konami, but the game was rated recently in Australia

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
and isn't that how a lot of these games seem to leak all the time?

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Yes, they leak with, usually like ratings boards and stuff showing like some sort of rating,

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
like either a PEGI rating or something like that.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Now, this has many people saying, ooh, Konami made things like Metal Gear and so that could,

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:05.000
well, hold up, if it's Konami Arcade Collection, I wouldn't get too crazy about what you're going to see in this.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:10.000
If you want an idea about what to see in this, look at the types of Konami games that have been released

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:15.000
on places like Xbox Live, Arcade, the game room.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Believe it or not, there was a lot of Konami stuff in that game room when that was still a thing.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
God, I miss that service.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
And, you know, Konami's kind of released stuff from their 80s catalog.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.000
If you need an idea what that looks like, I would, and again, we don't know what's in it,

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
but I'm just hypothesizing you might want to be thinking a little less Metal Gear Castlevania

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:40.000
and the things they're known for on console and maybe be thinking a little more about things like Scramble,

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Jungler, Frogger, maybe, although Frogger's a weird one because Sega actually released it.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
They'll throw in Frogger.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
They throw in Frogger all the fucking time.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Time Pilot.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
When no one wants it.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I love Time Pilot. I would love to see that.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Maybe Tutankham, I'd love that, but again, some of these were like co-pilot, like Stern was involved with that too.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Jairus, I love that game, so I'd be there for that.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Track and Field was an 80s arcade classic as well.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And then, you know, Yara Kung Fu was like an original fighting game classic.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.000
But there was Gradius in the arcade, so you never know.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Salamander in that whole series, you might see some of that.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Technically, there was a Castlevania game in the arcade, so we might get lucky and see Haunted Castle could show up.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:26.000
And I would say if you guys get really lucky, maybe stuff like Sunset Riders, you know, when you get into the later Konami years.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I doubt the Ninja Turtles game, because Konami did at least the second game, didn't they do the first one?

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Yeah, they did. They did the first and second Ninja Turtles arcade game.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
But then you get into licensing, da-pa-da-pa-da.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Simpsons arcade game never happened.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I don't know if that, yeah.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.000
So, I mean, those things only happened, like the Simpsons arcade game did come out as a download, as did the Ninja Turtles.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:51.000
But that was like through new partnerships, so like Ubisoft, EA, or whoever had the current rights at the time.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Those came out.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:58.000
So, I don't know. But also, you know what, maybe, if we're really lucky, here's the one I would be crossing my fingers and toes for,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
is that in 1992, they made the X-Men arcade game.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:07.000
So, again, license, it's com- if they could get all that worked out, I know I'd love to see that.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
So, we'll see.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Oh, DJ Rama S also chimed in chat with that. I swear I said it first.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
DJ Rama S also suggests Bucky O'Hare.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Let's see, some folks in chat.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Blades of Steel, Double Dribble.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Uh, Dartesia pointing out, technically, Castlevania was in the arcade, but the original game had its issues.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Uh, Sjoerdundermatt says Russian Attack, probably.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Yeah, you guys in chat, you guys are naming the, uh, the right stuff there.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000
YYR said Ninja Turtles, Simpsons, X-Men did all come out on Xbox Live Arcade, so it's not impossible.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.000
You're right, it's not impossible, but it may be a little trickier if it's in a collection,

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
or it's gonna be harder to make sure the rights holders-

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's less lucrative for them to re-license that, you know, to, it's not the first of the value add to it.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I just don't think that they would go that far to get some of this stuff in there.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Now, I guess it's worth asking, cause I do see it in chat, Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I wish, but no.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I wish, but I just, I don't, how would DDR work on the Switch anyway?

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Like, I guess you could do with arrows.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Beatmania could do the five key like you used to do on the Playstation if you downloaded the controller.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I would love it, don't get me wrong, but I just don't.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:21.000
It would be awesome if Konami would put them in as like secret things, or like Easter eggs,

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
but they're just, why would they? Why would they do that?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:30.000
This is, you know, but prove me wrong, Konami, I dare you, I would love that.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Moving on, uh, Loki, you got something for us, right?

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Yes, and so this is kind of a silly add to the game, but there's this game called Plague Inc.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:45.000
where you design your own, like, super viruses and watch them take over the world and stuff like that.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:54.000
So, now they have a scenario, thanks to fan demand, that involves anti-vaxxers.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:01.000
And so, apparently they had a petition out there that says if this petition gets 10,000,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000
we will add a specific new anti-vaxxer scenario into Plague Inc.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And of course, over 20,000 people signed it, so they are going to be doing that.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
So, that's kind of funny.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Dude, is there actually anybody anti-vaxxer still left?

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I feel like it's one of those things that everybody jokes and makes jokes about and so forth,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000
but like, nobody actually confesses to actually being an anti-vaxxer anymore.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I think that there still are.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Ugh, get with it, people.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Well, I guess, okay, yeah, as I'm saying this aloud, and I'm sure before you all scream at me in chat,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
and I'm going to, believe me, I am on the side of kids ought to be vaccinated,

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.000
and I work for a company that says that and puts that out there as well.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
It's stupid not to be vaccinated.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
And I'm thinking about, there's the whole measles thing that just happened in Washington, so you're right.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
There are still morons out there that are...

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
It's just the problem...

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000
It's Facebook's fault. It is all Facebook's fault.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Nobody would have heard what Jenny McCarthy had to say if they hadn't shared it on Facebook.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Facebook should have shut that down when they had the chance, but free speech.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
So, anyway.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I liked Jenny McCarthy when she was set dressing, but, you know, now she has opinions.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Alright, well, everybody in chat, I knew that happened, everybody in chat, there's many anti-vaxxers.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I know people that are anti-vaxxers.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:22.000
But hey, you know what, though, to balance the universe out with all this pro-vaccination stuff,

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.000
we're going to give Goop a new Netflix series, so that's a thing.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Alright, anyway, vaccinate your fucking kids.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I work with medical professionals, and they all agree.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Vaccinate your fucking kids.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
And yourself, honestly.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Alright, anyway.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Moving on. Something a little more lighthearted.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Yes, so this is kind of cool.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I remember actually getting this within a box of cereal, but...

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:56.000
You may remember a while back, especially if you were a kid in the 90s, that there was, you know, a game called Doom,

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:03.000
and then there was a famous mod, or total conversion of Doom, that was free with a box of Chex cereal.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000
And that game was called Chex Quest.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And Chex Quest was a kid-friendly, non-violent Doom total conversion that you could play,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
and it came with your box of cereal.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Well, guess what? It's getting an HD remake.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Why?

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Because it's fun.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So, Chex Quest HD is apparently a passion project of a guy named Chuck Jacoby.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Nobody's getting paid for it.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:37.000
And him and volunteers have created, with permission from General Mills, so it is endorsed,

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
that they have fully committed to...

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Somebody at General Mills was like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Alright, sure, free advertising for Chex, sure, why not?

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Yeah, so they're remaking the whole game, including the five-level single-player shooter.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.000
So, neat that it's a thing that's gonna be coming out.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.000
When is somebody gonna remake Sneak King and all these other great advertisement games?

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I want that shit re-released, because that was fucking brilliant.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000
And they promised more, they were supposed to be making more games, but it hasn't happened yet.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
I need more.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I need more.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
But, if you would like to follow the progress of Chex Quest HD,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
they don't really have an official page aside from their Facebook group,

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
so facebook.com slash chexquesthd.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000
You can go follow the progress of Chex Quest HD.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
When's Chex Mix Quest HD, because I prefer Chex Mix.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000
I wanna see a version of Chex Quest built into the new Doom game.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.000
The frenetic action that is of the modern Doom.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Oh man, I love it.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
It's gonna be awesome.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Alright, and one more story for you guys tonight about a website where you can go on adventures.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:59.000
It's a site called Noclip, and it's at the URL noclip.website.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Not a .com or a .website.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Because, you know, they expanded the .domains layer.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:11.000
So there's noclip.website, which has levels stripped out of existing Nintendo games.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Things like Ocarina of Time, Luigi's Mansion, Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
And what do you do?

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
You just go flying around looking wherever the hell you want.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It's just an exploration.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
That's why it's noclipping, because you can go through walls.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
You can fly anywhere.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.000
So you can explore worlds beyond maybe what the original games would let you explore.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
And I know some of you eat that stuff up.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Jamie loves this stuff.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
She has a whole Mass Effect.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I wish she was here tonight, because she has that whole Mass Effect Tumblr that was dedicated to finding stuff hidden in the Mass Effect games through mods like this that would let you clip through Mass Effect.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000
So people like to do this stuff, you know, breaking down the Nintendo files and all that stuff.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I mess around with some of the Mario Kart maps.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
It was pretty neat.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Did you?

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Yeah.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000
And I noticed there's like gifs and little videos where you can go through fast.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Yeah, it's pretty fast.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
You do a Mario Kart course and you have zero speed.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I did try. They have a few experimental things in there.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
So they have some non-Nintendo games.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
They also have Super Mario Odyssey.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Although that really wasn't loading fast, so I didn't do that.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000
But the Mario Kart maps.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:24.000
And I did Super Paper Mario, which isn't too exciting to look at, because to me it's Paper Mario.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
But it was neat.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.000
All right, and some folks in chat, of course, that got linked in chat, thank you, from Matt.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
And some folks are saying, fantastic chats.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Holy crap, this Noclip website is dope.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Yeah, one of those things that's kind of fun to explore, especially because I know a lot of y'all have a soft spot for Nintendo games.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
And this is just really cool that it kind of just lets you explore them in a different way.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
So it's like, what was behind that house?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
What was in that place?

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
What was on top of the hill that I couldn't get to?

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
This website kind of lets you do that.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000
So pretty cool.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
I like that type of exploration stuff.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I wish I'd had the time tonight.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I was going to throw together some B-roll, but with all the changes we had to do last minute, I ran out of time.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
So you'll just have to go adventure and look at it yourself over at the Noclip.website.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.000
So vidpower573 in chat says, I see myself spending hours on this website.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I understand.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
I understand the struggle, that's for sure.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Anyway, now is the part of the show where we're going to go to the listener roundtable where you can participate,

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.000
ask us a question in the chat room, or if you'd like to head on over to Discord in our green room,

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000
you can actually call into the show as well.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I did want to, I promised last week that we would incorporate tweets back into the show in this segment as well.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000
So I wanted to go over to twitter.com slash o-l-r and actually look at some of the tweets that came in this week,

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
because there were a few of you that tweeted.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:49.000
And I do want to say very nice words to people like Spyro557 who wrote a tweet that was like,

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
everybody should listen to Bobby and OLR tonight at 8 o'clock Eastern.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:58.000
I just want to give you a gold star listener recognition there,

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:04.000
because we say at the end of the show, help us spread the word and get your friends to listen,

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
and Spyro definitely did that with the tweet this week, so thank you so much for that.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:14.000
But we did get a tweet from M. Colburn on Twitter who was answering the guilty pleasure question.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
A lot of you guys liked that question.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:23.000
So M. Colburn tweeted us saying, my guilty pleasure crap game was Winx Club on the DS,

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.000
which Shane, that's one of his too, because I don't know if that was the one he worked on.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
He was.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:34.000
It was one of those Winx games, and Flocko I think to some extent also considers that a guilty pleasure game.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:42.000
So sometimes those games that are like silly things for kids, like sometimes people get into them.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I guess one guilty pleasure game that I played, but only because it was so bad, was Driver 3.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Oh yeah.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Drive 3.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.000
I was just thinking one I didn't mention last week, Spice World on PlayStation.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Let's put another girl through her paces.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Yeah, that doesn't really have the same connotation as...

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I know, I know. I loved the Spice World game that was so stupid, but I loved it.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Anyway, do we have any last minute stories, Loki, before I get...

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
If you guys have any questions in chat, you can feel free to ask them.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000
I don't know, did you see the new trailer for Detective Pikachu? That looked pretty awesome.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Oh, I did. It did look awesome, you're right.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Yeah, so I want to definitely check that out still even more so than before.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:36.000
There's a rumor that Sony is offering refunds on Anthem, no questions asked, so that may be a thing.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
You're looking to get a refund.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Is that an exploit though?

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I don't know.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Alright, well let's get to a Discord chat, because we do get folks that want to talk to us on Discord,

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
so I want to get to the first of those calls tonight.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Hello, it's Delvin from Video Game Realness.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:59.000
It is so good to hear from you, my streaming buddy Delvin. How are you doing tonight?

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Good, I'm of course a long time listener, but first time caller.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Is this really your first time on the show?

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
First time calling, yes.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Wow, well, you know why I'm confused? Because you were here.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Yes, I was on the show, but this is my first time calling into the show.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Okay, I will accept that. To what do we owe this call tonight? What's on your mind?

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Well, I wanted to talk about something that happened with one of my friends,

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:30.000
and then it made me get into thinking about online, on consoles, and paying.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:36.000
So basically, he wanted to try Anthem, because there's all the hubbub about Anthem,

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:42.000
so he rented the game. So he rented the game from, I can't remember what service,

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:48.000
and got it home, but he doesn't have PS Online, so he couldn't play the game.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:53.000
So in order to play the game, you had to play at least one month minimum to play this game,

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:58.000
which there's no way to play the game unless you have online.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.000
I didn't even think about that. You're right, a game like Anthem is always online,

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.000
there's really nothing to do single player. Well, I thought you kind of,

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000
I remember in the demo that I played of Anthem, you kind of could do a single player,

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.000
but it was like, are you sure? Are you sure? You sure you don't want to play with other people?

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:18.000
But then now that I think about it, it's still like putting your progress in the cloud,

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:25.000
and you're still online whether you're playing with other people or not. So, interesting. Huh.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Correct. So he could not play at all unless he had paid for online.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:34.000
So it got me thinking, you know, when Xbox Live came out,

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:41.000
it was a luxury to play online with your friends, to play Halo online with your friends and other games.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:47.000
But now in 2019, where many more games require online,

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Overwatch, Fortnite, Apex, now Anthem,

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:59.000
is it valid for consoles to still charge you for online gaming

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:05.000
when now the games require it as a basic necessity to even play the game?

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Well, obviously, I was wondering what your guys' opinion was on that.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:14.000
The easy answer is no. Especially when you consider PC, right?

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:18.000
You don't have to pay to play online on PC. Correct. You're able to do that there.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000
So the easy answer is no. But the reality, Delvin, is that people are still paying for it.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000
So as long as people are paying for it, they're going to keep charging for it.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:34.000
But this is going to put Microsoft in a very interesting position in the very new future.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.000
And this is what I've been saying, Delvin, on the show for like the past two years.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
One of my E3 predictions has always been,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Microsoft's going to announce that they no longer are going to charge for multiplayer online

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:49.000
because why are they doing it when they release the same games on PC

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
and you don't have to pay for online?

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Instead, the Xbox Live Gold monthly thing is going to turn into

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.000
this Game Pass thing that they've been wanting to sell you anyway.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Like, why don't they just bait and switch Xbox Live Gold

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000
with the Netflix thing they want you to have anyway?

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Because the Netflix thing, they charge more for it,

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
and so I don't think that they're going to want to get both of that.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
They're just going to get money wherever they can.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I just don't think in the long run, especially when they, you know,

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000
when they start to blur the line between PC and console more and more,

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000
I'm not sure that strategy is going to sustain itself.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000
So they're milking it while they still can.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.000
But I would, you know, I'm going to again foolishly predict,

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000
as I have for the past couple years, within the next few years,

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Microsoft's going to be the one to drop it first and everyone will cheer,

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
and then it's going to peer pressure Sony into doing the same thing.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Nintendo will cling to it, because they were late to the party,

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
and they're going to say, Nintendo Online,

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
all these other things that they do.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
That is my crazy ass.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
If Michael Patrick can make predictions, so can I.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Do you guys not like your free Nintendo games each month?

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
I mean, all right.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.000
My thing is that I think it should, like, as you mentioned,

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000
you can have the premium service and get the free games.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:13.000
That's fine, but I think for basic online, playing with your friends,

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.000
or even just being able to play Fortnite, Apex, Anthem,

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:23.000
these games that require online, you cannot play the game unless you have online.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.000
That should not be charged for anymore going forward.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Now, let me give you another perspective here,

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000
because YYR in our chat is, you know, who has made games

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
and done things for things like Steam,

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
is giving us another perspective here I think is important to weigh.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000
So YYR in chat says, once again, I'll make this case,

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
because I believe we've had a similar discussion before,

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.000
but probably every time I make my dumb prediction.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
The platform owners offer functionality to developers,

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.000
including matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements, et cetera,

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000
as well as run all of the servers to back that up,

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
and it costs the developers nothing.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Someone has to pay for it, and they ask the gamers to do that.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.000
This strategy back in the OG Xbox in early 360 days

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000
led to most games having multiplayer features

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000
that otherwise would not have had them.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
So that's an excellent perspective, YYR,

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:13.000
and I don't want to discount that perspective.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:18.000
However, the reality is, what rules the talk of the gaming world?

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Perception. Perception is going to rule everything.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:25.000
And the issue is, is that the perception is,

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.000
on PC I get to play it for free because EA is absorbing all that content.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000
You get to play it for free, but you have to do it through Origin,

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.000
because EA has eaten that cost to get you to use Origin, right?

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:40.000
But the perception is, it's free, but it's not free the other places.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.000
So I definitely don't want to invalidate your point or say it's not valid.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000
It is, but I still think that perception,

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.000
and I think there is, you say the gamers are eating the cost.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:57.000
I still think there's a possibility Microsoft may be willing to eat that cost

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:04.000
to try to win people into its PC and all-in-one kind of ecosystem.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000
They may be willing to take that risk.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.000
What do you think about the comments I just read from YYR, Delvin?

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.000
I think that it made sense before.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.000
I just think going forward now, the way that the infrastructure is there,

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000
it's been built, once upon a time it didn't exist,

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
so yes, we had the gamers pay for it,

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
but now the infrastructure is there.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Let's be real, this does not cost Microsoft or Sony

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000
a large amount of money to run servers for online.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000
It doesn't in the grand scheme of things.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000
So I think the infrastructure is there now.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
They don't need to continue charging for it.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Just charge for your premium service, your game streaming, your free games.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000
I think that's the best thing going forward.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I just thought of something too that is going to bring this issue to a head

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:56.000
maybe sooner rather than later, and that is those rumors,

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.000
big neon sign rumors, the best Fleetwood Mac album rumors

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.000
that came up last week on the show about this fact that

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Nintendo and Microsoft may very soon have a

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.000
we're getting in bed together type of arrangement.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
So how's that going to work?

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.000
If I have a game like, let's say, what were the games that were rumored?

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Ori and the Blind Forest was one. Well, that's mostly single player.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
What else did they rumor for the Switch?

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Cuphead, right? Which I guess has two player mode.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000
But I mean, let's say that Microsoft puts one of their more multiplayer games

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
on the Nintendo Switch. How's that going to work?

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Am I going to need a Nintendo system?

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Am I going to need a Microsoft system?

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Here's how it works with PC.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
When you're playing cross platform for Forza Horizon or something like that,

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.000
I don't need to pay for gold in order to play online

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
because I'm on PC.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Whereas if someone has an Xbox, they have to play for gold

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
in order to get online.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.000
So wouldn't it be weird that if I play Forza or whatever,

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
and again, this is all rumor anyway,

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000
so this may just be a whole bunch of smoke and mirrors,

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
and that's fine too, but to think this through a little further,

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
what's going to happen if that ends up being the case?

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000
That these Microsoft games are playable on Nintendo's console,

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
so they will let you play for free?

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Again, I think that adds to the list of why Microsoft is,

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
sooner rather than later, just going to eat the cost of gold.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.000
I don't know. We'll see. I don't know.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000
VG Realness, I think it's an excellent question,

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000
and I think it's a thing to watch at this E3 for sure,

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000
but again, obviously as the consumer, I want to sit here and say,

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000
no, they should get rid of it, but the reality is,

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000
but will they when people are still paying for it,

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.000
but as the industry is changing in front of our eyes,

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
as we're moving from physical to digital,

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
is this going to be reevaluated too?

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
And I think it will be. I think this whole online system

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.000
and who's paying for it and all that will be reevaluated. We'll see.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Let's hope so.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Well, thank you so much for the call. It's so good to hear from you.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000
All right. Bye.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Hey, wait. Plug your Twitch real fast. Plug your Twitch.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Oh, come follow me at twitch.tv slash VG Realness.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Excellent. Thank you. I will.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
All right. Bye.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
All right. Let's get to another call here.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
We have a few people waiting. I want to try to get to everybody.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Let's get to this next call here.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Hey, what's up, guys? This is Kaijuto.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Great to hear from you, Kaijuto. What's on your mind tonight?

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I just want to recommend some VR games for you because I know you said

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000
earlier you wanted some games that would like work you out like Beat Saber.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Yes, please. I would love to hear it.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Number one game you got to get and I hope it's still on the market because

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000
the company that made it, they went under.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
So they're no longer like updating the game. Well, I think they're fixing bugs.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
But, you know, like they're not responsible for doing any more with the games.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Hopefully it's still there. But that's Spark.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.000
That's the main one you have to get. That's like it's like a combination of everything.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000
It's like tennis, fencing, boxing.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I remember you. You've talked about this before.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000
You're a fan. I know. I remember this one.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.000
And it will it will work you out. And it's not you know, it's not like the

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000
what was the running game that you were playing where you just like constantly

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
swinging your arms and you have to run around the map like you're just standing

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000
in one spot. But the workout that it gives you is like your arms and everything.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
You swing in, you're dodging the ball, all that stuff.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
But you're basically standing in one spot, which I think is like ideal for like

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000
a lot of VR sports games. You know, I really don't like the games where you're

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
like kind of like trying to traverse a map because that gets really confusing.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:25.000
So, yeah, definitely get that one. Then there's the Creed boxing game,

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.000
which is another game where you're kind of like standing there boxing a guy.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.000
And then there's another boxing game. And then there's Rec Room,

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.000
which is a free game that you can download. And that's like that's a community

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.000
thing where you're like, you know, you're playing laser tag with people.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.000
There's a dodgeball game that really doesn't work that well.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.000
And there's other activities that you have like a battle royale game in there as well.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Rec Room is a is a PC game, though, right? Not PlayStation.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:53.000
No, it's PlayStation. Oh, it is. Yeah, it's free.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Yes, of course. So, well, should be playing with.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Yeah. All right. That's one of the great things about VR is that there's a lot of

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.000
cross platform play in a lot of the VR games.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:07.000
So you're always playing with somebody on Rift or now you got the Oculus Go.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Does everybody playing together? So definitely check those out.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:13.000
That's all I want to do is recommend those games. Hey, I love it.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I love the recommendations, you know, and somebody there was another game that was

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.000
recommended to me by Bobby that I looked at on the store.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
I just didn't get around to it. It's not really an exercise game,

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:23.000
but it was basically F-Zero and in VR, something like Radial G or something.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I don't remember the name. You know, Wipeout. Have you done Wipeout?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:31.000
I can't find my disk for Wipeout. I think I loaned it out.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Oh, so there's the downside of your physical games, by the way.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And I will I will let you digital people have your field day.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
There is your downside. I loaned it out.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000
I can't remember who I loaned it out to and now I can't play the fucking game in VR.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.000
But yes, Wipeout is certainly there, too.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Yeah, we buy it. It's cheap, man. Super cheap.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I know. It's true. It's true. All right.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Well, thanks for the recommendations, my friend. I'm going to look into it.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:56.000
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
All right. Let's get to at least one more call here.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:02.000
If you want to call into the show, though, join our green room over on Discord,

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000
vognetwork.com slash Discord. But we do have at least one more call tonight.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Hi, you are on orange on radio. Who's this?

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Hey, this is Deft.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Hey, Deft. It's great to hear from you. What's on your mind?

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Well, let's talk about the beta.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Let's.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
You first.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Okay.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Well, basically, one of the things the beta did right,

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:32.000
it was a really great PlayStation classic without being the PlayStation classic.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000
The first of all.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:43.000
And really, like it wasn't like really that expensive to to get most of the games you wanted.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:47.000
And it's like really, really easy to play.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:52.000
And even on the PlayStation TV, because you could do that, too.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:32:01.000
And probably not not as cheap or probably not as bad as the PlayStation classic was.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000
The PlayStation.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:15.000
That's one of the things I really, really I'm baffled that Sony like really did good in this or did well on that on the beta and pretty much screwed up on the PlayStation classic.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:22.000
I will say the PlayStation Vita was an excellent example of Sony knowing how to do backwards compatibility.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:29.000
The PSP stuff worked very well, especially considering that, you know, the Vita didn't have a disk drive, so you couldn't just like actually physically put in the disk.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
But it supported stuff that you had on the marketplace.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:35.000
They opened up the PSP catalog to be able to rebuy things.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
And it worked out very well.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000
The Vita was great in that regard for the compatibility.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:44.000
And then, of course, as you say, the PS1 games and being able to experience all that all over again.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000
That was great.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
And yeah, it was definitely a strong point for the Vita.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:52.000
And I think the reason why a lot of people are going, but why not PlayStation 4?

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
But, you know, that's that's a whole nother dialogue.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:05.000
And even then, it had the remote play on PlayStation 4 and you could actually use it as a controller, as you mentioned earlier in the show.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:09.000
So it really was a really great system.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Don't know why Sony didn't like focus or marketed that like really well, because I remember them mentioned it, but it was like, oh, it can do this and nothing more.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:28.000
They really needed to market the Vita more because it was a really, really great console.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Agreed.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:39.000
And I wonder if in five years we won't get an interesting post-mortem on the Vita and maybe get some insider info as to what really happened on the insider.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:46.000
I don't know. Maybe it'll forever be a secret because, you know, this is a very large company with very strong contracts and things of that sort.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
So we may never really, truly know the answer.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:54.000
But these things have a way of coming out as people move on to other jobs and get asked about them in interviews and so forth.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000
You know, we're getting all the dirt on the Atari and television days now.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Those guys go to the different conferences and, you know, some of them are very open about the drug use that was around back then and things that you didn't hear about in the 80s.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
So it'll be interesting to see, like, what really happened with the Vita.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Maybe we'll find out in a few years.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Maybe it'll be 30 years. Who knows?

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Yeah, those articles were really, really interesting.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:30.000
But even though the Vita was a really great system and it did a lot of things right, it did things wrong and really, really wrong.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.000
And one of them was the memory storage because that was, like, awful.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:46.000
I don't know why Sony tried again to do a proprietary storage system or capacity.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:51.000
And especially because it was, like, really, really expensive.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:35:05.000
64 gigabytes was $100 and you had to import it from Japan because the most you could find on the US or in America was only 32 gigabytes and it wasn't enough.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Yeah, and I think, you know, that was similar to a point that came up earlier is that Sony's insistence to kind of keep things, everything in the Sony bubble of all these things that Sony produces.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.000
I don't know if that really did them favors in the long run.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
I think it might have hurt them and I think the storage is an excellent issue.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
I think the storage really highlights that.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:30.000
A lot of people kind of said that was kind of BS and it may have had better luck if it would have adopted, excuse me, a more lenient standard.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It was very overpriced.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:38.000
We just had a little thing on the scroll bar that, you know, on the Twitch stream, the little headlines from various sites around the internet that scroll by.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I just caught one a little while ago.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.000
It said something about 128 gigabyte card or something for, like, 20 bucks.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Like, that's, you know, for something you can use on Switch.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:51.000
So, I mean, there's, that memory's coming down cheap in price, but those...

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Not the Vita cards.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
The Vita cards never budged, ever.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
And they won't get any cheaper because of this.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
They will probably get way more expensive.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Like, wow, it's gonna be, like, really crazy.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:14.000
But another thing that I was really bothered by the Vita, it was the fact that you can only have, like, one account per memory card.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:24.000
So, yeah, that's another thing that really, really bothered me because, at least in my experience, I have Taiko no Tatsujin for the Vita.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:30.000
And you can only get the DLC if you have a Japan account.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:36.000
So, obviously, my main account is for Mexico, and I had to actually, like...

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
It's a really, really long process.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:43.000
You have to delete your profile on the Vita.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.000
You have to remove the memory card and then do the setup again.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Again, it's a really long process just to make a profile change.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:00.000
And instead of, like, having multiple accounts, since it's, like, yeah, it's gonna be a personal console.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:08.000
It's affordable, but still, it's not like you cannot have multiple accounts on a system like that.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
It was really baffling.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Yeah.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:16.000
And I wonder if that's similar to the whole fact that, like, you weren't able to change your name on PlayStation Network for the longest time.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.000
And even still, I don't think... That still is not rolled out, has it? The name change thing.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.000
No.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000
No, we're still waiting. We know it's going to happen now at this point. It's just a matter of when.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:28.000
So, it just seems like maybe some archaic things held it back.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Trying to wrap things up on a positive note here, Act F, what was your favorite Vita game and why?

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
What was my favorite Vita game?

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I really cannot say of at least one game. There were so many. There was the Sly Cooper collection.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000
There was Taekunotatsujin. There were the Project D.Va games.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.000
There were other games like Tearaway, Gravity Rush.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:38:02.000
It really had so many great games, and that's the thing that really bothers me with how the Vita was handled, at least in America.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Because it really had a lot of potential, and Sony just killed it. Sony themselves could kill the Vita.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:15.000
At least some of those must-have games did kind of get a second life somewhere else.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Like, things like Gravity Rush did end up on PlayStation 4 eventually, so at least we got that.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:29.000
But, hey, I get it. You're right. It's one of those things where if only Sony had maybe put a little more effort into, and money,

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:35.000
into trying to get the message across about what all the Vita could do, maybe it would have had better luck.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:38.000
But we'll never know now because it's dead and gone.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Maybe it can have a second chance like the Dreamcast had back in the day. Maybe.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Maybe. Why not? The Dreamcast was ahead of its time. Heck, I've been playing Phantasy Star online probably more than any other game this week.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I'm still hoping for a Dreamcast Classic Mini at some point.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Yeah, you never know.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.000
I'll jump in on that.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Anything's possible. Alright, ActDeaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up. Thanks so much for the call, as always.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Thanks. Take care. Alright, that was it for the callers we had on Discord.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:13.000
I will see if we have any quick questions in chat. Most people reacting to the Vita, talking a little bit about that.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
But quickly, do we have any last-minute stories we want to get to?

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:16.000
No.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000
No? Nothing?

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Nothing.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Alright. Anything you're gonna try to get done with gaming this week, or your programming stuff?

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.000
I'm just working on stuff. That's all.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Alright.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I don't know what's gonna come out of it, but I know last week was really busy, and this week's probably still gonna be busy.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.000
I always feel guilty for not playing games, but at the same time, if I'm playing games and I'm not programming,

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:44.000
and if I'm not programming, then I'm not putting out a game, and then people are still gonna complain that I don't have a game done yet.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.000
So, you can't win either way.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:54.000
So, for my week this upcoming week, and if you have any questions, get them out in chat before I wrap up here.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.000
For my week this week, I am going to Las Vegas for a few days this week, actually.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Not with Alan Gasp, but one of my gal pals, Melody, is taking me.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:10.000
She bought me tickets to see Gwen Stefani at the residency there for my birthday, which was back in June,

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
but obviously they announced those residencies way in advance.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:17.000
So, I will be in Vegas for a few days, and I'm hoping maybe to check out a few arcades,

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:22.000
and finally, I keep meaning to go by there every time I'm in Vegas, but I know Melody's into this stuff, too,

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.000
so we might finally get over and check out that pinball museum that they have there.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Yes, I saw the pinball museum in Jack Black's Jablinski Games video.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.000
He went there in Vegas and it looked pretty cool, so they've got some cool stuff there.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.000
But, yeah.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Shehulk is asking, has Loki seen FP2, Beats of Rage?

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
I have not yet.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000
I haven't either.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I haven't seen FP1, to be honest.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I have the disc for it somewhere, but I haven't watched it yet.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
But I should watch the second one, too.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Alright.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:58.000
I think it's on Netflix, or one of them was on Netflix at one time.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
The first one, I think.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
But, yeah. I just haven't gotten around to it.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
The other thing I'm really excited for in Vegas?

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
The food.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Because, you know, Vegas has some good restaurants.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000
So, guess where we have a reservation over the weekend?

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000
We're going to go to the Hell's Kitchen restaurant.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Because they built, like, a mock, like, the TV show.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Oh, that's cool.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
They built, like, an actual restaurant at Caesar's Palace,

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
and you have to get reservations a few weeks out and all that stuff,

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000
so we're actually going there.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
But do they, you know, do, like, show stuff there?

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
No, it's not like the actual TV show,

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
but my understanding is they do have a kitchen with a blue team and a red team.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Risotto's on the menu.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.000
But is it cooked, like, shitty?

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Hopefully not.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.000
I don't know if they put on a show where you watch the chefs get screamed at or whatever,

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
but I'm really excited to try that.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Because I saw the building when I was there in November,

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
because I went to Final Fantasy Fan Fest, and I saw the building,

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.000
and it's got the big flaming thing, you know, everything that you see on the TV show.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Oh, that's awesome.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Because I think it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant,

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
because he has several of those places in Vegas.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
And so that's, you know, no different.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.000
So I think that'll be a lot of fun.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:01.000
I'm excited. I love the food.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Pixel Pacas in chat says you've got to hit a buffet.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Well, that would be something I wouldn't mind doing.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.000
We'll see how that goes.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
That all just depends.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.000
So anyway, Loki, you need to entertain the listeners for a bit

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
while I figure out what's going on here.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Yes. So, yeah, this week I'm probably just going to be programming.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Remember, I'm going to try to program, maybe.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.000
I've been trying to find out, like, I started one project,

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:28.000
which I guess I could talk about it a little bit.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:33.000
So I started a project which I'm probably not going to end up working on anymore,

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.000
but it was originally like a terminal emulator type thing,

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
but, I mean, it looked like a terminal,

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.000
but it was going to be kind of like a text adventure game type of thing

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.000
that was mocked up like a VoG network bulletin board system,

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:51.000
but I ended up not doing that because it was,

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:54.000
what I was using was limited to what I could do,

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
and I wanted to get it done quickly,

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:59.000
and this is not something that would be done quickly,

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:04.000
and I, like everything else I do, overscope the crap out of it.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:07.000
So I decided that I am just not going to do that,

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:08.000
not going to work on it,

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
not going to work on something that I can get done quicker,

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.000
although the project I'm working on now is not really going to get done any quicker either.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:19.000
It's going to take even longer, but it's more entertaining, I should say.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.000
So I decided to go that route instead, but who knows where I'll end up.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.000
I'll probably start several different projects and not finish anything as usual.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Okay, wow, a lot just happened there.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.000
So that was, somebody was at our door, right?

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
So I had to go, like, nobody ever rings the door on a Sunday night.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.000
It was Uber Eats, and they did have this address,

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
so if you wanted Burger King, I guess I could have grabbed it,

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
because somebody went to the, here's the scary part,

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
because I had the door open for it, Mr. Smoosh ran outside.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.000
So that's the first time that's happened.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
So yeah, very scary.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
He started to go in the little plant over here, I'm like, no, no, no, no,

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.000
and I was able to pick him up in time, thankfully, but that's scary.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
So he went on an adventure today.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Anyway, hopefully she's able to call and get the right address,

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:06.000
because I was like, can't you call whoever put it in and get the right place?

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
I guess I could have just taken the food, huh?

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:10.000
No.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
But that's not nice, that's not the right thing to do.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Yeah, yikes, very true.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Smoosh saves, stay inside Smoosh, luckily Alan was behind me and heard it happening,

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
and I was like, oh shit.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
So anyway, that was scary.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Anyway, I guess we will wrap up then.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Now that I've had a heart attack, we can wrap up the show.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
All right, so as we say at the end of every show,

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000
thank you guys so much for downloading our show, checking out the show.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.000
We appreciate you guys being here every week.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:39.000
All we ask, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word,

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.000
but we can only put those voices out there if they're here.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
So thank you guys so much for all the kind tweets.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.000
I will say here on Twitch TV, putting us on your hosting list,

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.000
your auto-host list, that helps tremendously as well.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
We would really appreciate those,

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:58.000
and of course we always appreciate all the bits and subscribers.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.000
I'll read some of those after the show is all done tonight here at VOG Network,

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.000
so stay tuned after the credits live on Twitch.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Otherwise, I think we can wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.000
My final thought, like I mentioned, I'll try to work on programming

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
and maybe play a game.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Me stream, I may do some streaming too if I ever get some time.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Yeah, my final thought is if I am able to do it before I leave for Vegas,

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000
I want to freaking do a stream of Super Mario Brothers U already on Switch,

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:29.000
which I keep saving to stream.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000
I haven't opened the damn thing in like two or three weeks,

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.000
because I keep meaning to stream it,

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
but I keep getting pulled into Phantasy Star online.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
But can I really complain?

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Because playing video games like it's 2000 all over again

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.000
is still an awful lot of fun.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
So, I think that is going to do it for now.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Oh!

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Oh, no.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Everything's broken tonight.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I'm going to wrap up the show.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
We're done. We're out of here before something else breaks.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Have a safe week, everybody.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
We'll see you here next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.000
