00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This week, EverQuest turned 20, and it may not be old enough to drink in the US, but if you played it, you are!

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
If that doesn't drive you to drink, in celebration and moderation, then join us for the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show, where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 769 for this March 24th of 2019.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you with my co-hosts in studio DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hi, how are you?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hungry, for once.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yes, I know.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm hungry now.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
So, unlike the show, what was it, like three weeks ago, when Mr. Smoosh actually got out? I think that was, you weren't here for that, it was like your last show, not here.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
So, unlike that show, when somebody showed up with food delivery unintentionally, you're planning to make food delivery show up intentionally tonight?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Absolutely, on purpose-ly.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
How do you like those services? I've never used them, am I weird?

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
I've only used this once, and I had it delivered while I was doing my hair, getting my hair done, so it was actually really convenient.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Goat curry, yum!

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
That's interesting to get it delivered places. Yeah, I guess, okay.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I am so getting goat curry.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Interesting, you've had it delivered everywhere but your house. Okay, cool.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Pretty much.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Anyway, also joining us, of course, here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Hello.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm fine.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I like your Pokémon themed shirt, it's very cute.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Yes, it's one of my new shirts that I have, can't really see it, I guess. Here, I'll stand up.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
Because now that we are on Twitch TV, because we do tape live at twitch.tv slash vlog network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
And since we are on Twitch, we have to make more like wardrobe choices and style, like I can't come out here in my PJs. Well, I guess I can.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
I was gonna wear, I had worn it on stream the other day, I think, maybe I did, I don't remember.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh, when you were doing your DDR, like-

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
I had a Thomas the Tank shirt, it's a tank, you know, it's hilarious.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I like that.

02:15.000 --> 02:24.000
So I had that and then I have a few other Nintendo shirts, but this is what I went with today because I was playing Pokémon Go.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Well, we'll come back to that because I think there was quite a bit of Pokémon Go going on this weekend and probably next weekend too.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
But we talk about a lot of video games, not just Pokémon Go, but it's, you got to admit that one's pretty convenient because it's on the mobile game.

02:37.000 --> 02:46.000
But we're going to talk a lot about games tonight with you guys in our chatroom, of course, over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where Fifth Dream Today says about the food delivery stuff saying,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I get them delivered to hotels, very convenient.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
I need to think, you know what, because I was just in Vegas a couple weeks ago and we got probably like seven different pizza places slipping the like flyer under the door.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
And I'm like, I did not come to Las Vegas to order cardboard pizza, okay?

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
I came to Las Vegas to eat because there's a lot of good restaurants there.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Food delivery, I didn't think about that one.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I'm going with Lamb Korma.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
You know what we were, I guess I can say this now because we're not at that hotel anymore, but do you know what we were right across the street from when we were in Vegas, our hotel?

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
This giant new, and I've not seen anything like it here in California, but this gigantic MedMen store, you know what they sell?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Huh?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Marijuana.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yum.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
It was a gigantic, like it looked like a fricking like Bel Air, Raley's, like Safeway, like shopping thing.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
But it was all marijuana because I guess I didn't even realize Nevada made it legal, like we did in California.

03:41.000 --> 03:51.000
So yeah, I just, I was, like here in California, even the places to get, I mean, not that we're a weed podcast, but it's a thing.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It's going on in culture right now, right?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It was just made legal in California, right?

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
But all the places to go buy it here, they still look like shady back alley places.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
At least all the ones I've seen, still like they have the scarred out front.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Just order it online.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
That's what I've heard too, is that online is like the way to go.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Speaking of, you know, delivery to your door, you can just do that.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
That's what I do actually, except they don't do it to my door and where I live, but I go to Natomas and have it done at a friend's house.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I go to Chibi's.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Wow. Okay.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
That's where I get my CBD pen for my nausea.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
You get your food delivered, you can get your weed delivered, you can get your-

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Get my fake weed. Well, CBD pen.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
How long until I can order a beet?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Did you hear the speakingness now that we're going-

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Would anyone in this room prefer a mango lassi, by the way?

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Now that we're going into the marijuana podcast, did you hear that?

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
It's not episode 420, it's 769. That's a different number.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Seriously, does anyone want mango lassi?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
No, I don't.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
But anyways, the guy that's the founder of Jelly Belly or whatever, they're making jelly bellies now.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I heard, yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I would eat that.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't know. I don't smoke weed, so it's not, you know. I don't care if other people do it, and I understand it's great for nausea and other things like that.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
It's just, I drink, isn't that enough? Anyway.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
All right, so I guess, but you know what? Look, I know it's a video game show, not a marijuana show, but I'm no idiot.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
And I could-

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
What are you allowed to do when you get high? You play video games.

05:15.000 --> 05:23.000
And based on, you know, the billboards that I've seen, I can also apparently have had my Slurpee delivered to me as well.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
But what's the point at that point? Because, you know, you have to go get it, and it's immediately melting.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
I just don't understand that, but you could do it if you wanted to, if you're that lazy.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Pixel Pacas in chat says, that's on the strip. No, we were off strip, but not far.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
If you know where the Hard Rock Hotel is in Vegas, that's, well we weren't at that hotel, but we were like right in that area.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And that's where the store was that I was-

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And this place is pickup only, so that sucks.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
So, all right. Oh no, you put in a whole food order, and then they were like, oh, only pickup?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, so I have to cancel it.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh boy. All right, well anyway, let's get into our kickoff talk.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Well, you know what? It's funny, because we're talking about all this instant gratification stuff,

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
and that actually does tie into the news this week a little bit, because Game Developers Conference happened,

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
so we had a lot of news around Game Developers Conference, and probably the big thing that we,

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
the big, big news out of Game Developers Conference is finally, we know what Google's dive into gaming is going to look like.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And the twist is, it's not a console, right?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
So tell us a little more about it, Logan.

06:26.000 --> 06:36.000
It's a service, if you will. So, they're calling it Google Stadia, and of course, Phil Harrison, who's now over at Google now,

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
was talking about their platform and everything, what they're basically going to use, their high-end backbone,

06:43.000 --> 06:52.000
running these really high-end gaming PCs or whatever, are going to be streaming up to, well, they said eventually 8K,

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
but right now, 4K, 60 frames per second, to any screen you can think of.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
Can I just quickly say, like, the 8K, 120 frames a second, like, when they were talking about all that stuff,

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
I just, I thought instantly of, like, gigaflops, and things that they just say, because it's like,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Gigaflops are real things, though.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
I know they are, but they're things that they just say, there's more of it, it's more better than what you know today.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It's just, I don't know.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
It's just, yeah, I don't know, it's a neat idea.

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
I just don't know how practical it is with our network infrastructure that we have, but okay, let's just pretend that that wasn't an obstacle.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Then, yes, this could be a thing.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
So, what they're going to do with Stadia is basically, you know, you would be able to, they're kind of linking it with a bunch of different things.

07:41.000 --> 07:49.000
So, for example, they have it linked with YouTube, so, like, you'd be playing a game and then have a link on there to join someone that's actually playing a game,

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
or you can basically create save states, sort of, with your different games, so you can actually share those out as well, which is kind of cool.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
They have, you know, it's basically going to allow you to jump into a game without having to download anything.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
They're showing off, you know, being able to kind of, you know, go from your PC to your TV to tablets.

08:14.000 --> 08:27.000
They have this dedicated controller that looks kind of like a Nintendo Switch Pro controller, but a little bit like Ouya as well.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
It's kind of like all the existing controllers mushed together type of thing.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
It's a very, like, when I saw the controller, I was like, this looks extremely unoriginal, but that's actually not a dig on Google.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Like, I don't want you guys thinking I'm, like, here to hate on this.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
You don't really need to improve too much on the PC.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, I was just like, okay, this is what I would expect in gaming today.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
This is a par for the course controller.

08:51.000 --> 09:00.000
Yes, exactly. And they're saying that theirs is different because it connects directly with Wi-Fi, and it's supposed to lower latency that way.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
So we'll have to see how that actually works out.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Right now, though, they didn't give too much of a hint of what they're doing.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
They did, you know, show that Jade Raymond's going to be doing games using it for their...

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
They actually have their own first party company that's going to be doing games now.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
We have no idea what the game is.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
No idea, but...

09:21.000 --> 09:34.000
But being that this is Game Developers Conference, it is logical that they would be focusing more on the platform, the delivery, the canvas, I suppose, and then we'll see the paintings at E3 or at different times.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
So I'm not, like...

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I know there was a lot of talk out there about why did they bring her out.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
They got nothing to show, but it's maybe GDC is not usually the time to announce games.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Although there have been exceptions to the rule, right?

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
PlayStation Move was announced at GDC, but again, that's also more like a platform, a delivery, a canvas, if you will, not a game.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
So...

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I would be...

09:59.000 --> 10:14.000
Now, what they didn't talk about, which I think would be pretty cool if they could do this because, you know, really one of the things that we run into with VR, for example, is having hardware powerful enough to be able to run it.

10:14.000 --> 10:38.000
So if they're talking, you know, assuming that they can actually push 8K at 120 later on in the future, I mean, that might be something worthwhile for, like, VR because then you can have, you know, VR headset that's basically just a receiver and everything's being done in the cloud and you can stream these really powerful games to it.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
But once again, that has to do with your network infrastructure.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
And let's be honest, that ain't all that great in the United States.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
So...

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
I like where they said that they only need 30 megabits down to be able to run games at 4K in 60 frames per second.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
But I would be...

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I would need to actually see this thing running and be able to check it out.

11:04.000 --> 11:15.000
So hopefully when they do announce price and all that stuff, which apparently is going to happen in the summer at their own separate event where they talk about games and everything or come out to it, then I guess we'll have to wait and see.

11:15.000 --> 11:28.000
But, you know, some of the games they talked about coming to it, obviously Doom, they were showing off Assassin's Creed, which, you know, that's the part of the project stream testing.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
Which apparently, by the way, for people that I know that were doing that and participating in that said it looked really good.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I didn't see it myself, you know, so it's hard for me to know.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
I think it's one of the things you kind of see yourself to really believe in it.

11:40.000 --> 11:54.000
But I do feel like people that participated in that in general were big believers in what Google was delivering at this conference, whereas people who hadn't had their hands on it, admittedly myself, were a little more in the skeptical like,

11:54.000 --> 12:02.000
I don't know, you know that Google just has that server behind the stage and it's not really, which by the way is the case.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
Like there's not, it's not actually beaming over the internet from another, you know, location in another city.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Like it's on site and they do this at E3 with these types of streaming things all the time.

12:11.000 --> 12:18.000
But I get it, I get it. This is a concept, it's not like it's releasing tomorrow, so I'm not going to like judge it harshly.

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
And it is benefited a little bit by the fact that, you know, people that I do know that had, did play the Project Stream thing, walked away from it with a pretty favorable impression.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
You know, and to my thing, though, with it is like everyone's saying, oh, well, this is going to kill consoles and stuff.

12:31.000 --> 12:46.000
I don't think so, because once, you know, first off, you have the issue where it's, you know, your network infrastructure has to be able to, and bandwidth caps for that, have to be able to withstand something like this for one.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
And two, they have to have the games you actually want to play on it, like, cool, it has Assassin's Creed and Doom.

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
So do these other consoles. So does my PC. It's like, why do I need yet another service to play the same fucking game?

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
I don't need it. I need to see what they're going to, you know, offer on this platform that I can't get on these other platforms.

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
I can get it, this and a bunch of other things, and it makes it more convenient for me, because honestly, that's what it's going to come down to.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
I don't care what your tech is. You just have to show me that it's going to work and that it has stuff that actually I'm interested in.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
And it might be a thing you kind of have to try for yourself, but at the same time, if it's as easy as click here in your Google Chrome browser and bam, game.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
I mean, this is not exactly something they're going to have to figure out. How do we get it in Best Buys and GameStop?

13:31.000 --> 13:39.000
Like they should, hypothetically, be able to have like a 10 minute demo or something that you could just click a button and bam, you're going, right?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
So it should be easy to make us believers, I suppose.

13:44.000 --> 13:53.000
Okay, so my thoughts on this, and I want to know your guys' thoughts too in our chat, and I see some popping in already, and definitely Jamie, if you have thoughts on this thing as well.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
My thought on this is that I do think this is the future of gaming. I think that's the reality.

14:00.000 --> 14:10.000
Here's the deal. Broadly, this is the future of gaming. Specifically, I'm not sure this is the future of gaming. Does that make sense?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yes.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Okay.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Immediate versus long term? Maybe?

14:15.000 --> 14:33.000
Google versus the industry, if that makes sense, is that I'm not sure, and this isn't like a Google hate or anything like that. Although, I'm going to say it, Google has a track record of kind of closing things maybe before they really, you know, what Google Plus is sunsetting next month.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But okay, fine. That never really caught on.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh no.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
Google inbox is going away, which I thought, you know, I was using that for a little bit and I thought it was kind of neat. It was just a different way, but I guess not enough people were doing it.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Didn't they have like Google Reader or something like that?

14:46.000 --> 15:00.000
Google Wave, Google Reader, that was a big one that I still miss. I really wish that was around. And so on and so on. I mean, you know, okay, so Stadia and gaming, it's a different thing, but you can't help but kind of look at that and go, hmm, here's another big concern I have.

15:00.000 --> 15:09.000
And I'm actually going to read a chat comment on this because I think he summed it up very well, and that's SSJ100Matt in our chat said, it frightens me that this is being powered by YouTube.

15:09.000 --> 15:25.000
They're making it so that creators can have fans join games live. Google has a horrible track record in moderation in terms of YouTube. I understand the power of moderation will be in the hands of the creator, but the YouTube community is notoriously toxic at times. That is one of my top three concerns.

15:25.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah, but I don't think that's necessarily what they're talking about as far as that because it's more of like that you can share out. They were giving examples and obviously they're going to name their own services if they're giving examples, but they're basically saying like as a streamer and they only have to do it through Google.

15:39.000 --> 15:53.000
You can have a hyperlink basically that you could put in the description for your show, podcast, livestream, whatever you're doing, where they would be able to jump into the instance that you're in as well to be able to play with you if they wanted to.

15:53.000 --> 16:07.000
Or you can send them a link to play this game online or like, hey, I got stuck here. I'm going to put you in the same scenario. It's like a save state basically that I can have my show me how you would get out of this or something.

16:07.000 --> 16:16.000
You're like, hey, you know, we're going to set up this Minecraft instance and you set it up and now show me what you're going to build with these blocks or something like that.

16:16.000 --> 16:29.000
That could be neat. I'm going to say like in theory, I do have some concerns about it being tied to YouTube. I hope due to antitrust concerns, especially because we've seen what's happening in Europe where they're getting smacked down, I do hope that this will actually be open.

16:29.000 --> 16:41.000
I hope it's more of a case of what you're saying, like YouTube is the example, but in reality, it'll be open to Twitch, it'll be open to Mixer and things like that. After all, on your Xbox One, you aren't locked into Mixer. That's the one that kind of pushed, but you can do Twitch.

16:41.000 --> 16:50.000
But the thing I did like, though, that they were talking about with the game streaming and stuff is this is opening up game streaming for other people that may not have the hardware to be able to do that.

16:50.000 --> 17:05.000
Because what they're saying with this is when you basically can hit a button to stream your gameplay, whatever, it's not taking your actual gameplay, it's taking what it's viewing in the cloud. So it's being streamed at 4K and 60 frames per second.

17:05.000 --> 17:17.000
So whereas I don't have hardware on my laptop to be able to do that, I could play this game in Stadia and be able to stream it out and it would be in the highest possible quality that you can get.

17:18.000 --> 17:27.000
Now, here's what I mean about the industry. This is where the industry is going and I'm not sure this is it, but this is definitely a good tea leaves the future.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
Actually, one thing I want to address real quick, because a lot of people are calling this OnLive, right? They're saying, Oh, OnLive did this a long time ago.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
You know why OnLive failed? Here's why OnLive failed, like straight up.

17:37.000 --> 17:52.000
OnLive failed. It wasn't like the fact that it was streaming and all this stuff. It was the fact that they wanted to charge you the same price for a retail game to own it in the cloud, essentially, and not have anything physical for that with no answer as to what would happen when the whole thing went away.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
Like you're paying 60 bucks and I believe OnLive had a monthly fee. Am I not correct? I believe that was the case.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
I remember.

18:00.000 --> 18:07.000
OnLive had a monthly fee and still wanted to charge 50, 60 bucks a game so you could play it digitally, hopefully, you know, and obviously now they're long gone.

18:07.000 --> 18:16.000
I think it is obvious. Who knows? Maybe I'll be proved wrong. I think it is obvious Stadia is intended to be subscription based.

18:16.000 --> 18:24.000
Stadia wants to be Netflix for games, end of sentence. I don't think there's going to be more money and more things that are in this.

18:24.000 --> 18:32.000
And you might wonder how, uh, studios are going to be able to make money. And so, well, I mean, Netflix is like, do you guys know?

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
I still think that they're going to sell actual games with it.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
I don't, I, they might for like premium, premium things. I don't think it'll be successful if they do.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
Does Netflix sell movies on top of what they're doing now? What would happen if they did that? I don't think, I don't think it would do well. I really don't.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
I really don't. I don't know. But I mean, doesn't mean that they're not going to try.

18:54.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah. So anyways, it'll, it'll be interesting to see what happens in the near future when other people jump into the fray.

19:02.000 --> 19:11.000
Um, but anyway, let's see, uh, other comments in chat, um, S2100 Matt says, I think that content creators struggling to gain viewership will be forced into having their gameplay open to viewers.

19:12.000 --> 19:20.000
Sure, they can make their gameplays close, but if they want to differentiate themselves between other streamers and creators, they will be forced to keep up with the Jones by having their streams open.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
Uh, PixelPaca says they talked about the Stadia store as a means to sell games.

19:25.000 --> 19:36.000
Okay. Personally, if that is the case and I misunderstood something I'm, I'm seeing, or I missed that part of it. If that's the case that they're going to like sell, I, I don't think this thing will work.

19:36.000 --> 19:45.000
I don't think the industry's ready for it. I think we're back where we were with Xbox One and them wanting to do as much digital as they did in the first announcement.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
It's going to go the way of the glass?

19:46.000 --> 19:57.000
I think so. I think it will. Um, well, Jamie, I haven't really heard your thoughts on this and I don't know if you've thought a lot about it, but what do you think of this whole like streaming only sensation?

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't base my judgment off of the initial statements. You know me, that's just not how I work.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
I want to see the damn game in motion. You want to see the damn game?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Exactly.

20:08.000 --> 20:23.000
Fair. Honestly, fair. It's fair. Um, I've learned not to judge things on the hype or on other people's opinions just because, you know, how long did I say, Oh, I'm not going to like Mass Effect. I'm not going to like Mass Effect.

20:23.000 --> 20:31.000
And what game do I super love? Mass Effect. How long did I go, Oh yeah, this particular thing is going to be really awesome.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Everyone says it's going to be great. And then I play it and I'm like, this is kind of shit, you know, but other people love it.

20:37.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm, my own opinions can't be affected by what other people are saying about it. I have to experience it for myself.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
Sure. Now we do know that existing games will be on the platform because you know about Assassin's Creed and all this stuff.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
So let's say it is something that's up your alley. Like, I don't know, Tekken 7. Just make believe with me here or Tekken 3. Better yet.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Which was the best of the series.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
Let's say, let's say they've got a nice retro collection and you know what? Something like that could win me over in HD.

21:07.000 --> 21:16.000
Something like that could win me over in a heartbeat. If Google was like, we have like Stadia retro that has all these Atari classics on demand and PlayStation.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't, well, obviously it wouldn't have PlayStation, but make believe with me here, classic games on demand.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
That would, I would kind of go, okay, you got my attention, right?

21:24.000 --> 21:33.000
But anyway, that stuff aside, what about just the concept of you're not going to have a cartridge or a disc to play Tekken whatevers.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
You're going to just go on to Google Chrome and click go and rely on the stream to do it.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
I also don't want to rely on Chrome. So there's that too. I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
I have one computer that Chrome runs really well on and that is still kind of iffy.

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
I do most of my stuff on a Mac. Chrome kind of doesn't run all that great on a Mac and this I can tell you from the back end of it.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
It does not run great on a Mac. So I don't want to be tied to a...

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So you have to see it for yourself on said Mac.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
Exactly. Exactly. And if anyone wants to talk to me about the back end stuff on it, I'd be happy to talk offline.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
But it just doesn't, it runs very inefficiently on a Mac.

22:17.000 --> 22:26.000
And so I'm afraid that with all of the inefficiencies with running, for example, every tab that you open opens three extra processes on the back end.

22:26.000 --> 22:34.000
Which will slow down. So imagine you're running extra tabs or you've got all these processes running and then you're trying to stream on top of it.

22:34.000 --> 22:44.000
That to me is looking like a disaster because, again, Google does not program efficiently for this OS.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
And I'll be perfectly honest, it's not super efficient on a PC either if you look at what runs in your task manager.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
Okay, I want to read this comment and it's really funny because he just pasted it again to make sure I see it.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
No, I was going to get to this comment a minute ago but then I ended up on a tangent as sometimes happens.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
But this is a great comment because I was talking about the industry versus Google. Here's VG Realness' comment in chat.

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
I also think that it's only a matter of time before Microsoft drops the bomb on Game Pass for PC with a massive library.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
So it will be hard for Google to catch up. Sony could make PlayStation Now available on PC as well to combat this.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
So it comes down to the available library.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Hell yes, and then I'll have all my games in one place. That's what I really want.

23:30.000 --> 23:40.000
And yes, that is why I say this is where the industry is going. Not necessarily PC, but maybe, although we know Sony loves their proprietary shit, right?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But here's, in my opinion...

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Oh God, what memory sticks do I have to buy now?

23:44.000 --> 23:52.000
In my opinion, expect this shit to be built into the next Xbox and the next PlayStation. Guaranteed.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
And I'm not saying it's going to be the only thing. I'm not saying it's going to be that they're going to completely walk away from discs.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
They might. I don't know. We'll find out.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
And I don't think necessarily PlayStation 5 is Sony's version of Stadia.

24:07.000 --> 24:16.000
But you can absolutely expect something like this will probably be a feature, a part, a component of the next consoles.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Fuck, we've already heard. Microsoft, haven't they talked before?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Correct me if I'm wrong, somebody in chat, somebody in the studio.

24:21.000 --> 24:32.000
Hasn't Microsoft already talked about a game that would play on the disc, like a normal game, but it would be enhanced by the cloud, by an internet connection?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Yeah, Crackdown 3.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Okay, so does it actually do that?

24:37.000 --> 24:47.000
Yeah, it does for the multiplayer, and it's alright. They have destruction in the game, but I can't help but think that it looks better even in Battlefield.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
They've done this like real time destruction stuff in Battlefield, and it's just kind of a pointless game mode.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
It was supposed to be like, oh, you can destroy any of the buildings in this game, but I don't know.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
It's just it's kind of not all that great.

25:02.000 --> 25:10.000
It's not compelling enough for me to play the multiplayer in there because, yeah, cool, you can break things, but the multiplayer sucks.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Like, not the co-op, but like the multiplayer versus sucks.

25:13.000 --> 25:20.000
So it's like, I don't give a shit they can break stuff because it's just a boring game. I don't want to play this.

25:20.000 --> 25:31.000
Right, right. So, I mean, one other thing we got to get into because this is a very legitimate concern people are having about Google Stadia is the bandwidth situation.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
What did they say for this? 4K, 60 frames a second was going to be what? 20, 30 gigs?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
30 gigabytes down.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
So a lot of us are capped at one terabyte on our Internet.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
And I kind of tried to get to this on Twitter, and some of the replies I got was, well, my Internet's unlimited.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And I'm like, that's great for you, and it is.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
And Google Stadia will be great for you and your house, but the problem is if you're going to catch on everywhere,

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
which Google's, you know, a big initiative like this needs to catch on everywhere,

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
then we do have to take some things like what is this going to look like for bandwidth caps into consideration?

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Because I don't know about you guys, but, like, I already use, like, a lot of Internet around here.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
I mean, shit, we're doing this show right now, right? I stream a lot. Alan streams a lot.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
You know, and it's just we're almost consuming more and more.

26:18.000 --> 26:26.000
I kind of wish Google would use some of their leverage as a powerhouse in tech to kind of force the hand of cable companies to help these data caps go up.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
I kind of think my gut kind of says these data caps will go up eventually.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
I think what's going to be well, what's going to end up happening is real quick.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
They've already gone up. They've got we were just at 250 gigs, not even what, five years ago.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
So the industry has already bumped this up due to pressure to bump it up to it.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
So it's not like it can't get bumped up again.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
But I just feel like this may need to happen a little sooner before Stadia.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
You know, some people are going to have some real concerns about it. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
No, I was just going to say, I don't think that they're going to have bandwidth caps for much longer.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
Eventually, they'll go through Congress or the FCC and stuff.

27:05.000 --> 27:15.000
And we'll eventually, once we capture it, we'll be able to pass legislation to make that stuff unlawful.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
You know, the whole net neutrality stuff probably pushing that back through again.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
But I think they're going to have to get rid of it anyways, because eventually it's just going to get faster and faster.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
And obviously they're keeping it there just as a monetization means.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Well, and I've said this on a show before.

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
I think what's going to happen in the next couple of years is that cable is going to have a real competitor in places where there aren't options.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
Like here in this specific place where I live in the Sacramento area, we only have one option.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And I know other people in Sacramento that have more than one option.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
But unfortunately where I'm at, just one option for internet.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
But what's going to happen, you know, because I think there's a lot of people in places where there's only one, maybe two choices for internet.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
What's going to happen, 5G getting adopted more and more and more.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
And look how fast tech is moving now in just a few years.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
I think 5G and over air and that is going to be the real competitor to cable.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
You want to jump in, Jamie?

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
Are they going to use this to push Google Fiber?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You would think.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Google Fiber has kind of failed in a lot of places, though, because...

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
But they've used this as a promotion point.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
You would think that Google could use like their own internet and this stuff.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
But you're right, like wasn't Google supposed to be in every city by now?

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
No, because I was even reading some online today, they're showing like some of the Google Fiber stuff where they were...

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
The plan was to just basically bury it a few inches below the ground and cover it with like asphalt or something like that near roadways or whatever.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Just kind of do it faster.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, some folks in chat are saying that Google Fiber is essentially dead.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
They got... Bobby says they got legislated out.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
G.G. Rama says they're not expanding it.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah, which is too bad.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Well, unfortunately, add that to the list of failed Google projects.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
Well, and we have Verizon 5G in like the middle of Sacramento right now.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
I just wish it would come out further because I do have Verizon.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
It will, but Logie, it will eventually.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah, but how it wins eventually, 2020, 2021.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Think of where our cell phones were at when OLR started.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
I had that hideous flip phone thing, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That's what I had. And look how far we've come in this.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I mean, granted, we've been doing this show 17 years. It's a while.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
But we've come all the way from that crappy little flip phone to what?

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Edge, 3G, 4G, right?

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
So it's just a matter of time before we get to a 5G era where it's everywhere.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
But you're right. How soon?

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
And is the fact that 5G is not going to be available in X percent of the nation right away,

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
is that going to hinder Stadia's availability?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Success rate, I guess.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
Although, granted, that makes it sound like I'm saying, oh, Stadia is only available on 5G. I'm not.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
Well, here's the thing. I don't know that all, I think, you know, for other consoles,

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
like for everybody that jump in on this is not necessarily a good idea.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
May we not, may we forget that not literally a few years ago,

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
everyone was like, you know what's going to be the big thing of the future?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
3D in your household.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
It's like it's pictures, but they're coming out of your face.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
And everyone jumped in full bore in the 3D and where the fuck did that go?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Nowhere, because it flopped.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Virtual reality.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, but that's virtual reality. That's different.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
But like when you say 3D, I'm like, it's just that just kind of shifted a little bit.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
But what I'm saying, though, is like people jump on board like they don't make 3D TVs.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Well, I mean, not nearly like they were trying to do like three years ago.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah, companies jump on board like with this stuff to try to push this new tech.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
But like if the infrastructure is not there to support it, it's kind of a waste of time.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Maybe just make a nice console and stick with that.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Do we really need to be planning for like 20 years in the future?

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
You're going to have like two or three consoles by then.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
I mean, let's just one step at a time here. Make better games.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
Anyway, I think what ultimately becomes a Google stadia, you know, I'm interested to try it for myself.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
But I just, you know, the cost is going to be a big thing.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
And if they're going to say, oh, you've got to pay a monthly fee and you've got to pay like 30 bucks a game.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Or even if you've got to pay like 30 bucks a game.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
But I don't like, I don't know how I'm going to feel about that when it's like, oh, but I've got to be thinking about my cable bill too.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.000
I don't know. I've got to, I think I'm going back to kind of where Jamie's at where like I really have to see it for myself

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
and not in a controlled environment, in a real environment to really be able to make that decision.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
But if Google's going to make first party games with all stars like Jade Raymond.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
Who knows what they're capable of making where they might have a game where it's like, shit, I got to play that.

31:44.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah. You know, but I can't like if it's something that I would play as much of as like World of Warcraft.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
I don't have the frickin bandwidth for that. So that's got to be addressed. I don't know.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
I'm curious. I'm more curious about some of the things that VG realness was saying.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
How the rest of the industry is going to respond to it. Because again, I do kind of think this is where industry is going.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
I do want to address the physical thing real quick and why I didn't call out Nintendo either.

32:09.000 --> 32:16.000
So, I think physical, there may still always kind of be a place for that. It's harder to tell with games.

32:16.000 --> 32:24.000
Because, you know, you look at music. Music has really shifted to things like Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, right?

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
That's a lot of where music is, is in that streaming area right now. But you could still get a CD.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
You can still get, I mean, you can't exactly walk into Best Buy and get one anymore.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
But they're collectibles oftentimes. Not always necessarily in other countries, too, as well.

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
CDs are the predominant way of getting your music instead of streaming like in Japan for real.

32:45.000 --> 32:53.000
That's also a damn good point when we talk about things like Stadia is like how adopted is something like Stadia going to be in Brazil?

32:53.000 --> 33:05.000
You know? And I pick on that because isn't that the country where things like the Mega Drive and the Genesis were still big years later on?

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
Because the stuff that we might be playing in the States was impossibly high to import in a country like Brazil.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
So, I'm kind of curious, you know, obviously there's gamers in Brazil. Are they going to be able to play Stadia like this?

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
So, probably, I don't know. But anyway.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
But it's not coming out in all regions, too.

33:23.000 --> 33:31.000
I guess that's true. It's probably not something they're going to target right away. But I guess neither do a lot of gaming companies officially.

33:31.000 --> 33:42.000
But anyway, movies. Movies within the past few years have really made a shift to things like Netflix, Hulu, and more to come.

33:42.000 --> 33:51.000
We know Apple is likely doing something in the next couple weeks involving streaming. Disney is certainly doing a streaming thing. We know that.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
And this whole like streaming solution for film, TV, movie, that's just getting bigger and bigger.

33:56.000 --> 34:04.000
But it's not like Blu-rays are dead. People still buy them. Why? It's collectibles, right? Or things to watch on the go on an airplane, right?

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
But I can't. When was the last time you brought a Blu-ray? Because I don't remember.

34:07.000 --> 34:15.000
I haven't bought a Blu-ray. Well, no. The last Blu-ray I bought was part of a Kickstarter. And I didn't even really need it.

34:15.000 --> 34:22.000
It was for Kung Fury. Because like, oh yeah, I want that on Blu-ray so I can watch as much as I want.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
Come to find out, the Blu-ray got delayed for so long. I've already watched this movie like 80 times online.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
Oh, hey, there's a Blu-ray now. I'll just put this in a pile of stuff I'm going to forget about.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
Here's why I don't think the gaming industry will be completely detached from physical games.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
It's the same reason why I didn't name Nintendo earlier. I don't think they're, why would they do this?

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
I don't think Nintendo has any plans to do anything like this. Why should they?

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Why try to figure out what the future is when you can just do what works?

34:50.000 --> 34:59.000
And Nintendo's big business is portable. Sure, the Switch is docked, but it also makes a lot of bread and butter by the fact that it's portable.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.000
And, you know, although maybe soon, maybe in 5, 10 years, we'll be in a 5G world where maybe I'll want to evaluate this statement.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
I think we all agree that Nintendo would be the last company to move to something like this.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
And I think Nintendo also underst... You're sitting on a joke over there, I know it.

35:16.000 --> 35:25.000
I just, they couldn't even, they can't, they can't even get a storefront working, let alone, you know, game streaming service.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
Let's, let's, let's not like, let's not scare Nintendo into doing something they're not prepared for.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
I bought Blaster Master Zero 2, just fine. Their storefront's fine. Anyway, here's the thing.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
When Nintendo, and I think Nintendo understands the value of IP, their collectibles, their characters,

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
where I think, you know, a lot of the movies and music industry kind of make their money right now,

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
selling shirts, selling posters, selling collectibles, and even the game industry is kind of moving in that direction,

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
which I talked a little bit on Bobby's show at the end, in the call, like if you go to a Target,

35:55.000 --> 36:01.000
you start finding loot boxes for games that don't have the game in them, it's just a bunch of, like, collectibles.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
But anyway, I think Nintendo can still hang on to that stuff for a long time.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
So I just feel like, I think we all have a general understanding that Nintendo would be the last company to adopt something like this,

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
and I don't think they would be in any rush to do so, and why should they?

36:19.000 --> 36:26.000
They're not, because they're successful, and I think it's just these other companies that are gonna try to figure out what the next big thing is,

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
and I don't think we even know, they're just pushing it, they're just trying to tell you this is what the next thing is,

36:31.000 --> 36:38.000
but we don't know until we get there, because, I don't know. Well, let's just see what happens, okay?

36:38.000 --> 36:45.000
Let's see how well the service runs, and what's even available in it, because if it sucks, then it's gonna fail.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
That's what it's just gonna be.

36:47.000 --> 36:55.000
Let's see, other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwell says, I buy 4K Blu-rays because you can't rent them via Netflix DVD or Redbox.

36:55.000 --> 37:03.000
And I know that, I know that, like, Netflix does some 4K, but it's kind of limited, right?

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Like, their originals are all in 4K, but usually the stuff that's, like, licensed on Netflix, not a lot of that is in 4K.

37:07.000 --> 37:14.000
I can never tell because it usually upscales some of that stuff on my TV, so, like, I can't really tell sometimes if it's in 4K,

37:14.000 --> 37:28.000
if it's just 1080. But, yeah, I mean, 4K looks nice. I wish I would, see, I would get the Ultra 4K stuff for watching them on my TV,

37:28.000 --> 37:35.000
but, oh darn, that PlayStation Pro, it doesn't play 4K content via the Blu-ray drive. Thanks, Sony!

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Thank you, Sony, I appreciate that so much.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
But we also know that this conversation about the future of gaming is not going to be had on the PlayStation 4.

37:44.000 --> 37:53.000
The PlayStation 4 is kind of in its, I don't want to say it's sunsetting, but it's in its, we all know that the PlayStation 5 is on the horizon.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
It's more like, more like the sun is rising on PlayStation 5, it's just a matter of time.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
And this is where we'll have these conversations, but the PlayStation 4 is not where these conversations are going to be had. Anyway.

38:05.000 --> 38:15.000
Or where I could just get an Xbox, you know, 1S, and a 1S, not the X, but the S, and that can do that shit just fine.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
Oh, but Sony, fuck them, they just wanted to save some money on that Blu-ray drive.

38:22.000 --> 38:30.000
Dartatia in chat says, I was just telling someone on Twitter, that's why I love Nintendo, they don't really do any of the loot boxes slash microtransactions stuff.

38:30.000 --> 38:37.000
They did do some DLC, but at least it's always been good. And how long did it take Nintendo to finally come to the table with DLC?

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
But, but you're right, it's all been very good.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
But that's the thing though, they're like 10 years behind in trends as far as online goes.

38:46.000 --> 38:52.000
Remember back when we used to get decent expansion packs and DLC for games?

38:52.000 --> 39:00.000
We used to have that, but now we have this bullshit. Just give them 10 years and they'll be in straight in bullshit again.

39:00.000 --> 39:10.000
I feel like though, we live in an industry that will forgive Nintendo time and time again because Nintendo makes those IPs you gotta have.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
It's kind of like Disney coming to the table really late on streaming.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
We all still know it's going to be a big fucking deal because it's Disney, right?

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
And they got the Star Wars and they got their, what they just said, all of their classics.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
There is no longer a Disney vault because all of their classics will be on the streaming thing and that whole thing.

39:29.000 --> 39:39.000
That's a big deal. So even though it took Disney forever to come to this table, compared to Netflix and Hulu and so forth, the industry's kind of ready for it.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
And I think in some ways a lot of those same rules apply to Nintendo. They can get away with it for a long time.

39:45.000 --> 39:56.000
The only time I think Nintendo didn't get away with it was when they made a huge mistake of naming one of their consoles something as atrocious as Wii U and not being able to explain that to their audience.

39:56.000 --> 40:02.000
And I'm telling, I will still stand by that. The Wii U failed because of its name. Period.

40:02.000 --> 40:20.000
Yeah, sure. On that note, we'll move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week, whether it was on the Wii U or not.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

40:22.000 --> 40:32.000
It was pretty good. Of course, some of my gaming week did include the GDCN party. And so what I played, I finally found the...

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Back up. Because you actually went to GDC, sort of.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
Not into the convention, but I went to the party. Just two of the parties.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Just for some networking.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
You were in the area. How was that? Tell us a little bit about your experience there.

40:44.000 --> 40:55.000
Well, the Unowns were G, D, and C for Pokemon Go. I didn't catch a C, but I caught another D and another G because OG, I got the D.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Well, you know what's sad is that I would have...

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
This is not sitting properly on my head.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
You got a lot of compliments on the hat in chat, though.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Thank you. Target.

41:02.000 --> 41:11.000
The problem with GDC, guess what? Guess what letters I already have? DragonCon. So, D-R-A-G-O-N-C. I have all the letters already because of DragonCon.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I need another C, then.

41:13.000 --> 41:20.000
I can trade you a C. I've got Unown out the Unown right now, okay? I'll trade you one. It's fine.

41:20.000 --> 41:30.000
But at any rate, the Unparty was okay. The whole thing was supposed to be a quiet thing, and so they would have this wave go through it.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
It would get quiet for two seconds and it would be unbearably loud because it was in a freaking warehouse.

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
So, I mean, I had a good time. It was really nice. And they got us pizza. I haven't had Papa John's since I was in college.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Pizza's awesome.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Even Papa John's pizza's okay.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
But he's not the CEO anymore, so...

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
I don't know if that's... All that stuff aside, which I really...

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I'm not gonna say no to free pizza.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
I can't follow that anymore, but that's not exactly the pizza chain I get up and cheer for.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
But they said, there's gonna be tea, and it was bring your own tea. So there was hot water.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
It was nice. It was a good place. I'm not complaining.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
Instead, Dark Soccer walked up and said, okay, well let's talk some shit. You wanna talk some shit? Let's talk some shit.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
No. But anyway, there were... I saw two games there that were on demo.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
And one of them was called Hyperdot, which if you go to hyperdotgame.com, you can see.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
And really the point is to dodge everything.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
You have a hundred trials that you go through in your campaign mode and you have to...

42:29.000 --> 42:35.000
There's even a multiplayer mode. And you can do custom challenges, but basically you're a little green dot avoiding all these blocks.

42:36.000 --> 42:44.000
And I don't know, maybe it got a little bit of inspiration from Undertale, maybe? The boss battles in Undertale.

42:44.000 --> 42:52.000
But at any rate, it is a neat little game. It actually reminded me of that game I love, Fractal, in just it's style.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
So, really neat. Check it out, guys.

42:55.000 --> 43:03.000
And then I spoke to the guy who's behind Zephyr Fox Games.

43:03.000 --> 43:09.000
And I'm so sad. I have his name on a business card and I left the business card at home.

43:09.000 --> 43:18.000
But he actually is local. So I said we should... I talked to him about getting him in that spot so he can hide Pikachu.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
He's a really cool guy, too. But he's working on a game actually in Unity called Space Uber.

43:24.000 --> 43:33.000
And he actually showed me two different demos. And one of them is going in in your spaceship and fixing it up and hacking into stuff on it.

43:33.000 --> 43:41.000
And then the other one is actually where you pick up passengers in space, but at the same time you have to dodge mines in space.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
He said as you go later on, you can pick up other vehicles like you find in space.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
You have to hack into them or you find different creative ways to get the machine started, to get the ship started.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
I just remembered it because the name of his ship in the demo was the Lopey Bovine.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
And it was just really, really kind of funny.

44:03.000 --> 44:10.000
But I did take some video of it and once I get it edited down we can do it during a mid-break thing.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
But it was a really neat little game.

44:13.000 --> 44:22.000
And actually if you go to zephyrfoxgames.com, his most recent update on March 5th actually shows some of the gameplay of Space Uber.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
And it's just a neat little game.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
For me now, I will warn you, it made me super motion sick.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
I could not play or control it because my motion sickness got way set off.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
But the guy next to me had no problem with it.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
So everyone knows I got crazy motion sickness.

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
When I told him that I couldn't play Goldeneye, he's like, oh.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
So it was like that.

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
But it's a really, really, and he's doing it in Unity and he's done some amazing stuff with it already.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
So I'd say check both of them out.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
So zephyrfoxgames.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
And then the other one was hyper.game.com.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Alright, well I'm sure they appreciate those plugs.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
And I play a lot of pinball, like I do.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
I'm playing Pokemon Go. I played Ingress.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
I used up all my stupid bursters at work, thinking I could take it down.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Now I have no bursters. Thanks, Rob.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Why are you thanking me?

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Because you should give me more bursters.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
I'll give you more bursters. It's fine. I got a ton of them yesterday, so it's fine.

45:27.000 --> 45:34.000
At any rate, I'm also still playing idle pouring because of stupid, addictive reasons.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And I started playing Pocket Camp again.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
Which reminds me, I should probably open up Pocket Camp and get stuff.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
But I didn't do it yesterday, so whatever.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
Well then, while you do that, we'll go on over to Loki and check out Loki's gaming week.

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
I didn't play a whole lot this week. I mainly played just Pokemon Go while I'm doing other things.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
Because I always turn it on so that it automatically plays while I'm out and about.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
So that's what I did.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
I played that, and then I played a little...

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Was it H2 Overdrive?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Arcade, the Hydro Thunder.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Yeah, H2 Overdrive is a sequel.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
So we played a little bit of that today.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah, that's about it, unfortunately.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Didn't get to play a lot.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Oh, a little bit of DDR.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
But I didn't stream a ton of it.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm probably going to try to stream some more this week, though.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
I wanted to stream a lot more last week.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
But it just didn't work out because I have to cook things.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
And I always have to cook things when I get home.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
But this week, I didn't prepare for crap.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
So I don't have any meals to cook this week.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
So it'll be perfect.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Alright, so look forward to that on your Twitch channel.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Yes.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
My gaming week actually was not a lot of...

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I didn't really get into new stuff.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
So here's the weird thing about gaming week.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I still was playing quite a bit of Pokemon Go.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
I feel like we're like the Pokemon Go talk channel or whatever.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
But I did play a bit for Community Day.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Because Community Day was yesterday.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Yeah, 3 to 6.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Yeah, it was 3 to 6.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Well, the funny thing was, OK, so that morning I was playing Ingress

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
because there was things that we were getting together and doing in Ingress.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
That's all I'm really going to say about that. We were having fun.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
A social event, we'll say that.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
And then with Pokemon Go in the afternoon,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I kind of went right into that.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
And so we went downtown, and by that point I was already kind of sick of staring at my phone.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
So I was like, alright, I'll just kind of play.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
So the very first Trico I tapped on, Shiny.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
And then we get to the park, get another Shiny pretty quick in about five minutes.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I get a third Shiny by the time we walk over to the Rose Garden.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
So we're 15 minutes in, I have three Shinies.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
So I was like, alright, I got what I need.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
So I kind of closed my phone, put it in my pocket, and I turned on my Bluetooth catcher.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
And I was just like, I'm just going to catch a Bluetooth, whatever.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
So we just kind of, we walked around.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
I was more into the walking, I've been trying to get more in tune with fitness and things like that lately.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
So I was more into the walking, and seeing what Alan was up to, and cheering him on, and so forth.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
By the time it was done, and we really, we kind of went to go eat at one point.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
We just really took it easy, even though we were still down in the capital.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
We went to, you know, it's kind of where we always go is the capital park.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I had 11 Shinies by the time it was done.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I had none.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
What? I'll give you one.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I don't care.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Loki, I have 11. Take a goddamn Shiny.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Fine.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Alright.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Shiny what?

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Trico.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
I'll take one.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Okay, there you go.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
If you don't take it, I can do one a day, because they're special trades.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
So yeah, so I have like 11.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
What am I going to do with that many?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
I don't know.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Recycle them.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
I'll give, yes, obviously other people don't have such great luck.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
But I always say that's what, like, I have a million Cyndaquil.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I have a million, you know, some of the others.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Now some I didn't get so lucky on.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Like Charmander, I only have like the three.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
Bulbasaur, I was out of town when that happened, so I'm only, I only have two, so I don't really have enough of those.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
But you know, some of them I just barely skip by with three or four.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
But like, yeah, what am I going to do with 11 Shinies?

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
And I always say, I'll trade the extra ones.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
And it's like, I never, it's like all those unknowns I'm sitting on.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
Never, I think being limited to one special trade a day kind of sucks.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Because I can't really unload those as fast as I want to.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
So, anyway.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
Pat Deft asks, how many did Shane get?

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
I don't know, sometimes he's, sometimes he's listening or watching, so if he's out there maybe he'll reveal himself and tell you.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
It was more than me.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
I think he said his husband got 12, and I think he said he got 15?

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
He'll correct me if I'm wrong.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
But, yeah.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
So anyway, but here's the other thing.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
So I did play a console, here's the crazy thing.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
So you know I kind of got into Skyrim VR last week.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
So I played a little more of that.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Yeah.

49:43.000 --> 49:49.000
And then I got to the point where I'm like, okay, this is fun and all, but I'm like, I don't, I don't know if I want to keep playing this in VR.

49:49.000 --> 49:55.000
I want to go back to the PC. You know, I haven't seen Skyrim on the PC in a long time, and I have a 4K monitor now.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
And I don't even have the Skyrim Special Edition, but I got like an HD texture pack at some point, I don't know.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
So I started playing Skyrim on the PC again.

50:02.000 --> 50:09.000
Well, the Special Edition, I think, didn't they give that to you for free if you had bought it?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
If you had all the expansions, which I didn't.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Oh, yeah.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
No, they didn't give it to me for free. They gave it to Alan for free because he had all the expansions, but he had already played it a lot more.

50:16.000 --> 50:25.000
So I spent a lot of gaming time this week playing Skyrim, because I'll tell you what, in 4K, even on the regular version.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
Yeah, I don't play the HD version either because half the mods don't have them.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Well, it's not, well, it's not, yeah, I do use mods, especially like inventory mods.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Very, I don't, I don't mod heavy it like you do.

50:35.000 --> 50:45.000
But like, I do run a few mods in the old one, but I also feel like maybe because it wasn't like optimized for like HD, I can actually play it in 4K.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
Because a lot of games, my video card isn't strong enough to actually support full 4K gameplay.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
But Skyrim is great and it's gorgeous.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
And so I've just been playing it on PC, like, ooh.

50:56.000 --> 51:03.000
So I got, you know, enough through the story where what I got to, well, I don't want to spoil the whole thing, but you know, there's dragons.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
So I fought the dragon, I got Lydia, and doing that thing where I got to go up to the top of the mountain. That's where I'm at right now.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
So I played a little bit. And then, of course, as I'm going up to the mountain, what happens?

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
Ooh, cave! Ooh, giant! Ooh! You get distracted with everything.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
And that's, that's the Elder Scrolls experience, basically. So, yeah.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Now we're in Blackreach.

51:23.000 --> 51:30.000
I've been spending a lot of my gaming week playing a game that's eight years old, but whatever, right?

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Skyrim was 2011, right? Oh, it's kind of a...

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
It speaks to the longevity of the game design.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
Oh, no, for sure. For sure. I mean, hell, Skyrim just came out on Switch, what, a year ago?

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
So, I mean, you know, there's still, there's still a lot of longevity in that game.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
But I am definitely looking forward to Elder Scrolls VI as well, that's for sure.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
So, anyway, that was my Game of Week. Mobile phone games in Skyrim.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Let me just quickly say, though, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
And, yeah, the next show we will not be here is Memorial Day weekend, but that's a long ways off.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
So, let's talk about some gaming news for now. Loki.

52:11.000 --> 52:21.000
So, they had this Nindies Nintendo Direct this week, and they announced a bunch of games that are coming out on the Switch.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
And some even were released that same day because that's something that they like to do.

52:25.000 --> 52:35.000
So, starting in order of when they're coming out, Blaster Master Zero part two, or number two, is coming out.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
Well, came out earlier, and I guess we'll see some of that later.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Yes, we're going to see some of that later in our break.

52:41.000 --> 52:50.000
There's, was it Nuclear Throne is coming to the Switch, so that was also released as well.

52:51.000 --> 53:02.000
And then, in a few months here, they're going to be releasing Cuphead on the Switch, which was kind of interesting because that was pushed by Microsoft to try to put that there.

53:02.000 --> 53:09.000
So, that's April 18th. Katana Zero is coming April 18th. I think that's from Devolver Digital.

53:09.000 --> 53:20.000
And there's some more Vlambeer games, so Super Crate Box also coming out in April, and Ultra Bugs is another thing that they have coming out.

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
There's a game called Darkwood, which is also coming to the Switch in May.

53:26.000 --> 53:33.000
My friend Pedro is also coming out in June.

53:33.000 --> 53:39.000
And then, they have this one, which was kind of a release surprise here.

53:39.000 --> 53:47.000
So, from the makers of Crypt of the Necrodancer, they have a game called Cadence of Hyrule.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Cadence, I think.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
The musical term, yes.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
Cadence of Hyrule, and it's basically Crypt of the Necrodancer in Hyrule.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
It looks like a mod for Crypt of the Necrodancer is what it looks like, but it's not a slam.

53:59.000 --> 54:04.000
I think a lot of people were like, whoa, cool. And yeah, I'm into it too.

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
One of the games they have, Neo Cab, which is going to be coming out this summer.

54:09.000 --> 54:15.000
There's this game from Double Fine called Rad. It's an isometric 3D action RPG.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
And then, they've got a game called Swim Sanity.

54:20.000 --> 54:27.000
Bloodroots, Creature in the Well, which looked kind of cool.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
This was a game that was like a pinball action game.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
So, the whole game is played like pinball almost, but it looked pretty cool.

54:35.000 --> 54:41.000
They have the Stranger Things retro game that's coming out on July 4th, the same time as season 3,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
which we've got a trailer for this week as well.

54:43.000 --> 54:49.000
Pine, Overland, and a game called The Red Lantern,

54:49.000 --> 54:56.000
which is about a woman getting stranded in Alaska with her sled dogs.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Did you mention Cuphead?

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Yes.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
Okay, I must have missed when you brought that up. Okay, that Cuphead thing.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
Okay, hold up though, because Cuphead, I mean, that's obviously, you know,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
that's a game that's going to be great for the Switch,

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
but it also means that a lot of those Microsoft Nintendo things that have been rumors in previous episodes,

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
hold up, it's happening.gif, right?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Because Cuphead is coming to the Switch,

55:21.000 --> 55:27.000
which may indicate that some of these other things we've been hearing about could happen as well,

55:27.000 --> 55:32.000
namely Ori and the Blind Forest and some of these other Microsoft things,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
which is funny because I saw people on Twitter going,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I predict that Ori and the Blind Forest is next.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
I'm like, yeah, because that's what all the rumors already said. Hello?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
But anyway, whatever.

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
And the fact that maybe Xbox Game Pass, which that was kind of the big warning.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
I don't know how that would work though, but like, how does Hulu work?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
You know, I don't know. We'll see.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
But that's a little different. They're running on the actual hardware.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
Yeah, you're not going to be dealt, but I mean, maybe like a streaming, like, you know.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
Yeah, whenever they talk about their streaming thing, which we still haven't heard about,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
and maybe we'll hear about later this year. Who knows?

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
VG Realness in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says the budding

56:10.000 --> 56:16.000
Microsoft Nintendo relationship is very interesting in it,

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
which is also kind of goes back to what we were talking about earlier about,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
you know, the future of gaming is that maybe.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Oh, my God. My God. What did they join forces?

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
You got Microsoft with the back with the the tech.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
You've got Nintendo with the games. They could defeat everybody.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
I think there's a lot of fan wank that comes into situations like that.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
I mean, both of them are still in it to make profit, you know, for themselves.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
I don't think we're in a you know, when people say Microsoft should just buy Nintendo,

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
they forget how much money Nintendo has and they end up buying them.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
They just team up. Yeah. I mean, a team up could be interesting,

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
but I just I don't I don't know how far that goes and where what.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
I mean, I guess Nintendo gets, you know, some more things on their switch platform

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
and maybe Microsoft has an agreement. They're not going to address the portable market.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
And that's not something they're going into with, you know, the next Xbox.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Nintendo probably knows. And this is this is fascinating to think about.

57:13.000 --> 57:21.000
Nintendo probably knows exactly what the next Xbox is for a lot of this to happen.

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
If we're going to go this far, I mean, Cuphead on Switch is one thing.

57:25.000 --> 57:30.000
But if we're going to go this far down to talking about, you know, a true like alliance

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
or whatever to dominate the gaming industry, if that's really where we're headed,

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
then wouldn't it be logical to know that Nintendo already knows what Microsoft's working on?

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
And for them to agree to this, they know it's not portable.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
And it's not something that's going to step on the toes of the switch.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
Microsoft. Microsoft is not going to come out with an Xbox that pops off a dock and you can take with you.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Nintendo would never have agreed to this whole thing if that's what Microsoft's doing.

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
We'll see. Oh, it's kind of, I don't know, interesting to me.

58:01.000 --> 58:09.000
S.H.A. 100 Matt points out this is messing with everyone's Apple and Nintendo fan fix that people have been writing for decades.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
It's in that same vein. It certainly is.

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
Renji two to one in chat says something that wasn't brought up is Castle Crashers remastered on the switch.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
That was the thing right out of this week. But that was also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
And it's also like, with all respect to Castle Crashers, that game's pretty old at this point.

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
I mean, I say that and then I talk about how I played Skyrim all week.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
So, you know, an old game is still a good game.

58:36.000 --> 58:43.000
But I was just kind of like, I think I would have been more excited if it was a Castle Crashers sequel that was coming out to all these platforms.

58:43.000 --> 58:50.000
And maybe the first game with it or something, you know, just the fact that it's, oh, it's that same game again.

58:50.000 --> 58:56.000
And I'm not as excited about, but it's not like it was a bad game. So there is that for sure.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
Let's see. V.G. Realness says both companies have what the other needs.

59:02.000 --> 59:10.000
Nintendo needs better hardware and network infrastructure. Microsoft needs stronger Japanese presence. Interesting.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
That's true. You know, we didn't bring up the Japanese presence part.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
But that is a very good way for Microsoft to shove their foot in the door in Japan is the Nintendo partnership.

59:20.000 --> 59:27.000
Fifth Dream Today says people still think Microsoft will make a handheld. People think a lot of things. Go onto Reddit or Twitter.

59:27.000 --> 59:33.000
It's still out there, of course. So anyway, we will see what develops.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
So what did you think, though, quickly before I move on to the next story?

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Was there any of those Nindies that really jumped out at you where you're like, oh, I got to get this?

59:39.000 --> 59:46.000
Blaster Master Zero 2 looks good. I still haven't played through Blaster Master Zero, the first one.

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
I have it. I purchased it, but I haven't played through it. So I need to probably do that.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
No, that's about it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really want to play through Cuphead again.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I might pick up Cuphead because I'm just it's such a good game and I might be a sucker for it, especially with the portability and all that.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Is your play through video? Was it that old school musical yet?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You know what? No, I didn't pick that up. I really should know. You're right.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So many so many games I need to catch up on. Yet here I am playing Skyrim from how long ago?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I don't know. All right. It'll keep sucking you back in for hundreds of hours at a time.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And that's money well spent, though. All right. Let's get into our next story, which has to do with a rumor from the past that's kind of come true,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
because this is one of those rumors based on ratings in another country.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And sure enough, those are usually the ones where it's like, yeah, this is going to happen.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So Konami put out information this week that they are in celebration of their 50th anniversary doing some different collections.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And the first one is the Konami Anniversary Collection Arcade Classics.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So it's going to have eight arcade masterpieces, according to the list, from the 1980s.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
So here's what's in Konami's collection.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
They've announced the list here because this is out on April 18th, which is a pretty big deal.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And this is coming out on all the platforms. Right.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I missed it. It's Switch for sure. Right. Was it PS4 and Xbox One as well?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It's got to be. But it's digital. Right. Because it's like 20 bucks. Right.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I'm pretty sure it's on all the all the major gaming platforms.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Yeah. It's PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
OK, great. Oh, PC as well. Cool. All right.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:38.000
All right. So anyway, in the arcade classics, Haunted Castle, which, if I'm not mistaken, was like Castlevania's kind of first game.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Right. It was Haunted Castle. Probably an arcade game.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Yeah, it was. Or was it or am I mixing it up with Vampire Killer?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
No, Haunted Castle was Castlevania.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
OK. All right. Let's see. Typhoon or Ajax, which that one's not ringing a bell.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I don't remember that one. Is that one that you recognized?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Typhoon. No, she's just shaking. No, Nemesis or Nemesis.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah, well, of course, Nemesis is basically Gradius, Vulcan Venture, Gradius 2, Life Force or Salamander.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That one has me excited for sure. Thunder Cross, Scramble and Twinbee.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So those are the games that are going to be in the arcade collection, which is that's kind of neat.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So. Oh, thank you, Dark Tetsuya. That's why it's throwing me off.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Haunted Castle was the arcade. Vampire Killer was the MSX version.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
OK, thank you. All right.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Now, speaking of Vampire Killer and Castlevania, the other collection they announced, one of the other two,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
was a Castlevania anniversary collection for early summer 2019.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
There will be eight games in this collection, two. We only know four of them.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The original Castlevania for NES, Castlevania 3, Castlevania 2, Belmont's Revenge.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000
That's the Game Boy one, not Simon's Quest, which is notably missing, at least so far,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
because there's also four games we don't know yet.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And then Super Castlevania 4 is the other entry here.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
We don't know what the other four games are. We don't know if it's Simon Quest.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
We don't know if it's, you know, Symphony of the Night or some of the 3DS games or what.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So it's to be determined still on what that could contain.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But that could be interesting, especially for 20 bucks.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And then lastly, a Contra anniversary collection.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Now, I would think there's only so many games they can pick from for this,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
because I don't think Contra's had as many games as Castlevania. Really?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
All right. If you say so.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And some weren't even Contras originally.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Maybe that's what it is.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And it's one of those things where it's like these games that were kind of like derivatives of Contra

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
are probably going to be included.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But the original list is Contra, the arcade version, not the NES version.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
They really are the same thing.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
It's just the arcade version didn't have the 30 lives code.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
But I think Konami would be stupid not to put a throwback

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
where you would just unlock 30 lives in the arcade version by putting in the Konami code.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Super Contra, also the arcade version.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Super C, which was the 1990 NES one.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And then Contra 3, the Alien Wars, the pretty sweet Super Nintendo version of the game.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Those are the four that they've announced for the Contra collection.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So again, four more to be determined.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
We have noticed the lack of Contra hardcore in all the Genesis ones.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
So far, but they could be some of the Secret Four that are in there.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So we'll see.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
But what do you guys think so far?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I mean, I know Konami's gotten a lot of shit lately and rightfully so,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
but as far as like retro throwbacks and so forth,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
this seems like I think what a lot of people would be interested in.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I know I'm probably going to be a sucker for that Castlevania collection, that's for sure.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I wish the arcade collection, some of those...

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I mean, I might get it just for Gradius and Life Force, honestly.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Where's my throwback Bomani arcade collection?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It's doing a presidential move.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Distracting us from the real issues with, you know, little tidbits.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yes. But, well, I mean, if these sell well, maybe there will be more.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
You know, like Beatmania, popin' music.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Do you know how much I would love like a five-key Beatmania collection,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
but also I just feel like it's so niche that like we're asking for it.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Some of our listeners that date, you know, to the music game days

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and our fans and that stuff are asking for it too.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Put it only on PC.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Enough people asking for it? I don't know.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I would love it, but I just don't, I don't, I don't totally see it happening,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
but we'll see. You never know. You never know.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I have a collection.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Tiger Claw and Chat says what this Konami collection needs

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
is the two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games and Simpsons and Sunset Riders.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I only need the arcade ones for sure.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Well, Ninja Turtles and Simpsons, that's going to be very hard

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
with the licensing and all that stuff.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So that's why those got pulled off of the other digital storefronts.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Right. But Sunset Riders is certainly a realistic prediction for maybe the future.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Like if, if a second collection is released, but, uh, yeah, we'll, we'll see.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Honestly, for 20 bucks, I'll probably pick it up,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
but I love that it's on PC as well.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
But then, oh, do I get it on PC because it's where I play a lot of stuff

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
and like have really good graphics and all that,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
or do I get it on Switch so I can be portable?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Ah, the struggle.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I don't know what to do.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
All right. Wait for the sales.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Yeah, I guess, I guess. All right, let's move on.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Well, I have some news about Mortal Kombat 11, which I think is pretty neat.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Um, but basically, now we all know what a beautiful thing the original Mortal Kombat movie was.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It was one of the first video game movies done right.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Well, um, the guy who played Shang Tsung, who is, uh,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Kari, uh, Hiroyuki Tagawa, um, is coming into Mortal Kombat 11

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
and lending his likeness to Shang Tsung in the game.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
And he will be the first character to be downloadable content for the game.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
He's also the, uh, guide for the Crypt, Mortal Kombat 11's campaign style mode

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
that gives you challenges and unlockables.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Um, also, um, when he was unveiled, it was our first look at the Crypt

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
at Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo, C2E2.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Um, there actually is a clip of that out and about.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Also, there's a confirmation of a return of Noob Saibot.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And I think in the Noob Saibot clip, there was also Jackie was in there as well.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Oh no, there was Kotal Kahn. There was like a separate, I think a separate thing. But anyway.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
But yeah, but there's some cool stuff. I mean, we're getting some of our little classics back.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Allen always makes it a point. You know Allen really likes Mortal Kombat games, right?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And you all know where I'm at with these.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Where it's like, I love the old Mortal Kombat games with the new ones.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
They're, they're like kind of like ultra violent for me. I don't know. It's a bit much.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I kind of prefer Injustice as far as like the NetherRealm games go.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But, um, Allen makes it a point when they go, when like, oh, look, uh, there's a Noob Saibot Fatality.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
You want to see it? You should see it. Let's see.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And it holds the phone in front of my face. So I have to watch it.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And I'm just like, this is, this is, y'all, y'all.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
You've turned into your mom.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I know I have. It's crazy. But seriously, like, did you see that Noob Saibot Fatality?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
What the hell? That's, who thinks of that?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I don't think I saw it. Ew. Anyway.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
So what was it in graphic detail?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I don't know. He fricking like pulls out the intestines and then like uses that to like go inside the body and then like jump out of the mouth.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Like his hands like go to the mouth and like rips the head. It was disgusting.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And then it's also impossible.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Does he go happy birthday?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
At the end?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I thought you were telling me he was going to rip out.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I'd play that game.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I was thinking you were going to tell me he's taking out the guts and macrame with them.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And so he gets a nice hanging plant.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I like the happy birthday.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I'm still imagining the macrame like with the head is the plant in the middle and have it swinging like in the breeze on a porch.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I want to see like, I don't know if they do this in games.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Sorry, real quick. With these really gross fatalities,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I think it does say something that this guy is still lending his likeness to the game, knowing that it's going to be ripped apart in hideous pieces.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That's that's a strong actor willing to do this as an added bonus.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
What are you talking about?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Maybe he's just like, leave the head intact.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Well, that you can't do that.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Not if you could do a fatality on him anyway.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Oh, I was just saying, you know how they do like the whole like X-ray things when you're like breaking bones and stuff like that.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And it gets really gross and up close.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I want to see them do that for friendships, but like maybe something a little bit differently, you know, baking a cake.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And I don't know what they do. They still leave friendships in.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I feel like Mortal Kombat nine had them.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I don't remember X because I didn't play enough of it because I was like, you know, I just think it'd be funny.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
The parody that probably somebody in shadow probably yell out where the friendship thing is at.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But yeah, when you are bad balladys. Yes.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
They saw the balladys.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I don't know if the balladys have been in the game in a while.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I don't know. I think that's maybe that was in nine to nine was really like a throwback to the classic like Mortal Kombat games.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Those are the last one that I kind of played, to be honest.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I do hope they find a way to work in with the Shang Tsung actor.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I really hope they do find find a way to get him to actually do the your soul is mine.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
That whole thing like for the movies that has to be there.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Like, please tell me they got him to do that.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Like, you know, their little walk ins when they're all bad ass when they walk into the arena.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I really hope he does that. Your soul is mine with the, you know, big eyes and all that, like in the movie.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
So, yeah, the hilarious. So let's see.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Comments and chat as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Jax still hasn't been announced.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
There's still time, right? They didn't announce Jackie was she was hers.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
The one I saw another fatality because, again, Alan makes me watch them all because he's sick.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
There's one where, like, they're putting up fake walls like a laser wall or something.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And like the laser wall is totally splits this guy in half.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And I was like, this is great. I think that was Jackie.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Didn't I steal that like from the first Resident Evil movie or something?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I think, well, but you could also say Resident Evil stole it from Cube.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So hard to say.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Cube was a good movie.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You know what's weird? As much as I hate gore and violence and all that stuff.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I actually thought Cube was a great movie, too.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I really liked Hypercube better, though.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I never saw the sequels. You know that?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Actually, the reason I liked it better is because it does like it.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Hypercube is another word for a tesseract, which is a fourth dimensional cube.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
No, I heard like the sequels get super nerdy with the math.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
The third one is shitty. The third one is absolute shit.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Were there four or three?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
There was Cube, Hypercube and Cube Zero.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So these are like, if you've never heard of these movies like Cube,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
they're like super like cold, like low budget.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The first one was really low budget.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
They were Canadian films.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I thought, well, Nicole DeBoer is in the first one.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I'm almost positive the first one's a Canadian film.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Yeah.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Yeah. And so I think it had a limited release here.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
If anyone doesn't recognize that name, she was Ezri Dax in Deep Space Night.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
She's also like one of the big main characters in it, too.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
But yeah, it was basically these people are put in like this shifting room cube

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and they had to figure out how to find the exit.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But the rooms are shifting.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Cube two is when it's also shifting in time.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Cube would have made a great video game.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I was just thinking that.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I'm surprised they never did that.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I don't think I can eat Indian food anymore.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
It could have been on the GameCube.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And if Cube came out in this day and age, it would be an escape room.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Right.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Because you know how like those those escape rooms are huge and everywhere,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
like cube is an escape.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
That would have been a thing.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But I think the movie's a little old now at this point.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Anyway, everyone should still watch it.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
It's it's a classic.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
See, it's not really that gross either.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
See a Tiberian chat commenting on as I'm talking about Jackie Bridges.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Fatality is asking, when do we get the two to seven crossover?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I want to see Jackie Harry.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I want to see Jackie.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Oh, God.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Just think.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Think one of those actresses from two to seven just won an Oscar.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Think about that for a minute.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Anyway, moving on.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Let's move on.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Dr.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Sue is saying, isn't there already an escape room horror movie?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yes, but I'm talking about the other way around.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Like if Cube was a movie that came out today,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
they do an escape room based on Cube, I think is a good concept.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
That would be crazy, though, because I mean, it's not feasible.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It's true.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I know.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I keep but they should do a game.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I keep seeing commercials on Facebook for a saw themed escape room in Vegas.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
And I'm like, nope, nope.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
The fuck out of there.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Nope.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
The fuck out of that block ad report ad numbers.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
But I definitely was like, I'm not interested in this.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Oh, I'm blocking ads left and right, though.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But still.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
All right.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And I'm going to actually officially say I would put this as a dream game.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
They do a cube video game.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
No, I'll be rad.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I'll be glad.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Pissal Blanca says there is a game based on Cube.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Ugh, what's it called?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
But Pissal Blanca, there certainly wasn't one based on the movie,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
but maybe it's inspired by Cube.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
That I could see.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
There probably is a game out there.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And this is not intelligent Cube either.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
That is very different.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I'm just going to say right now, everyone needs to watch Cube.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And also, one last thing.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Someone recreated the end of Hypercube in Unreal.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Are they on streaming service?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I take that back.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
They did it as a Quake mod.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Is that movie on streaming services and stuff?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm sure it is, but I own, like, old-ass DVDs of them.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Somebody else in Chat has seen it.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Only Sonic in Chat says Cube was cool.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Somebody else knows what we're talking about.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
That's good.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And Tigerclaw found the IMDB, so that's good.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
All right.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Let's move on and talk about some more gaming news,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
because we're running a little long tonight, but that's okay.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
We're having good discussions.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Let's go, Loki.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I was just looking for Cube, the video game.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
They have a game on Steam called Half Dead

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
that people are comparing to Cube,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
because you just survive through rooms of traps,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
so that might be something they'll look up.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Anyways, speaking of Steam, though,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
it's getting an overhaul, especially the libraries.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So they had some screenshots put up

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
and a bunch of information coming out during GDC

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
talking about how they're going to overhaul the Steam library page,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
and yes, it looks amazing.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
They've got basically different sections,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
like, for example, parts.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Not everybody's a fan.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I've been looking on Twitter.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Some people are like, what's this, you know?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I think it looks cool.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I mean, they have different games that have updates recently,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
games you have completed.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Well, that's going to be a very small list for me.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
They should have games I haven't played yet.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
That's going to be all of it.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
But yeah, they've seen...

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It should feature in the library very big.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Here's a game that you paid money for,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
but you still haven't touched.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Feature of the day.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yes.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But basically, they have a carousel of dedicated games and updates.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
They've got different things that show different friends' activities.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:01.000
It almost looks a little bit like the PlayStation events page.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
What do they call that?

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
That social media thing that they have on the PlayStation 4

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
that's like kind of whatever.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
That shows your friends' activities and stuff.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I don't know the branded name of that, though.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
The feed or...

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Yeah, I think it's something like PlayStation feed or something.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Anyways, whatever that is.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
But they're going to have something that shows what your friends are playing,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
the type of stuff.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Yeah, and then they have different events,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
so you can actually see what's coming up,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
like different tournaments and online games.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Like free weekend of DLC or something.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah, let's be honest.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I think Steam could use a little bit of a refresh.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I mean, so I'm down.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Isn't that funny?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Right around this time where we talk a lot about the Epic Game Store

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
and we talk about good old games

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
and we talk about all the competition out,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Humble Bundle and all the competition out there,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
isn't it funny that Steam is suddenly kind of feeling the need to refresh

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and tidy up house a little bit?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
It's funny, though,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
it's like actually looking at the layout that they have

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
kind of reminds me of the Epic Game Store a bit.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
A little bit.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Actually, speaking of game stores, though,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
this came across my Twitter feed this week,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
and I didn't really realize this.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Did you notice Discord's game store is gone?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
It was quietly removed from the app,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
and it's been replaced with a section that focuses on that Nitro thing

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
that they sell.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So not so much the piece by piece game store things,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
but the subscription service, basically.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Oh, yeah, I forgot all about it.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Which is basically a Discord's paid version,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
you know, and that whole thing, right?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Yeah.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Isn't that interesting?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Discord kind of quietly slipped out the back door

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
on all those games things,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
but they, you know, as much as,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
and I still think, and I've said this on the show before,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I think Discord is a pretty brilliant gaming company

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and the way that they got themselves on all your computers

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
and all your mobile phones and all that stuff,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I think it's pretty brilliant what they did,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and I'm kind of surprised to hear that the store has exited as a result,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
but it did come out at kind of like exactly the wrong moment

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
when all of a sudden now Epic Games Store comes in and says,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
oh, no, by the way, the price cut we're given is, you know,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
so it's almost like Discord probably, in a weird way,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
had a problem standing out with that.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So I don't know.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
So anyway, Pixel Pacas also says this is kind of a change here.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
If you have a, and I remember reading about this in the press release too,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Pixel Pacas says if you have a verified Discord server,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
then you can sell your game on the server,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
and so that's pretty clever too because, you know,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
there's all these Discords out there.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
There's obviously a cheap plug for the VOG Network Discord

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
at vognetwork.com slash Discord where we talk about the shows,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and a lot of people drop topics in the OLR chat room,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
and I know for Bobby's chat room too, we use them.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
We absolutely use them on the show,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
and I love some of the discussion that happens on there too

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
because some of the people who can't listen live

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
will kind of go into like a long form kind of feedback,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
and I love reading it.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Even if I don't always respond to it directly,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I just, you know, love that it's there.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
So anyway, cheap plug for our own Discord,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
but game makers all have their own Discord too,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
so wouldn't it be something if like you were to join the Discord for,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
you know, Indie Adventure 11 or whatever game is under development,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
and then when the game's ready to go on sale,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
oh, here's in our Discord because we're a premium.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
You can click right here and get the game right now.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So it's not to say that the store is gone, gone,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
but it's not like a traditional store at this point anymore.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000
So anyway, let's move on.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Let's talk.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Maybe let's not move on for a minute because I need a drink. Sorry.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Oh, Rob.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Well, I did discover that I apparently can't eat Indian food like I used to,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
but I'd be happy to share with anybody else who wants some.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Would you like your sinuses blown wide open?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I got to wait for it. Did you get really spicy?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It's not really spicy, but spicy to me.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I was going to say, can't you not like do spicy?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I can only have like some pepper stuff.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
It's not to where I'm going to need any Benadryl yet.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Okay, gotcha.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
For those who don't know, Jamie has a pepper allergy.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
That's right. All right. Anyway, I'm ready. Sorry.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I've rinsed my mouth with water, and I'm ready to talk again.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Hopefully. Oh, girl. I know. Right.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
All right. Anyway, let's talk about Nintendo's Labo

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000
and the next Labo kit that they've announced, which is Labo VR.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Remember a puppy came back? We could call him Black Labo.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I would love from way back in the day.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
God, what was the last time he was on the show?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I wish puppy would come back.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Ten years ago was probably last time.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Everyone who knows puppy told him to come back.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
You know, he's got like a kid now. That kid's probably like five years old.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
It's perfect time to get his kid introduced to our podcast.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
We got to recruit. We got to recruit still for people.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Get him young.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
We got to recruit for people to co-host the show with Josh and Julian.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Julian. So we still got to get a third host somewhere.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Julian's going to be 12 next month.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Oh, my God. You got to be kidding me. 12?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
12.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
How old was he when he was on the show? Like nine?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
It was a while ago.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
He was like 10.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Was he? All right. Anyway. Anyway, back to Labo.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
The next kit for Nintendo Labo is a VR kit.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And so, of course, a lot of people went, oh, my gosh.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Nintendo is taking on Oculus Rift.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
No, Nintendo is not taking on Oculus Rift.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
This is not playing Breath of the Wild in VR.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
In fact, Nintendo actually has put out a video that's really demonstrated

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
some of the things that they're doing in their Labo VR kit.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And I got to say, it's pretty like the amount, the depth,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
and the amount of stuff they're doing.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
If it's like a mini game collection, there's a lot of freaking mini games in it.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
So like there's a thing where you can build like a blaster

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and there's like a blaster little mini game that you can play.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
But there were some other cool little things, too, like a 3D paint.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So it's not Mario Paint.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I don't know why they didn't brand it Mario Paint.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
That would have been...

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
It looks like an elephant.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
With that elephant thing, that was like the painting thing, though, right?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
That's what's so confusing because it's like an elephant thing.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I also feel like it's a missed opportunity for Mario Paint 3D, but that's all right.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
But I mean, it was like a neat concept.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
You know, just the idea of like painting in the 3D space.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Anyway, so here it is. Here it is.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Really, the VR is like a plastic goggle thing that just goes on top of your Switch.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And it's never going to be like the Oculus.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
It isn't strapped to your head.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
There's no strap to keep it there, but you have to hold it to your head.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I get why they're doing that, because they can do the math with the two controllers

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000
with the angles and stuff, since it can tell, based on the angles of the two controllers,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
where it is in 3D space, because there's no real way to track it.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
But it's still weird.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I'm looking in chat over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
and I see they're talking a little bit about some of the...

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Okay, so Bobby says, I can explain the elephant.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
It's using infrared stickers to mimic 6DOF controllers,

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
like the Vive controllers or Oculus Touch controllers.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
The infrared stickers are on the headset of the elephant.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I mean, it's cool, but it's also the way we expected Nintendo to get into VR in some ways.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Although, I've got to say, because there's a whole video.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
There's a 10-minute video you can watch out there about LaboVR,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
and you can see all the things, because they show all these different experiences,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
and then they go, and there's 64 more that are just for the goggles.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And it's like, jeez.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
They're not all full-featured games.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Some of them are just like, look in this fish thing.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But you've got to wonder, did Nintendo start to go down this path of VR,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
and these were all the concept things they built,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and then they were like, eh, maybe not.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And so they repackaged it into this, because you know Nintendo is never going to be one

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
to throw something away completely, right?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.000
They're going to repackage it, just like the Wii U, the Miyamoto experience,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
they repackaged it into a Star Fox spin-off, right? Remember that?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Yeah, I know. You're Project Guard.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah. They ended up making a Star Fox spin-off out of it.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
So it's like, you almost wonder, was this all made originally with Labo in mind,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
or was this kind of like the whole, this is what we're going to do with it?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I don't know. It's kind of interesting to think about where Nintendo's brain might have been with this.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
But that all being said, I think it'll do pretty good.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I think it'll be the type of thing, even though it's out kind of early,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I think especially for that younger audience.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I don't know if you, me, Jamie, I don't know if we would be at the start of the line to get this sort of thing,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000
but I think for the younger kids, the teens and the tweens, this is going to be right up their alley.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
If I was 12 and gaming right now, I'd fucking want this. You know what I mean?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Yeah.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
But don't be under seven years old, because there's all sorts of health warnings.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Put all that aside, like this is pretty, and it's, you know,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
what you learn from the experience of building it and all that stuff as well is an important part of it.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Yeah, the thing that sucks is, I bet this would be pretty hard to stream this.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Bobby in chat says, I'm at the start of the line getting it.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Yeah, but you're a VR enthusiast and it's a little different. It's to be expected.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.000
So I think it's, I think it's a logical step for how Nintendo goes into the VR.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
They can kind of put one foot in the pool and be like, okay, that was nice.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And then go back to do with what they were doing.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Well, who remembers a particular game where you took, holy crap, did I just lose?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I lost my story.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I don't remember a game where you took a holy crap.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
That was in.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
There was, try not to, was it?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Don't shit your pants.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Don't shit your pants. I remember that.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Anyway, um, where you took a manual, you dipped it in water or a letter,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000
and you would get a code on it that you would put in after you submerged your submarine.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Although, in retrospect, I wonder how they would have gotten it out,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
gotten the letter out of the submarine in the game to then get it back to get the code,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
because that would depressurize the submarine and everyone would die.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
But I'm talking about Star Tropics.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I was like, you are going to tell the kids the Children's Z is what game we're talking about, right?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Okay, yes, Star Tropics.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Well, Star Tropics is going to be on the Switch, but guess what is missing?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
The letter.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Yeah.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
That has the thing.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It didn't work out well for me when I was, you know, when I originally got this game,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
because I bought it used a long time ago and it didn't have the letter.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I had to call it 800 numbers.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Well, some people think that's why Nintendo did this, because y'all probably wouldn't remember,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000
but back in the day, back in my day, when these video game rentals,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
game companies were really pissed about video game rentals,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
because they're like, it's preventing people from dropping money on the game.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
They beat the games. They never buy it.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And they don't get to see those returns on the rentals.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
So the gaming industry hated the rental.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
They probably still do, but it's probably just not as big of a deal as it used to be.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Now they have, you know, licensing deals with rental companies.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
That's true.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Some say that DLC online pass, the EA did. Remember that?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
That was the used game market and all that.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
But anyway, this was Nintendo's way of kind of combating that.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Back in the day, it was like, oh, you don't get past a certain point without a special code

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
that's only with new copies of the game.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Yeah.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000
But at any rate, the manual is not going to be there.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Nobody said anything about the manual being there. It's not there.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Of course, we do have the internet today.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
They're just at the same time, Nintendo themselves aren't really...

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
They're not providing the code.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Well, I'm really surprised they didn't just put it in the description.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Like, there's little descriptions.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Well, they had, in the Wii U version, they had the whole manual, like the digital manuals,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
and you could actually, it did a little animation where it dips it in the water and all that,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
but why couldn't they just port that over?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Because they...

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Reasons.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
It's not like they're...

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Because they half-assed it, is what they did.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Well...

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And spoiler, the code is 747.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Yes, if you need it, the code is 747, like an airplane, 747.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Even though you're in a submarine.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Yes.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
So, whatever.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
But you'd think they would just put that in the description or something.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
This is weird.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Anyway, the point in the game is when Babu, who is the uncle's assistant,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
is possessed and says,

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Evil aliens from a distant planet, tell my nephew to use code 1776.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Tell Mike to dip my letter in water.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
You know, StarTropics was a really unique kind of game.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
If you haven't played StarTropics, you really should.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It was lateness.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It was lateness.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Well, you know what's funny?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
The Super Famicom had already been out in Japan for a few weeks when this game released.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I think StarTropics was too late for me.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I think I moved on to the Super Nintendo by then.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I think people did, but some people forget.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Did you guys remember? There was a StarTropics 2.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Zoda's Revenge.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Zoda's Revenge, yeah.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
And you want to talk about a game, because Zoda's Revenge, if I'm not mistaken,

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
was the next to last NES game, the last being Warriors Woods,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
that Nintendo did, period, for the NES.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Like, Zoda's Revenge was next to last.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
That was very late in the cycle.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000
But if you haven't played the original StarTropics, it's a good, it's neat.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Yeah, I've actually beaten that game.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
It mixes elements of, like, Zelda.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Here's the other fascinating thing, though, you might not have known about that game.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Because, you know, on the Switch Online right now,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
we got StarTropics and Kid Icarus, right?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And then, over in Japan, they got Kid Icarus,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
and they got their special Japanese-only game.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I don't remember if this was the month that the Sumo Wrestling game came out.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
But they got some Japanese-only thing that was never here.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
But they didn't get StarTropics in Japan.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
They got Fire Emblem, which we never got here, right?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Why didn't Japan get StarTropics?

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It was never released in Japan.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Even though StarTropics was developed in Japan,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
it was this rare product of a company that said,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
we're going to develop a game here for the audience over here in the States.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And so, StarTropics was developed in Japan for an American audience.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And that's why that game is kind of interesting.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And UK. I believe the first StarTropics was in the UK.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I don't think the sequel ever was.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I think Zelda's Revenge, and I think I maybe played Zelda's Revenge once,

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
but I don't remember it.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I want to say, Zelda's Revenge tried to teach you history or something.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
It had a lot of historical stuff that was kind of built into it.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
It was learning. I don't want to do any of that.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Which is why it didn't sell.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So, anyway.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Murica.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Yeah.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
S2100 Matt in chat says,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I think Rob needs to do a stream playing StarTropics.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Be careful what you ask for.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Bob Coffee brings up Like Secret of Evermore.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Close.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Secret of Evermore, remember, there was a Square USA for a hot minute.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I think it was in the Seattle area, right?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
So, there was a Square USA for a hot minute,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
and Secret of Evermore was like the game that they produced.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So, it was still like a Japanese company,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
but with a US office.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
This was years before they ever had like Eidos or things like that,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
you know, and that whole thing.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
So, a little bit different, but like,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I see where you're going with that.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Which, then the interesting thing about Secret of Evermore is that was,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
oh God, what's that composer?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Sulay? Jeremy?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Is that his name?

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Who did Skyrim and Oblivion.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Does all the Guild Wars.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
He does a lot of great soundtracks.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
That was like, he was probably a young guy when he did that.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Yeah, Jeremy Sulay.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Thank you.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Okay, I knew it was like, yeah, he was on Secret of Evermore.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Random.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Go Fig.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Weird ass fact, but yeah.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So, it was developed here in America.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
It was the first game that brought us that guy

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
who still does a lot of these, you know,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
everybody knows the Skyrim stuff, right?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Dovahkin. Dovahkin. Dovahkin.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Right, that whole thing, right?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
So, that was his first game.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
So, there you go.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Anyway, actdeftinchat says,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
here, there, everywhere, indeed.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
All right.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And we are going here, here, there, everywhere.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Let's go to another story from Loki.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
All right.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
So, this is pretty awesome.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So, they announced, they were showing this off at GDC.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I want to say that this was a Kickstarter one time,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000
but this device called the NES, the NES Maker.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
So, you know, you may have your Mario Makers and stuff,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
but this actually makes NES games.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Mentos, the NES Maker.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
And it's coming from, what was it?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
It's coming from the 8-bit, or,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
what was it, the group that did the 8-bit Heroes film,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
in which they made a game called Mystic Searches,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
which is an NES game.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And so, they released, basically, their tool set

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
to make these games.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
And so, it is, it's very much,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
you can make stuff without any programming.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
You can make your own NES cartridges

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
and actually play them on an NES,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
which is pretty awesome.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
So, if this is something you're interested in,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000
you check it out at www.thenew8bitheroes.com,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and they sell, you can download the software,

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
you have to buy the activation code for it,

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and then they also sell the flashers and stuff.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Plus, there's dozens of tutorials on how to do everything.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
This is hot.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I'm into this now.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Loki, you're the one that, like, tries to make games.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
You don't ever finish, but, you know,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
it's a long-running joke here on the show.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Surely, this looks up your alley.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Are you gonna try to make a game in NES Maker?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
It looks interesting.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I'd be interested to see what it can do.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
But, yeah, I mean, it looks pretty cool.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I don't have an NES to play games on, so, I don't know.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I have three.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I mean, I could play them in an emulator.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I know so many people just do emulator these days.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Well, I was gonna say you could probably borrow a NES.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Throw it on my NES, or Super NES Classic.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Could I take the ROM that I make in NES Maker,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
burn it to a Dreamcast disc with the NES emulator on Dreamcast,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and play my NES Maker game on the Dreamcast?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Probably.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yes.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Fuck yeah, how meta.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And then you could also, like, you know,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
put it on the SNES Classic or an NES Classic.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You can flash it to those.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Oh, an NES Classic, but it's all games I made up.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
That'd be cool.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I like that.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It's very cool.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
We'll call it the Rob ES.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Anyway, some comments in our...

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
The Rob Entertainment System.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Some comments, not to be confused with the robot, right?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Some comments in our Twitch over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Again, where we do tape live on Sunday nights.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Bobby Blackwell says,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
If you can't finish a game in Unity,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
you won't be able to finish a game in NES Maker.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I call shade.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Although, he's right.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
It is true.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
It is more...

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
That's a lie.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I don't find it.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
It is true.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I mean, it is, um, it is more restricting to build something in it for an NES cartridge

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
because they have a lot of limitations there.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
True.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Because if it's going to run on the actual system, they can't just like...

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Yeah.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
You have to file these sizes and you have to make sure your sprites are all small enough

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
and compact enough.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And yeah, so there's a lot of limitations.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
You're only using so many colors in the palette at a time.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Right.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And your sprite palette only has...

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
The RAM only has so much to load.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Exactly.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Exactly.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Yeah, it is a challenge.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
You have to have a...

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
You probably have to have a bigger brain to develop for NES.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Is that what you're saying?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
No.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
You need to be a little smarter.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
You need to be a little smarter.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
A lot more planning, I think.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I'm just being an asshole.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I'm just kidding.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
That's what I was doing this week, by the way.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Which I haven't been playing any games because I'm fucking playing with Unity, okay?

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
So that's why I haven't been playing games.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Am I going to talk about what I'm working on?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
No.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
No, because many of you people care about that crap.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Just give me a hard time forever so the hell with you.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
People watching this stream cannot see how red the two of you both are right now.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It might be able to see a little bit.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Me from laughing, him from being angry.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
So is Loki...

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
You look more amused.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Are we saying, Loki?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Are we saying, Loki, that you're not going to be talking about Unity Develop anymore

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
because you're sick of all these jokes.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
You're sick about people joking.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
You never finish a thing.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And you're just going to come on here one day and you're going to say,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I fucking released a game.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Mic drop.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
We don't want to drop the mics.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
They might break them.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Drop it on the couch.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Drop it on the couch.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Put it on Pikachu's little pillow there.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Drop it on Pikachu.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
He'll hold it for you.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
There you go.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
There we go.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Let's drop it on Pikachu.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
We got to think about the mics.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
All right.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Okay, so Loki's new plan is to catch you all off.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It's Beyonce.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
He's going to do the Beyonce.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
He's going to be...

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Because now Beyonce is a verb ever since what she did in the music industry.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
He's going to Beyonce his game on us all someday.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
So we will eagerly await it.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
this is why game developers aren't as open with gamers.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Now you're learning this firsthand.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Eh, whatever.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
All right.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about Final Fantasy Fan Fest in Japan.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
So you guys know I'm a fan of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I've played that game quite a bit.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
And the new expansion, I went to this in Las Vegas and they announced in Japan,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
they had their kind of like final Fan Fest because they did one in Paris as well a couple months ago.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
So this one that they did in Japan was kind of the last one that's going to be leading into this expansion,

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Shadowbringers, which is going to be coming out pre-play, I think it's June 28th.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000
So for those that pre-order, you can play on June 28th.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And so they announced a brand new class that's going to be playable in the game.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So we know that we already had Gunbreaker was going to be the first class, a new tank.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And the other job that they have unveiled is Dancer.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
That's right. You can live out your Mog fantasies and be a Dancer.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Interesting though, a lot of people predicted the Dancer would be another healer,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
but Dancer turns out to be a ranged DPS.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Although they're saying that Dancer will be able to do certain buffs that will have an effect on your party,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
which is interesting because we kind of thought that's what Bard's going to do.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Bard does have some limited things, but it's like shared with Machinists.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000
But anyway, they have talked about a battle system complete redesign anyway.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000
So we'll probably hear about exactly how that's going to work in a couple months in May or so forth.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
They announced some new areas for the expansion.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:14.000
They announced that the new raid, not the one, the 24-man that's the partnership with the folks behind Nier

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
and that whole thing. They talked about that in Paris.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000
But the new raid here is called Eden, and it actually is going to have characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
from Kingdom Hearts and all that, so that's got a lot of people's attention for sure.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And then they announced, because a lot of people have been looking forward to,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000
they announced the Viera in Paris, so the Viera from Fran from Final Fantasy XII.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
They're going to be in Final Fantasy XIV, but when they showed it off in Paris,

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000
there was nothing but female Viera and characters that kind of look like Fran, right?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:52.000
And so a lot of people were kind of waiting, oh, they're going to show off the male Viera in Tokyo.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Well, guess what? They dropped the bombshell. There are no male Viera.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
There are going to be instead the Hrothgar, which is a class that,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
and I'm not going to get too far into the Final Fantasy lore, but basically this whole next expansion

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.000
is going to take place in another realm where every race has a mirror race.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And the mirror race for Hrothgar is the Ronso, which if you guys remember Final Fantasy X, Kilmari.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So Hrothgars are basically Kilmari from Final Fantasy X, but Hrothgars are male only.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:34.000
So you cannot be a female Hrothgar, even though female Ronso's were present in Final Fantasy X.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:43.000
And I got to be honest, when I kind of saw the footage of the Hrothgars, I was like, this looks a little rushed.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I got the feeling watching this, they made this decision, especially when you look at the words,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
when they talked about in Las Vegas, we were there about how Viera would be the last race.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
They're not going to do another race. And then in Tokyo, they say, I know we said Viera was going to be the last race.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:08.000
We're actually going to do one other race because I have this feeling that in these few months between Vegas and Tokyo,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:14.000
they made the decision to flip out. And I know there was leaks back and forth. I've heard all that crap.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
But I think somewhere in there, they made the decision they're not doing male Viera for whatever reason.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
And I think it's a shit decision.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
They're like the Gerudo then.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I think it's a shit decision.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
They have one male every hundred years and then he turns out to be Ganon.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Do they have male Mithras in this game?

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Yes, they do.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Here's. Yeah. There's that pretty the pretty boy with the neck tattoo.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
So here's here's the whole thing.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.000
When they originally went from Final Fantasy 14, so 11 had gender locked races, right?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000
So the equivalent of the Roga and the Galca in Final Fantasy 11 were males only and the Mithra,

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
which are the Makoto and 14, were female only.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And because 14 was a lazy ass fuck copy paste of 11 in many ways, they kept it the same.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000
14 1.0 what they did, they did, which was a terrible game. They did a lot of the same.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000
So when they made Final Fantasy 14 2.0 or Realm Reborn, they were like,

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
why would we gender lock these things? Let's just open it up.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Let's do. And they did male Makoto and they did female Rogan and it's worked.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
So when they announced Viera, a lot of people got really excited about.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Oh, well, Final Fantasy 14 has been like super progressive on a lot of this, like genders.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
They listen to their player base and they made the glamour and the bunny stuff you can put on male or female.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.000
And Final Fantasy 14 is infamous for the sublegar, right, which is dudes not wearing pants.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Look it up. Dudes and females not wearing pants.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
11 as well.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
But basically in Final Fantasy.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
11 had that too.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000
It did. But basically in Final Fantasy 14, not only do the women look like hoes, but so do the men.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
And that's what a lot of people love about the game.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So it's really fucking weird and off-putting to suddenly hear the development team go,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:06.000
we just, you know, male Vieras, we just, it just felt weird.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
So we're doing this instead.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:14.000
What? What? You just, but, but everything you did in 2.0.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And you better believe people are pissed.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And you know who's pissed?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
A lot of women.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000
A lot of women out there on Twitter and so are pissed because they were looking forward to playing their bunny boys.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And to be fair, why shouldn't they get to play the sexualized male class or whatever?

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Even though the kitty boys are kind of sexualized as well.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And honestly, I've got to admit, I was really fucking looking forward to playing a bunny boy.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I really wanted to see how they were going to do it.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And I just think the fact that they're now gender locking in 5.0,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000
when they realized that that was a bad decision in 2.0 is fucking, period, ridiculous, period.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Do you have a comment or sorry?

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Just something, a little bit of history thing that I just had to check because I was really curious to see if it was a real thing and it was,

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
or what the real thing was called.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Subligar was actually called the subligaculum, which basically means little binding underneath.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Exactly.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I knew what sub, what some of it meant, but I had to look up the rest of it.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
That's what a drag queen uses as their trick too.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Tucking panties.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Yes.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
But in this case, it was actually the dress of gladiators, athletes, and actors on stage in Rome.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And it was a precursor to the bikini.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Well, it makes sense because that's how you make sure you're not sewing a moose knuckle when you're on stage.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
If you're wearing, you know, a dancing thing.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
That's why they have like a dance belt, right?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
So that it makes it look a little more Kendall.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
All right.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Now that our viewers have seen and listeners have heard much more than they want.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Anyway, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Anyway, just saying it was the precursor to the bikini.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Yeah, no, I know.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Thanks, Rome.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So anyway.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I have to throw some education in this shit.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000
So I'm just, I think it's, I don't think these Hrothgar look very good at all.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And I think there's a lot of question marks in the way this news was delivered.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
There's a lot of fan art out there about male Veras that look great.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I don't understand why Square can't fucking figure it out.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
But I kind of think they need to figure it out.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I think they're like, it's 2019.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Like, just figure it out.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Give us the boy bunnies, dammit.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And honestly, I got to admit, as much as I enjoy Final Fantasy XIV,

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000
like, I do feel like a lot of the announcements we're getting is like,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
here's the new eight man raid.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Here's the new 24 man raid.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Here's the new dungeon.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Here's all the cookie cutters for this expansion

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
that are just like the ones in the last expansion.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And we haven't heard enough about what's really, like, game changing.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I'm going back to WoW.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
For real.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And I don't think that game's perfect.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I think I get why people are mad at WoW, too,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
because I think a lot of the lore, the lore in this new expansion is straight up bad.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Like, what they did to Sylvanas, it's dumb.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
It's just dumb.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I've been still working on the previous Illidan stuff just because it's more

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Demon Space Elf Husband Boyfriend.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000
But like this new, I'm sorry, the new expansion, the lore is bad.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Anyway.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000
But I will say, when I log into WoW, I don't feel like a shortage of things to do.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Like, I'm like, I could go, and the way you can gear up and feel progression in World of Warcraft,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
and granted, they've had like eight expansions to perfect this.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Final Fantasy is on what, their fourth?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
But you can go do a world quest, or you can go run mythic dungeons,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
or you can raid if you want,

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
or you can do PvP, or, and I feel like there's just like more things to kind of do

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000
to feel a sense of progression in World of Warcraft than maybe in Final Fantasy XIV.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Like, I feel like, even though Final Fantasy XIV, like, especially the expansions have had a great story,

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I feel like kind of like once you beat that story, it's like,

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
well, why do I keep paying my monthly fee?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And when I think one of the biggest criticisms about Final Fantasy XIV is that people are like,

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I'd love to play it, I'd love to experience the story, but bummer about that monthly fee,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
because I ain't going to play it because of that monthly fee.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I kind of think Final Fantasy XIV really is at a point in its growth,

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
they need to really justify that monthly fee.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Sure, it's got a great story, you've justified the cost of buying the expansion,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
now justify that monthly fee.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
And I say that as a long time supporter of Final Fantasy XIV,

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000
but I kind of feel like there's been a lot of decisions made at Square Enix

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
that are very much like, we exist in this bubble, and we're going to make this decision

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
just because we think it's best.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
They need, like, accounts.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I mean, they've been pretty good about listing their player base,

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
and I hope they do it on this male VR thing too, anyway.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Anyway, I've talked long enough, sorry.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Sia Tabiri says, ugh, this bikini talk reminds me that I need to finish catching up on the Ace Attorney anime.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Garth the Wolf in chat says, I keep thinking of resubbing to XIV,

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
but also got to justify if that fee is worth the time I'm going to spend on it.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I would say it's super worth it for that month you're going to spend to beat the story,

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
but I'm kind of overrating.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I don't really do it anymore. I don't do it in WoW, I don't do it in Final Fantasy XIV.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I'm kind of over that part of it.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Dungeons are okay because you need far less people to do those,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
but I'm not interested, and again, you game how you want to game,

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
and I've been a raider in the past, and there's a lot of joy in it,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000
but for me, I just don't want to sit there for two hours learning a fight anymore.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
You know what I mean?

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I like having my DBM.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Oh, the Deadly Boss mods?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Yeah.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Yeah, but even then, even with that, you still, when you rage, you got to know.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
But it's still not hard to learn.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
No.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I watch one YouTube video, do one practice run, and I usually have it a third time.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, did they implement the NPC helpers for Dungeons?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
So that's the big thing in this next expansion.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
So instead of endgame content,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.000
trusts are the brand new thing in this expansion where they are making a shift.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
So to be fair to Square Enix, they are kind of listening to feedback

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
where people don't really want to play an MMO as a multiplayer game,

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
which I get it.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
So they are implementing that as this new expansion.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
So you will be able to beat the Shadowbringers story with just yourself

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.000
and with a little help from your NPC friends instead of your IRL friends.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
And so for those that are a little more nervous about tanking and things like that,

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
which I don't like to tank either,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
it'll be a lot easier because you won't be worrying about,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
oh, I'm going to get other people killed.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
It's just, oh, I'm getting these NPCs killed.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
And they're expendable.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Yes, they are expendable, which is like in Skyrim.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Hooray, I have Lydia.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Oh, Lydia died, right?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
All right, anyway.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Or they just disappear sometimes.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
She'll disappear and then all of a sudden she'll come back and be like,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
oh, where the hell did you come from?

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
All right, let's go back to a time when games were a little simpler

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
and we had to just put trust in the development of the game.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
It was going to be a good game, but there weren't NPCs following you around,

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
especially not in this game.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Well, maybe, I guess there were, but maybe a little bit in this game.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
But anyway, it's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
What is the classic game of the week that you picked for us this week?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I went into Namco Land and did Winning Run.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Winning Run is a first-person Formula One racing game.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:33.000
It was released in 1998 in Japan and in 1989 January in the European Union.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Well, actually, that didn't exist back then, so in Europe.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And it was the first game to run on the 3D Namco System 21 polygonizer hardware.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Music was composed by Kawada Hiroyuki, who had also worked on Galaga 88.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And since you mentioned music, it's going to shift here.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
We're going to play some stuff from the soundtrack

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
because the ambient noise of the game is just kind of...

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Pretty much.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Yeah, so we switched it out for the actual soundtrack here in the video.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
At any rate, development for this game actually began over three years

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
before the game's release when they were developing the hardware.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Now, I'm sure people are familiar with Namco System 21,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
but just to go ahead and tell you what else came on it was

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Winning Run, Winning Run Suzuka Grand Prix, Galaxian 3rd.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I never want to call it 3 because it's got the cube, so Galaxian Cube.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Driver's Eyes, Winning Run 91, Starblades, Solavu,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Air Combat, Cybersled, and Attack of the Zul'gir.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
So, some pretty big names came out on that.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:48.000
But anyway, this was the first 3D game that Namco had released on that system.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
It was the first game on that system.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
It was also considered a milestone in 3D polygon graphics.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
It pushed 60,000 polygons per second,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.000
and it used the shapes basically as the building box for the structures within the game.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.000
It's basically in one of those little sit-down cabinets

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
like most of the other Namco racing games at the time.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
And you had two game modes.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
You had an easy drive with an automatic transition and slower gameplay,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
or a technical drive that was manual transmission with faster gameplay.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:27.000
It also featured a Dunlop style tire bridge over the track with the text of Namco on it.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And, you know, it had many musical things in common with Final Lap.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
It also had a rear view mirror so you could see what was behind you.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
And of course it had two sequels, like I mentioned.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Winning Run, Suzuka Grand Prix, and Winning Run 91.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Driver's Eyes, also that was on the same hardware,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:52.000
was a three-monitor game that was considered in the family but not a true sequel.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000
At any rate, it was a really, really successful game too.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Famicon Tsushin, which was the arcade earnings chart,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:08.000
had it hit number one in August of 1989, so that was almost a year later.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
The first game that overtook it was actually Super Monaco GP,

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
so another thing at the same time.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
At any rate, it was also super well received in Europe.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
It got really great reviews.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000
And then, I mean, really it just got so many raves over,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000
especially since it did push early 3D back in the day.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I'm trying to find what other releases came out.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
It doesn't have it all listed together.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.000
But it actually did get a mention in Commodore User back in the day

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
when it was starting to come out in the UK.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
And basically most of the...

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Yeah, it doesn't look like it ever got any kind of home release from what I can see.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.000
This definitely looks like a game of an era when hard drive-in...

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
You know those very polygon-heavy, creating 3D experiences of these huge polygons?

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I mean, those of you that are kind of watching it on Twitch with us

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
are probably like, boy, this definitely looks dated,

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
but this is definitely a product of its time.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000
There were a lot of similar games, and the consoles couldn't frickin' do it.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
They did an NES or SNES version of stunt drive-in or one of those.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It was kind of terrible.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Well, yeah. But now look at just the playthrough here, right?

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
And just see the general layout and how things are lined up.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Tell me of another Namco game that this makes you think of.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
When I saw the map, I thought Pole Position.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I know that's Atari. But then, of course, obviously the logical step would be Ridge Racer.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Exactly. A lot of the track layout and elements...

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I firmly believe Ridge Racer would have been a nod back to this one.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Even though this one's still a Formula One-style game,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
it has so much in common with it.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000
It even looks like it flows like Ridge Racer does.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I wouldn't doubt that they looked at this game

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
to bring it into the modern era to make it Ridge Racer.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.000
By the way, I'm out of footage, so I've got to come back to us to the studio.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
That's all I have, anyway.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Well, there it is. Your classic game of the week. Winning run.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
It was neat because, again, even though it's definitely...

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I think that's an important racing game because without that game,

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
you probably wouldn't have what you have today with Ridge Racer.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000
When was the last time they did a Ridge Racer game? It's been a while.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Wasn't it R7?

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000
No, they had the one for the Vita, and then they did one for PC and consoles.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
But it wasn't really the Ridge Racer team.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000
It was the guys at Bugbearer, I think, that did those games.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Actually, Dr. Suya in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
actually, pole position was Namco in Japan.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.000
So when I called out that track, maybe pole position led to this in some ways.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
It's indeed possible.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
I actually will tell you what my inspiration for picking Winning 11 was.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
You mean Winning Run?

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Winning Run, sorry.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Winning 11 is a different game, yes.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000
One of the YouTube channels I like to watch, Retro Core, does Battle of the Ports.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
And I was watching the pole position Battle of the Ports.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And I was like, I know Namco did another game that we never got over here,

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
so it sort of sent me down that rabbit hole.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000
And it was Winning Run, so I was like, that's what inspired me to do it.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
And if you guys have never watched Retro Core's stuff,

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I mean, he's funny and some of his assessments are not at all right

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
and his grammar is terrible.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
I'm not judging because, I mean, seriously.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000
But anyway, go definitely watch his videos because they are top notch.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.000
All right.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Classic Game of the Week is Winning Run.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Good pick.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
That was a very educational pick this week because, again,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
I think that's a game that a lot of people have heard of.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Well, I know a game a lot of you guys have been hearing about this week

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
is Blaster Master Zero 2, thanks to the Nindies.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
So we're going to take a moment here to go to a prerecorded bit here

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
from earlier today with me.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Okay. Hello, everybody.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I thought for our prerecorded segment this week,

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
we could take a look at the just released Blaster Master Zero Part 2,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
which I'm sure at this point we've talked about earlier in the show

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
as it was kind of that surprise announcement

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
during Nintendo's presentation this week during their Nindies event

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000
that this Blaster Master Zero Part 2 was available today.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
And certainly, you know, for fans of the first Blaster Master game,

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000
it probably left folks feeling like, oh, well,

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
the first Blaster Master was a reimagining of, obviously,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
that first Blaster Master game from the NES so long ago.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Where are they going to go with the sequel?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Because, yes, I think many of us know that the original Blaster Master

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000
had sequels on the Genesis and what there was that Wii game

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
that was a reimagining a while ago.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I think there was one on the Game Boy as well.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
But let's be real, none of those were particularly good.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So I think it kind of left this Blaster Master,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
and I'm going back into the opening sequence here,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
where it kind of sets the tone for the game while I'm talking,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
it kind of leaves Blaster Master Zero Part 2

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
to do something a little bit more original.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
So if you actually kind of watch this opening sequence

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
where it's basically recapping the events of the first game,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
you learn that Jason, you know, obviously the frog jumped in

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
and got lost, which I think many classic game fans know

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
is the plot of the original Blaster Master games.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
But something new that they kind of introduced in Blaster Master Zero

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
when they did the reimagining of the Switch

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
is that there was this other character, Eve,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
which is funny because Eve was one of the characters

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
that was actually in that Blaster Master book

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:34.000
when you had those like Worlds of Power books by FX9 some time ago.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
So it was kind of interesting because that ended up being

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
like a canon thing due to Blaster Master Zero.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Anyway, it's kind of funky how the whole thing works.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
But the plot and the setup for this new, I guess, original story

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
that Inti Creates is making with Blaster Master Zero Part 2

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
is that Eve got infected with a parasite.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Yes, she became Parasite Eve.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
And so she got infected with a parasite,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
so they're going to go to Eve's homeworld, Sophia,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
to find the cure, I guess, for this plague.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
So that's where this game sets up here.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
So we're looking at the menu,

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
and if you kind of look at the how to play section,

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
and actually this is my very first time looking at it.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I didn't really prep this in advance.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I just thought, oh, I'll just kind of do a quick little playthrough

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
since we don't want to spend a whole lot of time during the show,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
but give ourselves a little break in studio.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
We can kind of look at kind of generally what this game looks like

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
and how it works.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
And you can even look at from this how to play menu

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000
is that you have a lot of the same features

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
that you're kind of used to in Blaster Master.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000
It doesn't look like they invented a lot of original things,

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
except I'm not sure what it's trying to say

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
with one of these screens here where you can see that the,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
and again, I know there's folks listening on the podcast,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
you can't see these screens,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
but there's one where the vehicle is falling

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
all the way down to the bottom,

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
and it's got some type of like,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I don't know if that's supposed to be like a climb or a move

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
or something.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I'm just not connecting to a special move from the first game.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Maybe somebody in chat is probably yelling it out right now.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
But it also looks like they may have changed the top down view a bit,

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.000
that portion of the game.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
That's what it looks like in the second menu

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
is that it looks like it's more of like a slanted view.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
So I'm excited to try to at least in this little segment here

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
get to one of those sections

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
because I want to see if that looks any different

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
because this how to play definitely makes it look like

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.000
it might be a little bit different.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
So let's get to it.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
I'm going to jump into the game

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
and just kind of see where it throws us off here.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
So like the first game you have several different save slots

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
and I wonder if they aren't going to be planning to expand it

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
with DLC later on

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
like they did the original Blaster Master Zero

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
is that you can play with all these other characters

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
that weren't really connected to Blaster Master,

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.000
but it was kind of neat to see them in the game anyway.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
So all right, here we are.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
So we're going to a new planet

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
and the original cutscenes kind of set that up that we saw earlier.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
So now we have Jason saying it was close.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
We touched down right before our energy ran out.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Eve is the Gaia system holding up

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
and you can see if you're looking on the Twitch stream

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
you can kind of see Eve's got that little

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000
she looks sick.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
She looks like she might be part zombie there.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
So that's part of the story here.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
So yes, things are converted

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
and I'm sure it's probably setting things up here

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
to be like, oh, but the thing is powerless.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
You're going to have to find all the features

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:11.000
that's a true landmark of any Metroidvania game

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
and you're going to have to go around and find everything.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
So, all right.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So it should allow for limitless planet exploration.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
So I guess when you fall, you get SP

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
and maybe that's what that how to play thing

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
was saying earlier.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I'm not sure.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I see no more hover functions.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
So you're going to have to kind of find that.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000
So, yeah.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
So as the dialogue is going on,

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
we're kind of learning about that.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Oh, the car is a little broken, but that makes sense.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.000
You know, you got to start over since it is a new game.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So hopefully we'll get through these cut scenes here.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
All right. There we go.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Now I can play.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
So, yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
This feels very similar to the first game

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
where you can drive around in the car right now.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
You can it looks like immediately right away

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
fire through bricks, which was a power up in the older games.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So kind of interesting.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
They give you that feature right off the bat

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
and it looks like there might be some

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:06.000
you can see some things on the screen,

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
but they're a little high up.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So I can't get them yet.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
So it's one of those classic.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
You got to come all the way back to the beginning

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
probably to get those lists.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
There's something I'm not thinking of,

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
which that very, very possibly could be the case.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
So now they're kind of setting up some of the story that

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
there are, in fact, aliens on this planet, too,

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
that are bad and you're going to have to kill those.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.000
So there's it's talking about the SP conversion still.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.000
And basically, that's how you power your special attacks,

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
it sounds like.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
So it sounds like that could be an interesting

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000
kind of limited feature.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
So it said, oh, yeah, look at that.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
When I fell a long way, bam, it converted.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000
That's kind of an interesting little feature.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I want to see how that plays out.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Now, how do I?

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Oh, there we go.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Okay, so you can actually choose by holding the L button

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
what it is you want to fire.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I don't know if you use the L button to fire.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Ah, no, it's the A button.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Gotcha.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Okay, so I just killed a little crab

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
and I had to hit him with the missiles first

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
and then kind of attack him.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
So I bet if I fall from the...

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Oh, that's an interesting way to recover special units

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
is to have to fall from a distance to do that.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Hmm, kind of interesting.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
All right, so now there's...

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Okay, let's see if we can...

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
So you have to really time this right

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
to hit him with the missiles and then fire at him.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
All right, let's see.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Obviously, I can't spend too long looking at this game

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
because I know we're going to want to get back to the show

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
before too long, but I want to see if I can get to one of those

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
top-down sequences to see how that plays.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So hopefully there's one of them before too long.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
All right, there's a save spot.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
We know those.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000
So that saves the game.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Aha, there's one of those little doors.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.000
So we will have to go hop in there.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
And they're saying that with the dialogue as well.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
And how convenient.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Eve can't leave and go with you to help fight.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
She's stuck in the car because of her sickness.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.000
That's what they're kind of saying there in the dialogue there.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
All right, let's see.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I get through lots of dialogue, lots of press an A.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
All right, ribbit, ribbit.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Okay, let's see.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Here we go.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
So I'm making our way down to this little.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Okay, so there's a ladder here, but it's one that we're going to have to exit.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
But this also means now Jason can't really fall a great distance.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Ooh, there we go.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I had to kneel down there because I got hit with a bullet.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Oh, tricky.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I lost a little bit of health doing that, but I made it to the door.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
So now he can see the top-down sequence.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
So it's loading, and here we are.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Oh, it does.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Okay, it kind of, it does look like the first game in a lot of ways.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
But Jason definitely looks like overpowered.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Like he looks like he's definitely grown a lot since the events of the first game.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
And obviously, again, for those on the podcast that are listening

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
and can't see the visuals right now, you know, it's got a definitely unique sort of skin to it

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
that doesn't look like the planet from the first game.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
It looks a little more like this kind of purpley planet that we fell onto.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.000
But otherwise, a lot of the gameplay still kind of feels like the first game,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000
although you have things like floating platforms and things.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Okay, so you had to push that platform down.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000
And that's how you get your first item, a map.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
We found it.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Oh, and the frog is very happy, and he made a little portal up here

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
that immediately warps me out the door so I don't have to walk all the way back.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Well, that's a convenient feature.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I sure like that.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
So let's see.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
So he should have given me a map, which where would I see that?

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Would I see that?

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Oh, there we go.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
So you can actually see now a map of the area,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
and you can see where the other items are and where the boss is,

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
and we can start to make our way from here.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
So all right, we got to take just a quick peek,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
but we wanted to take a look and see what it looks like in motion,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
and definitely something I want to explore a little bit more later

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
because now Inti Creates kind of has this canvas

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
where they're not beholden to the original story anymore.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
And even though I think they did a really good job

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000
with the first Blaster Master Zero of reinterpreting the first game

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
but kind of doing their own thing with it,

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
even though some people criticized it for being too easy,

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I think a lot of us kind of look back at the original Blaster Master and go,

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
that's a really hard game to beat, especially in one sitting

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
like you used to have to do back in the day.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
So I think Blaster Master Zero kind of tried to make it a little bit easier

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
but then had some more challenging modes with the different characters

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
and the difficult modes that they added in there as well.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.000
So I'm very interested to see what more they do with this different canvas.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
It sounds like you might be going between different planets

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
and other things like that.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000
So there it is, a first look at Blaster Master Zero Part 2

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
because apparently the first one sold well enough.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
So good job, Engine Creates.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
They're making some great games so far.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
So we're going to go back to the studio.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Okay, we are back. Thank you, me.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio In Progress tonight

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:32.000
on March 24th, 2019, and episode number 769 already in progress.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
We are going to get into some rapid-fire news here shortly,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.000
but I know a few weeks ago on the show here, Dark Soccer,

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.000
you were giving a shout-out to another podcast doing a little plug there.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
For our old OLR pals that used to be here a lot, Chris and Meg Z,

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
although they moved.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
But you got a lot of positive feedback from plugging podcasts,

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000
and we always say support indie podcasts.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Precisely.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000
So you want to give another one a shout-out tonight?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.000
I do, and I'm going to be taking suggestions from people on Twitter.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
So if you've got one that you would like to have a shout-out to

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:07.000
as long as they are like non-hateful asshole podcasts.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I mean, if they're not asshole podcasts, I will.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
You know what I mean.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I had a show called The Asshole Podcast. Oh, well.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Was it about bleached assholes?

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
No.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Okay, then. So I don't care. Anyway.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
But if it was about bleached assholes, you would care?

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
We would point it to Extrofer.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Let's not ruin the shout-out.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Anyway, so the suggestion on Twitter comes from SpringTieMe,

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:36.000
and it's a podcast called Riptide Podcast.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:41.000
It is a pinball podcast for women in pinball, in competitive pinball.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
I'm sorry, I got the name wrong. Riptide Pinball Podcast.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
And it's at Riptide Podcast.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
You can find them on iTunes.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I didn't see anything super recent, but I guess it does it during, you know, releases and whatnot.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:58.000
But at any rate, I definitely want to give them a shout-out.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
We need more women in pinball, especially competitive pinball.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000
We have a ladies' league up here.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
I'm not competitive, so I don't want to play.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I just like to play and lose by myself.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
But at any rate...

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Literally in the privacy of your own home.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
In the privacy of my own home.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Even when Dan's not there, or he's asleep, and Midna's in the other room.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
So she's not judging me with her cat eyes.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
But anyway, so yeah, give them a check-out.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Alright, thanks for the tweet, and thanks for the shout-out.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Send me more suggestions. It's at DarkSakura.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Or you could probably send them to the show on Twitter, and I could pass them along too.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
But I want more people to talk to me on Twitter.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Are you lonely on Twitter?

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
A little bit. I'm trying to give my Twitter more attention,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:43.000
and really put more focus on games, unless it's yelling at politicians.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Alright.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Okay, let's move on to some rapid-fire news,

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
and talk about some other things going on in the game industry right now.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Loki, we'll start with you.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
So Nintendo was doing their directs.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Microsoft has their little thing that they do.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Now Sony's joining in the game with their state of play live broadcast.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Inside Xbox is what you're trying to think of.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So they have their state of play,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
and they're doing live broadcasts to talk about different games that are coming out,

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
and their platform announcements and whatnot.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
So the first state of play is going to be March 25th,

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
at 2 p.m. Pacific time, 5 p.m. Eastern.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
And they're going to show something.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Hurray!

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Hurray!

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Well, remember, Sony's not doing E3 this year,

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
so they're going to be showing the PlayStation 5.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000
But wouldn't that be a gag if they did?

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
No, I think they would give us a little more announcement.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Probably some unreleased PS4 games,

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
some things to carry them through the summer and the rest of the year.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Very similar to what we would see if Nintendo said,

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
we've got to direct tomorrow.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
It would be a very similar sort of thing.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Yeah, we'll see.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
And then, of course, as usual, Bethesda's announced

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
that they're going to be doing their E3 press conference

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
right in the middle of our goddamn show.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
So, 5 p.m. Pacific time on Sunday, June 9th.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
So, of course, we'll be interrupting for that.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Hurray!

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Hurray!

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Hopefully, we won't be disappointed by their announcements.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Alright, moving on, talking about Apex Legends.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000
There is a new patch for Apex Legends on PC.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:21.000
So, apparently, there were a lot of crashing issues for Apex Legends on PC.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000
So, Respawn went and did some tweaking with the game,

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
and they did a patch.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
So, it's supposed to be some stability, some performance issues.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:35.000
It also capped the frames per second on PC to 300.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So, you can get no more than 300 frames a second on PC.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
And if you're getting 300 frames a second, you must have a BBBC.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
But anyway, also, apparently, it will actually,

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
when the game crashes, it will do like a text dump.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
So, you can learn more about, I guess, why it's crashing.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
So, that's kind of neat.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Also, it should be mentioned that there was a new champion,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
or what is it called, a legend?

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
I don't know what they call the fighter's name,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:04.000
but Octane is the newest playable person.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000
No, no, he doesn't look like one of the psychos from Borderlands at all.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
He also kind of has like the Junkrat thing going on.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I think his legs are replaced with, they're not like...

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
What did you mean, cybernetic?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Yeah, I think they're cybernetic legs or something, I don't know.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
They're not, they don't look like...

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
They look enhanced or something.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
They've got magic legs.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Yes, we'll say that.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
A lot of people are very excited about this news,

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
which was kind of released a long...

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I know I say that GDC is not the place for game announcements,

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
but here's one that was announced during the GDC timeframe,

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000
So, there is going to be a second game, that's pretty cool.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
The game is going to be in 2020.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
It is a sequel to the original Bloodlines that was out on PC and console,

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
and if you're a fan of Vampire the Masquerade,

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
this might be something that you're into.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
I know a lot of people I saw on Twitter were excited about that.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
This game is being developed by Hardsuit Labs,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000
and the story involves a vampire insurrection,

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
where you're going to be making an alliance with warring clans,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.000
and there's politics and volatile climates and all sorts of fun things.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.000
They had a lot of announcements during GDC, actually, for games.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Pre-order now for 60 bucks.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Because I was watching the Unity press event thing that they were doing,

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000
and they showed off a new trailer for System Shock 3,

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000
and they announced Call of Duty Mobile.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.000
That's kind of the weirdest place to do that, but okay,

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
because it's built on Unity.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
That's going to be a big mobile thing.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Yeah, and I'm not to say they never talk about games at GDC,

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
and certainly indie developers get their games out there,

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
but it's just like, it's not E3.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000
And I think people kind of have it in the right perspective now,

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
but there was definitely a period of time where people thought,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
oh, GDC is like a mini E3.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Not really.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Not really. It's for the developer audience,

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
but because it's for developers,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
sometimes you get, these are the new tools to be developed on.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
But sure, sometimes developers are going to want to show off here,

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
is what we've been working on.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
So you get some game announcements.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
And again, this is a pretty big deal to some people.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Questbuster in our chat, yay, Bloodlines 2.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
And I think there's a lot of people that are saying yay to this.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
We have a few more rapid-fire stories,

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
but they're coming from Dark Sakura.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Yep. Well, one might remember that I talked about

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Pierre Taki, who played Hamura Kyouhei in Judgment Eyes in Japan.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000
They pulled the game out of sales because he had been busted for cocaine.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
They're actually fully removing him from the game,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
replacing his model with a different character

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000
in different Japanese voice acting or a different actor

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
to be released in the Western market and redone in Japan.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.000
So those first original release copies, kind of rare. Someone find me one.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000
He's being replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Fucking A.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Who thought we'd have a highly collectible type of game here

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
in the year 2019 like this, in the age of digital distribution?

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
But this is going to be a rare game

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
if you can get the one that has the original guy in it.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Someone get it for me.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000
And then in other news, EverQuest turned 20.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Yay. People are still fucking playing EverQuest.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It's hard to let it go, man.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
So they're celebrating with new progression servers,

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:33.000
new in-game events, and 50% experience point bonus through March.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
So, yay.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000
As Jason kind of alluded to in tonight's intro,

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.000
this is one of those stories where on Facebook all the time

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
we see these stories about such and such turns XX today.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Oh, no. Here's the big one.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Do you know that in theaters this week,

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
they have Cruel Intentions re-released in theaters?

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.000
The movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe and all that.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Do you know why they re-released it in theaters this week?

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Because the movie turned 20 years old.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
And it's one of those things where we're like, thanks.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I didn't need a reminder.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I know, right? I didn't need a reminder how old that was.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Thanks. Appreciate that.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
And there you go.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I know SSG and her mad just replied with a bunch of dots.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Right?

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
And I was like, wait, wait.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Cruel Intentions is like 20 years old.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000
You know I've never seen it, right?

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Oh, really?

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.000
It's like it's not an Oscar movie.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Should we have like a 90s?

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
We should go to the theater and see it.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Although, here's the problem.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
I do want to see that.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.000
But I also, now that I know it's not super gory

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
because I asked somebody about it,

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I really want to see us.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Me too.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Although I understand that if you are a bunny lover,

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
then there is sadness.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Oh, no.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Like Fatal Attraction.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000
That's depressing.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
I don't know.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Then my sister should see it.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Oh, my God.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000
My sister loves bunnies.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Well, I saw it when someone warned Marissa.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Okay.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Because you know she has her spotted bunny named Snoopy.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Oh, yeah.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Okay.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
But apparently it does actually contribute to the storyline.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Okay.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Oh, boy.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
All right.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000
That's one of those.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Because that's one of those,

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
even though you may not want the minor story spoiler or whatever,

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
it's still one of those things where it's like,

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
why they have websites of does the dog die or what is it?

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
There's some website where you can go

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000
and you can check on any film to see if the dog dies.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
So that way, you know,

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
like I ain't seeing this movie because I know the dog.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I wish I had been warned about Drag Me to Hell.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Cat.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Hold up.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Hold up.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Hold up.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
You went to see a movie called Drag Me to Hell.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Because Tiara wanted to see it.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
But you were shocked by something in a movie called Drag Me to Hell.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I wasn't shocked.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
The only reason I saw it is because it was a Sam Raimi movie.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Okay.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
It wasn't really all that fucking good.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I mean, she liked it, but I just didn't understand.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I would have liked to have been warned if a cat was being sacrificed in a movie.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Okay.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Oh, yeah.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Yeah.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
But at any rate, Drag Me to Hell is really stupid.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I really did not like that movie.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Tiger Claw.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Speaking of old.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
And then we'll move into release dates.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Tiger Claw on chat is talking about that it's C2E2,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
the big Chicago event that was this week.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
They had a clueless reunion.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.000
They sure did.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Except, rest in peace, Brittany Murphy wouldn't have been able to be a part of that.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
But I think they had everybody else involved.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.000
I don't think Stacey Dash was there, but, you know, everybody else was.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
So, that could be.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
But rest in peace, Brittany Murphy.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
And in my opinion, although Brittany Murphy is fabulous in the movie Clueless,

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000
if you really want an underrated Brittany Murphy role

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:36.000
and an underrated movie in general, you need to go see the cult comedy classic Drop Dead Gorgeous.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
It's perfect.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I love that movie.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
By the way, I just got a black cat in Animal Crossing named Kiki.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Oh, the universe heard you calling out for more kitties.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
I needed a Kiki.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000
All right.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some things that are not 20 years old.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
They're brand new as they are released in different parts of the world, starting with the US.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
How ironic that you would transition with that.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Because our first release for this week is none other than the brand new Final Fantasy VII on the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:13.000
And then we have Generation Zero on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.000
MLB The Show 19 on PlayStation 4.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Outward on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Space Junkies on PC.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I guess that's, I thought that was already, maybe that was early access.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Now it's coming out of early access, which is a VR game.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel on PC.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Or I'm sorry, PlayStation 4.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.000
The Princess Guide on Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
The Walking Dead, the final season, Episode 4.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Take us back on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and...

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Is that like the former Telltale stuff that got picked up by...

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Okay.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
So they're releasing another episode of it.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Who picked that up? Somebody, it was a logical...

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Anyway, anyways, PC Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Xenon Racer on PC Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
And we've got a couple more for this week.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Fun Fun Animal Park on the Switch.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Assassin's Creed 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
I'm assuming that's the remaster.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Yeah.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000
And finally on the Switch, Yoshi's Crafted World.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Oh, cool.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
That's it.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Alright.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:38.000
In Japan this week we have, on the PlayStation 4, we have Remilore,

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000
is a game that's out this week, as well as winning post 9.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000
So we've talked about winning run, winning 11,

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
and now winning post 9 is out in Japan this week.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
And a game called Full Kiss.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
We just need a game called Winning!

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Starring Charlie Sheen.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
No, just a game called Winning. Starring me, because I'm winning.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:04.000
The Lego Movie 2 video game gets a Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 4.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.000
It's different.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000
It's different.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Did I mention Full Kiss in a regular and full version that's out this week as well?

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Call of Cthulhu gets a Japanese release this week as well.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:19.000
And Memories Off, innocent file for dearest, in a regular and limited edition.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:26.000
And Utaware Urumono, there's two versions of that releasing this week on the PlayStation 4.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
And then one other game that's coming out this week, Konosuba,

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:35.000
God's blessing on this wonderful world, the labyrinth of hope and gathering of adventurers.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.000
That is the name.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Sign me the fuck up.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.000
That sounds epic as fuck.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
That's a very long title, but that is out.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I want to fucking climb a mountain now.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Anyway, the main character is Kazuma and parties alongside Aqua, Megumin, Darkness,

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.000
and one other character to make a five person party.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:01.000
It looks like a very basic old school RPG, but on the PlayStation 4.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:04.000
And when you go through the story, you get new costumes.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Whoopee!

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:09.000
To quote Mystery Science Theater 3000, whoopty shit.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:16.000
On the Switch this week, Winning Post 9 is out there, Remolore, Diabolic Lovers, Chaos Lineage,

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.000
and the LEGO Movie 2 video game is out in Japan as well on the Switch.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Memories Off, innocent file for dearest.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
So a lot of those same games also on the Switch this week.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Oh, a bunch of stuff.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
We have The Walking Dead, the final season.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
All these that I'm naming right now are on the 25th.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Outward, we have Space Junkies.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.000
We have Xenon Racer for the major three.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000
We have Generation Zero, looks like a mecha game.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Dragon Marked for Death, which looks really fun.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
That's going to be on Switch.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Squishies.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Squishy!

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Kingdom Hearts, the story so far on PlayStation.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Actually, that's the 20th.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Squishies, Dragon, and Kingdom Hearts are all on the 28th.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:05.000
And also on the 28th is Nelke and the Legendary Alchemists,

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Tropico 6, and The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel,

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:15.000
and Yoshi's Crafted World, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
That's it.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000
All right, going to some comments in chat,

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Act F is talking about Konosuba.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
It is an anime.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
It's very popular.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:28.000
The story is about a guy who dies and gets transported to an RPG-esque world.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Interesting.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Speaking of animes, did you know that Ingress anime is finally coming out in the US?

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Yeah, isn't that coming out soon?

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Finally. It was supposed to come out last year in late November.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
I think it's been out in Japan.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
It's already done in Japan, I think.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Finally hitting Netflix, I think, the end of April is when that's finally coming out.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
It better have the option for subtitles.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Most of the Netflix anime stuff is pretty good about that.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.000
So anyway, let's get to our mailbag every week.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
You guys email us.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000
and we read our favorite emails here on the air.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
And do we get it? We got one, right?

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
We got one. There's one.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Okay, just one. All right.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
And it's actually subject line is, oh, man.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Uh-oh.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000
I had zero interest in the Toy-Con elephant set

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000
until they showed what was essentially Tilt Brush with it,

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000
even if you can't walk around or through your artwork.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
And that comes from Robert M.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000
That's it.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
That's it.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Thank you for keeping it short and sweet.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
I'm sorry, I might have missed,

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
because I was prepping for the next story over here.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Was there a question in there for us?

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.000
No.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Just an observation.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Yeah. I mean,

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I guess it would be kind of cool to walk through your artwork,

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
but I don't expect that on Nintendo.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Yeah.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I do wonder how, like,

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I've been without this game, without Animal Crossing,

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
for, like, essentially the last three months,

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
and now I'm fucking addicted to it again.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Just wait until Animal Crossing is on the Switch.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Oh, fuck.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Our Switch is never gonna be at the house again

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
while I'm, you know, at work.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
My wife, since...

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
You didn't have to buy a second Switch.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
No. No, my wife, since...

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
We didn't buy our first Switch.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Christmas, I got, you know, the kids their 2DSs,

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
and I got them Animal Crossing on those.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Guess who's been playing Animal Crossing since

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
they got their system.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
My youngest son hasn't had his 2DS for months now,

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
because she's been playing Animal Crossing

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000
every day.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Good for her. Your wife's a gamer after all.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
How about that?

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
She's gotta do something without any new Excite Truck.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
You know what you need to do?

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
This is how you get her back.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
So next time she's sitting there on the couch

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
playing the game, you just walk in there and go,

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
games, games, games, games,

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
because I remember she used to do that to you.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Well, she's doing that and watching the act on Hulu,

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000
so, you know.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Because she needs to get her drama-filled

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
show with, you know.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I understand.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
That's why I watch MSNBC.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I need to get my weekly filled with drama every week.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Fucking A.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
There's been a lot of it this weekend.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
You know what? I can't stand MSNBC.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
I, I, I don't like it.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I can't stand MSNBC for the same reason

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I can't stand Fox News.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
It's too, it's too at least-

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Too skewed. Way too fucking skewed.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
If you deal with any news source that is too skewed,

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
you are not going to get the whole story,

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.000
so that's why I read BBC.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I also, I also don't,

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
not to go too far down this road,

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
I don't, I also,

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I kind of know that when I watch it,

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
so I kind of have that perspective in mind,

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
so I don't, like, let myself-

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Yeah.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
be swayed.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
I, the only reason I'm actually saying that

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
is because there are people who take it as much gospel-

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Oh, I'm sure.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000
as some people take Fox News.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Oh, I'm sure.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
So, as I warn everybody,

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
this is your PSA of the evening

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
and not just educational radio.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Take everything that you see with a grain of salt

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
and research, research, research.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
But if it's on Wikipedia, it's true.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
That's a joke. That's a joke.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000
All right.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Moving on, we got some more news for you guys,

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
and we're going to try to squeeze in some calls.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.000
We're running a little long tonight,

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
just some good discussion here happening in the studio.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Um, so we will have time for Discord stuff,

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000
um, and if you want to call us, uh, the show, uh, via Discord,

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000
you can by joining our green room,

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000
but I am going to warn,

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
it probably is going to be a short segment tonight

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
for that part, so have your question ready to go,

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
and you can, uh, tell us what you're going to talk about-

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
You also want FUs.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Huh?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
I do also want an FU.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000
You want an FU?

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Can we do that closer to the Discord segment?

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Sure.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Okay, let's get to- remind me,

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
don't let me end the show without it.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Uh, let's get to some more news.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Loki.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Yes, and so Epic had a presentation they did at GDC as well

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
and made a bunch of announcements of games

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
that are exclusive to the Epic Games Store coming soon.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000
So, for example, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls,

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000
and Detroit Become Human are coming to PC,

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
but those are exclusive to the store.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Aside from that, they announced ten other games as well.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:54.000
So they have After Party, The Cycle, Dauntless,

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Industries of Titan, Journey to the Savage Planet,

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Kain, Phoenix Point, The Sinking City, Spellbreak,

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.000
and Solar Ash are all going to be exclusive on the store,

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:14.000
and Ancestors, The Humankind Odyssey as well.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
So...

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I'm kind of all about Detroit and that coming to PC.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
It's not even the Epic Games Store.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000
I mean, whatever, they're wheeling and dealing or whatever,

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000
but the fact that these games are coming out on PC is kind of cool.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Yeah.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000
So, because, you know, that was one of those games I meant to play on PS4

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
and I just kind of never got around to.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
But I wonder if when it comes out on PC,

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000
they'll cut the price on PS4 just to be like that.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Yeah, I don't know.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.000
But anyways, yeah, so there's that.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Questbuster in chat says,

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Damn, Industries of Titan and Sinking City.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
So some folks have their eyes on...

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.000
They also threw a lot of shade on Steam as well

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
because they were talking about how they're going to really monitor

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
what gets uploaded to their store.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
They're not going to include porn or...

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Well, but they also, like, they don't have the door wide open

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
that anybody can publish a game.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:14.000
And you've got to wonder if when Epic gets more and more games,

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000
there might be calls to have a more open door

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
where you can publish your own thing on Epic

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
and if they'll have a solution.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Because, you know, Steam's kind of been trying these different solutions

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
like the project.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
I think they really should just go back to the previous solution

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.000
because that was better than it was now.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000
And now it's really not good.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
You have to know the right people to get in the Epic Store.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Because there's so much crap on there,

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.000
but I guess neither are the perfect solutions.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I don't know.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.000
To be continued, to be developed.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Also, always under renovations is the game Heroes of the Storm,

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.000
which, you know, the community's been facing a lot of kicks in the butt

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
lately with the whole fact that, you know, the esports

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.000
was kind of sunsetted, the official one anyway.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And it sounds like a lot of the development on this game

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
is going to kind of go more into support mode

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
as opposed to like develop a lot of new stuff.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I mean, not to say they won't ever do new Heroes and stuff,

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000
but it has been a while since they've announced a new Hero.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I don't know.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
So the game might kind of be moving into a stable state.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
But anyway, the news this week is that

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
they're going to be changing the way loot boxes work.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
You know, Heroes of the Storm does have loot boxes,

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
but it was a free game.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000
So I think a lot of people feel,

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
all right, you can do loot boxes or games free.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.000
But you're actually not going to be able to pay for loot boxes anymore.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Gems, which are the pay currency,

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000
will no longer be usable to get loot boxes.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.000
You have to earn loot boxes in game by leveling up and all that stuff,

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000
or you use the currency that you get in the game,

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000
the gold in the game, to buy those loot boxes.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.000
So you can no longer buy with pay currency loot boxes.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
So that kind of begs the question,

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
where is this game going to make their money?

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
It's money then.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Well, don't forget, the things that you get in the loot boxes

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
are still things you can buy piecemeal on the store.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
You can buy new heroes.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.000
You can buy new skins, new mounts, announcers, things like that.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
You can buy all those things with the gems.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:17.000
It's just they are taking out the random chance fun box,

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:20.000
which I must admit, I have never purchased.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Pretty much any time I did drop money on Heroes of the Storm,

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
and I have spent a little money on Heroes of the Storm,

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000
I bought, they had a sale on an Uber bundle with a hero amount

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
and a couple of things, and I was like,

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
okay, for 20 bucks, I'll get that.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
And that's about the most money I've spent on Heroes of the Storm.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000
I've probably spent about as much money on Heroes of the Storm

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
as I would have on a retail game release,

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
and I got a lot of enjoyment out of that game.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I haven't been playing it as much lately,

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.000
but there's just been other things, like Overwatch.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I need to play Overwatch again and play that new hero,

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
which looks really cool.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Well, last but not least of my things here,

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000
we have The Return of Obra Dinn, which is a fun name.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
It won quite a few awards at Game Developers Conference.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.000
And that one was actually developed by Lucas Pope,

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
who did Papers, Please, and you know how well that game took off.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Oh, yeah.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:19.000
But it won, basically the game is about discovering,

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:25.000
you know, just different things that happen while sailing a ship.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
It won the best narrative.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.000
It also won the IGF Grand Prize in Excellence in Narrative.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And also Game of the Year was, I just had it a second ago,

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
was God of War.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.000
It sounds like as far as the more indie development goes,

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:46.000
this guy, you know, because Papers, Please was kind of,

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:47.000
you know, it was a very interesting game.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
It was kind of a commentary in some ways.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
So that being directly in your face about it,

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
it was definitely a commentary on some things in culture.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
So it sounds like this guy is getting pretty good

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
at making thought-provoking games.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
It sounds like that's what this new one's doing.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Well, here are the Game Developers Choice winners.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
For Best Audio, Celeste.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Best Debut, Mountains.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Best Design, Into the Breach.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Best Mobile, Florence.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Innovation Award was Nintendo Labo.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Narrative was The Return of Obra Dinn.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Best Technology was Red Dead Redemption 2.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:19.000
I guess it must be all the horse penis.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
The graphics are pretty stunning in that game, so.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Best Visuals is Grease,

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
which I'm actually looking to play, GRIS.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I'm actually planning on trying to stream that one,

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.000
because I haven't been able to get the Super Nintendo hooked up yet.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
We have to clean out that office a lot.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.000
The Best VR AR Game is Beat Saber.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Audience Award is Beat Saber.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Game of the Year is God of War.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Pioneer Award, Reiko Kodama.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Lifetime Achievement Award is Amy Hennig.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:49.000
And for the Independent Games Festival winners,

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
we have, for the Seamus McNally Grand Prize,

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Return of the Obra Dinn.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Excellence in Visual Art is Mirror Drop.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Excellence in Audio is Paratropic.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Excellence in Design is Opus Magnum.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Excellence in Narrative is Return of the Obra Dinn.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:05.000
A Nuevo Award that's given to unusual experimental games

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.000
is Black Room, which I wanted to look into.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
And Best Student Game is After Hours.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
So, there you go.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
That's pretty cool that you have an award ceremony

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.000
that really honors student-developed games,

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
all the way to AAA stuff like God of War.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
So, I really feel like we got a full spectrum

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
of different development sites here.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Indeed.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
That's cool.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Questbuster pointing out, as far as Papers, Please go,

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:31.000
the Papers, Please short film on Steam is also really good.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.000
I heard they were making a movie out of it,

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000
but it wasn't like a...

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
So, I never saw the finished product.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I'll have to check that out.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Sounds interesting.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Yeah.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.000
But there's just quite a number of things

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
that I'm going to be checking out that came out of GDC.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000
So...

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Cool.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.000
And hopefully some folks here in studio.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.000
That would be great.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I'd love that.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Actually.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Or via Skype, if need be.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Or, excuse me, Discord.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Well, I can still do Skype on demand, if need be,

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
if our guests have to do it.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000
To go ahead and point this out,

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
I'm actually planning on working on something

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
with somebody else, and that's all I can say about it.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
That was an announcement of an announcement,

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
if I ever heard one.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000
All right.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:14.000
We're going to do something with someone.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
We're going to do something with somebody at some time,

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:19.000
and you won't know when, but you're going to love it.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
All right.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys,

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
then we're going to get to the listener round table.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
If you have some questions for us in chat,

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
or you want to join our green room in Discord,

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
again, I'm not going to wait all night.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000
So, if the green room stays empty, then so be it.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
But get in there, if you want to give us a call

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
First, we just have a couple more stories for you guys.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Loki.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.000
So, you may remember that they had developed at one time,

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.000
I don't know, it wasn't necessarily a mod,

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:52.000
it was more of a multiplayer co-op version of Mario 64.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Yes, because Nintendo shut that shit down,

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.000
but they put Wario in it, or Waluigi in it.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Well, they brought it, I think they brought it back too,

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000
and Nintendo tried to shut it down.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I think it's still out there.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Well, it was one of those once on the internet,

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
always on the internet sorts of things.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:10.000
So now, there is a new mod, that's now for Zelda,

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Ocarina of Time, they call it OOT Online,

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.000
and it allows co-op for two to fifteen players.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000
What would you do with fifteen people in Ocarina of Time?

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I don't know, but they have video footage showing

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
what they could possibly do with it.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000
So, I don't know.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I watched some of the video, and it was a lot of two people.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000
I don't think they showed more than two at a time.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Yeah, and it's kind of...

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
It was neat.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Yeah, it looks like it's still early.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I mean, some of the animations aren't really coming over too well,

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
but it's neat that you can do that.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Right, for sure.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
They found a way to shoehorn it in there,

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:53.000
but I'd be curious to see what more they can do with this,

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
and also if Waluigi is going to be in here.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Well, they just patched Waluigi in.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Why? Because.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000
All right.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.000
And this is also very exciting news.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I don't know why I saved...

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Maybe I saved the best for last.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
I don't know.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
But it looks like, you know what's coming back?

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Lucasfilm Games is going to be making a comeback.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000
I saw that.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Loom 2?

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Oh, God.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
We can only hope.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Anyway, here's the deal.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000
No, no.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Before we just blatantly make stuff up, here's the deal.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Disney has posted some job listings for some new Lucasfilm games.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:26.000
And especially when we've heard stories about layoff, layoff, layoff,

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
this could be a great thing for some of those people

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
to hopefully get there on the ground somewhere else,

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.000
and this could be pretty cool.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:35.000
So Disney Careers, which is the official website for Disney postings

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.000
and things like that, they are showing positions at Lucasfilm Games.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Now, this has been in the news before,

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
because I guess Lucasfilm Games was looking for people in 2017,

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000
but it does seem like things are picking up,

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.000
because some of the job listings actually mention Nintendo Switch

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000
as a potential platform.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Now, some places that are running with this story

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.000
get into this whole talk about Star Wars games

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
and how EA's kind of had the lock on Star Wars,

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
and what have they done with it in seven years?

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Like, two Battlefront games, that's it.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Ruined the Star Wars name?

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Yeah, so some folks are wondering if Disney is either prepping

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000
for when that contract is over and they're going to make their own stuff.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.000
I mean, I would assume, actually, they could probably make their own stuff

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000
at any time.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
That's probably part of the agreement.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.000
But, you know, still, once this EA thing ends, if it'll be reevaluated.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
But I also kind of say, you know,

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Lucasfilm Games didn't just make Star Wars stuff.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I joked about Loom, but that was certainly a memorable game.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:38.000
They did the Indiana Jones PC adventure games, which was really good as well.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Maniac Mansion was them, wasn't it?

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Maniac Mansion was them.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
They also had mercenaries, I think.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Monkey Island.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000
We used to call it Mercenaries back in the day.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:55.000
So it may not be, even though, yes, it's Lucasfilm,

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:58.000
but, you know, also Lucas isn't strictly involved in Star Wars.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Can we get Maniac Mansion right in Disneyland now?

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
That'd be kind of cool.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.000
But, yeah, I'm curious to see what they're doing,

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
and I'm curious if it's even Star Wars at all.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Everybody's assuming it is, but maybe it's not.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Maybe it's going to be something different.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Why can't we have both?

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Yeah, why not? Why not both?

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:20.000
So, anyway, Questbuster in chat says,

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
the hiring position seemed to show that the new Lucasfilm

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.000
is going to be like a branding watchdog, at least for now.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000
It would be nice to see a new Dark Forces, though.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.000
All right, well, we are to the part of the show

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
where we're going to do the Listen Around table,

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.000
and I don't believe I saw anybody in our Discord waiting to call in,

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
but I'll give it just a couple more minutes there.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Just a couple more minutes for now.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:43.000
If you do want to call the show,

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.000
go to our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
That'll get you that invite right away into the server,

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
and you're going to join the green room,

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
and then you can mention in the Orange Launch Radio channel

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
what you want to talk about, and that would be great.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000
So we have an idea of what you are wanting to talk to us about tonight.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
But currently nobody's there,

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.000
and I mentioned we are running a little long anyway,

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
so maybe just people are shy tonight.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
I don't know.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
But if you have a quick question,

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.000
you can also ask in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:15.000
While we wait to see if anything pops up there in chat or in Discord,

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
do we have any last-minute stories to cover?

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Yeah, the Atari VCS console's been delayed

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.000
because they say they're improving specs of what's going in the console.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Totally forgot Atari was making a new console thing.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
So yeah, I totally forgot this.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.000
They say now it's going to be a new Vega graphics-based AMD Ryzen processor.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:39.000
So yeah, now we don't know when that's coming.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I think they said the end of 2019 now.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Alright, we'll have to wait and see if that's even worth it at this point,

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000
but whatever.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:54.000
And then kind of once we were talking about indies and stuff like that

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
and different direct type things,

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Microsoft is doing an ID at Xbox Game Pass thing

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:10.000
that's going to be streamed on March 26th at 9 p.m. Pacific

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000
to showcase some indie games coming to that platform as well.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.000
So we'll have to take a look at those when those come out.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Yeah, I'm kind of curious what their response will be

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
because Microsoft's got a lot of good indie stuff on it.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Before we get to the next story, though,

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000
we have a question in our chat for this segment from Dark Tetsuya who says,

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Did y'all see that DDR Ace 20 or A20 finally launched?

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Apparently there's a Konami 50th anniversary song in it

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.000
with nods to Gradius and Yirr Kung Fu.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
I'd love to hear that song.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Do they still put rips from the arcade online somewhere?

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Yes, yes.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000
On like Bimani style or something?

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000
I'm sure it's on YouTube.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Oh, yeah, it's probably on YouTube somewhere.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Check that out. I want to hear that song.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Have they said anything about when we get that over here in the States?

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Is it just location testing right now?

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Or is it like the official launch?

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
I think it's launched already because it's like they've got...

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
I would have thought they'd wait until 20 November.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Actual cabinets and everything.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
I think it's just...

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
I don't know if it's like a software upgrade that they're doing

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:08.000
to some of the other cabinets.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I know that they have the new gold cabinets as well.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000
But if all of the Ace machines are going to turn the Ace 20s

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.000
or how that works now that we live in this digital age

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
with even arcade games.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Yeah, I'd be curious.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
So Dark Tetsuya says he'll put it on the Discord

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
so we can... and that the game is officially out.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
It's not a location test. It's officially out.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I definitely want to hear the song.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.000
I would play it on air, but I've got to be content matching

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.000
and all that. I've got to be careful because I don't want to get

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:37.000
a stream muted for the people that do watch the archives.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Which you can do, by the way.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Cheap plug.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:42.000
If you are a subscriber of our channel here at VOG Network,

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.000
you get access to the video archives of Orange Ontario,

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000
The Bobby Black Wolf Show, and anything else we might be doing in the future.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Which, by the way, there may be a special thing on Thursday.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
I'm just waiting on the final kind of thing on that.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.000
But stay tuned to my personal Twitter as well as the VOG Network Twitter.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
My personal Twitter is at MrRobRoberts.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.000
We may have a thing on the stream on Thursday night.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.000
And I'm waiting on the T's to get crossed and the I's to get dotted.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
And a little bit ahead of PAX East.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.000
We're all guessing that Borderlands 3 is going to be announced.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Yes.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
But it may not be Borderlands 3.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
It may be actually Borderlands Game of the Year edition.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Now, I know what you're saying, but wait.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Borderlands Game of the Year edition?

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
That already came out several years ago.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Not on the Switch.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
It's... no, it's not coming on the Switch.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.000
PC?

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Well, they say that now it's been rated for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:34.000
They're saying that it's going to be a remaster, possibly, of the original Borderlands game.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000
And I know what you're thinking.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Well, wait a second.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Didn't I already purchase a remaster of Borderlands games?

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
The Handsome Jack collection?

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Yes, you did.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000
But that was two and technically the third game.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Pre-sequel.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.000
So this is going to be the first game.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
And then, oh, this is oh so nice.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:57.000
In-game purchases are a thing that they have flagged on here for Borderlands Game of the Year.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Which is weird because the Game of the Year edition should have all of the fucking content in it.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000
So why am I having to make purchases for things?

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Because maybe they're going to still have the two and the pre-sequel remaster available within this game.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
It's just a touch of a button.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000
You can get the Handsome Jack collection for less than $15.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:18.000
True, that's true.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:19.000
No point.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Fifth Dream Today says maybe new things.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Maybe not the same DLC.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Maybe they're going back.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.000
I don't really want a remaster for the first game.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Do Borderlands 3, you cowards.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Yes, do a third game.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:33.000
Or do another, I don't know, a Borderlands prequel or something.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
They already did a fucking prequel.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Borderlands 3 or GTFO.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
No, it was a pre-sequel.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.000
And I say that with the freaking poster hanging behind me here.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Three or get out.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000
I don't want a remaster.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Anyway, Tigerclass says they're milking that franchise for all it's worth.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.000
SG100Matt says Borderlands 2 had that bullshit too.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.000
If Fifth Dream Today said maybe the newer characters in the first game.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000
That'd be cool.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:03.000
And SG100Matt says if you got the season pass for Borderlands 2, you didn't get the pre-order bonus content.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.000
This has nothing to do with any of that, but it's definitely relevant to our interests.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Akira Yamaoka just posted on Facebook because I follow him on Facebook.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Yeah, me too.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:17.000
A poster. This is Akira Yamaoka, Pantera.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
So either he's working with Pantera.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
That's badass, if true.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Or is something...

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I think he's working with Pantera looking by the logo.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Is he gonna produce the...

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Dude, it would make total sense as a band. Pantera probably played the old Silent Hill games and was like...

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Far Beyond Driven. Yes, it is. He's working with Pantera.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Wow. That's pretty cool.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
So...

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Oh, you know what? Never mind. I know what this is.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Okay, so I just figured out what it was. I went looking it up and there's a Pantera ad generator.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
A font generator thing.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.000
So apparently Akira Yamaoka just played with it.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
That's...

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
It's a fucking font.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
My emotional roller coaster here.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
I know.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:04.000
This is that clip from Roller Coaster Tycoon.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Where they're like...

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:11.000
And then the coaster's going, everybody's having fun, and then the track just ends.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
I was excited about it too.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Because I was like, holy shit, working with Pantera, that's fucking awesome.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Akira Yamaoka's working with Pantera.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.000
And then I just double checked the logo.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.000
And yeah, it looks like it's a Pantera meme generator.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000
That's set for Far Beyond Driven.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Our chat room is laughing their ass off too.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Yeah, it's...

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
I just double checked it.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I'll link the logo generator, but fuck.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.000
And Chad says, what the fuck, I was lied to.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Act F says, I feel betrayed.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Look.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
It's Facebook.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Nothing on Facebook is real.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:02.000
I was just like, because usually when people do something like that,

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.000
it's just like a splash.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
Something to get you interested in.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:12.000
And that wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Yeah, I don't normally buy Pantera albums,

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000
but that one I would probably catch my attention.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
But it's also like a fucking old ass album.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Well, old ass, I say this.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
It's from 1994.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Fun fact, that would make it 25 years old this year.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Anyway, all right.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Well, I don't see anybody else in the green room,

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
and I don't see any other questions in chat.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
How very dear you all.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:39.000
I think it's about time to wrap up the show.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Unless we have other last minute stories we didn't get to yet. Sorry.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Oh, no, I'm just watching the new trailer for Earth Defense Force Iron Rain,

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:49.000
which I totally need to get because it looks very awesome.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.000
My friend's cat's named Pantera.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
All right.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
We're going to wrap up the show.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.000
We're going to wrap up the show, get everybody's final thoughts,

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
and then we'll head on out of here for the night.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:04.000
But, again, as always, I want to thank you guys for listening to Orange On Radio.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Whether you watched us live on Twitch here or Sunday nights

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
at the Voice Geeks Network, VOG Network,

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:14.000
or if you downloaded our show free on iTunes or Google Play

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:18.000
or wherever it is you listen to podcasts, really appreciate it.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:21.000
As we say here on the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
If the voices aren't here in our Discord waiting to be on the show,

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
then we can't share them with the world.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
So please help us spread the word.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
I'm posting the poster I just made on my fan page.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Okay, you do that.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Well, is that your final thought, Dark Sakura?

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
I had a F-you, but I forgot.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Oh, yeah, I'll use it as my final thought then.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
It's not really a F-you.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
For all the people who says, oh, I went shopping today,

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000
or, oh, I had my nails done, or, oh, I did this,

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.000
and say it's self-care, it's not self-care, that's pampering yourself.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Self-care is doing the things every day that maintain your physical and mental health,

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:07.000
meaning getting out of bed, taking your vitamins, walking, doing some exercise,

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
leaving the house, getting enough sleep.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:13.000
What if, and I mean this is a totally legit question, what if,

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:18.000
because I did this last week, what if I like canceled plans with somebody

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:21.000
because I was just so burned out and exhausted?

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:24.000
That is something that contributes to your ongoing well-being.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Okay.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Because you have to have, now that's perfect self-care.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
That's taking care of your mental state.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:33.000
But just going out and doing something for momentary pleasure,

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.000
that does not constitute real self-care.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
That's just treating yourself, okay?

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.000
You know, if you go, say, get a massage because your back hurts,

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:49.000
that's something that contributes to your ongoing physical and mental health,

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.000
as an example.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:56.000
And for someone who is personally dealing with trauma, myself,

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:01.000
who has been through a lot of these, doing something nice for yourself is fine,

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000
but it's not therapy.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.000
And Peso Pacas in chat says, treat yourself too, though.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Treat yourself for sure.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000
That is something that's a momentary uplifting.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Did you see a gold sparkly hat that you want to own, by all means?

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Wear it around in Target for 20 minutes and then buy it.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Or don't.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.000
But I'm saying, but also on the same thing,

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:23.000
if you are, say, financially struggling and you see the hat,

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.000
and you're like, but you know what, that $5 I'm going to spend on this hat

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:29.000
could go into my groceries, that also is self-care,

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
being fiscally responsible.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Just saying.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:33.000
All right.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Some words of wisdom from Auntie Dark Sakura.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Appreciate that.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Bitches.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Let's see, I'll do my final thought and then we'll do Logie's final thought.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:47.000
My final thought is I need to do about eight more minutes of walking today.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.000
So I'm going to go out on a night walk after the show,

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
and I'm going to hope I don't get stabbed.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000
What is it with everybody thinking they're going to get stabbed in these neighborhoods?

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:01.000
My wife's like, well, I could go for a walk today, but I might be murdered.

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
I'm like, no one wants to murder you.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
You won't have any valuables on you.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:06.000
It's daytime.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
No one's going to murder you.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I will say that for-

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000
That was a nice thing to say to your wife. Nobody wants to kill you.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:19.000
I will say for women, it is a very real concern for us that we are at a higher risk than men usually are.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
But that's not what she's saying it for.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
She's saying it for her because she wants me to go walk with her,

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.000
and I don't want to because I already walked three miles earlier in the day,

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.000
and I don't feel like going out for yet another three-mile walk.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I think although what Dark Sakura's saying is certainly valid,

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:37.000
I think that is not quite the frame of reference that your wife is using.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Right.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.000
I get it. I get it.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.000
All right.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
And then that was my final thought.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
So what's your final thought, Logie?

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:49.000
My final thought is I'll keep working on my game.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000
I'm not going to show you guys.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Sounds good.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.000
You don't get to see it.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Sounds good.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Drop it on us like a surprise.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:58.000
I just want you to come in here one day and go, bam, here's my game.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Here's my game.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Well, bam, there's our podcast for this week.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.000
We'll be back to do it in seven days with whatever happens in gaming news next week,

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.000
possibly some type of Borderlands news, some we're going to hear about the next week.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:12.000
PAX is going on next week, right? PAX East?

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Yes, PAX East.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
So those of you guys still in Boston, right?

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:19.000
I haven't been to PAX East in like, God, six, five, six years.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
So those of you that are going to Boston this weekend,

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:24.000
have a ton of fun and don't get in too much trouble,

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
and we'll have some of the news that comes out of that next week.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
So we will see you in seven days.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Good night, everybody.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:33.000
