00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, the week of PAX East brought us new game reveals and new ways of revealing game news, but it seems one way of purchasing those games may be seeing big changes. All this tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 770 for this, March the 31st of 2019.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, hi.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi, how are you doing?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here's my foot.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, there's your foot.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm actually fairly accomplished.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Good.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I've had a week that good things have happened in.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's good.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, I've been open with, you know, my surgery.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Uh-huh.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I fit into a size two this week.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Congrats.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm like, I've never been a size two. Maybe when I was six.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, good job.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I also made dandelion cookies.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You did. I've been eating them. They're pretty, they don't really taste like a lot like, maybe it's like a hint. It's like that, it's like just the.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's meant to be subtle.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, it's a very subtle, subtle. So it doesn't taste like you're like actually eating flowers.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But they're edible the same way that rose petals are.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So there you go.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And good for you. Lots of beta carotene.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She's just, she's just, you know, playing a prank on us.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's really their spider legs.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But you know, I'm just going to eat them.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then they have protein.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Actually, I'm most impressed.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Loki doesn't usually eat food from strangers.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not a stranger.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But still, even us, he doesn't.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I am strange.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He doesn't.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He doesn't normally eat baked goods of that nature.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, no, he.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But thank you for eating my cookie.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He eats what he brings and that's that.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What did you bring today?

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A sandwich from, really.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sandwich is good.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Because it took them forever to make the sandwich.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They have to tell me the story about how they ran out of all the other bread types.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm like, I don't fucking care.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just make my sandwich faster.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hold on, I have to wrap it four or five times.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's like, we're just going to open it anyways.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Look for a recipe online and they talk about their family history.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And all of the things that go into it.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And they're like, I want the fucking recipe.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You want the sandwich, I want the recipe.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I would say this is one of those socially acceptable times where you are able to say,

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
get over there and make me a sandwich.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Because you are in a sandwich shop.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, it's a little more socially acceptable to be able to do that.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, I did the new modern way of shopping today.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I ordered everything online and just went and picked it up.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How convenient.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's for grocery shopping.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know if I would want to replace all my shopping with that method.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My neighbors have theirs delivered.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I do buy a lot of stuff online.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, it's just we buy the same things every week.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are we going to do with all this commercially zoned space?

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We've all stopped going to stores and things.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know. Okay.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And this does tie into games.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Because we are a show that talks about video games, gaming news, gaming culture, and so forth.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network,

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
voguesnetwork.com, which is also available on Twitch,

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
twitch.tv slash voguesnetwork.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I do apologize because I can see as we are streaming tonight,

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we're losing a lot of frames as we upload.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We haven't, there's nothing unusual going on in the studio.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We just unfortunately have some type of bad internet connection.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So, as we would usually do when we were recording this as an audio only podcast,

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we're going to push through for the sake of the actual podcast

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and just hope it kind of comes back.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because it looks like the internet is doing one of those things

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
where it's kind of coming and going.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But unfortunately, like, yes, we've shut off all our background downloads.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
None of the other computers are on.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It just, it is what it is. So.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, we're just doing the robot during the show. That's fine.

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Right. Yeah. So, unfortunately, guys, there's not a lot I can do about that,

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
which really stinks because we are trying to attract some more viewers

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and get more people here to join us on Twitch.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, it kind of sucks when things that are out of your control

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
are preventing that from happening, but what can you do?

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So, anyway, let's, let's, what else was I going to, gosh, I got off track.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was, oh, speaking of games, okay, so this has to do with the delivery

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and all that stuff. So, and this never happens,

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
but Alan and I last night were like, let's go to Walmart.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I never go to Walmart, okay, specifically that store.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I usually go to Target. But for some reason, it was like,

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
oh, we haven't been there in a long time.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I was like, I wonder if they've released any new of those mini arcade games

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
because they have that mini collectible series that is over there.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let me actually, I'm going to stand up and grab one of these.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So, they have these mini collectibles. And yes, this one is new

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that I picked up yesterday. So, this is this arcade classics collection.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've only seen these at Walmart. I've seen a similar type at Target,

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
but I haven't seen the specific same arcade classics library.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I might be stopping by then. Is it the LCD screen or the?

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It is. It's the nicer screen. You can play with that if you want.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll just go buy one. This is Ms. Pac-Man, is the one for the podcast folks that can't see it.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I picked up a Ms. Pac-Man machine because I thought they might have a new one I didn't have yet.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I was right, they have Ms. Pac-Man. And then I also picked up Dig Dug.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And what's interesting about Dig Dug. But you already have Dig Dug.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I do have Dig Dug in the Target collection.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, Target has the my arcade and Walmart has the arcade classics

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and Dig Dug thus far is the only game that I know of that exists in both.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, now I have two.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Which is better?

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I haven't extensively played the arcade classic ones yet.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So, anyway, I told that whole story because my point was

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that's probably not something we would have done if we hadn't like thought

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
oh, let's actually go to Walmart, let's go in there and actually go shopping and all that good stuff.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, there is still benefits going on in person.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And then of course not only was it that, but it was like

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
oh, they have the potato chips and all the different flavors

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
like the hot pickle that we couldn't find anywhere else.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's where I found the beer cheese flavor.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, I didn't realize that like Walmart is the place to go for the

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and I'm not endorsing him, but appears to be the place to go to find all that flavor filled stuff.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because the banana frosted flakes I can't find anywhere else now was there.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So, Dan says that by the way the Ms. Pac-Man and the Dig Dug and the Fix-It Felix are not new.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, interesting.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They're new to me.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, they're new to me.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, I'm just saying that apparently

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think it was the Ms. Pac-Man one I couldn't find for you.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, because they're all numbered.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And so Fix-It Felix, which Jamie got for me when she was at, is number 12.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So, I knew there was one missing. I knew there was an 11 that I was missing.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes, and I think that Dan had found, maybe Dan found that one and I didn't see it.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But yeah, I had remembered.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And I checked with Dan because I was like, do we have those?

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because I have no idea what the crap we own anymore.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And then Dig Dug was number 13.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, we need more.

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, I know.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Look, it's like filling up that top shelf.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have to clean off another shelf space so I have room to put all these mini arcade games.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And at some point I'll have to do a YouTube or something to show off these different little collectibles.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because they are really cute.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For the folks on the podcast that don't have the benefit of the visual, they're really tiny little machines.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're like the size of, I don't know, like half a shoebox.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think a She-Ra doll could play them.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Probably. Actually, yes, you could probably pose like your Barbie dolls and your G.I. Joe dolls in front of them.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Or a couple transformers.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And it would look legit. Yeah, so they're fun.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Anyway, let's get into some news.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's a lot of gaming news that has happened this past week.

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have a lot of ground to cover tonight.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So I'm going to throw it right over to Loki, if you are willing to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No!

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, so this is not a big surprise to me because I always looked at, when they had these available in stores,

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:17,000
like, why would I buy this versus, you know, buying the physical copy or buying it digitally on sale through the store.

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I just didn't understand the purpose of having these cards to buy digital versions of the games.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now, granted, Sony is now removing these from stores, but there are still other companies that have digital codes there.

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
For example, Nintendo has a lot of these different indie games that are available that you can purchase by digital code.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But you think about it though, usually if you're purchasing digital, you're not going to the store because it's more convenient that way.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Or you're buying it on sale, which this card is never going to be on sale because it's a digital copy.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And it's specifically a certain amount that the vendor paid for that.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They're not normally going to discount those.

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Once in a great while, but it's usually a large region.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's very rare that that happens.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Funny enough, sorry, just quickly, on the Walmart topic, since it is newsworthy, I set foot willingly in one.

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I was like, wow, all these things are different than what I remember.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
One of them was, the section for these cards and games on cards is huge.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Like half what I remember used to be the glass cases and all that.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I would say a third of that. A third of that is now games on cards.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And I was kind of like you. I'm like, who's buying games on cards when it's very easy to go on the shop and buy them?

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But gifts was the thing that came to mind.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You have a lot of people on stuff.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, I guess if you wanted to just buy a card and send it through the mail or something like that to somebody and you wanted to buy them a gift.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because you can't really gift digital purchases, I think, on many of the store friends.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's something you could do, but at the same time, just buy them a points card and have them pick out whatever they want.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Grandma's not going to know that.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I can kind of see, especially like Minecraft, okay?

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Minecraft is a card.

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Grandma's not going to know, but Grandma's going to know, oh, Minecraft is the thing that kids are into, so I'm going to pick this up.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I think you're not giving enough grandmothers credit.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Grandmothers now are seriously, like, some of them are our age.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
True. I'm not talking about Grandma Skyrim.

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But, you know, I'm talking, you would be surprised.

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You know what? Obviously.

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like, maybe the great grandmothers won't get it.

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay. Not all grandmas.

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But you know what I'm getting at, right? I'm talking about that crowd.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Maybe what we think of as our grandparents never really understood.

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now, that's not necessarily true because I had to set up an Alexa for, or an Echo for my father-in-law.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So not everybody's going to understand what these cards are.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, I just didn't understand why they're there.

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Bobby's yapping in our chat, although I enjoy it here, over at, of course, twitch.tv slash vog network.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But he's bringing up some points that are worth reading here.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So Bobby Black Wilson in our chat saying, they're great for gifting digital games.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I've bought people digital codes of games rather than just sending them $60.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Also, you can't get a $60 point card.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can get a $50 card and a $20 card.

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So it sounds like a little bit like those dollar amounts might be kind of like, I don't know, the hot dogs versus the hot dog buns.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They're uneven.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You get a $50 card that doesn't really cover the cost of the game.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Also, you know that you're, you know that little Jimmy, going back to my grandma example,

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you know that little Jimmy's not going to take your $50 gift card and spend it on porn.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Because you may not understand that porn isn't available, but you know what I'm getting at, right?

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You want a little more control over what exactly that kid is getting.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Now, Bobby's also bringing up the story that I know he's talked about on his show about mother-in-law kind of messed up trying to do the digital games

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
because she created a PSN account to buy me some PS4 games and then learned he couldn't play them

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
because she just didn't understand how the system worked.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But she knew, oh, if I go to the PlayStation store, this is the cheapest place to get them.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So she did, but now they're on her account.

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So it's, and it's, he's been writing all these tweets, like they will not refund the money.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They're being sticklers about it.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Can't you just sign in under her account and then like download them and then?

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't think, because he got it.

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He used to share accounts like that.

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, keep in mind, Bobby's house, there's multiple PlayStations and things going on,

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and he's married and the wife is a gamer, so they probably have separate accounts.

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm not going to overanalyze the situation.

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He said it wouldn't work the way it was, I believe it.

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okie doke.

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But anyway, back to the point of these cards.

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So anyways, April 1st is going to be where they're going to stop selling these cards.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No, that's not really a joke.

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's basically, you know, they're not going to be offered through SIE's Global Digital Retail Program.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The decision was made in order to align key businesses globally

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to support full games and premium editions.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
SIE will continue or introduce increased denominations

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that select retailers, DLC and add-ons, virtual currency.

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Season passes will still be available.

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So there you go.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So now your complaint was that they didn't have those large amounts for the cards.

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Now they're going to offer those instead of just specific games.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And that makes sense, because if you think about it,

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I offer like a download for a specific indie title.

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Maybe that title's not popular anymore.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And now it's just, you can't sell it.

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Whereas if it's a, say, $60 card or something like that, then you can buy it.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What about, like, the fact that it seems with this,

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Sony might be trying to bring this in-house

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and force digital transactions to go through their own store?

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, it doesn't sound like that that's the case.

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I think it's more of an issue that it's just that they're going to,

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
that maybe these didn't sell that well.

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Instead, they're going to address the need in different ways

257
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so that you can buy those points and then purchase them through this,

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you know, purchase your games through the store once you have those points.

259
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So there's more flexibility there.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I think that it makes sense, because think about it.

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Instead of printing several different types of cards,

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
you can just print the one card,

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and then you can use it for multiple things versus just having all this.

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It reduces shelf space.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It reduces the need, the extra cost of manufacturing that stuff.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And it's giving the consumer what they truly want out of that.

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Instead of buying three $20 cards,

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you just have one for a full retail price of a game.

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So it sounds like they're still going to be doing, like, you know,

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
DLC and add-ons, different currencies and stuff like that, season passes.

271
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's another thing you see quite a bit of.

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So the trending page, if you go to Recruitment on Monolith Sauce website,

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you see this Zelda-filled page.

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But here's the thing, I think a lot of people,

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
there's a lot of, like, big jumps to conclusions people are making here.

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
For one, on the internet?

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Anyway, for one, of course they're making a fucking Zelda game.

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Of course they're going to make another Zelda.

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Of course another Zelda.

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I mean, would Nintendo just decide, you know what, we're done.

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, they are making several Zelda games.

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's not like we're talking about F-Zero here.

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I know, it's like, Zelda, you get three games, F-Zero.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Zelda, you get more games.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
F-Zero never happens.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Metroid, you get some more games too.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
F-Zero, you get Falcon Punch.

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
F-Zero, we're going to, you know what,

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
there's these indie guys that are doing this Super HD Racing game.

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I can't remember the name of it in the moment.

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's the big game on Switch that they...

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Fast Neo, Neo Racing, that one.

293
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And no shade towards that game because it's great,

294
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
but clearly Nintendo's like, oh, we got that, we don't need F-Zero.

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's all about the Mario Kart now.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But anyway.

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Mario, you're going to get more games.

298
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yoshi, you're going to get a ton of games.

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And, uh...

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Excite Truck.

301
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Anyways.

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We hate racing games is what they need to basically say.

303
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You know what, they just need to make a Zelda racing game.

304
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Are you Mario Kart? No. Sorry.

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Anyway.

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But here's the other thing.

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think some of y'all forgot.

308
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Like, oh my gosh.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Is the next Zelda going to be like Xenoblade?

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Is that what's happening?

311
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Because, like, Monolith's doing... Well, hold on.

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Monolith's hiring for positions that are related to the Zelda project.

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Y'all might have forgot.

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Monolith helped on Breath of the Wild.

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
OK?

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm like, dear people on the internet, calm by tits.

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Calm it.

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I mean, maybe they are doing a little more.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's not like Nintendo is unheard of to seek out third party support.

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
For example, what, Namco fucking

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
lended a hand on Smash Brothers, right?

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Am I crazy on that?

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't think you're crazy.

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So anyway.

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You know what else they lended their hand on?

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
F-Zero!

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Where's my F-Zero, Namco?

328
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Of course, they don't make racing games either.

329
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So, you know, I guess.

330
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Monolith did the maps, I believe.

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The landscape, the environment, I think

332
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
was a big thing that Monolith did.

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And based on how most of y'all felt

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
about Breath of the Wild, myself included,

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I think we would like Monolith to keep doing that.

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They did a pretty fucking good job.

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah, Monolith.

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Was it them or Nintendo that came up with

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the weapon durability?

340
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The weapon durability is not

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
a bad mechanic, OK?

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It was a little much.

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I just wish there was a way you could

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
tone it down. So maybe things break

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
a little less often.

346
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's why you have to hurry up and get the fucking mouse.

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I want it to tone down to zero.

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't want it in there.

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It would be nice if maybe there's a mode

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
where you can just turn off the...

351
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Hardcore mode. Call it hardcore.

352
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh no, I'm thinking the opposite.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Master mode. I want Bobby Black Wolf

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
BFF mode where nothing breaks.

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And you already know all the recipes

356
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and all that stuff. You just go out there

357
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and eventually... You know what? You don't have to know the recipes

358
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
as long as you know the combination.

359
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's true. I have an internet.

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Dan got me a cookbook.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The Breath of the Wild cookbook.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's not a legit cookbook. It's just

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the in-game cookbook.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Miltonius Games in chat says,

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
weapon durability stressed me out.

366
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Same. My heart rate definitely went out

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
playing Zelda.

368
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I like some of the mechanics with the weapon durability.

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I loved Breath of the Wild.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If I could change one thing,

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that was the one thing where I'm like, OK.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If you got a shitty little sword,

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you could use it as a projectile.

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Or having

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the wooden weapons if it was...

376
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I thought it was a neat addition.

377
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I did, but that was better.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But you know what should not be changed ever?

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The fairies were fantastic.

380
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And the horse fairy.

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What were they called? The little mariachi things

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
that would increase your health and stamina?

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, the yaha!

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The ones that you had to steal their poops.

385
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Can you do that noise again?

386
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yaha!

387
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I actually have that as

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a sound tone on my phone.

389
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Corox.

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's it. That's it.

391
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And you had to collect their poop.

392
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The seeds.

393
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Their poops.

394
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And you get a giant turd out of it.

395
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm sure not going to be poop

396
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
is another Zelda game, especially if Monolith

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
is fulfilling a very similar role.

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Honestly, would anyone be disappointed

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
if they just did Breath of the Wild

400
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
like a very similar type

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
of game, but like a new map

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and a couple new mechanics

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
but basically it's Breath of the Wild 2?

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Would anyone really be disappointed

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
if Nintendo put out that game? Because I don't think I would be.

406
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You know what I would want, even though they said

407
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
they're not going to do any more DLC for the game?

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I would want the world rebuilding mode.

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like, almost sim-like.

410
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You know? Or just different quests and stuff.

411
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because, I mean,

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Zelda, poor Zelda,

413
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
is coming back 100 years later after

414
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you know, basically making Ganon her bitch.

415
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And then it's like,

416
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
my house sucks. It's torn up.

417
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't know anybody in this world.

418
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We need to rebuild my kingdom here.

419
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No, no, no.

420
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's just Actraiser at that point, then.

421
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Exactly!

422
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm okay with that, TDH.

423
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let's see, VGRealness says

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
they are 100% going to use that engine again.

425
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I agree.

426
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That engine's amazing.

427
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm hearing it'll be Breath of the Wild 2 if not that exact name.

428
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No, it won't be the same name.

429
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why would they do that now?

430
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They never do the same name.

431
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But, I mean, if you look at Ocarina of Time

432
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Majora's Mask, I mean,

433
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
was the engine really that different?

434
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I mean, sure, you had the big moon.

435
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They were the same engine, and it played

436
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
very similar. And that's kind of more what I'm talking about.

437
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And Majora's Mask started off as a different game

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
using that engine.

439
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, right, right. I think I'd heard that too.

440
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's true. Anyway.

441
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
NinjaBunny in chat says,

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I didn't like Breath of the Wild at all.

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Ooh, she's different!

444
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Descenting opinion?

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Descenting opinion? No, I'm not

446
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
trying to give you crap. But there's always

447
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
one in the room, right? But that's okay.

448
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You know what? Here's the thing.

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Everybody's got that controversial

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
gaming opinion hot take.

451
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And people are entitled to be wrong.

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And mine is Zelda related too.

453
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Mine is that Ocarina of Time

454
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
is not what you all make it out to be.

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is it a good game?

456
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes. Is it the game

457
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
y'all hold it up as?

458
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
For a lot of people though, it was their big

459
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
thing. Like,

460
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
for me, and Dan will disagree,

461
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
but I think Link to the Past is the best.

462
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I would play Link to the Past any day

463
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
of the week, but maybe that's a GenX

464
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
thing, I don't know. Or

465
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
gamers of a certain age.

466
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, everyone. GenX exists.

467
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Cater to us. Alright. Anyway.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
NinjaBunny in chat says,

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm a guy, Rob. Gender is merely a suggestion.

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Come on, it's 2019.

471
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Um, let's see. Are you that insecure

472
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
in your masculinity?

473
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
There's also a quote, but I don't expect

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
everybody to know the quote that I gave there.

475
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm also being silly. Bobby Blackwolf in chat

476
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
says, popular opinion Super Metroid

477
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
is not all that. See, everybody's got that

478
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
one wrong-ass gaming opinion

479
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that they express once in a while.

480
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And those people should just not

481
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
express them. It's like with

482
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
the zit. You're not really supposed to

483
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
express them. Every gamer has a voice

484
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
starts off. I know, I'm being that bitch

485
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
tonight. Some of us have to scream a little louder.

486
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Okay. Anyway. And some people

487
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
just need to scream.

488
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
In all seriousness, let's move on to another story that's also

489
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
retro latest stuff, right?

490
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Doth it be my turn to speak?

491
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes, I think so.

492
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, once again

493
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
we have another attempt

494
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
at a little teeny Sega Genesis.

495
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
In this case,

496
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
it is going to be

497
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
the, um, basically

498
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
like a Genesis mini.

499
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I guess that's what they're calling it, yeah.

500
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So, um,

501
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
it's going to have, uh,

502
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
40 classic games installed. I hate

503
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that they say fucking pre-installed

504
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
because you're just fucking installing it.

505
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're not, like, installing it before

506
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
you're installing it. But it's locked.

507
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's pre-installed because they're installed

508
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
before you get the console and you can't

509
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
install more on them. Allegedly.

510
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Allegedly. Exactly. That's not gonna last

511
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
fucking long. Um, but the other

512
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
games that are included on there is, of course,

513
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Sonic the Hedgehog, Echo the Dolphin, Toejam,

514
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
and Earl. Um, a few

515
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
ones on there is Castlevania

516
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Bloodline, Space Harrier 2.

517
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Sega's doing a retro collection

518
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and Sonic is a part of it.

519
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Can I finish reading my fucking article, Rob?

520
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I guess.

521
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Shining Force, Dr. Robotnik's Bean Bean Machine,

522
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Comic Zone, Altered Beast, and Gunstar Heroes!

523
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Awesome!

524
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Um, the one hope

525
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that I have for this is that it's actually

526
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Sega behind it and

527
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
not outsourced, like the last

528
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
disastrous attempt.

529
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay, because that's what I was actually gonna

530
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
bring up, was that, wait a minute, we've had

531
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Genesis, well, they're not minis,

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
but you know what I mean, we've had Genesis available

533
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
at stores, Genesize,

534
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Mega Drive,

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
we've had, hey,

536
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Genesis, um,

537
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
but we've had the Genesis

538
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
stuff available at retail,

539
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the retro stuff, for quite some time

540
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
now. I believe they have, like, a

541
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
TV type and they have an on-the-go

542
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
type. You can buy one now for

543
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
$25.

544
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Those are probably all bargain basement right now because of

545
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
this other news, but,

546
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
so this is special because

547
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Sega is

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
like, policing it,

549
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
basically. Sega better be the

550
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
one releasing it.

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I mean, like, fully behind

552
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
all the programming, because we've had some just shit

553
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
emulation in the past. But, why is

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the controller only have three buttons, and why

555
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
is it not the six button controller?

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What?

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They're wired.

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
If Street Fighter isn't on it, you don't need six buttons.

559
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's probably not true. There's other six button games

560
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm not thinking of, but that's obviously the big

561
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
one. Uh, Dartetsuya in chat

562
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
says, as far as I know, it's in-house developed.

563
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Hell, I heard that Yuzo Koshiro

564
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
is composing the menu music. Oh, shit,

565
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
if that's true, sign me

566
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the fuck up. 70 of them. Right?

567
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Fucking love Yuzo Koshiro.

568
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I mean, he would give us our streets of rage.

569
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, I mean,

570
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
there would definitely be a precedent for him to be involved,

571
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
but I did not hear that.

572
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Anyway. But anything

573
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
that comes with it are, is the

574
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
console, two wired controllers,

575
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
um, a USB power adapter,

576
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
a power cable, and an HDMI cable.

577
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So,

578
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
sweet.

579
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Now, Akdeft in chat is pointing out, the

580
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Mega Drive Mini in Japan is

581
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
getting the six button controller.

582
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, then I'm gonna import mine instead.

583
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Um, now, you know, though,

584
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
this actually goes kinda along

585
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
with this, is that a few weeks ago

586
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
there was a, um,

587
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
a survey

588
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
that was put out

589
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
about for, you know, what would you want to see

590
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
as far as merchandise and games.

591
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And the ones that they were listing

592
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
on there were the Shining series

593
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
were Puyo Puyo,

594
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you know, were a lot of those

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
games that we're seeing on here.

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Gunstar Heroes, a lot of it.

597
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know, and so I wonder

598
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
if that survey might have been

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
related to this.

600
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I took it, you know.

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Maybe. Because I want all the Puyo Puyo.

602
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And what's funny is that I love that

603
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
they listed it as Puyo Puyo.

604
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And not as Puyo Pop or whatever the crap.

605
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I wish the console port actually opened

606
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
up and I wish they had the expansion port on the bottom so we can get

607
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Mini 32Xs and Mini

608
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Sega CDs. That would be kinda rad.

609
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The other thing about that survey is that they were

610
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
talking about originally Japanese only

611
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
franchises.

612
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And Questbuster points out, I did that survey too,

613
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
they were talking about some old properties like Panzer Dragoon.

614
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Well, but the thing is that when they were

615
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
putting the list of have you played these games

616
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
in the series, they were going

617
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to Japanese only ones. Like, they

618
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
listed, like, I do want to say

619
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
that they listed the PC Engine

620
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Puyo Puyo among them. Puyo Puyo

621
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Sun, which never came out over here.

622
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So it was fairly interesting.

623
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I think they're finally recognizing that there

624
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
are importers who have been fans

625
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
for a while. Sia Tabiri in

626
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
the chat says, would you guys want a 32X

627
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Mini? Yeah.

628
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because, I mean, it had some of the best arcade ports.

629
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I want a Saturn Mini. Yes.

630
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Or a Dreamcast

631
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Mini. I'll take either one. I'll take both.

632
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I would. Or either one.

633
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I mean, chances are I probably already have

634
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
everything that I would want on both, but.

635
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So none of y'all are Mini

636
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
systemed out? This Genesis thing sounds

637
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, I didn't bother with the PlayStation

638
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Mini because the emulation was

639
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
garbage. I didn't bother with it either just because

640
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
of the choices they made. I found NES

641
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Classics at Target

642
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
a couple weeks ago. Oh, really? For full retail.

643
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Pick those up while you can

644
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
if you want one because they're not coming

645
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
back. I already have one. Yeah, I've already

646
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
got an SNES Classic that I packed the

647
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
bits in. I think

648
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that's why they're not coming back. Zero.

649
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Nintendo's not happy with how fast those got

650
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
ripped open. Well, on top of that,

651
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
legit, all you need

652
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
is the old console and an EverDrive.

653
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The end. The end.

654
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I mean, if you're going to put data on those chips,

655
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
you're going to be able to get data

656
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
off of those chips. Well, and the other

657
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
advantage to having, though, the classic

658
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
series would be the HDMI support

659
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
with no input lag.

660
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's that. Well, let's

661
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
move on to another story.

662
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Loki, another another blast from the

663
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
past of sorts, right? Yes. And this is

664
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
kind of an odd odd one here, but

665
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
apparently Dance Central is

666
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
being ported to the Oculus Rift

667
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and apparently the Oculus Quest

668
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
as well. Why

669
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
is so the keep it going?

670
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I don't know how that's going to work. I'm assuming

671
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
that they're just going to track the arm motions

672
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
using the controllers. Kind of

673
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
similar how, I guess, Just Dance does it

674
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
with phones

675
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
or I guess it's all phones nowadays.

676
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
They don't really use the move controllers

677
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
or Wii remotes or

678
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
whatever the hell they have. Oh, you

679
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
mean the move dildos? Yep.

680
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So they're going

681
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
to be porting

682
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
that over. It says it's going to

683
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
be exclusive on both of those platforms.

684
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
This will be the first time

685
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
it's been on another platform

686
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
other than the Xbox. They haven't

687
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
given any sort of

688
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
specifics on

689
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
what's going to be included with it, if it's going to

690
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
include songs from the first three games

691
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
or if it's just going to be the first game or whatever

692
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
the hell it is.

693
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But it's interesting

694
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to see this. I'm curious

695
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
to see how it's actually going to work, being that

696
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
the game, I don't know,

697
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I guess you'd just see your avatar dancing

698
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
or something, but

699
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
it'll be interesting to see how this works.

700
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And also kind of curious

701
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
to the fact that

702
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
they're going to port

703
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
this to VR, but I'm surprised they didn't go the route

704
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
of, say, a Just Dance

705
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
game, where

706
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
since they're just using

707
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I would imagine, not necessarily head tracking,

708
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
but they're using just the arm tracking.

709
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So you could essentially

710
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
do just a Just Dance

711
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
game, but with Dance Central and port it

712
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
to other systems,

713
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
we'll have to see how it works, I guess.

714
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah, when I was reading about this, I was kind of thinking

715
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
like, gosh, this sounds really

716
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
cool, but if it was

717
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
like PSVR, that thing is kind of like a

718
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
beast to have on your head. And it's one

719
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
thing if you're playing something like Beat Saber

720
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
where, I don't know, my head

721
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
is staying pretty stationary. Sure, I do the bobs

722
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
up and down and things like that, but from what I remember

723
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
of Dance Central is that you were doing real

724
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
dances, and I just think with that whole

725
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
contraption...

726
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's pretty heavy, yeah. But, doesn't

727
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oculus, and aren't they trying to scale it back to more

728
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
just like goggles that you basically strap

729
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
on your face? Isn't that what the Oculus

730
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Go and some of the... The Go is,

731
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't know how light it is, but it's

732
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
similar to, I think...

733
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Again, I think it's one of those things that as technology

734
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
advances, it's not like my complaint

735
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
is not going to be valid anymore because

736
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
they're not going to be that heavy.

737
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I think, though, for me,

738
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
it would make more sense not to do it

739
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
just VR because you would want

740
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
to have it available

741
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
to as many people as possible

742
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that are going to play these games, and I would

743
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
think that the crowd that's doing Just Dance

744
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
would want to get into that.

745
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I don't know

746
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
how this is going to track any more accurately

747
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
than it would with...

748
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Unless, I don't think the base stations

749
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
can track your body movement, aside from

750
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
if you had sensors on your feet or something like that,

751
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
but... I don't know.

752
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I just think that it would work better

753
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
if they didn't do it in VR, but we'll have to see.

754
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And then also, how's that going to look? Because like,

755
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
you know, Just Dance originally,

756
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
or not even Just Dance, Dance Central, the whole

757
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
point was like, it was Kinect and you were just

758
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
kind of doing it without any sort of sensors

759
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
on you, and at least then that way you can

760
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
record yourself doing it and actually look like you're

761
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
dancing, but you're kind of looking weird dancing

762
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
with that giant VR headset on.

763
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I just think it's going to be weird, unless you can do

764
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
some virtual camera with your avatar or whatever,

765
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
but...

766
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Guess you can pretend you're dancing like no one's watching.

767
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I mean, I would be super

768
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
into this with the control,

769
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and what you were kind of saying,

770
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
the control mechanism, and that whole

771
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
thing with either the move, or the

772
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
similar, and I don't know what the technical name

773
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
is on the Vive, has those sticks

774
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
that you hold that kind of feel like a PlayStation

775
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
move, even though they're so different.

776
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But you know, I would be all for

777
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
playing a dance game with that type of stuff

778
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that's come a long way since the Kinect,

779
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and just the fact that technology's advanced,

780
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
but yeah, I don't know about the whole

781
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
headset part.

782
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll try it, but it just seems

783
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
a little...

784
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I have to see it to believe this.

785
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Dance Central was so fun.

786
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I don't know if this is the case, but we're talking

787
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
motion gaming and stuff like that.

788
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Is it possible to play one of these games

789
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that uses the Vive controller

790
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
without the Vive,

791
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
or without the Oculus Rift,

792
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
just using the motion controllers and just playing

793
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
a game on your PC monitor or something like that?

794
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
PlayStation can, technically.

795
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So I don't understand, couldn't we do it like that?

796
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The move was purpose-

797
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I understand that there's some of those

798
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
trackers that use the inside-out tracking

799
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
where it'll actually use the headset,

800
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
but the older stuff

801
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
uses the base stations. Bobby's trying to explain

802
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
some of this in chat. There's no more base stations

803
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
with the Oculus Quest. Oculus Quest is now

804
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
all inside-out tracking, so

805
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oculus Touch, not with the Oculus Quest

806
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
because the sensors are all in the headset.

807
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
There are no more base stations.

808
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So it would depend on which piece of technology

809
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
you're using, basically. I guess. I don't know.

810
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I just think that they would have a better adoption rate

811
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
with it being outside of VR,

812
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
but I'm curious to see how this plays.

813
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But also,

814
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Bobby's pointing out that

815
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oculus is paying for the

816
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Dance Central game, and that's

817
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
why it's exclusive, so it's not something

818
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
that- Are we not gonna get Kinect Star Wars now?

819
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
No dancing to the Han Solo?

820
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Or anything like that?

821
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Maybe you can hope for a secret unlock

822
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
or something in the game. I don't know.

823
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
No? Alright.

824
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Well, moving on. Let's talk about

825
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
everybody's favorite. It's a rumor,

826
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
but the Wall Street Journal

827
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
is reporting on this one, so

828
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
this is one of those rumors that's so loud

829
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
it's got the attention of the traditional

830
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
press, and in the case of the Wall Street

831
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Journal, a lot of investors and people

832
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
that, you know, keep their eye on the money and such,

833
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
so take with a grain of salt, but

834
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I know for me, this isn't the first time

835
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I've heard this rumor, but- We've also thought

836
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
of similar things. Yes. So anyway,

837
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
here it is. Wall Street Journal is saying that

838
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Nintendo is looking at doing two

839
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
new Nintendo Switch models, and

840
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
one of them could be this summer.

841
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Possibly timed around E3,

842
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't know, that's me making that up, but

843
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I mean, it could be interesting if Nintendo were to

844
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
say, you know, at E3,

845
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
they're doing their direct, we're looking at doing this

846
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
new Nintendo Switch, and I don't think they could do

847
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the whole, it's in stores today,

848
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
because it's very hard to keep those kinds of secrets anymore,

849
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
especially with physical things, but they could say

850
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and it's going to be on shelves

851
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
next Friday, you know, they could

852
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
have that type of fast turnaround, maybe.

853
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm fanboying a little

854
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
bit here and making things up, but they could.

855
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Anyway,

856
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
apparently one new Nintendo

857
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Switch model is going to be enhanced and

858
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
more powerful than the Switch you have today.

859
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We're not talking like 4K

860
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
graphics, we're not talking Xbox

861
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
One X, we're not talking PlayStation 4 Plus,

862
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but it's just going to be more powerful

863
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
than what we have today.

864
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So far I'm a little worried, because

865
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
this reeks of new 3DS

866
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
versus 3DS, and

867
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
does this mean now we're going to segment the game market?

868
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I hope it's not that,

869
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
but we'll see, I'll give Nintendo the benefit of the doubt,

870
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
after all, this is a rumor. The only thing I could see is

871
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
maybe that it's a 1080p

872
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
screen, and they have something to push the graphics

873
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
1080p portable instead of

874
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
just, you know,

875
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
720 portable, maybe?

876
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I like that, let's go with that.

877
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
We'll go with that. More games in portable

878
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
mode running like they were docked.

879
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I like that.

880
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But there's also going to be a second model.

881
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's going to be cheaper, because it's going to

882
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
focus on the handheld mode, meaning

883
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm assuming to take this to mean there's not

884
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
really going to be a dock. Nintendo

885
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
is looking for this to be

886
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
the successor to the 3DS.

887
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Finally.

888
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Finally.

889
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The 3DS may finally

890
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
be done. But I don't understand how they're going to make this

891
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
any cheaper, though. Well, you get rid of the

892
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
dock, that's going to be part of it, and then

893
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
just the fact that it's been a couple years

894
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
maybe it'll be a little smaller, you know,

895
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
who knows. Maybe the touch,

896
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
maybe they'll eliminate the touch, because not a lot

897
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
of games really use it, to be fair. I'm making

898
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
shit up, Nintendo will be the ones

899
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
to answer this, but there's ways they can scale it back

900
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
a little bit. Okay.

901
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But anyway, the Wall Street

902
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Journal reporter, in the name

903
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
of the guy that's been talking about this on Wall Street,

904
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
is Takahashi

905
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Moshizuki, is saying that

906
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
the different designs of these two Nintendo

907
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Switch systems are different from the

908
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
original, and you'd be surprised.

909
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm not sure what to take

910
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that to mean. Perhaps the actual

911
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
system may look different.

912
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Perhaps, you know what, Loki, maybe

913
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
to save on cost, maybe

914
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
the portable Switch, you can't

915
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
take off the sides.

916
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Maybe those don't, like it's

917
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
just something that you can play

918
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That's gonna suck.

919
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You know why? It's gonna

920
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
suck because if those

921
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Joy-Cons

922
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
handle dirt

923
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and dust and whatever, like the ones I

924
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
have do, it's gonna suck because they're gonna

925
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
break and then you're gonna have a whole system to

926
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
replace. DJ Rama S

927
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
says, Rob, stop hating on the 3DS.

928
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm not hating on the 3DS.

929
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The 3DS and the DS, therefore,

930
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
have a wonderful, it's so

931
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
important for the history of portable gaming, and

932
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
there's a library of amazing games on

933
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
it that people should play, and if you never touch

934
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
one, you'll be missing out on some very great

935
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
experiences. That being said,

936
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Nintendo has a

937
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
better portable system out now.

938
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's been many

939
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
years, many years since the first

940
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
DS especially, but to be

941
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
fair, even quite a few years since the

942
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
original 3DS, it's time to

943
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
move on. Like, I

944
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
just can't think of any other console

945
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
that's like lasted this long.

946
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I kind of think what Nintendo

947
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
was doing is after they got burned a little

948
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
bit with Wii U, they didn't want to put

949
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
all their eggs in the Switch basket

950
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
until the Switch was a bona fide success.

951
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Well, guess what, y'all? The Switch

952
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
is a success. The Fides have been

953
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
bonuts. The Fides have been bonuts.

954
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, therefore,

955
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
they can move on from the

956
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
3DS now and let its great

957
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
legacy live on in our

958
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
hearts and in our retro game collections.

959
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Is that hating on the 3DS?

960
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
No. Alright, I didn't think so.

961
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Alright. Let's see,

962
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
other comments in chat.

963
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Bob Coffee says, I imagine Nintendo will

964
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
announce a cheap portable, one

965
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
portable only one for

966
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Pokemons. You know, that's a great observation.

967
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If there's any time

968
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
to release like a mini Switch,

969
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
it's cause of Pokemon. I think

970
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I think you're, ding, ding, ding,

971
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
winner, winner, Pokemon

972
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
dinner, because

973
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and which Pokemon is up to you? Because

974
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
it would seem like a

975
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
given that you would have this

976
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
bundled with Pokemon

977
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
like same day, like if Nintendo

978
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the mini one will

979
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
be out with Pokemon. Bank on it.

980
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Bank on it.

981
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Let's see.

982
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
ActDeft in chat says,

983
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
new Switch XL or something like that.

984
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Who knows? Who knows what the actual

985
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
system will be called. Tiger Claw

986
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
says, the Switch is a success

987
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
because it bridges the gap between handheld

988
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and console. And the fact that

989
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it's just got Nintendo's brand

990
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
all over it, you know, and

991
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
going back to like Zelda from earlier.

992
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Like, that's just not a game

993
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
that exists anywhere else.

994
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
There's things that try to emulate

995
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
it and come, you know, I mean, certainly you can

996
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
say, well, Breath of the Wild was

997
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
inspired by Skyrim, but there's

998
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
nothing like Breath of the Wild.

999
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
There just, anywhere. There just isn't.

1000
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Anyway. Alright, let's move

1001
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
on. Darsakra, what do you

1002
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
got for us? A little more facts.

1003
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Things that are actually happening, for sure.

1004
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Well, do we remember a particular

1005
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
game that never actually came out called

1006
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Penn and Teller Smoke and Mirrors?

1007
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think that we do remember

1008
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
this one, because that's what gave us Desert Fucking

1009
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Bus. I was going to say, Desert Bus

1010
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and the, basically,

1011
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the marathon,

1012
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
the charity event, the drive

1013
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that they do for that every year

1014
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
is because of Smoke and Mirrors, for sure.

1015
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Exactly. Well, it looks like

1016
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Penn and Teller are getting back into

1017
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
the tie-in

1018
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
video game stuff.

1019
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So, um, they are

1020
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
going to, and whoever

1021
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
wrote this article that I'm reading it from clearly

1022
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
never knew about the Sega CD game

1023
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and only knew about the Desert Bus Marathon.

1024
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
These kids today. So,

1025
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
whatever the fuck. Um, anyway,

1026
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
so, they did announce at PAX

1027
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
East that Gearbox is going to be

1028
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
working with them to do an Oculus

1029
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
game. Oculus,

1030
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
the Vive, the PSVR

1031
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
headset that's going to be called Penn

1032
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and Teller VR. Frankly, unfair,

1033
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
unkind, unnecessary, and underhanded.

1034
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I like that.

1035
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I do think the name

1036
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
is great. They only have a title and a release date.

1037
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Um, which

1038
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm looking to see if they put

1039
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the release date in a stupid article.

1040
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Um, but at any rate,

1041
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
um, it is going to be

1042
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
developed by Gearbox, so hopefully it will be

1043
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
better than

1044
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Smoke and Mirrors was supposed to be.

1045
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Um, but yeah, the one thing

1046
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
they have on here is that it's going to be released in

1047
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
June. They don't actually have the specific date

1048
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
on it. But this, that name is great

1049
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and it's fun to say.

1050
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Unfair, unkind, unnecessary, and underhanded.

1051
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah, no, I like, the name is great.

1052
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I just, I hope that Penn

1053
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and Teller and the things that they do,

1054
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I hope they don't use this as an excuse to make

1055
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
like VR make me sick on purpose

1056
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
type of thing. I hope it's a little,

1057
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I hope it's controlled.

1058
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Well, and it was always

1059
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
my impression that at least

1060
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Penn doesn't

1061
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
really care for video

1062
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
games that much. So the fact

1063
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
that they are licensing out to do

1064
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
a video game is a little bit beyond me

1065
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
so maybe, well, given

1066
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Do you know what he likes more than games? Money.

1067
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah, but they're

1068
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
fairly successful. No, they are. Their show's

1069
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
been at the Rio for eons. Well, on top

1070
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
of that though, they also have, I don't know if they still have

1071
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that TV show where it's like, they try to

1072
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
fool the magicians.

1073
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But, you know. Oh, yeah.

1074
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And that's pretty fun to watch. I like that they've actually

1075
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
been fooled a couple of times, but

1076
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
not often. But

1077
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
at any rate, you know, it's

1078
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
it's just very interesting and I have

1079
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
a feeling that there's going to be a lot more commentary

1080
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
in this one, you know, down the line.

1081
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So. Now, I

1082
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
sorry, I was gonna say, I know you're not

1083
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
a big VR person because of the motion

1084
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and, you know, some of the other things that you deal with, but

1085
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
if there is a

1086
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
well, I guess there already was an, I see Bobby saying in the chat,

1087
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
there already was a Desert Bus VR, but let's

1088
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
say it's a Desert

1089
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Desert Double Decker

1090
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Bus VR. Would you give it a try?

1091
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
No. No. Because I won't play a VR game.

1092
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It was worth a shot.

1093
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'll play it. I'll try it.

1094
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I actually was trying to double check

1095
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
to see if I could find the quote and it's back from

1096
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
2012.

1097
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And

1098
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
talking about how there is

1099
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
the video games

1100
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
for a little while.

1101
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay, here's the thing that I want.

1102
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The cliche of the nerdy kid who doesn't go outside

1103
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and just plays games is completely untrue.

1104
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's also true for the nerdy

1105
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
kid who studies comic books and turns them into

1106
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
basically saying that the obsession

1107
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
with video games can turn into

1108
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
a creative outlet and become

1109
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
a career or something

1110
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that would make them a creative genius.

1111
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'd be curious where their opinions

1112
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
are at all these years later now.

1113
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The video games are much bigger.

1114
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's not that long ago.

1115
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I guess that's true.

1116
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So maybe I was wrong about the not liking games.

1117
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Maybe that was just like in the 90s.

1118
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Maybe that was the case and it changed in the

1119
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
aughts. That's kind of more what I was getting at.

1120
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Maybe their opinions kind of come around as

1121
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
now everybody's got cell phones

1122
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and more people play games because of cell phones.

1123
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's a quote we're now. We've all got cell phones

1124
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
so come on. Let's get real.

1125
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Bobby wants to point out though Gearbox made

1126
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
it and Penn would never allow them to make

1127
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
a game where it makes you sick. Fair enough.

1128
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
They trust Randy Pitchford who is also

1129
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
a magician.

1130
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I thought I heard he put on

1131
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
a magic show at PAX or something.

1132
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
He did.

1133
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Bobby also watches that show and said they did

1134
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
get fooled every episode.

1135
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's probably, here's the thing

1136
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
those shows are edited in a way. They probably

1137
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
shoot like 20 of those guys

1138
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and gals every day

1139
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and then they shuffle them in a way so that every

1140
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
episode has one. Granted I don't really watch the full

1141
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
episodes. I've just watched a bunch of it on YouTube

1142
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
because I hate watching

1143
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
sitting down for a whole episode of something.

1144
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And I might be wrong. Wasn't it on some obscure

1145
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
cable network? I could be wrong. I thought it was

1146
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
like I

1147
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I always saw it on YouTube ever too.

1148
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I just pull up a bunch of YouTubes of like

1149
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
you know different acts within it and try to watch

1150
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
them so maybe I just

1151
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
don't have. I hate sitting down and just focusing

1152
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
on a TV episode. I mean I will

1153
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
only do that for just like things that I

1154
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
am super fan girl about.

1155
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It was on the CW apparently

1156
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
which yeah that is an obscure

1157
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
broadcast network. I'm sorry. Speaking

1158
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
of CW. The only thing I know about on CW

1159
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
is Supernatural

1160
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and DC stuff. Well the

1161
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
DC stuff is, DC is garbage.

1162
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Oh and Top Model. I do not watch any

1163
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
DC shows but Supernatural

1164
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
is going to be on its last season. Yeah I heard.

1165
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Finally I mean

1166
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I love the show but I stopped watching after like

1167
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
season 10 and then

1168
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I've gone back and tried to like watch again

1169
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but

1170
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
it was supposed to end after season 5.

1171
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That was the

1172
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
end of the original story.

1173
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Spoiler. Sam goes to hell.

1174
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That's the end of the season.

1175
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I think that's how Buffy season 5 ended too

1176
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
sort of. Well no. In season

1177
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
6 she died. Yeah. And then they

1178
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
did a season 7 which was garbage.

1179
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I mean it was okay. I mean there's

1180
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
some big stuff that went but it wasn't a

1181
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
great season. Now Pod Culture in chat says

1182
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
don't be ragging on DC. I know some people

1183
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
that are really. You are welcome to enjoy

1184
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
terrible story writing.

1185
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Pod Culture and I know the critical myth gang

1186
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
are like into those shows.

1187
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Good for them.

1188
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm just waiting

1189
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
for Disney to get their shit together

1190
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and I'm also waiting for season 3 of Jessica Jones.

1191
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But that's going to take

1192
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Disney getting their shit together right? Because there's no more

1193
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Netflix Disney thing right? Disney's going to do

1194
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
their own thing.

1195
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Will they still have Kristen Ritter and all that?

1196
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I hope she was good but you know

1197
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
it's funny though. I like

1198
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I finally picked up a Captain Marvel

1199
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
pop but I'm calling them

1200
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
comic besties because they are besties in

1201
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the comics. So

1202
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
that makes me happy. I have my comic besties.

1203
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Alright let's move on

1204
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic

1205
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
game of the week. First Loki.

1206
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Alright so I

1207
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
actually did get to check this out because

1208
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I almost forgot that it was even on

1209
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
but Sony you may remember

1210
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
was doing their state of play

1211
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
which is kind of like their Nintendo Direct thing

1212
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and so they actually did

1213
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
show off quite a few different games

1214
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
that are going to be coming out for the Playstation.

1215
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Actually a lot for the Playstation VR as well.

1216
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So to kind of run down some of the stuff

1217
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
that they showed.

1218
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Concrete Genie which is a pretty cool looking

1219
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
game. They have that coming out now with

1220
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
VR support as well.

1221
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They showed a

1222
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
trailer for Marvel's Iron Man

1223
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
VR which my kids are definitely all

1224
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
over. More gameplay

1225
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
of Days Gone which

1226
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
doesn't have a fucking release date.

1227
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I thought that was supposed to be out by now.

1228
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Well

1229
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
it's not.

1230
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Blood and Truth which is

1231
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
a

1232
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
it looks like almost like a spin off

1233
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
of the game that they had in

1234
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Playstation Worlds where you kind of

1235
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
play like the mob series and stuff but it's

1236
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
another VR game. Ready Set

1237
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Heroes look pretty cool.

1238
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
They had

1239
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Observation which is a

1240
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
game that came out on Oculus

1241
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Quest. Now it's coming to Playstation

1242
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
VR. They were showing

1243
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
off

1244
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
they're going to have retro skins for Crash

1245
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Team Racing Nitro Fields.

1246
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The old school polygon

1247
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
stuff that's going to be in there.

1248
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh that's silly I like that. Yeah so they have

1249
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
those. That's a good kind of silly.

1250
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
They showed off a new trailer for Mortal

1251
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Combat 11.

1252
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I can't believe

1253
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
that game is only like three weeks away. I feel like

1254
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I just heard it was coming.

1255
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I got to say with as much as you know my

1256
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
opinion on the Mortal Combat franchise and all

1257
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
that it's too much for me but

1258
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I got to say they did that launch pretty well.

1259
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
They announced it and then like two months later it's here.

1260
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You may remember No Man's Sky

1261
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
got the new Beyond

1262
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
expansion that's going to be coming out which is that brandy thing

1263
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
but they also have a new patch that's going to be coming out

1264
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
soon that's for Playstation

1265
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
VR as well so you'll be able to play that game

1266
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
in that.

1267
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That's kind of rad.

1268
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't know how often I would like really use that

1269
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
but I think it would be fun a couple

1270
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
of times to just explore the worlds

1271
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and VR kind of get my fill of that

1272
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
and that would be cool.

1273
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I think I did hear though that that same patch is

1274
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
going to hit the PC and the relevant

1275
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
VR platforms on PC too. Yeah so that would be cool

1276
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and then definitely another one. You'll have fun with

1277
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Robby's Five Nights at Freddy's VR Help Wanted.

1278
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Hell no. It's going to be coming out

1279
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
as well. Hell no. It's

1280
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
a great thing for the

1281
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
franchise. It's the same guy doing it but now he's

1282
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
doing a VR game. Yes and my son totally wants to

1283
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
play that as well so that'll be... I hope y'all

1284
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
have fun. That'll be fun.

1285
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I feel about that the way Jamie does

1286
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
about the DC stuff. I didn't see it in here

1287
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
on this list but I think that they announced

1288
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
also Dreams is going to have that

1289
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
beta test for Dreams as well.

1290
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I think, I don't remember if that was part of this

1291
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
presentation or not but

1292
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
yeah lots of things

1293
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
coming out. Oh and then they also showed

1294
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Vacation Simulator again and they announced

1295
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
the release date for that because I know I'm looking forward to that one.

1296
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That's June 18th.

1297
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah. Lots of

1298
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
stuff. I think we only touched on some of the

1299
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
things that were in there but it was

1300
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
a decent presentation.

1301
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I hope they do more of them.

1302
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
SSG100Matt says

1303
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
how many biddies to get Rob to play Five Nights

1304
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
at Freddy's VR? I

1305
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
would only do it for charity. I wouldn't do it for

1306
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
as much as Bobby's going to grit

1307
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
his teeth. But I think he'll agree

1308
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I would only do it for charity. I wouldn't do it

1309
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
for our own pockets.

1310
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I would stream it here

1311
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
but I'll only do it for charity.

1312
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I haven't thought of a number yet.

1313
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
We'll see.

1314
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I'm like

1315
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
getting scared just thinking about it.

1316
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
The jump scares in those games are

1317
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
horrible.

1318
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I can't even imagine

1319
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
looking to the right and what those little creatures

1320
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
are. They have additional things that you do like

1321
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
repairing them and stuff.

1322
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm getting a headache just thinking about it.

1323
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Anyway.

1324
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Let's see.

1325
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah, Shane's in chat saying

1326
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I told Rob he needs to play it the moment

1327
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
it got announced.

1328
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Siya Tabiri says

1329
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
who's charity and why will you play it for her but not

1330
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
for us? Oh you.

1331
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Alright, anyway. What did you think of the

1332
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
event itself? I heard it kind of got

1333
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
kind of a tepid. It was okay.

1334
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It just kind of seemed like it was just like trailer dump.

1335
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yeah. But I like, I do

1336
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
like and even though I saw some comments in chat like

1337
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
wow it was a lot of VR. I'm

1338
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
kind of glad that Sony is supporting

1339
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
this hardware that they put out and like

1340
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm okay with them like

1341
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
maybe so that they don't feel like they

1342
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
have to do this around E3 time. Maybe

1343
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
now, yes I know Sony's not doing E3 but

1344
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
still, maybe Sony's kind of like putting

1345
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
this information out there now so it's like oh hey

1346
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
look at all this stuff that's coming on VR.

1347
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You got a reason to own one. We're still

1348
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
supporting it. And I can

1349
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
appreciate that. So you know even if I'm

1350
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
not into the Five Nights at Freddy's thing

1351
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
yes I am into the No Man's Sky thing.

1352
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They're not going to have like some sort of announcements around

1353
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
E3. They'll do

1354
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
something but it might just be in this format

1355
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
because more and more want to do

1356
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
a direct style like they want to

1357
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
use and Microsoft

1358
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
has their Inside Xbox that they just

1359
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
had one like last week so

1360
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
yeah you know anyway

1361
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
um what was there was

1362
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
another comment in chat here I want to read oh

1363
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Spyro557 Jonathan in chat talking about

1364
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
the Crash Team Racing.

1365
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Oh by the way the low poly skins are

1366
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
a PlayStation 4 exclusive

1367
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
so you don't get them on Xbox or

1368
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Switch and maybe that ties into the

1369
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
fact that you know those games were

1370
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
PlayStation games there wasn't those

1371
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
same platforms didn't exist back then

1372
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
so maybe it's kind of a special thing for Sony

1373
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
because Sony was the original home

1374
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
of those games so

1375
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
all right well let's move on

1376
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and I think I've got one more story here before we

1377
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
get to the classic game of the week and this one is about

1378
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
you know and I've talked earlier

1379
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
in the show about how I really think subscription

1380
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
services are kind of the wave

1381
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
of the future and another company

1382
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
throwing their hat in the ring this week

1383
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Apple did a big thing earlier this week

1384
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and of course you know Apple does phones

1385
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and watches but this week was a

1386
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
very different type of event

1387
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
because and you know folks were anticipating

1388
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
this it was supposed to be about

1389
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
TV and what they're going to be doing for the

1390
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Apple TV and their own type of

1391
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Netflix slash Hulu

1392
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
slash you know that whole

1393
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
warehouse competitor and

1394
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
so here comes Oprah here comes

1395
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Spielberg who just

1396
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
hated on Netflix like a couple weeks ago

1397
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
if I'm not mistaken but whatever whatever

1398
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
because he's probably getting paid by Apple so

1399
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
you know somebody showed him money and now he's on board but anyway

1400
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
it sounds like they've got some neat things

1401
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
but that's not games I mean then there was the whole

1402
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
credit card thing which I was like I

1403
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I guess I mean because Apple pay

1404
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
but anyway that's not the game part the game part

1405
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
is they announced Apple Arcade

1406
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
which will be a premium subscription

1407
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
service for Apple devices so I think

1408
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
many people kind of figured this was coming

1409
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
we've heard these rumors about Apple for quite some

1410
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
time so

1411
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
iPhone

1412
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
iPad Apple

1413
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
computers meaning like Macs

1414
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
right and Mac Minis things like that everything in the

1415
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Apple family and Apple TV

1416
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
are all part of Apple Arcade

1417
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and so that kind of

1418
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
oh I was only expecting the phones and the iPads

1419
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I didn't think but it makes a lot of sense of course

1420
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Macs and computers will be in there

1421
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
too what are what's available in the service

1422
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
though well they're

1423
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
going to be getting games we didn't get a lot of

1424
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
details on like exactly the games

1425
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
but we do know the talent

1426
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
and they've got some big talent so just like

1427
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
they brought out Oprah and they brought out Spielberg

1428
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Sega

1429
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Konami we'll let it slide

1430
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Mistwalker which for me that's the

1431
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Mistwalker that's like

1432
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
fucking Lost Odyssey okay Mistwalker is a big

1433
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
deal Mistwalker is the studio that was founded

1434
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
by Final Fantasy Hironobu

1435
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Sakaguchi so

1436
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I think they kind of threw

1437
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
a lot of companies out there hoping something

1438
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
will stick with somebody and that's the one that stuck with

1439
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
me was Mistwalker I was like

1440
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
oh shit so the next Mistwalker game is going to be

1441
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
something on my phone but then I also thought

1442
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
oh but no it's going to be on Macs

1443
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
as well because there's that part of me that's like

1444
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
but I like

1445
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
the stuff I like to play on the phone

1446
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
was built for the phone

1447
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
like Ingress, Pokemon Go those were built

1448
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
for phones right there's not a lot

1449
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
although I don't know like Super Hexagon

1450
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I don't play a lot

1451
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
but the fact that it's on

1452
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Mac now

1453
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I'm like okay

1454
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I mean the only Mac we have is the

1455
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
one that's dedicated to the video for this but assuming

1456
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I took that plunge in the future or something

1457
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I got two in my house

1458
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and I actually just downloaded a game for mine

1459
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
right and you know for all the talk

1460
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
of LOL games

1461
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
on Mac in my opinion

1462
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
the biggest news out of this Apple

1463
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
thing is oh

1464
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
well yes we're bringing games to Mac

1465
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Konami, Sega

1466
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Mistwalker

1467
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
God what were all these logos on the screen?

1468
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Devolver Digital, Disney, the Chinese

1469
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
room which I thought they folded

1470
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
but I guess not. Right it's probably their

1471
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
catalog titles. I don't think it is

1472
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I because there was something else I read

1473
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
that said no the Chinese room like those guys

1474
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
are now a part of a different

1475
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
studio but they're using that brand on their newest

1476
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
project and the reason why I specifically

1477
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
call out Chinese room that was everybody's gone

1478
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Rapture and Dear Esther which I

1479
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
loved those games so when I saw

1480
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
their logo pop up I was like

1481
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I guess I could see that on a phone

1482
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
but I'd rather play it on a TV

1483
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I am super skeptical

1484
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
but okay. Yeah

1485
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
but anyway we don't know when

1486
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
we don't know oh

1487
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
here's the other bit Will Wright is another

1488
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
big name they've got on the service so I mean

1489
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
attracting the talent not an

1490
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
issue but there are still quite a few

1491
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
gaps in this such

1492
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
as when and how much

1493
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and those and what and

1494
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
well yeah and the the conclusion of

1495
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
what specifically exactly

1496
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
um and those are all fair questions

1497
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
to ask but I imagine we'll find out

1498
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
a little closer to when they're really ready to

1499
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
roll this out so um

1500
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
who knows but again I

1501
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
you know I think this is kind of where gaming

1502
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
is going anyway and I

1503
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
kind of think the big news out of this isn't

1504
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
really the phones as although

1505
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
certainly that'll be the big user this don't get me wrong

1506
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
but I think this is Apple's own way

1507
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
to kind of be like guess

1508
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
what since people have no problem

1509
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
developing for phones

1510
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
we're going to bring a lot of that to the Mac

1511
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
too and not to say they're not already doing that

1512
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
they have been doing that but I think the fact

1513
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
that it's going to be like this in bulk in one

1514
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
fell swoop so to speak

1515
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I think I think

1516
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
it's kind of the biggest most news worthy

1517
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
thing out of it but you know your

1518
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
mileage may vary so anyway

1519
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
um thank you Questbuster

1520
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I knew it was a studio that so Questbuster said

1521
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Sumo Digital bought what was

1522
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
left of the Chinese room because Chinese room

1523
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
laid off almost all of their staff except

1524
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
the people that founded it were still so

1525
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Sumo got those guys

1526
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
on board and so whatever they're developing

1527
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
will probably be different now because they're staffed on

1528
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
alright well let's just see but like I just

1529
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm so highly skeptical

1530
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
with that it's like without

1531
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
any sort of like here's what exactly

1532
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
releases like here's the talent we have that's cool but

1533
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I need to see what it is and how much

1534
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
it is and all that stuff a system is only

1535
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
as good as the games that are on it

1536
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
right? or a service

1537
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
they see those why not

1538
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
can the golden rule of gaming apply to services

1539
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
as well I would say sure because

1540
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I think before too long services

1541
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
are all that's going to be there no it's not

1542
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I just

1543
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I really do alright Bobby

1544
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
wants to point out though in chat at least it's not

1545
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
streaming so that is a good point

1546
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
this is very different from Stadia because

1547
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Apple's not streaming these

1548
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
things it's more of a

1549
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
game pass if you will you're going to

1550
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
log in download it and

1551
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
although you might think like

1552
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
you know oh my god bandwidth

1553
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
caps and things of that nature these

1554
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
games have not I don't think we're

1555
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
looking at any 60 gig phone

1556
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
games maybe two gigs

1557
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
but it's just going to be a different

1558
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
kind of currency

1559
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
here I suppose so that could make it

1560
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
very interesting we'll see

1561
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
we'll see anyway

1562
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
that's it for now let's move

1563
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
on to let's go back to a

1564
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
classic time let's go back to a classic

1565
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
time when you didn't have all these

1566
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
newfangled services the Googles and the Apples

1567
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
participating in gaming

1568
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it was no no it was Nintendo, Sega

1569
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and Sony at some point

1570
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
the classics so it's the classic game of the week

1571
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find

1572
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
a game that she thinks hey

1573
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
you guys should be showing this game a little respect

1574
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
if you can this

1575
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
one might be a little harder for people to find

1576
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I bought this in a bargain basement

1577
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
import at remember

1578
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Game Masters

1579
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
oh yeah I bought it from there

1580
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
dirt fucking cheap so tell us

1581
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
already what is the classic game of the week the game

1582
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
is Panzer Bandit

1583
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
it came out

1584
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
for Playstation

1585
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
in 1997 published by

1586
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Banpresto and developed by

1587
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Fill in Cafe

1588
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Panzer Bandit is

1589
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
a fun little

1590
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
beat em up brawler game

1591
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
it uses the same engine

1592
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
as Mad Stalker

1593
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Full Metal Force

1594
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and by the way actually it did get a

1595
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
PSN release in 2011

1596
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
only in Japan of course but we have

1597
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
ways of making that happen

1598
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
but anyway the way that you

1599
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
control the game first of all

1600
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
is you have two attack buttons

1601
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
strong and weak your directional pad

1602
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
for moving around crouching jumping

1603
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and then you have your shoulder buttons to change between

1604
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
foreground and background

1605
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
and can be used to activate your special attack

1606
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
so that was one thing

1607
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I thought was kind of neat for a brawler

1608
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
it kind of has that Fatal Fury

1609
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
kind of vibe with the two

1610
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
layers and

1611
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
then another thing

1612
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
for the

1613
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
game that's a little bit unique is that

1614
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
if you stand still during

1615
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
an attack it's guarding

1616
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
you also have a combo

1617
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
counter and an

1618
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
elemental attack that will launch

1619
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
an enemy off the screen

1620
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
so it's just a neat fun

1621
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
little game but basically

1622
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
it

1623
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it's a game that I'm actually surprised

1624
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
never did come out over here just for

1625
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
how fun it was and it was

1626
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
as far as I remember a little bit of a budget title

1627
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
when it came out but

1628
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and as we all know Banpresto

1629
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
was the one of the arms of

1630
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Bandai so

1631
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I mean they also the company is

1632
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
also responsible for giving us

1633
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Super Robot Tyson

1634
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Super Robot Wars

1635
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
so but I mean the game

1636
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
it's a little

1637
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
obscure I mean

1638
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
not many people have heard of it

1639
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
but when I

1640
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
played it for the first time I just

1641
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
was enraptured with it it was so much fun

1642
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
and so

1643
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
you know there's not really a lot to say about it

1644
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
it's just to beat them up

1645
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
another thing about it is you have 12 characters

1646
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
that you can play

1647
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
4 story characters and 8 unlockable bosses

1648
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
so there you go

1649
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
it's just fun classic fun

1650
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
brawling

1651
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
sometimes you need a good beat em up

1652
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and darn it you've just played the shit out of

1653
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Ninja Turtles and Simpsons

1654
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
it's time for something new

1655
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'd tell anybody if you can find

1656
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
this game or you get access to

1657
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Japanese PSN definitely

1658
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
own this one it is super

1659
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
duper fun actually some folks in chat

1660
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
over at twitch.tv slash vog network are

1661
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
saying some good things about it

1662
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
darticuya says getting a guardian heroes

1663
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
vibe orange right saying kind of looks like

1664
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
guardian heroes actf says

1665
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
this game looks great

1666
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
questpusher says it's like a lot of fun

1667
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
love me a good beat em up

1668
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
it's ridiculously fun

1669
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and kai judo says

1670
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
the kid is biting off sonics

1671
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
look no

1672
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
this different art style

1673
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I see where he's

1674
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
got the blue spiky hair

1675
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
if they did make sonic human in the movie

1676
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
it might have looked like that

1677
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
yeah but all you know lead

1678
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
video game characters in the

1679
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
late 90s had that whole

1680
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
extra big well I mean

1681
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
look at like

1682
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
any of the characters that have

1683
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
sort of sci-fi universe

1684
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
alien thing that's just the

1685
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
aesthetic but I mean

1686
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
clearly lots of fun

1687
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and screaming and blowing up

1688
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
cute robot enemies

1689
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
and the art style is fun and the

1690
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
it's just 2D brawling

1691
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
delightfulness

1692
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
so acquire it

1693
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
however you might need to acquire it

1694
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
look we have a boss battle coming up

1695
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
dialogue

1696
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
yeah

1697
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I noticed the

1698
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
beginning of the game had a really long

1699
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
kind of cut scene so I chose the video

1700
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
tonight kind of to start at the actual

1701
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
game because

1702
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
we don't always have 10 minutes of discussion

1703
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
on the classic game

1704
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
you see the plane jumping too

1705
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
like Cal is describing in Fatal Fury

1706
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
that's a really

1707
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
fun just added

1708
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
feature in the game I mean I don't like it in

1709
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Fatal Fury oddly enough but I loved it in this game

1710
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
so there you go Panzer Bandit

1711
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Panzer Bandit there you go classic

1712
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
game of the week sorry guys I got to take it off the

1713
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
shot now so those of you that are

1714
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
watching on Twitch you'll just have to go find that game

1715
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
for yourself play a little more maybe somebody will stream

1716
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
it on Twitch maybe Dark Sakura after they beat

1717
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Super Mario World

1718
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
oh fuck I don't even know

1719
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I thought you had this

1720
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
well no I do but I don't know where

1721
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
the PlayStation with our HDMI output

1722
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
it's a fair question

1723
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
where do I find the hardware to play it on these days

1724
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
well no shit we've got something like

1725
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
six PlayStations

1726
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
well I think it's on the PlayStation Network so you could just

1727
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Japanese

1728
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and I'm not going to bother making a Japanese account

1729
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
you could get the old school capture

1730
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
device like the one you used to have

1731
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I have his old capture device

1732
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
but we agreed

1733
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
that we were going to do Super Mario World

1734
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
in the future in the future down the line someday

1735
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
maybe I'll just put up a bunch

1736
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
of PlayStation games and say

1737
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
yo guys pick one educate the children

1738
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
on some of these obscure

1739
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
titles they know Mario World

1740
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
that game is fun I'm not saying don't stream that because that game is a lot of fun

1741
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and especially watching you and Dan both

1742
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
is going to be a hoot and holler

1743
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm just going to tell him he's a jerk

1744
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
speaking of retro stuff

1745
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
those of you that have followed me for a long time

1746
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
first thanks for putting up with my bullshit for all these years

1747
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
but second you might remember that when I was trying to do the YouTube thing

1748
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I started this little series called Let's Remember

1749
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
and I was doing like

1750
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
it's kind of like Let's Plays but I would put in

1751
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
a lot of facts in there

1752
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
you're like a pop up video

1753
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
oh my god that's a great way to describe it

1754
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
it was like pop up video but for games

1755
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
so I think I want to bring that back

1756
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
you guys

1757
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
not necessarily on my YouTube

1758
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
only there was a video platform that we're using more and more often

1759
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
these days

1760
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I'm just curious what you all on chat think about that

1761
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
is that something you'd be into you might want to watch

1762
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
check it out because here's the thing

1763
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
we should do something like that

1764
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
for a podcast

1765
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm going to tell you the moment

1766
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I knew I needed to do this and bring this back

1767
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
because it was last week it was 7 days ago

1768
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
do you know when?

1769
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
when I brought up the game Star Tropics

1770
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and so many of you were like

1771
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
never played it

1772
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I don't know much about it

1773
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I was like oh we got to fix this

1774
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
so

1775
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
you can blame Star Tropics for all of this

1776
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
so alright

1777
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
oh we got some good comments in chat

1778
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
thank you guys I swear I wasn't fishing for compliments

1779
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I swear alright

1780
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
but I think I will fish over to the

1781
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
other studio we're going to do a little break tonight

1782
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I did a few minutes

1783
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
of a play of

1784
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Crypt of the NecroDancer

1785
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
which ties in a little bit more maybe to last week's news

1786
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
but you're still all talking about it this week

1787
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
it's that Zelda game

1788
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
the Cadence of Hyrule

1789
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
that is basically this but with the Zelda skin

1790
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
but then I found a lot of you guys

1791
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
because maybe you don't follow music games so much

1792
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
maybe you don't know what Crypt of the NecroDancer is

1793
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
but you really want to play

1794
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
this new Cadence of Hyrule

1795
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
so I thought let's take a look so now we can all

1796
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
know what is

1797
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Crypt of the NecroDancer

1798
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
okay

1799
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
hello everybody it's Rob in the

1800
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
other room the other studio

1801
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and I thought for our break tonight we could take a look at

1802
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
this game now it's a little bit older

1803
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
but a lot of people are still talking

1804
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
about it this week

1805
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
or these past couple weeks ever since that Nindies Direct

1806
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
the game we're looking at today is called

1807
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Crypt of the NecroDancer

1808
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
like I mentioned it is a little bit older but you know

1809
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
just a couple years old

1810
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and today I'm looking at it on Steam

1811
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
but I know I've played this game quite a bit on the Playstation 4

1812
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
it might have been one of those PS Plus games

1813
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
at one point I can't remember

1814
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I know it's also on the Switch which is probably

1815
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
part of the reason why it's in the Nindies collection

1816
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
and it's on Xbox One

1817
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
it's pretty much

1818
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
if it plays games this game was

1819
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
probably ported to it at some point

1820
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
and since Orange Launch Radio

1821
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
is rooted in music

1822
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
based games such as

1823
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
DDR and the community where we really got

1824
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
our start there was obviously a lot

1825
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
that was very appealing about Crypt of the NecroDancer

1826
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
being that it was like oh it's a roguelike

1827
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
but it's also kind of a music

1828
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
game little twist to it

1829
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
so I thought we'd take a look at it because

1830
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
with the Nindies announcement

1831
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
in the past couple weeks

1832
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
that Cadence of Hyrule

1833
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
is on it's way out which is basically

1834
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
at least as far as you can tell

1835
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
this game but with the Zelda skin

1836
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I find there's a lot of people that don't

1837
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
necessarily know a lot about this game

1838
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
but are suddenly interested

1839
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
because of the Zelda tie in

1840
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
maybe I don't play a lot of music games

1841
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
but I'm going to play every Zelda game so I'm going to play that

1842
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I prefer to use my keyboard in this game

1843
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
so you might hear a little bit of clacking because I do use

1844
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
a mechanical keyboard

1845
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
but in this area you can move around

1846
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
you'll notice there's no I'm just moving around

1847
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
however I want I'm not tied down

1848
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
to the music or what have you

1849
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
so you're kind of free to do what you want to do in these modes

1850
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
but this is kind of like your central hub

1851
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
where you can go buy permanent upgrades

1852
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
which is very typical of a roguelike

1853
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
it's funny because the design

1854
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
of this game actually kind of looks like

1855
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
the old game Rogue

1856
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
which is where that term roguelike comes from

1857
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
if you've never seen it from way

1858
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
way back in the day

1859
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
it was a randomly generated dungeon

1860
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
that kind of looked like this a little bit

1861
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
so you can see in this hub there's

1862
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
various things you can do

1863
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
there's training modes you can do

1864
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
permanent upgrades, you can take away

1865
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
upgrades that maybe would be useful and so forth

1866
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
you'll notice that the game will allow you to

1867
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
play with a dance pad if you want

1868
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I guess it's a little more forgiving

1869
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
there's a tutorial as well if you forget what to do

1870
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
there's a bunch of other characters you can play as as well

1871
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
although again since I've made a little more progress

1872
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
on PS4 than I did on Steam

1873
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I don't really have a lot that I can play

1874
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
with right now so we'll just go ahead and

1875
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
keep Cadence which is

1876
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
what I'm going to keep right now

1877
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
although it may change like I believe if I

1878
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
pick one of these other characters

1879
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
yeah it may be like the bard

1880
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
no beats, you can move at any time

1881
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and enemies can move after you

1882
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
so this is like the Bobby Black Wolf mode

1883
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
and if you're bad at music games

1884
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
you have to slow it down a little bit

1885
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
so you don't have to worry about hitting everything on the beat

1886
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
so that might be helpful for some people

1887
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
oops I didn't actually want to switch to him

1888
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm okay with a little bit of a challenge

1889
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
because without challenge I won't screw up

1890
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
so anyway I've been gabbing for a few minutes

1891
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
let me actually show the game

1892
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
so we're going to go into zone one

1893
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and you'll notice there's that little meter at the bottom

1894
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and you have to move in tight because if I don't move

1895
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
see I get all these missed, beat skit

1896
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I get little deductions

1897
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
my coin streak might break

1898
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
or other types of deductions

1899
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
so I just picked up a whip that's going to let me

1900
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
have a wider attack and that's good

1901
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
that'll allow me to kill those enemies

1902
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
a little easier

1903
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
because you'll notice they kind of move like you do

1904
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
so I'm kind of strategically

1905
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I notice the length

1906
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
with the whip allows me to hit these

1907
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
little monsters

1908
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
that's what happens when I try to talk and play

1909
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I skipped a beat

1910
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I like that the shopkeeper sings

1911
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
so if I had like one more coin

1912
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I could get an empty heart container

1913
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
but I'm one coin short

1914
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
unfortunately

1915
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
now I believe I have until the length

1916
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
of the song

1917
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
to get through this level

1918
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
or there's like bad penalties or something

1919
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
so there's the little gem

1920
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
and gems are the things you can use

1921
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
to buy those permanent upgrades

1922
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I don't remember what the bomb switch does

1923
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
it's probably not good, but let's see

1924
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
oh

1925
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
now

1926
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
it kind of made a little dent in the wall

1927
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
and you can't, what's the barrel do?

1928
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
oh

1929
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
so if you get certain items

1930
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
you can try to

1931
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
yeah, I lost my multiplier because I ran into a wall

1932
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
but you can dig through the wall

1933
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
with certain items

1934
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and you might find like secret rooms

1935
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
so there's a treasure chest, okay vision radius

1936
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
that would be helpful in trying to maybe locate

1937
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
hidden rooms

1938
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
this dragon looks very scary

1939
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I died

1940
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
because I didn't have enough health to take on

1941
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
that dragon, that was a lot of monsters

1942
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
in that room, yikes

1943
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
so and then it gives you a little

1944
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
recap, I got 46 coins but

1945
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
lol you died

1946
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
so I got to go back to start

1947
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
and the whole process begins again

1948
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
but because I picked up that one gem

1949
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I don't know if one will be enough

1950
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
to get these permanent upgrades

1951
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
like I could get a permanent heart container

1952
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
if I had two gems

1953
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
but I don't, I only got the one because I did kind of crappy

1954
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I ran into a hard boss though

1955
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
yeah there's nothing

1956
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
available for one gem there

1957
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
and let's see

1958
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
so riches I could buy for one gem

1959
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
sure why not

1960
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
so that'll be something that will now show up in chests

1961
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
when I do another run through

1962
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
as is again kind of typical

1963
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
of where the roguelikes

1964
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
are at these days is that

1965
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
you play a lot of random generated

1966
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
you know if you play things like rogue legacy

1967
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
or other popular roguelikes

1968
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
you kind of go through the same type of

1969
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
random generated thing over and over again

1970
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
but the only way you really start to really make progress

1971
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
with that is that you're buying these

1972
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
permanent upgrades that therefore help you

1973
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
and in the case of Crypt of the Necrodancer

1974
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
you even have degrades

1975
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
that will take things out of chests

1976
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
where maybe it makes it

1977
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
so you have a higher chance of getting something you really want

1978
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
because chests could have really anything in them

1979
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
so let's see if I can do a little better

1980
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
maybe one more time

1981
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
try to get moving a little sooner here

1982
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
a little less talking

1983
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
now again I'm not going to have those same items in force

1984
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I don't have that whip

1985
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
so I'm trapping monsters in this hallway

1986
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
to try to get

1987
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I hit two keys at the same time

1988
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
at least I got a gem

1989
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
yeah these things are making quick work of me

1990
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
instead of trying to run face first into them

1991
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
you really want to strategically attack them

1992
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
from angles and stuff

1993
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
like I just did with that guy

1994
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
like I just did with that guy

1995
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
okay so now I got that vision radius item again

1996
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
this must be a shop

1997
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I have an apple

1998
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
for health maybe

1999
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
sure I'll take it, I need that

2000
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
and you'll notice that you use

2001
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
different combinations

2002
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
of keystrokes to use items

2003
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
yikes that was almost a bad situation

2004
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
oh wait no I want that

2005
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
that says something about low health

2006
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
yeah something's screaming down here

2007
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
oh it's this gold bat

2008
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
now what else is interesting about this game

2009
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
is that they actually added it to Steam Workshop

2010
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
so if you actually look on Steam Workshop

2011
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
there's already

2012
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
like Zelda type mods

2013
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
available for it

2014
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
like obviously people have skinned in

2015
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
some of their Nintendo favorites

2016
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
already into this game

2017
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and I did it

2018
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I got to floor two

2019
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
so now we get a different song that we can dance to

2020
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I'm sure some of you watching out there are far better than I am at this game

2021
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
but again we're just trying to help those who maybe haven't seen this before get a look

2022
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
so now I'm up to two gems

2023
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
so it's much more

2024
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
what the hell is that thing

2025
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
much more likely to be able to buy something in the lobby

2026
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
when I inevitably die in this one

2027
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
let's see

2028
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
oh that guy was kind of caught on that spring and kept moving up

2029
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
turn out the lights I don't want to do that

2030
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
hopefully the soundtrack is coming through pretty good

2031
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I know a lot of people are

2032
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
pretty into the soundtrack in this game

2033
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
and I think they do crossovers

2034
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
oh boo I couldn't kill that thing

2035
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
it must be one of those things where

2036
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
it's like a boo

2037
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
oh I'm stuck this way now

2038
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
those arrows are kind of

2039
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
oh boo

2040
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I lost my coin multiplier because I needed a key that I didn't have

2041
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
so yeah if you can imagine this

2042
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
but like to dance these Zelda songs and stuff

2043
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
that's probably going to be

2044
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
uh oh there's that dragon that got me last time

2045
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
ah much better that time

2046
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
see I just had to get him to follow me a little bit

2047
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
that's all there was to it

2048
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
alright well that's all there is

2049
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
to this little look here at

2050
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Crypt of the NecroDancer for tonight

2051
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
we've been going for about ten minutes

2052
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I want to throw it back to the studio

2053
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
but there you go a little look at what that game is all about

2054
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
if you haven't played it again

2055
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
it's available on a lot of different platforms

2056
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
you can check out the sweet soundtrack

2057
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
which incorporates popular songs from other franchises as well

2058
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I don't remember if I had said that

2059
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
you can see even in this menu

2060
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
there's a way you can play mods

2061
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
make your own mods and so forth

2062
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
especially on Steam and the platforms that support it

2063
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
there's all sorts of ways you can tweak this game

2064
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
and get a real sneak preview

2065
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
of what Cadence of Hyrule might look like

2066
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
but in the meantime I know I'm looking forward to Cadence of Hyrule

2067
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
and I'm sure many of you are as well

2068
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
so there you go

2069
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
a little look at Crypt of the NecroDancer

2070
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
we're going to go back to the studio live

2071
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
thank you me for that

2072
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
a little look at Crypt of the NecroDancer

2073
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Dark Soccer I saw you kind of looking at the game

2074
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
had you played that game before at all?

2075
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
or is that kind of the person you saw?

2076
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I haven't played it

2077
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I tried it a little bit

2078
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I just wasn't too interested in it

2079
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
it's fun but I understand the whole roguelike element

2080
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
and the random levels sometimes is not

2081
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
and I was really surprised with how little I could remember

2082
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
of that game

2083
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
even though I played it pretty heavy a year or two ago

2084
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
but when I was fighting that dragon

2085
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I was like oh crap I forget how you have to fight

2086
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
some of these monsters

2087
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
you kind of have to remember how to do that

2088
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
but I think it's such a strong indie title

2089
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
but it's also funny watching back the video

2090
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
because I didn't realize how loud the clacking was

2091
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I knew that would happen

2092
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
which is why I said in the video you're going to hear me typing

2093
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
which is good for the podcast

2094
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
because you can hear me clicking in time with the music

2095
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
or not

2096
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
but it was just kind of funny the way that all turned out

2097
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
so there you go

2098
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
as a reminder we're looking for more of our folks out there

2099
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
to submit some breaks for us

2100
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
or folks in studio

2101
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
possibly to do that too

2102
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
but man PAX East

2103
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
to be in this weekend was a great opportunity

2104
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I was hoping to see some video from PAX East

2105
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
but I understand y'all were having a time

2106
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
at PAX East so it's all good

2107
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
but if you are interested in creating a segment

2108
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
here for Orange Lounge Radio

2109
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
you can just reach out to us on Twitter

2110
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
or myself personally

2111
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I don't care at MrRobRoberts

2112
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
that's MrRobRoberts over on Twitter

2113
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
there's a million ways to find us

2114
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
it's very easy

2115
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
just send me an email

2116
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
robertvognetwork.com

2117
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
and that's fine too

2118
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
let's get back into some more gaming news

2119
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
actually quickly before we do that

2120
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I remember Jamie

2121
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
you kind of wanted to make this a regular thing

2122
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
where at this point of the show you do a podcast shoutout

2123
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
because we want to help our frenzies

2124
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
and things that do podcasts

2125
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I've been putting out for suggestions and haven't really gotten many

2126
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I'm going to save anything that I get

2127
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
for next week

2128
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
but in this one I normally like to do the independent ones

2129
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
but this is one that has been a mainstay

2130
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
of my favorites for quite some time

2131
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
from when they were vaguely independent

2132
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
on into corporate sponsorship

2133
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
and whatnot

2134
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
but it's called Stuff You Missed in History class

2135
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
it's by How Stuff Works

2136
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
and I love these podcasts

2137
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
they basically take

2138
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
different events or people

2139
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
or different things in history

2140
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
compile from different sources

2141
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
and try to give a very clear

2142
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
my favorite ones are the ones where they do

2143
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
unexplained events

2144
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
or things

2145
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
like the Lizzie Borden trial

2146
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
where she was considered innocent

2147
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
but people set all these different accounts

2148
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
and they try to put the accounts together to see

2149
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
what is the real outcome

2150
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I'm right now listening to one about Charles Adams

2151
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
of the Adams family

2152
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I did not know he was such a playboy

2153
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
and had two wives

2154
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
named Barbara

2155
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
our discord posted a movie poster

2156
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I guess they're doing a new Adams family movie

2157
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
but it's animated this time

2158
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
needs more Debbie Jelinski

2159
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
that's all I'm saying

2160
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
but she officially died

2161
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
bring her back

2162
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
we didn't see a severed head

2163
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
at any rate

2164
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Stuff You Missed in History class

2165
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
definitely worthwhile

2166
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
not just if you love history

2167
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
but learn something

2168
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
it's a really really good podcast

2169
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
and I love listening to

2170
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
the two ladies who are on it

2171
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
so they're a lot of fun

2172
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
speaking of podcasts

2173
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
you should be listening to, just a reminder that VOG Network

2174
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
is more than what we do here on Twitch

2175
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
we have some great audio only podcasts

2176
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
that we work with

2177
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
you can look up more information over at vognetwork.com

2178
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
and one I would particularly give a shout out to tonight

2179
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
would be Electric Sistahood

2180
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
just because I know they are in

2181
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Boston

2182
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
and go, I saw pictures of

2183
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
my sister all over Twitter this weekend

2184
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
so I know they go

2185
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
since they're based in the Boston area

2186
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
they go to PAX East

2187
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
that's like their home convention

2188
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
so I will be tuning in

2189
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
since nobody sent me a video tonight

2190
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I will be tuning into Electric Sistahood

2191
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
for the wrap up this weekend

2192
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
we did a podcast with them at PAX East once

2193
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
many moons ago

2194
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
so yeah, good times

2195
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
and then since I'll add to that

2196
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I haven't listened to them in a while

2197
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I have trouble concentrating at work

2198
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
when I'm listening to a long podcast

2199
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
or I shouldn't say concentrating at work

2200
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
concentrating on the podcast

2201
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
when I listen to a long podcast at work

2202
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
but the debug log is another good one

2203
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
they're a group of indie developers

2204
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
out in the Atlanta area

2205
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
who work in Unity

2206
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and they talk about Unity and game development stuff

2207
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
all the time and they have people on their show

2208
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
talking about different game development principles

2209
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
and all sorts of topics

2210
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
so go check them out

2211
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
wow, we all had a little plug tonight

2212
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I like that, I want to make this a regular thing

2213
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
spreading the love a little bit, good times

2214
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
alright well, let's spread around some more news

2215
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
but the rapid fire kind

2216
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
and there was a lot, honestly a lot of this stuff

2217
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
we probably could have spent a good 10 minutes talking about

2218
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
but there's a lot of news this week

2219
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
but it is what it is, let's rapid fire these next few stores

2220
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
so here's your games

2221
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
the gold lineup for April

2222
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
you've got on Xbox One

2223
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
the Technomancer

2224
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
and that's going to be coming out April 1st to the 30th

2225
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and then of course

2226
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Outcast's second contact is going to be

2227
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
16th through May 15th

2228
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
and then your Xbox 360

2229
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
compatible games, you're going to have

2230
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Star Wars Battlefront 2, the original one

2231
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
that's April 1st through the 15th

2232
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced

2233
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Warfighter 2 on April 16th

2234
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
through the 30th

2235
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
and then on the Playstation side of the house

2236
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
of course this month it's a little bit lighter

2237
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
because, you know, they got rid of all those other systems

2238
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
so now you have Conan Exiles

2239
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
and The Surge

2240
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
and one of those has a penis slider

2241
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I'll let you guess which one

2242
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
it's Conan

2243
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
thank you

2244
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
for letting us know

2245
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
thank you for keeping us informed

2246
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
and then of course

2247
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Risk of Rain 2 is something that they talked about

2248
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
during the whole Gearbox presentation

2249
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
and Risk of Rain

2250
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
was a 2D roguelike

2251
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Risk of Rain 2 is 3D

2252
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
and what's kind of cool about this is

2253
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
it's in early access right now

2254
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
you can actually purchase a copy

2255
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
but apparently

2256
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
well this is a little old now

2257
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
if you had purchased a copy before March 30th

2258
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
you actually got a free copy to give to a friend

2259
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
but it still looks like it's a pretty decent game

2260
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
so go check it out

2261
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I did not pick up a copy

2262
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
so I don't have a copy to give to anyone

2263
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
maybe

2264
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
maybe in a future time

2265
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
maybe

2266
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I may have the original game

2267
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
but I still haven't

2268
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I'm surprised I haven't played it

2269
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
well I wouldn't give away my copy of this game

2270
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
because I like this game an awful lot

2271
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
it's Minecraft and Minecraft made an update this week

2272
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
unfortunately it was not the 4K update

2273
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
that I was looking forward to

2274
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
but Minecraft actually removed

2275
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Notch who originally created Minecraft

2276
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
they removed him from the

2277
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
game's splash screens

2278
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
now one could infer that this may have to do with

2279
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
some of the things

2280
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
he says on Twitter

2281
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I blocked him because quite frankly

2282
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I don't give a shit what he has to say

2283
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
and that's my personal opinion

2284
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
but I don't know

2285
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
they're not saying, obviously

2286
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Microsoft is not saying what

2287
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
if it has to do with the guy specifically

2288
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
or what it is

2289
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I think it's probably just more the fact that

2290
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
the game has evolved so much

2291
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
since he sold this off to Microsoft

2292
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
yeah he hasn't really been working on it

2293
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
it ain't his game anymore

2294
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
it's now this Minecraft team

2295
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
at Microsoft that makes this game

2296
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
so the time was probably right

2297
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I do believe he is still credited

2298
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
like

2299
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I think in the

2300
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
actual credits

2301
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
it used to say on the title screen

2302
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
like it would rotate

2303
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
there's like a carousel of things

2304
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
kind of like our little ticker on Twitch

2305
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
there's carousels and sometimes you're gonna see it says

2306
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
follow Rob Roberts on Twitter

2307
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
or follow DarkSakura on Twitch

2308
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
you'll see those things

2309
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
well it's kind of like if one of those said

2310
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
well that would never happen here

2311
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
but if it said created by such and such

2312
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
and said person wasn't here anymore

2313
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
it's like they took that out

2314
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
so you don't even see it show up on the carousel anymore

2315
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
so that was the update they did

2316
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
that being said, where is my 4K graphics pack?

2317
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
yes I want 4K graphics in Minecraft

2318
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
well I got news for you, Notch is working on it

2319
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
but now he's not

2320
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
he wasn't doing shit with that

2321
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
that was all Microsoft's thing

2322
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I think that was a concept thing that really wasn't meant to go

2323
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
much further than that

2324
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
where is

2325
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
where's my Ouya Minecraft

2326
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
that I was promised

2327
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
when the Ouya came out

2328
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
was that really supposed to be a thing?

2329
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
it was on their screenshot

2330
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
it wasn't necessarily something that they may have had

2331
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
permission or saying

2332
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
this wasn't actually coming to the system

2333
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
here's an example of games

2334
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
you might see on the platform

2335
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
one of which is never really coming there

2336
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
anyway

2337
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I thought that was more appropriate for rapid fire news

2338
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
because one of those things where it's like, okay

2339
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
they did a thing, but whatever

2340
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
it doesn't really affect the game

2341
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
anyway, this is a big effect for the game

2342
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and hopefully will be fixed by the time the game comes out

2343
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
505 Games commenting on the Bloodstained

2344
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Ritual of the Night demo that they showed on the Switch

2345
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
at PAX East

2346
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
apparently wasn't running great

2347
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
it was a little choppy

2348
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
and unpolished

2349
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
505 Games did kind of comment on this

2350
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
to basically say there's still optimization

2351
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
to be done

2352
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
the build that was at the show is a long way from being done

2353
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
the final product should run more like

2354
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
the PC

2355
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
which is like the

2356
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
base one that all the others made

2357
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
was the PC version running well?

2358
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I wasn't there

2359
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
so I couldn't tell you

2360
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
why would you bring a demo for something that doesn't work?

2361
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
that's kind of where I'm at

2362
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
why did they bother to show it on the Switch then

2363
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
if it wasn't really working right?

2364
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
and if people ask about the Switch

2365
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
say, oh yeah we're working on it

2366
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
it's coming out to the Switch too

2367
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
we didn't have a version available to show you at the show today

2368
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
but whatever

2369
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
they made a choice

2370
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
at the same time, if they hadn't shown it

2371
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
then there would have been these other questions

2372
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
no, there wouldn't have been any other questions

2373
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I'm sorry, we don't have the Switch version available

2374
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
to show you at the moment

2375
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
it still needs some more

2376
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
enhancements

2377
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
it's unpolished and not ready for the show

2378
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
it'll be ready to go by the release date

2379
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I don't know

2380
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
anyway, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night is coming

2381
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
to the Switch this summer

2382
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
it's also coming for PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4

2383
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
pretty much everywhere you can play a game

2384
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
this game will be available

2385
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
moving on to Dark Sakura

2386
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
well,

2387
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Dead by Daylight is getting

2388
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
another character

2389
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
it's going to be Ash from Evil Dead

2390
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
yay!

2391
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Bruce Campbell probably needed

2392
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
to buy a new roof or something

2393
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
please, let him deliver the line

2394
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
this is my boomstick

2395
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
well, I remembered

2396
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
having seen him when I went to go see

2397
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
the man with the screaming brain at the Crest

2398
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
and he talks about how different

2399
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
roles are like, what he has to pay for something

2400
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I was like, I wonder if this one's going to be

2401
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
pay for his roof or a car or something

2402
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
well if you watch the little announcement trailer

2403
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
that was kind of the whole point of it

2404
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
he made his announcement and was like, okay

2405
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
who's got my money?

2406
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
but at any rate, that's going to be

2407
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
on April 2nd

2408
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
so just in a couple of days

2409
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
no fooling

2410
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
no one's guessed what the joke is

2411
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
so

2412
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
guess what the joke is

2413
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
and then this is the news that made me happy

2414
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
that I alluded to it in my

2415
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
what I've been playing

2416
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Steve Ritchie

2417
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
really cool guy, going very very deaf

2418
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
he is

2419
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
a game designer responsible

2420
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
for such classics as Black Knight

2421
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
and Black Knight 2000 and

2422
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Star Wars Pinball, he's doing a lot of stuff for Stern

2423
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
right now

2424
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
well, we remember

2425
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
hearing that he was

2426
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
told he finally gets to work on his dream game

2427
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
that dream game

2428
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
and Dan and I were like, oh it's another Black Knight, it's another Black Knight

2429
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
turns out, it's another Black Knight

2430
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
so Black Knight Sword of

2431
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Rage is the new one

2432
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
there is a

2433
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
there's actually even a teaser up

2434
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
some gameplay that's up

2435
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
and then there are

2436
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
going to be two versions of it

2437
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
there's the pro edition which has just

2438
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
one play field

2439
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
and then the premium

2440
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
which is the one that we're going to be getting

2441
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
that's why we're selling off other pins

2442
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
that has the upper level play field that

2443
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
harkens back to Black Knight 2000 and Black Knight

2444
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
sounds fun

2445
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I wonder if he's still doing the Black Knight voice

2446
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
but the thing that I like is it's even got the spinner

2447
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
from the Black Knight 2000

2448
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
the color scheme is the same, it's got the

2449
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Black Knight in the middle of it and we're just so

2450
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
excited about this

2451
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
this is going to be one of the first tables

2452
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
that we're really going to buy completely

2453
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
brand new

2454
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
it's like buying a small car

2455
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
in some ways

2456
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
the one that we're getting is going to be

2457
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
67,000

2458
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
we're probably buying ours at

2459
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
6700

2460
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
oh my god, 67,000

2461
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
for a fucking machine

2462
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
6700 is appropriate

2463
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I think he said the pro is like 52

2464
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
or 55

2465
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
and then the premium

2466
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
is going to be like 67

2467
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
and that's buying it at the show

2468
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
so we're going to be

2469
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
probably picking ours up at California Extreme

2470
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
we may not have the money to get it

2471
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
by, not Pinagogo

2472
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
it's not called that anymore, Pinagogo is a different

2473
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
thing now, Golden State

2474
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
because they moved it from Dixon to Lodi

2475
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
yeah, it's still the same

2476
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
it's the same one as the old Pinagogo

2477
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
but now it's Golden State Pinball Expo

2478
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
in Lodi, the grape center, whatever, wine

2479
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
thing, which I went last year

2480
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
after DragCon, it was super fun

2481
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
but

2482
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
the, god, words

2483
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
but anyway

2484
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Stern is going to be selling

2485
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
there and at California

2486
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Extreme at the big pinball event

2487
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
so we're probably getting ours at California Extreme

2488
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
remind me, I need to talk to you about something

2489
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
with California Extreme off air

2490
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
just remind me, because I'll forget

2491
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
alright, we're all going, right?

2492
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
that's the plan, but I've got to ask you something

2493
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
about that

2494
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
anyway, yes, I am conducting

2495
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
personal business on the show, deal with it

2496
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
anyway, give me your money

2497
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
but I'm looking forward to playing this machine

2498
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
and hopefully Dark Soccer will let us bring the camera

2499
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
over, maybe we can do a little midpoint break

2500
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
and showcase the machine, that'll be fun, well once I have it

2501
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
sure, once you have it, well I think we should do that for some of the other machines

2502
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
you have today actually, well I've got Ghostbusters right now

2503
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
or the ones you're about to get rid of

2504
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
well that would be Monopoly

2505
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
you know what's funny is that we always call it

2506
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Monopoly, because of the master system

2507
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
misprint of Monopoly

2508
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
was Monospace Poly, we've got one of those

2509
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
like right now in the house

2510
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
is Monopoly World Cup

2511
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Ghostbusters in the dining room

2512
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
and then we have the Medieval Madness

2513
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
hello!

2514
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
we have the Medieval Madness reissue

2515
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Black Knight 2000 and

2516
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Theater of Magic, and then outside

2517
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
we've got Judge Dredd

2518
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
which I don't know why they like it, but they do

2519
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I have a creature from the Black Lagoon

2520
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Demolition Man, which we're going to be selling

2521
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
The Shadow

2522
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
and, and, and crap

2523
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
they love pinball at your house

2524
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
one other that I can't remember

2525
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
it's fine, oh yeah

2526
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Twilight Zone, we've got our

2527
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Twilight Zone back, so

2528
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
but you're Dr. Claw when you're thinking the pinball machines

2529
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
is my favorite thing about this Twitch room

2530
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
about me snapping?

2531
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
the hand gestures that come through on Twitch

2532
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
but this is Thing

2533
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
it's Thing from the Addams Family, of course

2534
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
alright, anyway

2535
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
come on, moving on, let's travel around the world

2536
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
and check out some releases, things that are coming out

2537
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
a little sooner than this new Black Knight

2538
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
machine, starting with the US, Loki

2539
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I'm afraid I don't have much

2540
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
to announce, but we do

2541
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
have one single game

2542
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
which will be very

2543
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
great news for my son

2544
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
and that is Power Rangers Battle

2545
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
for the Grid is coming to Playstation 4

2546
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
it's a Power Rangers fighting game

2547
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
that's it

2548
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
yeah, it seems like it's a slow week

2549
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
in Japan as well

2550
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I don't know if that's because golden weeks at the end of the month

2551
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
or something, I don't know, but there's not

2552
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
a lot happening in Japan right now

2553
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
pretty light time, because everyone shoves that stuff

2554
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
out for the end of the

2555
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
financial year, and then it's just like

2556
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
ah, that's true, the only big

2557
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
release on April 11th, that's

2558
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
next week, so I'll probably say this twice, but Earth Defense

2559
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Force Iron Rain is out in Japan on the way

2560
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I see that as well, so there is that

2561
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
but then if I'm looking at the Switch, okay the Switch has some things

2562
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
so on the Switch we have

2563
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Super Dragon Ball Heroes World Mission

2564
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
the Taikan Sports Pack

2565
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Tennis, Bowling, Golf, and Billiards

2566
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
and the variety game with

2567
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
King Guiyo Suki, Card

2568
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Tsuji Puzzle, and Nika Kudori

2569
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
these kind of sound like

2570
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
like kind of shovelware, doesn't sound

2571
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
like these are huge games, and that's

2572
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
really, well the Dragon Ball

2573
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
is a different story, but those other two sound like

2574
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
they're kind of mini game collections, but there you go

2575
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
that's what you got in Japan this week, how about the UK?

2576
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Anything exciting going on over there?

2577
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Just a few things

2578
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
on the first

2579
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Darksiders War Mastered

2580
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Edition, and then on the

2581
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
fourth YouTuber's Life OMG

2582
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
and Super Dragon Ball Heroes

2583
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
World Mission, Dragon Ball Heroes? Oh

2584
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I guess it's out on Switch

2585
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I always thought it was an arcade only thing

2586
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
but Super Dragon Ball Heroes

2587
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
World Mission is coming out

2588
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
There were all the DS ones that came out in Japan

2589
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Well and it's the same thing

2590
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
that was on the Japanese list too

2591
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Yeah, but I didn't think that

2592
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
it ever had a European release, so maybe this is

2593
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Dragon Ball Heroes

2594
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
is just kind of weird

2595
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
because it's like you're two kids

2596
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
who play in and get sucked into the

2597
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
video game and they're part of that

2598
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
they like become Saya-jin in the game

2599
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
and have to do shit

2600
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's kind of cool, but you buy like cards

2601
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
for the arcade machine

2602
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
and then it reads your characters on the cards

2603
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Fun, well I think Loki is

2604
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
in the right ballpark though, I think this week in particular

2605
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
is just slow because everybody

2606
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
pushed for last week at the end of the fiscal year

2607
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
so it's kind of like this is just a slow

2608
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
period because of that

2609
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Alright, well moving on then

2610
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
after world release dates

2611
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
this is the part of the show where we would usually

2612
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
get into the mail bag over at

2613
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
participate at

2614
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
orangelauntrader.com, although when I checked earlier today

2615
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
it was empty, I don't know about now

2616
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Oh, there's one?

2617
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Yeah, there's one from today

2618
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Ok, then that's why I missed it, let's do it

2619
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Alright, this one comes from our

2620
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
dear Ronchan

2621
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Evening everyone, great show last week

2622
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
but I wanted to say a couple of things real quick

2623
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I don't have much hope

2624
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
in Google Stadia, seeing how

2625
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
it's going to rely more on software

2626
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
than hardware. Honestly, if they

2627
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
want Stadia to be a success, Google should

2628
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
release a beefed up Chromecast

2629
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
with more storage and memory and have that

2630
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
as a dedicated streaming device to pair

2631
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
with a controller. To me that makes the most

2632
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
amount of sense, and I actually would second that

2633
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And then, ooh, to me about

2634
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
what I said about Chrome

2635
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
After the show I checked my task manager and saw

2636
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
for myself with the many instances, but also

2637
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Firefox, Edge, and other web browsers do the same thing

2638
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And I

2639
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
understand your views about how Google should

2640
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
optimize Stadia for Safari, but Google

2641
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
shouldn't have to because Chrome is their

2642
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
browser of choice for obvious reasons

2643
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Yeah, they're going to want you to use Chrome

2644
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Perhaps once they have perfected how they want

2645
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Chrome to operate with Stadia, we could see

2646
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
that same optimization on Safari

2647
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Seeing how Microsoft's new web browser

2648
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Edge is being redone with Chromium

2649
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
and seeing how that's the majority

2650
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
how that's the majority

2651
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
browser being used, it could be a while

2652
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And that's all for now, I'm off to edit more con photos

2653
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
and whatnot, stay awesome, I'll run that

2654
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
You can still use Chrome on Apple products

2655
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
It just doesn't run great

2656
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I use Chrome on my phone, and the reason why

2657
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
it's in incognito mode

2658
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
You have that on Safari

2659
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Oh, then they must have put that in there recently

2660
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
It hasn't been new, it's been there forever

2661
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
It's called private browsing

2662
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Because I use it all the time, because when I

2663
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
look at, like, there's so many news sites

2664
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
that, like, when you go, it's like, you've used up

2665
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
your free articles this month

2666
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Going private browsing works fine

2667
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Well, it's been there since its inception

2668
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Oh, I don't remember

2669
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
When you slide up your window, you'll get a new plus

2670
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
for a private browser window

2671
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I'm used to Chrome anyway, it doesn't matter

2672
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Okay, so

2673
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Well, people are used to horse and buggies, but you see where we are now

2674
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
You know what, alright

2675
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And Bobby Blackwell is saying you might want to reiterate

2676
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
who Ronchon is

2677
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Rama! T.J. Rama S, he's my Ronchon

2678
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Our pal from the Anime Jam session

2679
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Maybe Bobby wants us to

2680
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
work in the cheap plug for Anime Jam session

2681
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Hosted Tuesday nights here

2682
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Well, you can do that

2683
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
You got it

2684
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Alright, anyway, so there you go

2685
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Yeah, Act Def says, well, there was an email

2686
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
so no Drag Race talk, sadly, nope, we'll have to roll that over

2687
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Oh, girl!

2688
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I haven't watched this week anyway, so I'm not, well

2689
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I got, so, believe it or not

2690
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I've been trying to, and I didn't want to

2691
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
talk a lot about this on the show until I was actually

2692
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
making a habit of it, but I would say

2693
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
since mid-March, Allen got us

2694
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
gym memberships

2695
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And I've now been 12 times

2696
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So I would say I'm making it a habit

2697
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I haven't been good about every day

2698
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
but I've been going almost every other day

2699
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So I'm trying, I'm trying to turn

2700
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
this jigglypuff into some wigglytuff

2701
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
That's just kind of, you know, I just want to

2702
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
shape the dad bod a little more, that's all I want

2703
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
And just in general, just be a little more active

2704
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I still was pretty

2705
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Do you remember that article about the guy who

2706
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
went from like total twink to total bear?

2707
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Seriously

2708
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I'm not, I mean, I'm

2709
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
40 and married, I'm not, you know

2710
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Sure, sure, I would like to, but I'm not

2711
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I'm not going to have a six-pack, and I'm totally fine with that

2712
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
But exercise is good for your heart

2713
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Well, and also, I'm going to be on it

2714
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'm going to keep it real, because I'm very real with you all

2715
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I watched

2716
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
some of this show

2717
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
on Twitch, and I

2718
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
looked at myself and I said, that is

2719
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
the biggest I've been in a very long time

2720
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I don't like it, I want to change it

2721
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And so, you know how you change it?

2722
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
You do something about it

2723
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Exactly, change doesn't happen until you make it happen

2724
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
So it's not just the

2725
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
It's not just the

2726
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I just want to, you know, everybody views

2727
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
You know, I'm just saying

2728
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
If you are fine with your

2729
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
figure and, you know, full size

2730
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
That is fucking great

2731
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I'm just saying for me personally, because

2732
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
wonderful people come in all shapes and sizes and colors

2733
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
and formats and so forth

2734
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
But I'm just saying for me, I looked at

2735
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
this show

2736
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and I said, I'm capable

2737
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
of better, you know, and especially

2738
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Well, don't you feel better?

2739
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
It's been two weeks, give it, let's ask

2740
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
me again in another month

2741
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
You'll notice that just in general

2742
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
you feel better, have more stamina

2743
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You know what I do feel better with is that I've also

2744
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
in turn been trying to do more

2745
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Like I've been eating out at work a lot

2746
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Like I'll go to the taco place, I'll go to this place

2747
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I've really managed to

2748
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And you know what I finally did that kind of worked

2749
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Instead of forcing myself

2750
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
to eat those diet meals

2751
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I eat, and I don't want to give them free advertising

2752
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
But I eat a particular brand of meal

2753
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
It's not like Hungry Man

2754
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
But it's more like reasonable portion

2755
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
meal, it's not diet

2756
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
But it's 400 calories, 500 calories

2757
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I still feel like I'm actually eating something

2758
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
As opposed to eating

2759
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
you know, paper

2760
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Well I just like the whole fuck it thing

2761
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Which finally stuck in my head

2762
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I mean people call it mindful eating, I prefer the

2763
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
fuck it diet

2764
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
But for me it's like

2765
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
If you actually are enjoying what you're eating

2766
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
You may not feel like

2767
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
you have to finish it

2768
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
It'll be there, you can get it again

2769
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
As long as you have reasonable

2770
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
income, if you enjoy a food

2771
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
You can eat it again and you don't have to finish it

2772
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So you know

2773
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
And you guys have been very open

2774
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I'm really proud of you by the way, I'm proud of both of you guys

2775
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Again, save the kudos

2776
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
for about 4 more weeks

2777
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I wasn't going to say anything until it was 21 days

2778
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Because it takes 21 days to become a habit

2779
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Save the kudos until I actually show some visible progress

2780
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
But speaking of visible progress

2781
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
You guys would know that Loki

2782
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
was a bigger guy, a little bit

2783
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
You were never like big

2784
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
You know, you had a little more fluff

2785
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
like me, but you guys wouldn't know it

2786
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Loki has slimmed down quite a bit

2787
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So good for you

2788
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
As of the last few months

2789
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Sometimes the wagon, sometimes the trains

2790
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
get derailed

2791
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Even with my thing, I've been on a plateau

2792
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I was on a big plateau for a couple of months and then started losing again

2793
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
And then my weight hasn't changed

2794
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
But I went down a size

2795
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And you've been very open about

2796
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
You went through a huge life change

2797
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And you're like, your feet aren't going to get any better

2798
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Your back's not going to get any better

2799
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Until this happens

2800
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And I was very close to pre-diabetic

2801
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
So I was like, okay, fine, I'll do it

2802
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And I have no regrets

2803
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
PoppyBlackWolf says, I'm still fat and happy

2804
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Great?

2805
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Awesome

2806
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And Bobby

2807
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
has a great presence on Twitch too

2808
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
So it works, great

2809
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And he says, fitness, whole pizza in my mouth

2810
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
If you are

2811
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
If you are happy being squishy, then be squishy

2812
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it

2813
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
And also, you know what, just because I'm saying I'm doing these different things

2814
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
You think I'm going to rob myself of pizza

2815
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
When I go to Dragon Con

2816
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
You better believe I'm going to eat what I want

2817
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Who said yes to free pizza at work yesterday?

2818
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
This bitch

2819
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
When I went to Vegas

2820
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
You better believe I ordered exactly what I wanted

2821
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Because

2822
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
You don't always get to eat at those

2823
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I don't want no goddamn salad

2824
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
You know what though

2825
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
There are a few things that I miss

2826
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I miss buffets

2827
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I don't

2828
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I can't eat enough to make a buffet worth it anymore

2829
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
But I fucking miss ice cream

2830
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Like real ice cream

2831
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And pudding

2832
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I can't eat ice cream and pudding anymore

2833
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I haven't been able to eat ice cream since the surgery

2834
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Ten years ago when I had my gallbladder out

2835
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
What about like fat-free?

2836
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I'm sorry, let me correct myself

2837
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I can eat it

2838
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
But it's one of those foods that my insides

2839
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Don't

2840
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Do you feel like you're being punched from the inside?

2841
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
A little bit

2842
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That's what I feel like

2843
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I don't want to say the name

2844
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
The stuff that advertises itself is only

2845
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
300 calories in a pint because it's less dairy

2846
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I eat that stuff

2847
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And I eat frozen yogurt all the time

2848
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Froyo is great

2849
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But you know what

2850
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Anyway

2851
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
The quest one does to better oneself

2852
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
There are sacrifices to make

2853
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And if you

2854
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Again, change doesn't happen

2855
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Until you make it happen

2856
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Once in a while I will eat

2857
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Ice cream but it's like

2858
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I went to Dairy Queen

2859
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
And I'm fucking having a blizzard

2860
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I don't care about the repercussions

2861
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
But that's like once every few months

2862
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
It's not an everyday type of thing

2863
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Anyway

2864
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So I didn't mean to get on that whole tangent

2865
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I'm sorry, the whole point was

2866
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I was trying to say

2867
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I've

2868
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I watched half of this week's

2869
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Drag Race while on the elliptical

2870
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But I'm not through the whole

2871
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
thing yet

2872
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So I can't talk about Drag Race

2873
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Because I don't know who got kicked off yet

2874
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But I have a pretty good guess

2875
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
But anyway, until then

2876
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
We will move on with more stories

2877
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Let's talk about some more news

2878
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Then we're going to open it up for your calls

2879
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
If you want to derail the show with your topic

2880
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
You sure can

2881
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
And hang out in the green room

2882
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
But it will be a little bit before we get there

2883
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Because we got some more stories for you

2884
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Starting with Loki

2885
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So now we're laying off some more people

2886
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
And this time EA is doing the laying off

2887
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
The laying off I think was about 4% of their workforce

2888
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Or 350 people in

2889
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
marketing, publishing, and other areas

2890
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Basically

2891
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
There was an email

2892
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
That was sent out saying that

2893
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
We have a vision

2894
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
To be the world's greatest games

2895
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
If we're honest with ourselves

2896
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
We're not there right now

2897
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
We have work to do with our games

2898
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Our player relationships and our business

2899
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Across the company teams are already

2900
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Taking action to ensure we are

2901
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Creating higher quality games

2902
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And live services reaching more platforms

2903
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
With our content and subscriptions

2904
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Improving our Frostbite tools

2905
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Focusing our networks

2906
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
And cloud gaming priorities

2907
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
And closing the gap between us and the player communities

2908
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
That says nothing about laying off the people

2909
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
At all

2910
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
So I'm not really sure

2911
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
You know

2912
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
What the case may be there

2913
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
It seems like with a lot of these other companies

2914
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
It's to kind of

2915
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Meet the expectations of their

2916
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Investors basically

2917
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
You have a company that's

2918
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Made so much money

2919
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
That how are you gonna

2920
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Top that the following

2921
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Year because you've pretty much capped out

2922
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
All the people that are gonna be playing your games

2923
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And now how do you become more profitable

2924
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
While you lay off

2925
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Some people to make your operating

2926
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Costs lower

2927
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I have a theory as to why this all happened

2928
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But

2929
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
You wanna hear my theory?

2930
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Let's hear your theory

2931
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
And here's the thing

2932
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
A lot of people are jumping at this going

2933
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Anthem ruined EA

2934
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I think this might have been planned

2935
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
A little bit sooner than we definitively

2936
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Know how Anthem is doing or not

2937
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
But we do know Apex has been

2938
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Successful and you know what we talked about last week

2939
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
On the show and what a lot of people are saying

2940
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Very tongue in cheek about this

2941
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Is that EA paid Ninja

2942
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
A million dollars to stream the game

2943
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
On and

2944
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
You know it got all that visibility

2945
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Who did they just lay off in this?

2946
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
They laid off a lot of publicity people

2947
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
A lot of promotional people and so forth

2948
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
This in my opinion

2949
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
And I'm just some

2950
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Dude on a microphone with a podcast

2951
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I'm not like an official investor or whatever

2952
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But I kinda see there's a link here

2953
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Is that EA has now

2954
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Learned that they can

2955
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Just take their case to the

2956
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Gamers in a different way and I'm not saying

2957
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
That it's all

2958
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Gonna go this way I'm just saying

2959
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
EA's learned maybe where they can

2960
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Make some change or where they wanna make some changes

2961
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Whether it's effective

2962
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Or not I guess that's for the market

2963
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And the sales of the games to decide

2964
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
But I'll be damned if I don't see some correlation here

2965
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Between what we talked about last week

2966
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
And this and my heart does go out to those

2967
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
That are laid off I'm not saying it was the right move

2968
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Or anything like that but it's just

2969
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I can't help but notice this

2970
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Loki you think there's something there?

2971
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Well they were saying also that they're

2972
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Ramping down their current presence in Japan

2973
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
And Russia to focus on different ways

2974
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
To serve those players

2975
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
In those markets so

2976
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I think it's just restructuring

2977
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And

2978
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I don't know I don't think that they're just

2979
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
All of a sudden put all their eggs in

2980
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Social media influencers

2981
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Not all of them but

2982
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Some of them

2983
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
They laid off the entire staff I mean in some of these

2984
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Other markets like Russia and Japan they did

2985
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
But I mean

2986
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I just don't think EA games

2987
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Go over the same way in Japan

2988
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
It's not really the same to the market

2989
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So I think there's other

2990
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Factors when it comes to those decisions

2991
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
But I think they're all

2992
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Coming to a head at the end of the fiscal year

2993
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Which is why these things are shifting

2994
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat

2995
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Says business decisions aren't about what you did

2996
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
But what you're going to do

2997
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And then Tigerclaw kind of follows that up with

2998
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I can see EA hiring a bunch of streamers

2999
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
As their PR I don't think it's quite

3000
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
The way you phrased it there Tigerclaw

3001
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But I think can

3002
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Are they looking at perhaps it's

3003
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
More cost effective

3004
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
To have some of our PR

3005
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Done for us by streamers

3006
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
We've seen how that's worked out though

3007
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Because they did the whole Battlefield 5

3008
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Thing and I wouldn't see even

3009
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Battlefield 1 was like that they had

3010
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Social media influencers

3011
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Or YouTubers or Twitch streamers or whatever

3012
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Presenting and unfortunately they are not great

3013
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Presenters and it was very awkward

3014
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And again I'm not saying 100% of it is

3015
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Going to be streamers I'm just saying a good chunk

3016
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Of it but like I just

3017
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Don't see

3018
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I don't see how that's

3019
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Really going to hit more

3020
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I don't know if they're getting their

3021
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Money's worth with that you know paying Ninja

3022
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
A million dollars

3023
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Is that really going to recoup a million dollars

3024
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Worth of profit back I don't think so

3025
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I think it's

3026
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I think they're wasting money there

3027
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
But whatever I guess we'll have to

3028
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I don't know I don't see the numbers

3029
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Look at how Apex is doing I think

3030
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
They did it Yeah but I don't think that's because of him at all

3031
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Though I think it's because it was a game

3032
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
By Titanfall devs that

3033
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Look great I don't think it's him

3034
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Specifically I think

3035
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
We keep saying Ninja because he's

3036
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Kind of this symbol of

3037
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Multiple streamers that are doing this

3038
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Thing and the general concept

3039
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Of social media influencers

3040
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
It's just that he's been on Ellen so he's

3041
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Kind of the symbol right now of that whole thing

3042
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So to be clear I'm not saying

3043
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Him specifically but I'm saying

3044
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
That market

3045
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
If you will of him and streamers

3046
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Like him so anyway

3047
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I don't know I think that's giving

3048
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Them too much power to be honest

3049
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I think

3050
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I mean sure there's going to be

3051
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Some influence over there

3052
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Their crowd is going to get more impressions

3053
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
To people that are maybe interested in that

3054
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Type of gameplay because

3055
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Obviously people that are following Ninja are

3056
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Into Fortnite

3057
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And so spinning

3058
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Off to another battle royale type

3059
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Genre game is going to be something

3060
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
That's like oh hey you know maybe I could

3061
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Try that because it's free to play or something

3062
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Like that it's not necessarily going to be oh I'm going to jump

3063
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Into like PUBG or something where I have to pay

3064
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Money to I will absolutely give you

3065
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That the fact that Apex is free

3066
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Is a huge part of the reason why

3067
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It's succeeding absolutely yeah because if it's like

3068
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
A $60 game I mean

3069
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I don't know if it would have done as well

3070
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
But I just

3071
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I don't think

3072
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
The thought process here is that

3073
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Well these

3074
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Media influencers

3075
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Seem to be helping us out

3076
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
So we don't need our marketing department

3077
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
No I don't think that's going to do it

3078
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
They didn't eliminate the marketing department

3079
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
They cut it back

3080
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
That's the difference though

3081
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
That's why I keep saying not 100%

3082
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
But they're maybe looking at

3083
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Some of these dollars that we're into putting on E3

3084
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Right

3085
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
No I understand that but it's not

3086
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
You wouldn't cut back on marketing staff

3087
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
You would cut back on your marketing spend

3088
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
In different areas instead of putting all of my money

3089
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
In TV advertisements

3090
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I'm going to be shifting more to

3091
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Web, video pre-roll

3092
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Stuff

3093
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Maybe these social media influencers

3094
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Put my money there

3095
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Where I know I'm going to get more of an impact

3096
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
More of

3097
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
A result that way versus

3098
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Some older ways

3099
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Of advertising before print

3100
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Magazine advertisements

3101
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Let's cut back on that

3102
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I think that's more of the long lines

3103
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
And maybe if that's the case

3104
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
And the shift to these other types of platforms

3105
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Maybe these people that were in those marketing positions

3106
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Were towards

3107
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Those types of

3108
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Marketing

3109
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Or maybe who cares

3110
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
And we don't need to know about the inner workings

3111
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Of this company and it's not going to make their gains

3112
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Any god damn better at all

3113
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So who gives a shit

3114
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Sorry for the people that got laid off

3115
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
EA I'm sorry I know you wanted to be the best company in the world

3116
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
But guess what? Hopes and dreams aren't going to make

3117
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
That fucking happen

3118
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Your lack of loot boxes and shit will though

3119
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
And I'll meet you there

3120
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
This is not going to fix EA's problems

3121
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Because it's very different than this

3122
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
But way to have them spin

3123
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Well we're going to do it now

3124
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Okay

3125
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Wasn't there like a twin story to this

3126
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Something else to read with this

3127
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Because I want to quickly get that out and move on

3128
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
So EA announced a new publishing agreement

3129
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
With Velen Studios

3130
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
So they have a new game coming

3131
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
To the Switch apparently

3132
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
It's like a team based game

3133
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
It's called DJ Hero

3134
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
It's called DJ Hero

3135
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
It's called DJ Hero

3136
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
It's called DJ Hero

3137
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It's called DJ Hero

3138
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It's called DJ Hero

3139
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
It's called DJ Hero

3140
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
It's called DJ Hero

3141
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
It's called DJ Hero

3142
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
It's called DJ Hero

3143
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
It's called DJ Hero

3144
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
It's called DJ Hero

3145
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
It's called DJ Hero

3146
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
It's called DJ Hero

3147
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
It's called DJ Hero

3148
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
It's called DJ Hero

3149
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
It's called DJ Hero

3150
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
It's called DJ Hero

3151
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
It's called DJ Hero

3152
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
It's called DJ Hero

3153
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
It's called DJ Hero

3154
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
It's called DJ Hero

3155
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
It's called DJ Hero

3156
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
It's called DJ Hero

3157
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It's called DJ Hero

3158
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
It's called DJ Hero

3159
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
It's called DJ Hero

3160
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
It's called DJ Hero

3161
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Show me the game

3162
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
They're making a game

3163
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
It's coming to Switch

3164
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Look

3165
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Let's move on

3166
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I want to talk about some news

3167
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I think we all can agree on some great news

3168
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
If you are

3169
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Especially an Amazon Prime person

3170
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Cheap plug by the way

3171
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
If you are an Amazon Prime person

3172
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Then guess what?

3173
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
You get one free Twitch subscription

3174
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Every month

3175
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I have done so today

3176
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Hooray!

3177
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Because then you can actually watch the video archive

3178
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
At any time

3179
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
The audio as it has been for 17 years

3180
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
That same product the audio that we do is free

3181
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
It's just something a little bit extra

3182
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
But you can watch video archives of ourselves

3183
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Bobby Blackwolf

3184
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Now this indie game showcase

3185
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
As well as anything we might do in the future

3186
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
You'll have a nice big archive for our subscribers

3187
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So a big thank you to everybody who is subscribing

3188
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Using their Amazon Prime

3189
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Some people are paying out of pocket to do that

3190
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
We really appreciate you guys as well

3191
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I think also today is the last day to grab

3192
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
The 2500 biddies

3193
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
If it's not already done

3194
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
You can get 2500 biddies for

3195
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
25 bucks which means Twitch is kind of like

3196
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Not taking their cut right now

3197
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
So that's also

3198
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Because we really appreciate the bits and all that stuff

3199
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
So it helps us in getting the word out there

3200
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
And some of the plans that we have

3201
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
For this year with promo and all that good stuff

3202
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Anyway those of you that are on Amazon Prime

3203
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Guess what? You also get

3204
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Other perks so you don't just get

3205
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Your whole like you know that you can

3206
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Subscribe to one Twitch channel every month

3207
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
But you also right now

3208
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
This is a big kind of a big deal

3209
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
You get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online

3210
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Free

3211
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
So if you haven't signed up yet

3212
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Or even if you have actually

3213
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
You can go get 12 months for free

3214
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
And so yeah and I just did this today

3215
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
You can extend

3216
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Your current membership

3217
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I think it only lets you 3 months right now

3218
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Then 90 days you can do another

3219
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
9 months

3220
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
That's I think what they're doing to

3221
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Like if anybody's trying to do the free trial thing

3222
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Because you could go in with a free trial

3223
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Of Amazon Prime or whatever

3224
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Get your you know

3225
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
So they're wanting to make sure people keep it I think

3226
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
So yeah you can redeem 3 months now

3227
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And then in like 60 days, 2 or 3 months

3228
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
You can get the rest of it

3229
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
But you know I imagine a lot of you are

3230
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Thinking about taking advantage of that

3231
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
So yeah you can check that out

3232
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
You see that pop right up there when you're logged into

3233
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Twitch TV

3234
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I'm signing up for it right now

3235
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
And you can extend your current membership

3236
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
That's pretty crazy

3237
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
You know what this reminds me of?

3238
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
This reminds me of the recent

3239
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Spotify thing

3240
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Where they were like, hey if you're a Spotify premium

3241
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Person you get Hulu Plus

3242
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
You know it's this like weird

3243
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Alliance type thing they're doing

3244
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
You know I'm sure Twitch has given Nintendo

3245
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Some money and so forth but

3246
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
It's pretty crazy so

3247
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Anyway

3248
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Oh

3249
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Shane is pointing something else out here

3250
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
This is also very interesting

3251
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Shane is in our chat saying

3252
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Unless you're in a family plan

3253
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Then you get nothing

3254
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
So those people that were like

3255
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Coming up with their plan to share their family plan

3256
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
With other people, doesn't work

3257
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
This is only for an individual plan

3258
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Good good footnote

3259
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I don't have a family plan

3260
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Because it's just me and if Allen wants to play something

3261
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
He just uses my account

3262
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
He rarely plays anything on console these days anyway

3263
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
So yes good call out though

3264
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Let's see

3265
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Tigercall on chat says I took advantage of this

3266
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
But I can't activate it because I don't have a switch

3267
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Well

3268
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Maybe you'll be incentivized to get one

3269
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Or maybe you'll go to a friend's house

3270
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Or something I don't know

3271
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
But I think it's kind of interesting

3272
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Actf says

3273
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
You can add it to your current subscription

3274
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
If you aren't part of the family plan

3275
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Yeah pretty neat

3276
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Yeah you can get that for free

3277
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
If you are not already on a family plan

3278
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I mean

3279
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Hypothetically

3280
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
If I'm not mistaken you could

3281
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Make your own account

3282
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
That's not a part of the family plan

3283
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
And then you could get it for 12 months on your own

3284
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
But then why would you do that

3285
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
You probably still have like 9 months left

3286
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
In your family plan

3287
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
That all started like November December

3288
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Might not be worth it I don't know

3289
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Anyway there you go pretty good deal

3290
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
A lot of people are taking advantage of right now

3291
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Moving on DarkSakura

3292
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Well here are

3293
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
I don't know it's kind of sad it's the end of an era

3294
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
But Kaz Hirai

3295
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
You know he went on to be the director and chairman

3296
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Of Sony after stepping down as CEO

3297
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Now he's officially retiring

3298
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And

3299
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
But I mean he was the

3300
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Dude that gave us

3301
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
DarkSakura

3302
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
But I think he did a pretty good job

3303
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
With Sony

3304
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
So he's going to be around

3305
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
As a consultant

3306
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
You know to put in input

3307
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
And they say he's going to continue to advise

3308
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
The company until he

3309
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Decides not to

3310
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And

3311
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Yoshida Kenichiro

3312
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Put out a statement that says while he will be retiring

3313
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
From both chairman and

3314
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Board of directors we look forward to his continuing

3315
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Support to Sony's management that

3316
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Encompasses a breadth of diverse

3317
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Businesses

3318
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
You know for all the shit we gave this guy over the

3319
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Years about that infamous Playstation

3320
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
3 reveal at E3

3321
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
You know he did move on

3322
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
To other positions within the company

3323
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
And has kind of overseen the Playstation

3324
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
4 and the success that has come with that

3325
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
So you know

3326
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
As much as we joke about whatever the crayons and all that

3327
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Stuff from back in the day I think

3328
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
He really was fairly smart he just said some dumb things

3329
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
They had a bad E3

3330
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
And I mean a really bad E3

3331
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
A really bad E3

3332
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
But now it's a much different company

3333
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
And I think

3334
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
It's probably a good time

3335
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
It's probably a good time for him

3336
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
To transition this out

3337
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And I love the whole he's going to be working for them

3338
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
As an advisor until he doesn't

3339
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Like

3340
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I'm going to be doing this until I decide not to

3341
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Well I mean that kind of is how it is

3342
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
It's like us and Orange Lounge Radio

3343
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
We'll continue to do this show

3344
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Until we don't

3345
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
I mean seriously

3346
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
That's how we are

3347
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
No it is it is

3348
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Or until Rob has another big diva fit

3349
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
You never know time is short

3350
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Yeah

3351
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Live long diva hard

3352
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Alright anyhow let's move on

3353
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys and we're going to get to the listener round table

3354
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
With calls and discord and

3355
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Questions in chat but Loki

3356
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
You're really excited about this project

3357
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Yeah this is pretty cool

3358
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I never did get a chance to mess around with it

3359
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
But it's been updated

3360
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
So we talked about this I think months ago now

3361
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
About the Mega Man Maker

3362
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
That is out on PC

3363
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
So basically it's this unofficial

3364
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Almost like a Mario Maker

3365
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Type thing for Mega Man games

3366
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Well now they've added some additional stuff

3367
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Into the game

3368
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
That's focused around Mega Man 8 and 9

3369
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
So they haven't

3370
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Done like a retro form though

3371
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
So they've got four new bosses

3372
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Grenade Man, Astro Man, Tornado Man, Concrete Man

3373
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
They have a quick swap tool

3374
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Multi-boss option

3375
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And then you can even have it

3376
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
So basically that means you can have Mega Man fight two bosses

3377
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
At once

3378
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
And just like a bunch of other updates

3379
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
New little gimmicks and stuff

3380
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
In there as well

3381
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So if it's something you want to check out

3382
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I don't know where you can actually

3383
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Pick this up but I see that they have

3384
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Something on YouTube

3385
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Regarding it

3386
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Oh you can download it at

3387
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
MegaManMaker.com

3388
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Of course it would make sense

3389
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
That would be the URL for that

3390
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So that's where you can check it out

3391
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
It's free and

3392
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I'm curious to see if anyone's made anything cool

3393
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
With this probably

3394
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I'm with Dark Tetsuya in our chat room

3395
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network

3396
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Who says Mega Man Maker just makes me sad

3397
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Mega Man universe never materialized

3398
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Yeah but you know what

3399
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
When the official company decides

3400
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Not to do it other people kind of step

3401
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
In sometimes and homebrew it up

3402
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
And it looks pretty neat

3403
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
They've got some pretty interesting things in this

3404
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
So I mean it definitely

3405
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Looks pretty cool

3406
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I guess we'll have to check it out

3407
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Yeah that might be a fun thing to do some live streams with

3408
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
At some point or something

3409
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
SG100Matt in chat says

3410
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I was going to say Mega Man universe looked like an amazing

3411
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Idea

3412
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Tigerclaw says how about Metroid Maker

3413
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
It's probably out there

3414
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Someone did do a Metroid Maker already

3415
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
In fact there's some ROMs

3416
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Out there to do like fan built

3417
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Metroid

3418
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
And they certainly have the shuffles

3419
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
The random generated ones

3420
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I always mean to get in there and play some of those randomizers

3421
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I like the mixed randomizers with Legend of Zelda

3422
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Yes I've seen that one too

3423
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
The Zelda and Metroid one

3424
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Yeah they did it at GameStun quick

3425
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Yeah that looks so cool

3426
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Anyway

3427
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Let's move on one more story for you guys here

3428
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
And this has to do with

3429
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
You know another YouTuber

3430
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
But one that might not have as many people

3431
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Watching as a Ninja

3432
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
But she should

3433
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Her name is Shirley Curry

3434
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Which I love her name

3435
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
She's 82 years old and she is a

3436
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Grandma that plays Skyrim

3437
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
She is the Skyrim Grandma

3438
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I'm going to be playing Skyrim when I'm 82 years old too

3439
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Well probably not Skyrim

3440
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
She's like I was young like you once

3441
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
But then I took an arrow

3442
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Alright anyway

3443
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
This is cool Bethesda announced this week

3444
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
She will be appearing in the Elder Scrolls 6

3445
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
They use technology to scan her face

3446
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And she's going to be a character in the game

3447
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Funny enough

3448
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
This little peek behind the scenes

3449
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
That we saw

3450
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Is really like our first true look

3451
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
At anything

3452
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
With the Elder Scrolls 6

3453
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I mean that announcement trailer was what

3454
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
A photo and a maybe logo

3455
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
This was really the first true

3456
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Look we got at the game because

3457
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Bethesda's already said don't expect

3458
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
This until Starfield's done basically

3459
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Which on that note

3460
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I should also say kind of like a tangent

3461
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
From this Bethesda has also

3462
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Indicated you will not be seeing either of

3463
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
These things at E3 this year

3464
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
So if you are expecting that this will be

3465
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Starfield's year or this will be

3466
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Elder Scrolls 6's new Vegas remaster

3467
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Keep right on thinking

3468
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
It seems like at this point Bethesda may be

3469
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Holding those things for the

3470
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
PlayStation 5 next

3471
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Xbox etc etc

3472
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
What's coming next for gaming

3473
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
So don't expect that at this year's E3

3474
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
They're setting those expectations now

3475
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Anyway this was all revealed at a PAX East

3476
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Panel this is where this information came out

3477
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
It was actually an Elder Scrolls 25th

3478
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Anniversary panel I didn't realize the series

3479
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
As a whole I mean probably because

3480
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Most of us didn't really really follow it

3481
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Until Morrowind I mean no disrespect

3482
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
To like Arena and the games before it but I think

3483
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Morrowind especially Morrowind was on

3484
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Xbox so that's when the game really

3485
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Started to get more steam

3486
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
The original Xbox not Xbox 360 that was Oblivion

3487
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
But anyway

3488
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
So yeah they were talking about the photo capture technology

3489
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And then they showed good old Grandma Shirley

3490
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Actually being in the game and

3491
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
When asked for comment she said

3492
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
This means a lot to me because I would be

3493
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Extremely happy to know that somebody else

3494
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Was playing with my character

3495
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
In a future Elder Scrolls game

3496
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
She has 483,000 people on YouTube

3497
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
It's not a nothing

3498
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Nothing to a bulk at

3499
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
She's got about a thousand times the people

3500
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
That we do

3501
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
So good for her that's great

3502
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I love that too

3503
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
And I think that's so

3504
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
So good what she's saying there about like this is

3505
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Something that will be there

3506
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Forever essentially you know after she's

3507
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Gone and as video game historians look back on

3508
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
A game like Elder Scrolls 6 she will have

3509
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Played a small part of that and I think that's a really

3510
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Until she comes out and says racist things on

3511
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Twitter and then they can patch her out of the game

3512
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Well let's hope not

3513
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Let's hope she doesn't do that let's just hope

3514
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
She's pretty level minded

3515
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
And so forth

3516
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Slidekickingchat says Rob did you say this will be

3517
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Garfield's year? I most certainly

3518
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Did not

3519
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Starfield very big different

3520
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
But I will say

3521
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Garfield and I both hate Mondays

3522
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
So there is that going for us this year that's for sure

3523
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
You know what always bothered me about that?

3524
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Garfield's a fucking cat and doesn't have to

3525
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Go to work

3526
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Why the fuck would he hate a Monday?

3527
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Just doesn't make sense to me

3528
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I don't know I also appreciate

3529
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Garfield without Garfield

3530
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Is that still a thing? That's just really sad

3531
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
It is I love those

3532
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
It is

3533
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Poor John

3534
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Ciatiberianchat says do you also love lasagna?

3535
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Hell yeah Hell yeah I love lasagna

3536
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Anyway

3537
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
You know what

3538
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
If we still had a fortune cookie I would have

3539
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
you play Weird Al's Lasagna

3540
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Everybody in chat is

3541
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Bobby in act after chat

3542
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
chiming in saying

3543
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
John leaves to work on Mondays

3544
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
That's why Garfield hates Mondays

3545
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Yeah but Garfield only tolerates John

3546
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Isn't that the truth

3547
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Alright let's get to the listener round table

3548
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
If you want to call in to talk about literally

3549
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
anything but Garfield

3550
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Hopefully it has something to do with games

3551
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000

02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
right now over at

3553
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
voggenetwork.com

3554
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Discord and we're going to be taking

3555
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
some of your calls here on the show except I'm not

3556
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
configured here on the show computer to do that yet

3557
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
So Loki

3558
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I'm sure you probably have some last minute stories you want to get to

3559
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
while I get everything configured here right?

3560
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I've been looking at these videos

3561
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
on Twitter so apparently Sonic

3562
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Ether's unbelievable shaders

3563
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
for Minecraft is

3564
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
probably pretty close so he's in

3565
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
One of the experimental builds he has now

3566
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
it has ray tracing in it

3567
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
and it looks amazing

3568
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
So

3569
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
That's pretty awesome

3570
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I'll have to check that out

3571
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Apparently you can get it if you go back

3572
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I'm on Patreon Sonic Ether

3573
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
They're $10 and you get access

3574
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
to their experimental shaders

3575
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Apparently the ray tracing though is still

3576
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
not entirely optimized it only runs at

3577
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
25 to 40 frames per second

3578
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
with far distance

3579
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
on maxed out

3580
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
PC so they had like a

3581
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
9900K with

3582
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
a GTS

3583
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
was it

3584
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
1170 Ti

3585
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
or a 1070 Ti

3586
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
and

3587
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
but god it looks

3588
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
it looks amazing

3589
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
This is what I want to see

3590
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
For the 4K pack

3591
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
This is better than their 4K pack

3592
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Anyway before you get some more stories

3593
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
We actually have some people waiting to call in

3594
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
and be on the show tonight so I'm going to get to it

3595
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
and get to a call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

3596
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Oh they disappeared

3597
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Let me try one more time to bring them into the room

3598
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
and see if they want to be on the show tonight

3599
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

3600
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I'm on Ambience

3601
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I didn't know what I was doing on my phone

3602
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
so whatever it's Shane

3603
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Hi Shane how are you?

3604
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I'm on Ambien and tired

3605
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Okay well that's

3606
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
that's what Ambien does

3607
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
so before you fall asleep what did you want to call in

3608
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
about tonight to talk about?

3609
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
So we know that

3610
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I defend Anthem a lot

3611
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I think it's a great game

3612
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Dustin and I hit 30

3613
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
today

3614
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
He just dropped out

3615
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Did he just hit the

3616
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
disconnect button? Shane just fell asleep

3617
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
He stopped making Ambien Skype calls

3618
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
He just

3619
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
just so you guys know he disappeared from

3620
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Discord so he either

3621
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
that's not our internet or anything

3622
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
or those problems that we were having earlier

3623
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
he was in the chat and then he wasn't

3624
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
because

3625
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
you're looking at Britney Spears because somebody put that

3626
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
in our Discord before I started

3627
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
taking calls

3628
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Alright I'm going to try this one more time

3629
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Are you back?

3630
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Yeah I'm back I don't know what happened

3631
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
You hit the disconnect or you quit or something

3632
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
No I didn't I was just

3633
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
straight up talking

3634
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
It was taking Ambien too

3635
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
You were talking about Anthem so even though

3636
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
a lot of folks are expressing

3637
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
displeasure with this game you're into it

3638
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
What is it that

3639
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
you love so much about this game?

3640
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
It's fun the story is not

3641
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
half bad

3642
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
the flying is great

3643
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
the different javelins make the

3644
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
game feel differently for you so

3645
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I'm not big on just like shooting things

3646
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
but I am big on being like a

3647
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
mage and blowing stuff up

3648
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
so I found something that works for me

3649
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
and Dustin

3650
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
doesn't really like to shoot stuff

3651
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
so he found something that works for him

3652
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
that just melees everything till it dies

3653
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
so it's been pretty fun

3654
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
it's like Mass Effect multiplayer

3655
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
And so it was

3656
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
worth the $60 at the end of the day?

3657
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Well I didn't pay

3658
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
$60 because I

3659
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
had Gamers Club

3660
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
from Best Buy

3661
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
so yes it was worth whatever that was

3662
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
$42 or something

3663
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Right I always forget

3664
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
some people are playing it through EA's subscription service

3665
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
because subscription services are the way

3666
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
to go these days

3667
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Well and that's kind of where my call

3668
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
was leading because I love this game

3669
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
the bugs are sometimes annoying

3670
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I got into a mission today and I didn't have a head

3671
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I didn't understand why

3672
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
but I was flying around with no head

3673
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
but

3674
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
during my ambient shopping

3675
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
last night

3676
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I

3677
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
decided to

3678
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
pick up PC copies

3679
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
for us because he really likes

3680
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
the game and I like playing the game with him

3681
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
so I was like well now we can play on our PCs

3682
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
if we want

3683
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
because we've been playing on Xbox

3684
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
and so we go

3685
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
install the games, put in our codes

3686
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
apparently since

3687
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Friday

3688
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Origin is

3689
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
all sorts of broken for

3690
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
the west coast and

3691
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
central US and

3692
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Canada

3693
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
It'll keep telling you you're not connected

3694
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
online so you can't launch any of the games

3695
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Yikes

3696
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Yeah so this is one of those times

3697
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
where I can't defend

3698
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
something to do with EA that I like

3699
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
because I actually think Origin is pretty good

3700
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
but

3701
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
this has been a real

3702
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
annoyance today because we hit

3703
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
30 and I was like here let's go

3704
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
play it on computer and just get started

3705
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
and we're just sitting there and it keeps saying

3706
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
oh we see you're not connected to the internet

3707
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
it's like no we are

3708
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
interesting because

3709
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
because Apex is all

3710
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
through Origin I mean yes I know Apex is on

3711
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
consoles too but that means

3712
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Apex isn't working for people too

3713
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Yikes

3714
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
That's their bread and butter right now so that's

3715
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
a little surprising to hear that

3716
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
The only work around is apparently

3717
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
using a VPN and having it

3718
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
think you're like east coast

3719
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
East coast apparently is having no problems

3720
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
it's just the west coast and

3721
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
central

3722
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Weird

3723
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I wonder if it's like the data centers that's routing you too

3724
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
like there must be an east coast data center and a west coast

3725
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
data center and so the west coast one is having

3726
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
issues

3727
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Yeah since Friday and they haven't fixed it

3728
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
so I don't know what's going on

3729
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I kind of killed my buzz for playing

3730
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
the rest of the day so

3731
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
That's too bad

3732
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Alright so

3733
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
What?

3734
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
And in the amazing video game news

3735
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I got the soundtrack

3736
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
to Silent Hill 2 on vinyl

3737
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Nice

3738
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
And one of the records

3739
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
is like a black and red

3740
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
swirl that you can see through if you

3741
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
put it up to the light and on the

3742
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
back of it and the little hole around it

3743
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I don't know the paper around the hole

3744
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
says there was a hole here

3745
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
it's gone now and it just made my day

3746
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
That's pretty good I didn't know they were

3747
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
releasing that on vinyl that's pretty rad

3748
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Yeah they also have Silent Hill 1

3749
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
for vinyl right now but not 3 or 4

3750
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
which is actually the ones I'd want

3751
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Alright well maybe if the other ones sell

3752
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
really well they'll do the other ones in the future who knows

3753
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
So yeah

3754
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Well I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls

3755
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
but you know in the future you know you prevent

3756
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
ambient shopping and so forth

3757
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Have you ever considered like when you take an

3758
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
ambient like go to bed?

3759
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
That's what I'm about to do

3760
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Alright just checking

3761
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I mean ask your doctor but it just would seem

3762
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
like if you want to prevent

3763
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
unnecessary shopping

3764
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
you just go to bed when you take the

3765
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
ambient

3766
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Ok they tell me to take it in bed but I take it like an hour

3767
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
and a half early so the effects

3768
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
start kicking in and even

3769
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
then even then I would

3770
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
just take my phone to

3771
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
bed and then they're shopping right there

3772
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
But then yeah I guess

3773
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
you need to disable shopping on your phone

3774
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Real quick before we let you go because we are getting a question for you

3775
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
in our chat room. ActDeaf wants to know

3776
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
how many shinies did you get yesterday

3777
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
in Pokemon Go?

3778
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
3 Lotad

3779
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
and I think

3780
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I ended either 15

3781
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
no like 16 or 17

3782
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Castform

3783
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Wow I was going to say 3 is low

3784
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
for you but that Lotad thing

3785
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Not a lot of people

3786
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Yeah people are not happy with the way those research

3787
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
quests went down I guess

3788
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
No. Oh and here's another problem

3789
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
sorry I'm keeping me on the line

3790
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
It's fine

3791
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
At least here

3792
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
the spawns kind of sucked

3793
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
and I would see a lot of

3794
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Castforms just regular Castforms

3795
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
but wouldn't it be sunny

3796
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
like sunny Pokemon

3797
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
weather boosted sunny Pokemon wouldn't be out

3798
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
it'd be like I don't know

3799
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
partly cloudy so when you

3800
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
get quests that say catch X amount

3801
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
of weather boost what are you

3802
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
going to do? You really

3803
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
can't

3804
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
It happens at least 3 of the time

3805
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
3 of the hours that we played

3806
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
It didn't seem like the spawns were

3807
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
increased but I felt like

3808
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
we went to the usual spot at the capital and it felt like it was

3809
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
ok it was fine

3810
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
but yeah we

3811
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
didn't have that but I never need

3812
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
to see a shiny Castform again

3813
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Alright fair enough

3814
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Alright I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls

3815
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
but goodnight

3816
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Alright

3817
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
We're going to get to some more calls here

3818
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
I see this person I don't think this one's called

3819
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
in the show before so let's see if we can get them on

3820
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
We're going to bring them in to chat and say hello

3821
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

3822
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Hey this is Ninja Bunny

3823
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Hey Ninja Bunny good to hear from you what's up?

3824
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I want to

3825
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
talk about

3826
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
wait hold on I'm echoing

3827
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
there you go I wanted to talk

3828
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
about

3829
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
time investment

3830
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
in games

3831
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Sure what do you mean

3832
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
elaborate on that a little bit

3833
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
what do you mean by time investment in games?

3834
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
So I play a lot of fighting games

3835
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
and

3836
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
pretty much I feel like

3837
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
if you get good at Street Fighter

3838
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
3 or Street Fighter 5

3839
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
or whatever the hell you're playing

3840
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
those skills transfer

3841
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
over to other fighting

3842
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
games

3843
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
and I don't really like to waste time

3844
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
so

3845
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
that's one of the reasons why

3846
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I don't play MMOs because

3847
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I don't feel like any of those

3848
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
skills or anything like that

3849
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
transfer over to other MMOs because

3850
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
you still have to grind for

3851
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
items and skills and all that stuff

3852
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Unless you say the melee class

3853
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Well I kind of see

3854
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
where he's going though I get what he's saying is that

3855
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
like generally you know when you're

3856
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
playing fighting games like you push the stick

3857
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
up you're always going to jump

3858
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
but like in MMOs

3859
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
the whole like backbone

3860
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
about how the game functions

3861
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
and you know the fighting style let's say

3862
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
is very different between you know

3863
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 11

3864
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
and Guild Wars they're all very

3865
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
different whereas you know in fighting games

3866
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
you have punch, kick, jump

3867
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
you have different types of punches and kicks but generally

3868
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
you know and it's not to say all fighting games are

3869
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
the same but I kind of see

3870
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I kind of see where you're going with this

3871
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
so is

3872
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
sorry we cut you off did you want to finish your thought or ask a

3873
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
question or? Oh it's

3874
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
just mainly why I don't like

3875
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
why I don't enjoy games like Banjo Kazooie

3876
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
or Donkey Kong

3877
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
or anything where you have to like

3878
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
collect a bunch of shit and it's also the

3879
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
main reason why I don't like Breath of the Wild

3880
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Oh

3881
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
right because I read you a little bit earlier

3882
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
for the whole Breath of the Wild comment interesting

3883
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
well you know and that's okay all joking aside

3884
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
you know people like what they like

3885
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
and that's okay because

3886
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
you know for instance here at Orange Mountains Radio

3887
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
we don't often talk about sports

3888
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
games there's not a lot of sports we don't really

3889
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
play Madden and stuff like that now

3890
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
some of the old school classics like I heard they did

3891
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
NBA Jam at PAX East today that's

3892
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
pretty cool but you know

3893
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
like a lot of the newer modern sports

3894
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
games we just don't get into those so much

3895
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
but you know I completely understand as someone

3896
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
who's been you know commentating on this for a long

3897
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
time there's a lot of people who play

3898
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
sports games and who buy Xboxes and

3899
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
things to play sports games

3900
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
specifically and in some ways

3901
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
you know what one could say what you're

3902
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
saying here about fighting games in some

3903
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
ways is also true of sports games

3904
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
that like you know if you know how to play

3905
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
football for real you kind of already

3906
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
know what the rules of Madden are gonna be

3907
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
sorta sorta but

3908
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
you know but on the flip side of that

3909
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
and I'm sure you recognize this but for

3910
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
some people that collecting

3911
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
that exploring

3912
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
that's the reward that's

3913
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
what some people love to do

3914
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
specifically when it comes to Breath of the Wild

3915
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
because you know a lot of people

3916
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
think of Zelda as like being on this map

3917
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
and you know this dungeon is here

3918
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
and then you go here and there was you know

3919
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
a lot of especially the older Zelda games was very much

3920
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
a way that you progress

3921
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
and you go through the game that with

3922
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Breath of the Wild it opened it up

3923
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
and it opened it up really big

3924
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
to a point where maybe it felt a little inaccessible

3925
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
if you didn't really ever play these kinds of games

3926
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
but at the same time also led to

3927
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
a sense of reward for

3928
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
exploration like oh I had no idea

3929
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
this temple was hiding

3930
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
behind this corner over here or what

3931
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
have you and the whole concept

3932
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
of oh sometimes there's

3933
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
more than one way to get through

3934
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
an issue like especially when it comes to like

3935
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
the snowy areas like

3936
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
what you can build a coat I think at some point

3937
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
you can eat fire food

3938
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
you can just fucking run for it and hope

3939
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
you make it before you die there's like

3940
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
multiple ways to get through situations

3941
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
and that I think is fun for some people

3942
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
as well but that doesn't what I think is

3943
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
that the skill that you develop with something like Breath of the

3944
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Wild is the ability to look around corners

3945
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
and so when I started

3946
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
you know after playing a little bit of Breath of the Wild

3947
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I actually did apply it to World of Warcraft

3948
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
and found that I was

3949
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
well mostly to my breaking you know

3950
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
barriers in the game and breaking

3951
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
the game but I found that it helped

3952
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
I do want to read

3953
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
a couple of comments here in our chat over

3954
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
twitch.tv slash vog network

3955
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Questbuster in chat says that's one of

3956
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
the issues about games like Fallout 76

3957
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
that the loot system

3958
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
as it is right now doesn't respect your time

3959
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
oh wow I found a legendary

3960
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
mob and it drops junk again

3961
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
you know that was a big problem in the

3962
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
early days of Diablo 3 is that people

3963
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
felt like the stuff they were killing was not giving

3964
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
loot that was worth their time

3965
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
but anyway I digress

3966
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
so I mean let me just

3967
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
let me ask you this NinjaBunny and then we'll kind of wrap up

3968
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
like even though you kind of know this is where

3969
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
you stand on these types of games

3970
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
have you ever like played a game where you're like

3971
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
you know I'm not usually

3972
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
into this but this

3973
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I'm into sort of like how we

3974
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
said oh we don't really play sports games

3975
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
but I got a soft spot for Blades of Steel

3976
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I'm always gonna is there something that kind of like

3977
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
breaks that down for you like

3978
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
is there something that you play even though you

3979
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
didn't think you'd like it

3980
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Xenoblade Chronicles X

3981
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
interesting

3982
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
interesting because that is

3983
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
definitely an RPG and there's a

3984
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
lot to do in a game like that

3985
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
why do you think that game

3986
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
kind of broke the rule for you

3987
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
probably because it has robots

3988
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
you like robots are cool you like robots

3989
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
and mechs and stuff hey

3990
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
whatever the reason I just think it's always

3991
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
interesting that like we might say we don't like XYZ

3992
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
type of game but then it's like oh

3993
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
but there's this one exception because

3994
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
it kind of did this thing differently in this case

3995
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
you know what I'll give it to you

3996
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
it was an RPG fantasy

3997
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
thing that's not swords and

3998
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
shields and magic and like I love all that

3999
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
stuff it's fucking robots

4000
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
it's different

4001
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
right that was like the original

4002
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Xenogears yeah well I mean that's

4003
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
you know yes so

4004
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000

02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
keeping mostly the same

4050
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
format but uh trying

4051
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
on a little bit more of a conversational

4052
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
take on things so we hope you like

4053
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
it um but I didn't want to just plug

4054
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
my podcast I did have a

4055
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
question for you Robin I don't

4056
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
know uh because I was just in Final Fantasy

4057
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
14 and

4058
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I was dealing with that terrible

4059
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
raid with um

4060
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Diabolos uh

4061
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
like it took three hours just

4062
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
not really but like it took a long time in the

4063
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
alliance roulette so uh

4064
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I did not get to tune in when I

4065
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
had hoped to but

4066
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
um so my question

4067
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
is like I don't know if you talked about

4068
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
this earlier on the episode I

4069
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
apologize but um

4070
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I wanted to know what your thoughts are

4071
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
on the whole

4072
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
vera controversy with

4073
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
no male bunny boys for Final Fantasy

4074
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
14 because I know that you

4075
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
played a lot of Final Fantasy

4076
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
11 where uh

4077
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
you know there were only the

4078
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
um the male only race

4079
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
and the female only race and then

4080
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
uh you were at the launch of

4081
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Final Fantasy 14 too right where we're still

4082
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
gender locked so I kind of wanted to know

4083
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
your perspective on that and uh

4084
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
so I I did address

4085
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
this a little bit on last week's show but that's okay

4086
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I don't mind um answering the question again now that I've

4087
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
had time to like process my thoughts a little more

4088
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
um I think the big the

4089
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
the reason why I had a really big

4090
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
negative reaction to the fact that they

4091
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
did not do the boy bunnies it's

4092
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
you know sure I was looking forward to Rolling

4093
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
One and all that but also I just

4094
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
thought the Hrothgar that they

4095
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
showed that they did announce just didn't

4096
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
look good like it looked like they were just

4097
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
using the um Rogadin characters

4098
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
but put these like animal masks on them

4099
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I wasn't really a fan of that like I almost

4100
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
feel like they shifted course

4101
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
part way through it's so

4102
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
weird for Yoshi P to get up on stage

4103
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
and be like this is gonna be the last race

4104
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
this is it and then all of a sudden

4105
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
get up on stage again later and be like okay

4106
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
but we got one more race and this is it

4107
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
and it's just it's just weird but here's the

4108
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
thing I think the reason why the whole thing

4109
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
bothered me it just seemed like this unnecessary

4110
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
change in policy

4111
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
and this has been a thing that was bugging me through

4112
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
a couple things that Final Fantasy 14 has done lately

4113
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
um and the reason why I say unnecessary

4114
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
change in policy is that when Yoshi

4115
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
and his team took over

4116
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
and I want to make very clear a lot of people

4117
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
have been very nasty online about this whole

4118
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
thing and you know I am not about that so

4119
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
like do not cyberbully people that work hard

4120
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
to bring you games but I can say

4121
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I don't agree with this decision and this is

4122
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
why when they originally took over

4123
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Realm Reborn you you

4124
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
nailed it in 11 they

4125
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
had this um the Mythra

4126
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
which became the Mikote they were gender locked to women

4127
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
only and then they had the Galka

4128
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
or now they became Rogadin that were gender locked to men

4129
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
only and they decided when they didn't

4130
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Realm Reborn they were like you know what we're listening to the fans

4131
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
and we didn't really get the

4132
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
point of the gender lock so you know what

4133
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
eh we're gonna get rid of the gender lock and

4134
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
give the fans what they want so

4135
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
it seems weird to me that they would do

4136
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
that and then suddenly come out

4137
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
and say but you know what the Viera

4138
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
are only gonna be females because

4139
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
the lore that's the way the lore

4140
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
is you know if you played Final Fantasy 12

4141
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
you know it's the men stay in the

4142
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
shadows and they're in hiding and it's like

4143
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
bitch you write the lore

4144
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
if you don't

4145
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
like the lore fix it

4146
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
like it's very easy

4147
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
for you to do this and if you

4148
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
want to talk about the lore

4149
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
well they've directly connected the

4150
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Hrothgar to

4151
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Ronso and I believe

4152
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
in Final Fantasy 10 somebody

4153
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
correct me if I'm wrong there were

4154
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
female Ronso in

4155
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Final Fantasy 10 I mean didn't

4156
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Kilmari have a wife or something

4157
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
like I'm almost talking about it

4158
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
yeah so like

4159
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
it's so even worse

4160
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
your plan B solution

4161
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
is not lore

4162
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
accurate and this also

4163
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
just ties in the reason why I say this isn't unique

4164
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
to the races in Final Fantasy 14

4165
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
is it it kind of ties into the whole

4166
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
problems of Blue Mage right

4167
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
they had to make Blue Mage a limited

4168
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
job because oh that was that's the

4169
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
lore that's the way we remember playing them in Final Fantasy

4170
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
5 and it's like you

4171
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Final Fantasy 14 is a new entry

4172
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
in the series you have every right to

4173
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
rewrite some lore like you

4174
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
can make Blue Mage like take some of the

4175
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
basic components of Blue Mage like oh

4176
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
they learn spells from monsters and

4177
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
like do your own thing with it

4178
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
like they did the last time you had an MMO

4179
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
in Final Fantasy 11 it came out great

4180
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
in 11 so why

4181
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
why this dude like it doesn't

4182
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
so I will give

4183
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
them credit they do seem to be

4184
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
hearing the feedback pretty loud and clear

4185
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
and I think they will probably

4186
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
ultimately patch in the

4187
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
the you know the male

4188
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
bunnies and the female Rothgar later on

4189
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
but it just seemed like it just like

4190
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
why why all of a sudden are we

4191
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
inventing these rules that like we have to

4192
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
follow these old established

4193
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
patterns like Final Fantasy

4194
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
14 made a name for

4195
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
itself by taking the pattern

4196
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
that had been established by Final Fantasy 11

4197
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
and smashing it so

4198
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
break the rules

4199
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Yoshi you earned it

4200
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
that's my thought

4201
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
all right well thank

4202
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
you for sharing your thoughts

4203
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
you're welcome sharing

4204
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
is caring I have a lot of feelings quickly

4205
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
what are your thoughts you're a 14 player what are

4206
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
your thoughts

4207
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
you know I was going

4208
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
to make I was going to consider

4209
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
changing my aura into a bunny

4210
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
boy but I really like my

4211
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
aura so it kind of made that

4212
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
decision easier I don't know I mean

4213
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I understand why people are upset

4214
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
but

4215
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
you know on the other

4216
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
hand it is just a game

4217
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
so yeah I don't know

4218
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
it is I had my moment

4219
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I inhaled exhaled

4220
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
and I played 14 you had your own touch moment

4221
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
hunty yeah I did I had to feel my oats

4222
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
and I went back and I played 14 again

4223
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
this week and it's

4224
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000

and we're already almost 20

4241
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
minutes past nine o'clock because some of the tech issues

4242
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
at the beginning so I do kind of want to start

02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
he got sentenced to 20 years

4274
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
in prison over that

4275
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
that's what you get for being shit

4276
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
he pled to I think like 50 counts

4277
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
of I don't remember

4278
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
false reports

4279
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I don't remember exactly what the charges were

4280
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
but 20 years surprise manslaughter

4281
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
isn't on there yeah I'm surprised

4282
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
too and then of course

4283
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
not to be outdone by PlayStation and

4284
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Microsoft had their ID

4285
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
at

4286
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Xbox Game Pass

4287
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
web video and

4288
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
so they announced several games

4289
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
that are going to be coming to Game Pass

4290
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
day one including Killer Queen

4291
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Black, Outer Wilds, and

4292
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Blazing Chrome

4293
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
and those are going to be

4294
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
the same day as they launch

4295
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
and those will be out before the

4296
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
end of 2019 they had other ones

4297
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
on the list as well but I don't remember

4298
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
all of those

4299
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
but it's neat to see that they're going to be

4300
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
supporting more indies that way

4301
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
that's pretty much it

4302
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
ok thanks

4303
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Loki for holding down the fort while I ran

4304
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
off to get a glass of water to try to make myself

4305
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
feel better with this little headache I've got going on

4306
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
again I want to apologize to those that didn't get through

4307
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
but please feel free to send us an email for a future week

4308
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
participate at orangelandtrady.com

4309
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
but it is that part of the show where we go

4310
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
around and get everybody's final thoughts

4311
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
so since I see Dark Sakura finishing a chocolate there

4312
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I'll start with Loki, Loki your final thought tonight

4313
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
my final thought is I gotta finish

4314
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
over all these edits onto my cabinet

4315
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
so I've got 8 down and probably

4316
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
another 20 left

4317
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
it's a lot

4318
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
but it'll be new stuff to play

4319
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
and they don't look easy at all

4320
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
alright, sounds like much

4321
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
including a Legend of Max

4322
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
edit by Gatton

4323
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
so that's, I'm not looking

4324
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
forward to that, but I'm going to play it

4325
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
let's see my final thought is

4326
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
headaches are crap

4327
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
and I hope this one goes away soon

4328
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I'm ready to take a nap

4329
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
but at this late hour that would mean just go to bed

4330
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
so that's what I'll be doing pretty soon here

4331
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
as soon as we wrap up

4332
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Dark Sakura, excuse me, last but not least

4333
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
your final thought

4334
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I've had a constant headache since the beginning of February

4335
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
and I found out why

4336
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
so

4337
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I just want some

4338
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
good vibes, do not pray for me

4339
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
because

4340
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
prayer without action is nothing

4341
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
but I would appreciate some good thoughts

4342
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
unless you're a witch

4343
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
then you can cast a good spell for my neck

4344
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
but other than that

4345
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I'm about to go to Walmart on

4346
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
purpose to buy the

4347
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
machines that we're missing

4348
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
we actually are missing Dig Dug

4349
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
they had a couple more of those, I think they had a couple more

4350
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
of both the ones I bought yesterday, so I think you should be fine

4351
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
we already have the Ms. Pac-Man, but we don't have the Galaga

4352
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
so I'll be going back for Galaga

4353
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Galaga is the target collection

4354
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
no, but there was another Galaga

4355
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
actually, Dan looked them up

4356
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
so apparently there's a Galaga in that series now

4357
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
he's still like number 9

4358
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I'll look at it, we'll see

4359
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
but also chocolate is amazing

4360
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
and one last important thing

4361
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
for everybody, there's only one you

4362
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
in this world, take care of yourself

4363
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
alright

4364
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
take care of yourself everybody

4365
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
we will see you, we're going to do this all again in

4366
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
7 days, have a wonderful night everybody

4367
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
thanks for being with us, oh I almost forgot

4368
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
my usual spiel, if you enjoyed what you heard

4369
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
here at Orange Laundry, please tell a friend or two about the show

4370
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
help us spread the word, because we are the show

4371
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
where every gamer has a voice, but if your voices

4372
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
aren't here, what are we to do, we're lost

4373
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
and with that, have a good week everybody

4374
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
we'll see you in 7 days, good night

4375
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
