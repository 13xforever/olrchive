14000	21000	This week, Microsoft may be starting their diskless transition either because of or in order to boost the popularity of Game Pass. Optical Media's death knell beckons.

32000	39000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
39000	50000	Live tonight with episode number 767 for this March the 10th of 2019 or Mar 10 Mario with what is actually take 2 of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
50000	54000	So for those that are watching live, yes you are living a little deja vu right now.
54000	55000	Thanks Thor.
55000	59000	Anyway, I'll explain that in a moment. Welcome back DarkSakura Jamie Summers.
59000	60000	Yo.
60000	61000	How are you doing?
61000	62000	I'm Orange C.
62000	64000	Yes, hey look and she's on the camera a little bit.
64000	65000	A little bit.
65000	67000	She's at an angle where she can kind of choose.
67000	68000	Now I'm Dr. Claw.
68000	69000	Yeah, she can kind of choose.
69000	70000	I can pinch heads.
70000	72000	When she wants to be on cam or not.
72000	74000	Your head's harder to get now.
74000	76000	Is your mic on? Because I can't even see the chat.
76000	77000	I had it on.
77000	79000	Oh, it's weird. I don't know.
79000	80000	Fuck you Mike.
81000	83000	Hey, my name's Mike and I don't like your attitude.
83000	84000	No, I'm just kidding.
84000	85000	I can't see chat right now.
85000	86000	So here's what's going on.
86000	87000	Also joining us.
87000	88000	I will look at the chat.
88000	89000	Techmaster Loki.
89000	90000	I'm here as well.
90000	91000	Surprise.
91000	97000	Things are a little crazy tonight because we just got through about 5 minutes of show
97000	101000	and then a power surge took out the show completely.
101000	103000	Which, you know, have been there done that right?
103000	105000	Gosh, Rob, won't you get your stupid...
105000	107000	God, the back of my head's all messed up.
107000	109000	What do you call the thing they keep telling me to buy?
109000	110000	It's the UPS.
110000	111000	The UPS.
111000	112000	God, Rob, when are you going to get your UPS?
112000	115000	I don't think a UPS would have stopped that whole thing because we have too much stuff
115000	116000	wired up.
116000	117000	It's on two separate outlets.
117000	120000	So yeah, I don't even think that would have saved us.
120000	123000	But here we are back for take two of our show this evening.
123000	128000	So I was talking to Dark Sakura about welcoming her back after I know she's been on a bit
128000	130000	of a hiatus and we've had a special show here and there.
130000	134000	But it's nice to have you back in studio with us.
134000	136000	What did we miss while you were gone?
136000	137000	Bullshit.
138000	139000	Fair enough.
139000	140000	Fair enough.
140000	144000	We had a death in the family last week.
144000	145000	I'm sorry to hear that.
145000	147000	We were all thinking of you guys last week as well.
147000	148000	Thank you.
148000	151000	I would prefer being thought of in the form of money or donuts.
151000	152000	Fair enough.
152000	155000	But not pheromone.
155000	160000	I really was just doing a lot of work and now my schedule has changed.
160000	162000	I work four tens now.
162000	165000	So I get three days off a week.
165000	166000	Nice.
166000	172000	I get off my lunch in time to go to the cafeteria at work where they serve really good food
172000	175000	and seven dollar pizza.
175000	181000	I actually in that last few months I've dropped about 10 pounds.
181000	182000	Congrats.
182000	184000	So thank you.
184000	189000	I the schedule changed because I got the position at work I wanted.
189000	191000	So yay.
191000	194000	And I'm sorry we have some chat ception here.
195000	200000	So let me let me set the stage real quick too because what I was talking about before
200000	205000	we got zapped the first time was that I was mentioning for the folks that do watch live
205000	210000	on Twitch or if you are watching in the archives because you're a subscriber over at VOG Network
210000	213000	we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right
213000	218000	after the Bobby Blackwell show at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
218000	222000	You can subscribe and get the video on demand or of course the podcast which is what this
222000	226000	is all is anyway is going to be free like it always has been for the past 15 plus years
226000	227000	we're doing it.
227000	230000	But if you are watching the video you're going to notice the angle is very different tonight
230000	235000	because we wanted to be able to work dark soccer in but in a way where she can be on
235000	237000	camera when she feels like I'm still a little camera shy.
237000	238000	Yeah that's fair.
238000	242000	But I do like the idea you were talking about about using wigs and your hair looks fantastic
242000	243000	tonight.
243000	244000	Well thank you.
244000	246000	This is yeah this is my new dye job.
246000	247000	Yes.
247000	250000	Why did no one tell me the back of my head was messy.
250000	256000	But it is flamingo on the roots and orange and peach.
256000	257000	All right.
257000	258000	Fair enough.
258000	259000	It was expensive.
259000	260000	All right.
260000	261000	Well look.
261000	263000	I got to look good for Dracon.
263000	268000	Our show got cut so abruptly the first time that I didn't even get to introduce in studio
268000	269000	here.
269000	270000	And you can't even see it.
270000	272000	But why are we all playing up to the video.
272000	273000	It's a podcast.
273000	274000	We're playing up to the video.
274000	276000	This is makes good for good weather podcasting.
276000	277000	Oh we're weather.
277000	279000	Oh is that a weather map you're trying to show.
279000	280000	I was just trying to.
280000	282000	You can't see it because video.
282000	284000	Yeah it doesn't work well.
284000	287000	But as you see there's a giant red thing.
287000	288000	I see.
288000	291000	There's one of those big red cells that's right over the neighborhood right now.
291000	292000	That's fantastic.
292000	293000	It looks like a little.
293000	296000	Why does this always happen Sunday night at six o'clock.
296000	297000	Just in time for.
297000	299000	Oh and for the record I have coffee.
299000	300000	OK.
300000	301000	My of my own.
301000	303000	I also want to introduce.
303000	307000	She's not on camera because she's camera shy and we respect that people don't have to be
307000	308000	on camera if they don't want to be.
308000	310000	But it's always a pleasure to have her in studio.
310000	313000	It's been a long time since we've seen you misty.
313000	314000	Oh L.
314000	317000	Are joining us tonight all the way from St. Louis Missouri.
317000	320000	And yes I would have called last week to warn you all myself.
320000	324000	But considering things were going weird with the weather then it was threatening to snow.
324000	330000	I decided to just pull an all nighter at the airport before I flew out into ultimately San Diego.
330000	333000	Well it's a pleasure to have you here.
333000	337000	Even if the travel plans were a little you know on the fly.
337000	345000	But even though Misty isn't on camera I did notice she put her little mascot on camera for us all to see with her with her travel transit card.
345000	347000	So it's a little hard to see on camera.
347000	351000	But for those of you that are watching on Twitch you can see a little piece of Misty on the camera.
351000	354000	So Misty it is fantastic to have you here.
354000	356000	You've been listening to all our long time right.
356000	357000	Yep.
357000	359000	What was your first episode?
359000	362000	If I'm remembering accurately 91.
362000	364000	91 ok so you've been listening a very long time.
364000	366000	Probably the only person listening longer than you is Dartitsuya.
366000	368000	Maybe a couple other people in chat.
368000	372000	What do you think about and I'm not to put you on the spot or anything.
372000	375000	But what do you think about this whole move to Twitch that we did recently.
375000	379000	Are you kind of are you into it or you think you think it wasn't a good move for us or what.
380000	390000	I'm still evaluating but also I'm kind of also mentally comparing back to the days when I would do Twitch as part of somebody's rock band stream.
390000	392000	Fair enough ok.
392000	396000	Although to be fair some of those times I was having a few drinks.
396000	398000	So that made me give less fucks.
398000	400000	You know Twitch sings is a thing.
400000	406000	And I have thought about what kind of fundraiser we could do to get Loki to participate with Twitch sings.
406000	408000	There's no fundraiser.
408000	412000	Well we'll see. Maybe in the future I can talk him into it. We'll see.
412000	415000	That would probably involve a lot of money.
415000	419000	So are you still playing stuff like rock band and all that stuff.
419000	423000	Or is that kind of in the past now since those games have kind of faded away.
423000	430000	It depends. There's only really one TV in the house these days and I don't usually have access to it.
430000	433000	So that cuts my rock band time down dramatically.
433000	434000	That's fair.
434000	438000	We'll check in on your other gaming week in a little bit here after we get past our kickoff topic.
438000	443000	But one other thing I did kind of want to point out with the whole transition to video.
443000	447000	Because you've been to this show before when we were just like audio you know and all that.
447000	451000	Isn't it weird now how we have to actually like pay attention to a camera.
451000	456000	And like how we when you were at the shows before we just all be multitasking kind of off in our own world.
456000	460000	And now it's like oh shoot we can't we can't get away with that illusion anymore now that the camera is on.
461000	463000	Although that is a bonus to me not being on camera.
463000	466000	That's true. You can multitask all you want. That's fine.
466000	472000	All right. And hello to our chatters of course over at Twitch TV slash vog network where again I'll say it one more time.
472000	478000	We do tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show when the weather cooperates.
478000	481000	But hey we stuck through it. We made it through round two. Knock on wood.
481000	483000	I think that weather cells finally passed though. Not hearing.
483000	487000	Yeah it's weird though because like I was looking at the map it actually is going the opposite direction than normally is.
487000	490000	Normally we come from the coast and kind of goes towards the east.
490000	494000	But you know yeah yeah it's going the other way. Oh interesting. Yeah so weird.
494000	501000	OK well hopefully it doesn't come back. We'll see. Anyway I do want to get into our kickoff topic tonight which has to do with the day.
501000	510000	So a lot of people of course are talking about it's Mario Day or Mar 10 March 10th not Mar 10 from Belgium who emails us.
510000	514000	Although he should have a day as well. But this is March 10th or Mario when you write it out.
514000	518000	And of course because we had the power failure all the questions I had prepared just got taken away.
518000	523000	So I'm going to have to do this off the cusp. But let's talk a little bit about Mario and I open this up to chat as well.
523000	529000	First off the question you got to get asked when we talk about Mario. What's your favorite like Mario game.
529000	532000	What's your favorite experience playing a Mario title.
532000	538000	My favorite Mario game is probably the first one for Super Mario Brothers. The very first one for Super Mario Brothers.
538000	544000	Yeah because that's kind of what I remember like being introduced to like Nintendo is just playing the original Super Mario Brothers.
545000	551000	Yeah. Although you know when we talk about the original time I know it was around before that but I get it.
551000	556000	Yeah the original Super Mario Brothers not Mario Brothers. Fair enough. Dark soccer. What about you.
556000	566000	I'm going to probably say Super Mario World just because I really for me it's something I love to made it better with different challenges.
566000	577000	And I remember being so excited by the commercials and really it was having that and a link to the past is what made me lean back toward Super Nintendo when my mom put the decision in front of me.
577000	588000	What do we get. An NES or a Genesis. And I did bring up. Can I get a turbo graphics. And she said no. So because of course you did. Of course I did.
588000	599000	I actually ended up though playing so much Super Mario World that and linked to the past that my poor brothers hardly touched the machine. It was mine.
599000	609000	I would actually say my favorite Mario memory was probably Super Mario 2 which I know is a weird one to pick because we all know that was not originally a Mario game it was a different game in Japan.
609000	612000	It did get released in Japan. Oh Super Mario USA.
612000	622000	Yes. And it's on their virtual not virtual console. The NES switch online library. They actually got that game as Super Mario USA so you can go play it if you have the Japanese client.
622000	631000	But I would say doki doki panic was a pain in the ass. Yeah. You know they made some quality like things. And as a kid come on when I first played that game I was probably like 11.
631000	638000	So like you didn't know this whole history. You know we didn't have back in my day we didn't have the Internet or that stuff. It was what we would read about a magazine.
638000	645000	So they kind of were pretty good about keeping the secret that this was a completely different game in Japan that they had relabeled. So I didn't know any of that.
645000	654000	So I just I do consider Super Mario to a Mario game and especially because it's certainly part of the canon because we've seen shy guys show up in other games.
654000	663000	I feel like kind of Mario 2 now exists in that same canon as like the Yoshi side games which kind of ties into my world to kind of like a lot of that kind of comes from there.
663000	678000	But it was the music and I think it was the how the graphics really looked like I was playing a cartoon. Y'all remember like the ending to Mario 2 the first time you saw it with with him taking a nap with Mario taking a nap and it's like that kind of looked like a cartoon.
678000	686000	You know it was because the graphics were extremely simple but it was it was really stunning at the time I think as a kid. I don't know that was that was what I really remember about it.
686000	691000	Misty what about you. Do you have a favorite Mario title.
691000	708000	Actually I don't have the game on me but I'm thinking more long lines of Super Mario Land 2 6 golden coins because all the way back when I was like in fifth or sixth grade there were a few people that somehow we got to take our game boys to school with us.
708000	716000	And eventually I ended it was originally some other kids game but I eventually ended up with it I still have it to this day.
716000	727000	You know it's funny because I bet some people would say that's a more obscure Mario pick but like knowing you and like the way that you game you play a lot of portable stuff you because you're a big transit gal.
727000	736000	You like to go on these trips to take the trains to take the light rails you know and go on and rail and stuff which I think is super cool because my dad was a railroad guy until he retired.
736000	748000	So you're kind of doing the consumer side of that I suppose but you can play I remember one time the last time you were here I think we took the train up to Reno and you were playing Pokemon yellow on the way and it's kind of like I can chill out play my game.
748000	757000	Watch the scenery go by you know and do that so it like totally doesn't surprise me to hear that like a portable Mario game ended up being your choice.
757000	772000	So I like that anyway. Let's see going to our chat over at twitch TV slash vog network Tiger class as I remember the ending to Mario to everything that happened was all just a dream it never happened or did it.
773000	775000	Is that why we don't have Wharton smash.
776000	784000	Wart for smash. Come on. When are we going to get that anywhere. Any of the characters from what would he do just barf vegetables at you. Hell yeah.
784000	787000	No he doesn't barf vegetables he barfs gut.
787000	794000	If we could turn piranha plant into a smash character we can turn anybody into a smash character. Mario 2 had a great soundtrack and I love that.
794000	800000	That end boss theme when you're fighting war that you know what's funny about that game though this is awesome.
800000	806000	It's just that the game was a big advert for a television station.
806000	810000	Well originally but originally 11 year old came out of it. Yeah that's true.
810000	819000	That's true. And it's funny is because I really think Nintendo doesn't want that associated with Doki Doki anymore because that's not the game Japan got and probably licensing and things like that you know play into it.
819000	826000	You know you're probably just never going to see Doki Doki panic again unless ROMs emulation of course ever drive. Yeah.
826000	841000	Which funny enough the ever drive will play the the disk games with no problem but Doki Doki panic is like I think that Mario Mario 2 is a vast improvement over Doki Doki panic.
841000	847000	Oh it is. It's like the quality of life improvements you know like you don't have to beat it with every character.
847000	856000	Yeah exactly. You have you have the size thing you have the ability to run the ability to run makes that game. Yeah for sure.
856000	864000	It's annoying to play without it. Yeah I think it's one of those things where like I think a hipster a gamer hipster be like well Doki Doki panic was it's like no it was not a better game.
864000	871000	It was not. I mean it was it was more challenging. It was niche. Sure it was more challenging. It's a fun like party trick.
871000	886000	But at the end of the day they made improvements and that's what Mario 2 is the design gave us what we have now going to chat for some of the other comments there is some several folks talking about one of the other memorable bosses in that game.
887000	890000	Kaijuto says the bomb mouse should be in smash.
890000	901000	Mouser. That's right Mouser and I think actually. Yeah. Somebody else said that in chat. Yeah see Tabiri said hashtag Mouser for Smash. So yeah I was really cool. I would go for that. Yeah for sure.
901000	911000	Or at the very least Mario maker too. Oh yeah. They still need like not just the Bowser kids but like the Mario bosses would be awesome.
911000	922000	Well OK. I didn't mean for this whole thing to become a Mario 2 discussion but let me ask this question. I think this might be a tougher question. Why Mario as the mascot that stuck around all this time.
922000	933000	You know why is this you know oversized Italian plumber dude. You know why is he the guy that stuck around this whole time.
933000	941000	Because before that the mascots I mean there was really a mascot of like video games Pac-Man I guess. I mean there wasn't a whole lot of there was a there was a.
941000	951000	I mean Pac-Man branding was pretty crazy. There was a Pac-Man cartoon as Pac-Man board game. We Hubert had a lot to plush animals. You know I had a plush Pac-Man when I was a little kid.
951000	959000	I still have a plush ghost monster that I went out of a crane game. Yeah but nobody says happy Pac-Man day. I mean I think I certainly think people look back on Pac-Man remember it fondly.
959000	973000	Pac-Man is a strong brand. Pac-Man got in Smash which is you know cracks me up. But as far as Mario why is Mario stood the test of time. I mean the first Mario game what was was when he was Jumpman and Donkey Kong was what 82.
973000	985000	So we're talking like a long time ago but there was also a lot of Donkey Kong merchandise too. I think what it is is it came out with the generation that started with the NES or at least had more memories of the NES because it was marketed more more.
985000	1000000	I mean we started off I'd say with our age we truly started off with like say the Atari 2600. That was our big thing and so when we got crappy arcade games that were out at the same time that's where our brains went to.
1000000	1008000	But when we were teenagers younger teenagers and new kids coming up and gaming really started taking off again.
1009000	1020000	That's why I'm smiling because at least if nothing else your hand gestures get picked up by Twitch but it's great. I love it. Don't touch that.
1020000	1029000	This is a family show. Why is she fingering Pikachu? We are not a family show Rob. We are a dysfunctional family show.
1029000	1044000	Anyway. Anyway. No I please continue fun and dysfunction. I agree with you generational generational thing. But apart from that too it really came around when Nintendo decided to make Super Mario Brothers a pack in game.
1044000	1057000	That is what did it. It was among the first of games to be a true pack in because I don't think that hardly any of the other games came in any earlier systems came in with a pack in combat combat for the 27.
1057000	1069000	It was in a good game. And it didn't like it didn't have a mascot. I didn't have the mass. I didn't have a character. It was just exactly. Yeah. The two tanks bone each other out when I was going around playing on my clique vision.
1069000	1085000	It was Donkey Kong was what I first thought of with my clique vision or venture. It was the little circle head with the arrow you know which was by the way the best home version Avenger just saying but we had an identifiable character.
1085000	1099000	Who was in millions of homes that every kid knew that because every kid with the system had it. I'm only gonna but there's one tiny exception technicality.
1099000	1111000	The Rob the robot system came with Duck Hunt and gyro might not have more. I am saying Mario was not originally a pack in game. You bought it separately. Right. And that was that one that went for all that money to remember.
1111000	1126000	That's true. Yes. Just a couple weeks ago. But it was when they saw that having a good pack in game for the action series and not everyone got the the what was the Rob series called the the the robot series fucking weird.
1126000	1147000	It didn't sell as well. Yeah. There's my shoe. But the whole point of it was that we had an identifiable character sent in with all of the systems. It was who everybody's first association with the NES. The majority of people's first association with the NES was also with Mario.
1147000	1174000	I think you're spot on. I think there's like a generational thing to it. I think like you know like somewhere that bridge kind of between Gen X and millennial and really kind of like both generations I think a little bit like we grew up with Mario because just about 90 percent of the people probably more than that 95 percent of the people that had a Nintendo in their homes had Super Mario Brothers because it was just that quintessential NES game that everybody had to play and had to have you know.
1174000	1190000	And also don't don't forget to you know it ended up setting a precedent for having a mascot game released with a system. Yes. Interesting. It was interesting to see other systems try to copy that because Sega didn't come out the gate with Sonic. Sonic was not a pack in.
1191000	1210000	Sega was using trying to use Alex Kidd. Yeah. At first but it's curious that Alex Kidd didn't stick. It's just interesting they didn't use in the same way. Very good comment I think in our chat at Twitch TV VOG Network. Miramews in chat said because Nintendo won't let us forget Mario.
1210000	1231000	That's a very interesting perspective too is that it's it's not just that Mario might be the first. It's that Nintendo has kind of like never let go of them. Nintendo adopted Mario as the mascot in many ways and and like just about every pack in has involved Mario or every quintessential game has involved Mario up until a little more recently.
1231000	1246000	I mean the GameCube obviously was kind of an anomaly because Super Mario Sunshine didn't come out till later Luigi. Well the Wii. I guess it's true I guess. Yeah now I'm thinking about it. You know you have Mario 64 you had you had Super Mario World but Nintendo land.
1246000	1260000	Yeah we you and it didn't really do the Mario thing but maybe by that time it wasn't needed. Mario was something that you looked forward to. You knew there would be a Mario game. We have to have our pack in game that's really just tech demos that were packaging as a game.
1260000	1277000	Well not to get too far off topic though but that was so important as to why the Wii sold as well as it did. Yeah people didn't buy it. I've said this before on the show people didn't buy the Wii for the Wii. People bought the Wii for Wii Tennis and Wii Sports but really it was Wii Tennis. That was the thing that sold millions of those systems.
1277000	1293000	Who thought tennis would sell twice. Well and in a way I mean to bring it back to the top it's all Pong again for March 10th Super Mario Brothers was the game that really sold the NES to many people. People didn't buy the NES for Hogan's Alley as great as that game was.
1293000	1309000	Are you trying to tell me that people didn't purchase a switch for one to switch. Are you saying that that is a complete oversight of Nintendo. The Zelda game was a little stronger and people but it had switch in the title.
1309000	1329000	Okay more comments in chat. VG Realness says I think the big reason why Mario is still around is because Nintendo keeps making Mario relevant and interesting. Changing how his games are played. Mega Man could still be around but Capcom gave up. Sonic is lost because Sega doesn't know what to do with him.
1329000	1349000	Oh they know what to do with him. They turn him into a movie. Well we'll get to that later in the show. But I think with Sonic. I think. I don't think. I think Sonic is a strong brand. I don't think Sega has really made a mistake with Sonic. I think the only thing that maybe Sega has maybe miscalculated a little bit with Sonic is that Sonic should be in everything. But then again.
1349000	1362000	Before y'all jump in there. Mario's kind of. Mario plays tennis. Mario has an RPG. Mario kind of. Mario is missing. You know Mario. Sonic's in Smash now so. I guess I guess. So he's made it right.
1362000	1374000	Cia Tabiri in chat says I think that Mario is partially all about that brand and that basic idea that is universal. It is the stamp of approval as well. Mario is on this. It's going to be a decent game.
1374000	1386000	Let me ask one more question here and then we'll move on with the rest of our show. Especially since we're getting a late start tonight because of the freak weather and Take Two. But with Mario and all that and branding and everything else.
1386000	1402000	And talking about maybe Microsoft for a minute. You know we look at the Xbox. Microsoft doesn't have Mario. Microsoft doesn't have anything like Mario. I mean Master Chief. I guess we could debate this a little bit.
1402000	1419000	It's cheap you. Microsoft Master Chef over Master Chief. Microsoft doesn't have a Mario. Would they be in a better place if they did. And I open that up to our chatters as well. Yes. But the Sony have a Mario.
1419000	1434000	No. And I suppose that they tried with Sackboy and then that didn't really go anywhere. They tried with Ratchet and Clank. That didn't really go anywhere. Microsoft just has their name. True. And they have their computing background of shitty computers.
1434000	1448000	They have Clippy. So I guess that's you know if they would just do a Clippy game. It would be over. Yes it would be over. But I actually think that would be kind of fun. Like if somebody were to make like a Clippy game like official Microsoft Clippy game.
1448000	1463000	And look I'm not I'm not trying to shade Microsoft or say they make that. I will. Will you stop. But I'm just trying to say that you know they don't have that strong brand sense that Nintendo has with Mario or that even that Sega has with Sonic.
1463000	1473000	But I suppose you're right. Sony doesn't really have one either. But I will say what Sony has. Sony definitely has you think Uncharted. You think God of War. You think Last of Us. They have some strong franchises.
1473000	1487000	Microsoft has a few of those two for sure. Halo. Forza. All those things are very important certainly. But you know they don't really have that face. I don't know. I know I've just took a moment to check out the app store on my computer here.
1487000	1500000	I'm looking at Civ 6. Divinity Original Sin. I'm looking at a bunch of games that you know we wouldn't have had over here an age ago I think there's a lot more development going on.
1500000	1508000	I have Let Go of the Incredibles. I have a bunch of really good stuff on here. You know Borderlands came out. Total War Warhammer.
1508000	1514000	Tyreclaw asks what's Activision's mascot. Greed.
1514000	1525000	DLC packs. SS 200 Matt says Crash Bandicoot and Spyro were Sony's mascot early on. Only difference is that Sony's mascots aren't as iconic as Mario and Sonic.
1525000	1535000	Lots of people in chat love and the Clippy thing. Bobby in chat says Microsoft originally wanted Blinks to be their Mario. So.
1535000	1536000	So anyway.
1536000	1550000	Potential and I guess as you mentioned the little robots now are kind of Sony's mascot. Yeah but they have the VR game that's supposed to be pretty good but they don't really have anything else that's outside of that.
1550000	1552000	But yeah the robots are cool.
1552000	1563000	You know I think I think at the end of the day I think part of why people love Mario so much I think it does definitely tie into something you were hitting there on Jamie early on is it's that it's that thing the generation grew up with.
1563000	1571000	It's that thing people remember playing first off and the first thing that they ever kind of you know played. I think that's a big reason why.
1571000	1582000	And then Nintendo kind of kept reinforcing Mario which is very important too. Like you know and in new and different ways you know Mario Odyssey is very different game than the original Super Mario Brothers and I think that's very important too.
1582000	1592000	I think with that earlier chat comment that Mega Man was kind of the same thing over and over and they they kind of tried to do new things with Mega Man but like when it didn't sell millions and millions they just gave up.
1593000	1604000	You know and that's why I think Mega Man as much as a lot of people remember Mega Man fondly it didn't end up being as strong of a brand until maybe you know the recent resurgence with Smash and Mega Man 11 and all that stuff.
1604000	1615000	So I definitely think the whole like thing that when we were kids has a lot to do with it. You know huge movie at the box office this weekend Captain Marvel.
1615000	1625000	I haven't seen it yet. That's no shade. I just hardly ever get to the movies but I understand that a lot of 90s nostalgia and Captain Marvel apparently.
1625000	1633000	And this is the type of thing that people think is really awesome is like I saw Bobby nitpick in some blockbuster scene because he worked as a trailer.
1633000	1644000	Yeah I was in the trailer whatever. But anyway like just people and not in about I'm just saying that people the music I saw somebody also my my friends list was like oh man I put together this playlist with all this awesome 90s music that was in Captain Marvel and stuff.
1644000	1656000	I think there's just there's a soft spot a lot of people have for nostalgia and like whereas when we were kids video games was something that adults didn't always understand. We are the adults now.
1656000	1665000	Yeah. So anyway, I'm reminded of that scene in the craft when they get off the bus and she says we are the crazy people anyway.
1665000	1681000	Let's see going into chat for some other comments here as 200 points out the ferret was O.L. ours mascot. I have the ferret at home. Let's see Tiger Claw chat says Rob I love how much you I love how much you love cats and you will love Captain Marvel.
1681000	1691000	I'm sure I will. Maybe I'll get to see it eventually. I just I so rarely I'm going to go probably see it after work tomorrow. I'm kind of surprised you hadn't seen it yet because I've been dealing with things.
1691000	1703000	Well fair enough. Fair enough. But I know you're a big Captain Marvel fan so I'm sure you're excited to see. Although my brain still sometimes you know wants to call her Miss Marvel because back she was Miss Marvel before the new one.
1703000	1717000	And so I still see like they even made a nod in one of the recent Jessica Jones graphic novels. They made a nod to Miss Marvel's old costume the bathing suit by putting Jessica in it when someone captured her.
1717000	1733000	It was pretty funny. OK. But yeah but yeah I know that's all I was a Carol Danvers fan back when she was binary and hanging out with the X-Men in space. So I'm I'm super super excited. I just need time.
1733000	1746000	Sure. I understand. And not too many crowds at work. Well I don't want to get too far off base here with a movie talk. Let's get into more gaming talk by talking about our gaming weeks and how was your gaming week and dark soccer.
1746000	1757000	We can finally come back to you to start it off. How was your time to get my pictures because I take pictures of everything I play. OK. Because Tuesday Dan's mom canceled out on us so she could have soup.
1757000	1773000	So we went to the launch party for the Munsters pinball which is pretty freakin sweet. This is a coin up. So what I played that day is I did start off with the Munsters. I played Deadpool pinball. I played a lot of Deadpool pinball.
1773000	1794000	I played Tron. I played Dig Dug. I played oh that's more beer. I played Ghostbusters which I own one now. We just got it. That's right. I played Street Fighter 2 on a broken one P controller. I played Tetris in the arcade. See I took pictures of everything that's Tetris.
1795000	1809000	Galaga I played Galaga really well when I'm drunk. So you were having kind of Donkey Kong old school games and pinball night. I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I played more Deadpool. I took a lot of pictures of Deadpool.
1810000	1829000	And then I've also we did some more Resident Evil 2. I'm borrowing Horizon right now for PS4. So I'll be starting that soon. We also were talking about nabbing Kingdom Hearts 3 but we've still got so much else in the backlog right now.
1829000	1850000	Just that a lot of pinball and a lot of classic gaming and Dan and I are trying to work out the logistics of if we're going to hook up one of the classic systems to the current TV because of the input lag from the old systems or if we're going to hook up the old systems on the CRT and play in our very stuffed office right now.
1851000	1866000	For we're thinking about doing like a he plays she plays. Oh you know I'm still going to do cheat to win. I just have to figure out you know how to get everything set up the way I want to in the office because I actually have to have somewhere to sit in the office to play.
1866000	1880000	And right now the TV is way too low from where my chair is. So we'll see. All right. But I I'm going to actually I've decided that when I do that I'm going to play Eddie Guerrero's entrance music because that was this whole thing cheat to win.
1881000	1895000	Rest in peace Eddie Guerrero. So there you go. All right. Loki how about you. How was your gaming week. I didn't play a whole ton of stuff this week. I mainly I've been trying to get back in the whole swing of like actually doing programming and stuff.
1895000	1903000	So that's what I've been mainly doing this week. I did play some stuff yesterday because we went over to John's incredible pizza.
1903000	1914000	And so I ended up playing mainly I had to drag my kids around and they played stuff but I got to play Dances Revolution supernova. So I did play that a little bit.
1915000	1925000	And that was fun. But they didn't have all the songs unlocked and that made me sad because there's stuff I wanted to play and there was like a stupid barbers missing and like I know it was on there because it was in the credits where it shows all the songs.
1925000	1941000	I'm like I see it. It's not here though. And unless there's like some hidden like all songs options but I was selecting it under like you know expert difficulty or whatever because you can select your difficulty in the very beginning before you select your songs.
1941000	1955000	And it wasn't on there at all. So unless it's just some stupid sorting hidden option crap where I had to find some hidden all music mode or some bullshit it just wasn't unlocked which is weird.
1956000	1969000	But yeah I played that. All right. That's it. All right. No other guy is dude at a place that I haven't been to the John's Pizza or whatever in years but is it is it anything besides like do they have actual arcade games.
1969000	1978000	Oh yeah they got tons arcade games actually. They have quite a few arcade games. There's a bunch of big stand up things. They have one of these like tiny rooms where you get the Dodge like lasers.
1978000	1984000	You have to crawl through the laser maze type thing. That's kind of cool. My kids wouldn't do it though they don't understand what's going on.
1984000	1994000	Entrapment. Haven't you ever seen entrapment. Yes. Yeah. Show the kids entrapment. I don't want to show them entrapment but no. So they had that. They've got like they actually had another music game there.
1995000	2010000	I don't remember what some percussion thing they had there. Then all your big like kind of shooter like cockpit games. So they had the Jurassic Park when they had some transformers game some pirates one.
2010000	2019000	My kids love the Jurassic Park one. That's like my youngest son's favorite game. We played every place that has it.
2020000	2031000	And then of course John's incredible pizza for those are not aware because I don't know if they're a nationwide chain but they have they have carnival rides inside of there as well.
2031000	2040000	So it's arcade games and then they have like inside this one they've got a giant thing called the twister. So it's a giant carnival ride. They have bumper cars a bowling alley places are huge.
2040000	2050000	This one is the former Sam's Club or something right. I don't know what it used to be but yeah it's it's something but like I remember their pizza not being very good but it was actually pretty good.
2050000	2061000	Although they do have some pretty exotic like pizza flavors like they had one as a spicy paint a spicy peanut butter pizza. So it's basically all the components of a pepperoni pizza but with peanut butter sauce.
2062000	2071000	It's tasted like peanut butter when I bit into it but they have like other stuff too that's not so weird. OK. Loki's food to review. Let's go. All right. That's it. All right.
2071000	2081000	Misty what have you been playing these days. First that pizza sounds like I'll definitely take a pass on it but most especially considered in the past week.
2081000	2093000	Mostly DDR I. I went to Dave and Busters in L.A. I went to the one in Daly City both of course to play tomorrow. I hope I better wake up early enough to add Roseville to that list.
2093000	2102000	Nice. And you can tell us how terrible the Dave and Busters in Roseville is because it's so small and they don't have like anything there. It's unfortunate.
2102000	2114000	What's your favorite a song to play. Sorry we're playing. We're actually doing entrapment in the studio right now as dark soccer crawls around a microphone cord. Sorry.
2114000	2130000	What's your favorite song to play. And as usual I can't really pick one but some some of my favorites are shut up and dance over. Oh there's one I found recently because I'm on my phone term music player.
2130000	2139000	I do have a lot of DVR stuff. I've one that caught my attention recently was somehow you found me and it is on a machine so I can play it.
2139000	2145000	Awesome. I'm going into our chat at Twitch TV slash vlog network. I darted to you giving a tip for low QL.
2145000	2156000	If you keep scrolling down all songs is at the very bottom. Supernova arcade is weird. So used to very bottom of what like the difficulties like I kept pushing down.
2156000	2166000	That was I guess. OK. I don't remember. That's dumb. OK. If I should put it if I put it on expert it should have all those songs because I'm playing an expert level.
2166000	2176000	They shouldn't have another. Oh sorry. This is for the people that want to play. I don't know. Whatever. Yes it's weird. It's a very weird machine. All right.
2176000	2184000	Anyway if Misty's all done with her gaming week I will talk a little bit about mine. So for my gaming week so I was on a trip this week I went to Las Vegas.
2184000	2196000	So I didn't get to play a lot of games because I was on my way to Las Vegas because I got tickets for my birthday to see the Gwen Stefani resident show which I know this isn't a concert review show but I will say it was very good.
2196000	2207000	That's the first time I've ever seen a residency show and part of what made that show really good. I mean not just the fact that Gwen's a good performer she's got a lot of great energy and you know she has a rich catalog because of course she did all the no doubt stuff too.
2207000	2216000	But just the fact that like the stage and the costumes and everything can be tailored because you're doing the same show over and over again you're not having to pack it up and take it somewhere else.
2216000	2228000	So the stage stuff ends up being very elaborate and it's really cool. Like some of like just the custom way they would shoot stuff for some of her performances were just amazing.
2228000	2239000	So yeah I had a great time at the show so if you're in the Vegas area I would recommend it or honestly now I'm like I want to go see more residency shows like I can't fucking believe I missed Brittany in this because Gwen's playing at the theater.
2239000	2244000	I would love to see Janet but you know who else is going to be there? Christina.
2244000	2246000	I'd rather see Janet.
2246000	2249000	Yeah I would love Janet too honestly.
2249000	2251000	As long as she's not you know caping for her brother.
2251000	2260000	Well that's complex yes. But anyway so I had a good time in Vegas. However there is one very important thing I did get to do in Las Vegas.
2260000	2268000	Finally I've only been there like four or five times and I finally went to and I actually have some b-roll for those of you on Twitch. I went to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.
2268000	2274000	So I actually so I had a very a very similar week to Dark Sakura where I played some pinball and some classic games.
2274000	2283000	So for those who are listening on the podcast feed we're looking at some of the shots of the Pinball Hall of Fame and you can see this is just a it's a place that's just full of various pinball machines.
2283000	2286000	It's kind of like going to California extreme.
2286000	2288000	I went to their old location before they moved.
2288000	2291000	Oh did you? I didn't even know they had a second location.
2291000	2298000	But they have a lot of like old classic games as well and those that are watching on Twitch can see some classic games that are on display as well.
2298000	2302000	I thought this figure ice skating game this ice review is really cute.
2302000	2308000	See they have the classic tables but they have that mixed in with some newer tables as well including and stuff from the 80s.
2308000	2312000	The minute I saw the Elvira party monsters machine I had to play it.
2312000	2315000	So I was like oh that was the first machine I played.
2315000	2318000	There's someone selling a scared stiff by the way for under a grand I think.
2318000	2324000	I played this Adams family that has the color replacement monitor which I thought was really cool.
2324000	2326000	Adams family is like a classic table.
2326000	2328000	The term you're looking for is a color DMD.
2328000	2330000	Thank you. And then they have classic arcade games as well.
2330000	2333000	So it wasn't just pinball they had classic arcades stuff as well.
2333000	2335000	Things like Tron and so forth.
2335000	2339000	I figured some folks out there like Brad might appreciate the Doctor Who table so I had to get a picture of that too.
2339000	2342000	Which also had the DRD color thing.
2342000	2345000	DM DMD sorry.
2345000	2347000	This was weird too.
2347000	2350000	So this was a machine you put in four dollars.
2350000	2352000	This has to be from the 50s or 60s.
2352000	2357000	And it actually injects all this plastic and makes a mold right in front of you of Donald Duck.
2357000	2361000	That is actually made for you right there while you're watching.
2361000	2363000	And you can actually pick it up there.
2363000	2366000	Melody couldn't figure out where the door was and then I had to point at where it was.
2366000	2369000	And this machine is so old Donald Duck came out without an eye.
2369000	2372000	But it was still pretty cool.
2372000	2375000	And it smelled like burnt plastic all in that area.
2375000	2377000	So yeah it was kind of neat.
2377000	2379000	I didn't even know that was a thing they had.
2379000	2381000	But I guess this machine you've probably seen this before the Pinball Circus.
2381000	2383000	Only one of two ever made.
2383000	2386000	Because it's like multiple layers on this thing.
2386000	2390000	Like you have pinballs that go up to a different track and all this other crazy stuff.
2390000	2400000	Pinball Circus was one of those tables that was released when Bally and Midway were really trying to expand out of the standard pinball.
2400000	2403000	That's actually the precursor to what became Pinball 2000.
2403000	2404000	Ah okay.
2404000	2407000	Because Pinball 2000 was the one that incorporated video and that.
2407000	2409000	And this was like right before that era of pinball.
2409000	2411000	Yeah. So anyway.
2411000	2414000	I didn't really get a chance to shoot everything that I played there.
2414000	2416000	But I wanted to bring back some footage for you guys.
2416000	2417000	Because I had a good time at the museum.
2417000	2420000	It was kind of like going to a classic game festival.
2420000	2422000	But just in the middle of Las Vegas.
2422000	2429000	So I guess in some ways you can go to the strip to see classic performers doing their residency show.
2429000	2432000	And you can go off strip to see classic arcade setups.
2432000	2437000	One last thing about that. The original location, the one that I went to, was right across the street from the Liberace Museum.
2437000	2438000	Oh.
2438000	2442000	So I didn't go to the Liberace Museum though. I'm sad.
2442000	2445000	This was next door to a place that sold video games.
2445000	2447000	And the guy that ran it was really nice.
2447000	2450000	He was talking to Melody and I and he actually let us kind of peek in his office.
2450000	2452000	Because he had a bunch of collectibles that were in there as well.
2452000	2454000	And he's trying to sell some games and stuff.
2454000	2456000	He had some cabinets in that place as well.
2456000	2460000	And the thing that cracked me up the most though was that there was something under construction right next to it.
2460000	2464000	Because there was a giant tarp and it had written on it, I assure you were open.
2464000	2468000	Just like the movie Clerks. I was dying.
2468000	2470000	So that made me happy.
2470000	2472000	So yeah. I had a good time.
2472000	2474000	So that ended up being pretty much my gaming week.
2474000	2477000	Because obviously unless we want to talk about slot machines.
2477000	2479000	Which I don't think we do.
2479000	2481000	Technically they're video games Konami makes.
2481000	2485000	I was going to say if we want to talk about Konami we can talk about slot machines.
2485000	2487000	Because I played a lot of them.
2487000	2491000	And I will say I set a $200 gambling budget for my Vegas trip.
2491000	2493000	Because that's the rule. You've got to set yourself a budget.
2493000	2495000	And I will say I stayed even.
2495000	2497000	I only ended up $20 under.
2497000	2499000	Which for a $200 budget isn't bad.
2499000	2501000	Yeah. And for the entertainment I got.
2501000	2503000	So. Anyway.
2503000	2509000	But still based on the video this does give me another excuse to go back to Vegas.
2509000	2515000	Because granted the way my flights worked out I ended up connecting in Vegas.
2515000	2517000	But of course I didn't leave McCarran because of that.
2517000	2523000	But Vegas was where my original partner and shenanigans my grandpa and grandpa would drive us there.
2523000	2525000	Me and my grandpa and him.
2525000	2528000	Oh good. Because I was going to say the Pinball Hall of Fame it's not on the strip by any means.
2528000	2530000	It's a ways away.
2530000	2535000	Oh still this is a more valid excuse thing than go wander the strip in half fields.
2535000	2538000	Yeah. But we were taking Lyft everywhere.
2538000	2541000	Just because thanks to. I will say this.
2541000	2543000	Because Bobby will get a kick out of this. He's listening.
2543000	2549000	Thanks to all these years of Dragon Con and the VoG suite and the reward points that come with that suite.
2549000	2551000	This Vegas hotel was free.
2551000	2553000	Gotta work some points.
2553000	2555000	Yeah exactly. Exactly. Not gonna.
2555000	2560000	But it's funny that like one year of Dragon Con can pay for two nights in Vegas in reward points.
2560000	2563000	So thank you Bobby. You helped with that.
2563000	2568000	But I brought back some B-roll for VoG so at least I could say it was a working trip.
2568000	2571000	But also going back to the Uber and Lyft thing.
2571000	2574000	I don't blame you for doing that. You didn't have me to help you get around.
2574000	2576000	That's true. That's true. No we didn't.
2576000	2581000	Yeah. We're just you know especially after we've had a little after after mimosas at brunch.
2581000	2584000	It's a little harder to navigate the transit system that's for sure.
2584000	2589000	All right. Anyway that's enough for our game. We need to get in some gaming news because we're getting a really late start tonight unfortunately.
2589000	2596000	So we may actually run through some of this news a little faster just because we have lost time because of the power outage at the beginning of the show.
2596000	2604000	So Bobby's like where's my free nights in Vegas. Bobby you pick the residency show and the days and we'll make it happen.
2605000	2608000	And depending on the show I might crash this party too. There you go.
2608000	2610000	And how is Hell's Kitchen.
2610000	2614000	OK. Yes. All right. So you don't just go to Vegas for the shows.
2614000	2619000	You go for the food which cannot be bought with reward points and that's where a lot of the budget went.
2619000	2624000	So we actually went to at Caesar's Palace Gordon Ramsay has an official Hell's Kitchen restaurant.
2624000	2631000	And so we actually ate there one night and I had the beef Wellington because you have you have to get something that's like their specialty.
2631000	2635000	So you can get lobster risotto which I didn't. Yeah I don't really care for that. Yeah.
2635000	2639000	But I got the beef Wellington. Oh my God.
2639000	2645000	That is one of the best meals I've had in my entire life. Like really. Seriously. Like you know I paid for it.
2645000	2648000	It was an expensive dinner but it was it was worth it.
2648000	2654000	So Wellington is a bitch to prepare. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why you have to make a puff pastry. You have to. Oh God.
2654000	2658000	I want to cook it though. That's why it's a classic. I've made it before and they're delicious. Yeah.
2658000	2662000	I also had these scallops but they were like of course they were bacon infused somehow.
2662000	2668000	But yeah I think really good because why not. But I'll tell you this one more one more foodie thing and then we'll get into video game news I promise.
2668000	2674000	The thing that really blew my mind was that you could order like a smoked whiskey or smoked bourbon.
2675000	2683000	The smoked bourbon. They actually bring it to you in a lantern case with smoke in it that when they open it you could like smell this because the people at the table next to us got it.
2683000	2690000	And like even the cocktails were so extra as fuck. I loved it. If there's actually a channel called cocktail chemistry.
2690000	2696000	And this guy is amazing. He tells you how to infuse alcohol smoke into alcohol using a whipped cream container.
2696000	2703000	It's actually well not like a store bought one but like the one like the professional whipped cream things like they have at Starbucks.
2703000	2708000	But he talks about how to use this to infuse quick infuse flavors into alcohols.
2708000	2715000	Yeah I will crazy. I will say a lot of people associate Vegas with gambling and shows but you can not forget about the food.
2715000	2724000	Like if you go to Vegas you need to you need to set the money aside and do some nice and I'm not talking about space and for that we did go to for space but I didn't buy anything sadly.
2724000	2734000	Okay. I hope I'm saying this name right in our chat J's unknown in our chat says OMG stop. I'm stuck here with cheese balls.
2734000	2740000	Don't feel bad. Cheese balls are rad to OK. I go for some cheese balls.
2740000	2749000	When I if I do pull Vegas out of my behind pretty soon I'll be doing the buffets and dedicating my money to other shenanigans.
2749000	2755000	All right. Let's get let's go on. We got to get into some news. We got it. Let's get into some of the headlines for the week.
2755000	2759000	Loki once you start us off. So E.A. once again is not going to be at E3.
2759000	2762000	Remember E.A. kind of does their own thing across the street.
2762000	2778000	Well the difference this year is also not going to have a conference which good riddance because I don't need to see any more of that goddamn FIFA nonsense that they waste all the time with having actual like you know football players they're talking about shit and just dragging it out.
2778000	2782000	But instead what they're going to do is kind of like the Nintendo treehouse.
2782000	2788000	They're going to be displaying gameplay through a very extended period of time over the course of a couple of days.
2788000	2791000	So that may end up working out better for them anyways.
2791000	2802000	Are you saying that another video game company has decided there just isn't much point to spending all this money to get a booth at E3 when they can just take their message through the power of the Internet directly to the gamers.
2802000	2809000	Well they've done that. They've done it before like it been across the street but like yeah they're not they're not going to do their press conference.
2809000	2817000	They're just going to do the thing over the course of a few days which is fine because then I think that they could I think that they also still like did that last year.
2817000	2823000	They're just not going to do. I don't know. I don't really know what they have. It's going to be really unique and new.
2823000	2832000	I mean they pretty much announced the same damn games every year. It's always it's always Battlefield, FIFA, Madden, NHL and NBA Live.
2832000	2837000	There's your lineup. I mean like it's the same fucking games every year.
2837000	2841000	So I mean so Bobby of course is ribbing you a little bit in chat like he usually does.
2841000	2842000	Oh and UFC I'm sorry.
2842000	2846000	Saying I don't need to see them talk about the most popular sports game in the world. Nobody cares.
2846000	2848000	But you're kind of saying.
2848000	2853000	No I'm not talking about the like the game. They could talk about the game all they want. I'm talking about when they take us.
2853000	2861000	They're like OK here's our press conference but hold on let's stop showing the game. Let's talk to this football player for a good fucking 15 minutes.
2861000	2863000	That's what I'm having a problem with.
2863000	2874000	They could show me the game and all the cool shit that they're done with it but when they stop the whole event to have this one on one interview because people they like you know football games are going to like this interview.
2874000	2881000	Fuck that. You know what. If I want to watch your interview you put that up on an own separate video on your own channel and I can go watch that shit later on.
2881000	2886000	You don't need to interrupt my fucking you know press conference for this shit. That's my problem.
2886000	2887000	Your press conference.
2887000	2892000	I'm watching it's my fucking press conference. They'll put it on the fucking internet if you don't want me to see it.
2892000	2901000	Oh my God the entitled gamer vibe is so strong right now but I get it. I get it. Like you know I get that maybe they spend a lot of time on game.
2901000	2911000	I think it's the same with Sony. I gave Sony the same ship for their musical interlude. I didn't need that shit but I think it's that the thing for you if I'm not mistaken is that like OK.
2911000	2920000	Of course we know a FIFA game is coming. Of course we know it's going to be better graphics better more better soccer more rosters.
2920000	2925000	Yes all that stuff right. It's going to be the definitive version because it's the version that didn't exist a year ago.
2925000	2937000	We know all that. So you're kind of like since this is a given game do we really have to spend 15 minutes talking to a soccer legend that really has nothing to do with the game itself besides the fact maybe their names on it.
2937000	2949000	Maybe they're on the box or yes. I kind of I kind of see where you're going with that though. So anyway S.S.U. 100 map says hold up FIFA had a really innovative story mode in a sports game.
2949000	2953000	They spent time talking with players to make this story mode.
2953000	2961000	OK. Then show the story but not the interview. You had had all that extra time instead of doing the interview to show the story mode.
2961000	2976000	Since it's so innovative and new that they focus so much on it. Ben said no we had a goddamn interview. All right. I've tried to title him a little bit. I have I have very low patience for wasting time.
2976000	2994000	And I feel when you do like stuff that's wasting time and this could be anything is a lot of it is tied to having celebrities come up and wasting time with the celebrities that have nothing to do with the fucking game or very little to do the fucking and musical interludes and this can be anything from you know instrumental music.
2994000	3008000	It could be like here's Eminem to come out and do some rap shit for whatever like Call of Duty gamer like I don't remember who was they had like a rap song that was in like the end of black ops or some shit and they had like the guy come out and perform this.
3008000	3020000	I don't fucking care. That's in the goddamn credits. That's not. I mean stop wasting time. You can you know what you claim in my time or claiming my time. Exactly.
3021000	3033000	Because like seriously like even like even with Nintendo Direct for example where they haven't allotted like say 30 minutes or so that they're going to be showing off stuff.
3033000	3043000	It's like oh well we didn't have time to show this very large announcement because we were focused on this stuff when we have EA which maybe doesn't have as many of announcements to make.
3043000	3052000	It seems like OK well you spent all this time doing this but you could also been talking about like this other indie game that you're publishing or this other thing or this other thing.
3052000	3055000	I just think time better spent.
3055000	3062000	I want to look at the other side of it for a minute here because here's the other Twitter clickbait sensation thing. Is E3 dead.
3062000	3079000	No because they saw the public paying for it now. So it's just going to transform into some other thing. Is E3 as important as it used to be as far as getting the relationships with your vendors and their relationships with the press.
3079000	3088000	No it's not as important anymore. Did one of you ladies have a thought. Is E3 dead. I thought I saw. Sorry I was about to jump in there. To be fair I never really gave a shit about E3 to begin with.
3088000	3097000	That's a strong statement. Why is that. Well just considering I do know this show I put more stock in your guys's opinions.
3097000	3108000	That's a very sweet thing to say. But are you saying. So let me let me try to translate what you're saying there is that you realize that E3 and this is kind of like I don't want to put words in your mouth so please correct me if I'm wrong.
3108000	3123000	But I think what you're saying is that you find a very diluted message E3 a very we're sticking to the script a very like press release on a conference floor at E3 and you would rather hear what real people touch in those games.
3123000	3133000	Looks sounds like looks and sounds like basically. OK. OK. I kind of felt that's where you're going with it because to be fair that's that's where a lot of my frustrations with E3 ended up being as well as that I felt like what's the point of me going.
3133000	3141000	Nobody goes off script here. No developer wants to talk about anything that's not a very we're not an influencer enough to be all even if they were.
3141000	3151000	Look at the influencers the people to do all those interviews E3. They don't go off. Oh actually that's one of the things. No offense to the influencers that they had on their on their show.
3152000	3162000	But I think sometimes influencers aren't necessarily presenters of a large event. You know it's kind of they're not really used to that type of thing.
3162000	3177000	Like I'll be honest if I was set to present an event like that I would probably be all fucked up and nervous as well. So I mean it's I think that also the feedback that they probably got from some of those press events wasn't exactly positive.
3177000	3187000	And I think doing something a little bit more intimate where they have you know kind of the gameplay basically the Nintendo Treehouse shit I think is more effective because you got more attention on that stuff.
3187000	3195000	You can spend more time talking about stuff and hell if you want to do your stupid 15 minute interview by all means you've got two days to do it. So why not.
3196000	3209000	All right. Let's move on. I would love to spend more time talking about it but we're running long time tonight so let's move on and talk about a sequel of sorts to a very large game on the Nintendo Switch.
3209000	3219000	This last year Octopath Traveler is getting a brand new segment to the story shall we say. But here's the twist. It's coming out for mobile phones.
3219000	3235000	That's right. It is an Android and iOS game. So Octopath Traveler Champions of the Continent was announced this week and it will have that same look and feel to it because Octopath Traveler for the switch was probably originally going to be a cell phone game anyway.
3235000	3246000	So this is kind of back in the wheelhouse where it was probably coming from. But it is important to point out this is not a it's not a port of excuse me Octopath Traveler.
3246000	3256000	I don't think it's truly a sequel either. I think they're saying it's actually a bit of a prequel. Japanese mobile app stores should be getting this game at some point later in 2019.
3256000	3267000	You can apply starting this week for access to an early demo. No word on the international release but I don't see how that won't happen considering how well the sales were here.
3267000	3275000	There's not a lot on the plot but apparently there will be a mode in this game where you can play all eight people at once. That's going to be pretty cool.
3275000	3282000	So yeah curious to see how that plays out. I think it's supposed to be like a prequel or something that's like taking place in the same universe at the same time.
3282000	3292000	Kind of like Final Fantasy 15 was started as the 13 versus or whatever that whole type of thing. But yeah it's something else in that I guess realm.
3292000	3299000	But also should be noted is that the official Twitter account for Octopath Traveler did mention this in a tweet.
3299000	3308000	For those of you waiting for a new console game we apologize but we'll need more time for production. So in the meantime we hope you'll enjoy this.
3308000	3316000	Which is the response to smartphone game. So if you want to read between the lines maybe it's the whole the smartphone game is 2019.
3316000	3327000	Octopath Traveler 2 or whatever they call the sequel will be a 2020 type of release. I guess that's kind of what I'm reading into it is the whole you know this isn't the sequel but it's something to hold you over until the sequel is ready.
3327000	3330000	I mean don't you guys have phones?
3330000	3337000	No no not that same type of announcement. So anyway. All right let's move on.
3337000	3340000	Dar Sakura you also have some pretty big news from this week right?
3340000	3345000	I do and people are already shitting one way or another about it.
3345000	3354000	But Nintendo announced the Labo VR kit for Switch which I'm like looking at it like that looks like virtual boy levels of pain right there.
3354000	3361000	But it is a neat idea the way they're going to do it. I'd really need to reserve my true judgment for actually seeing it.
3361000	3369000	But looking at the box having like a camera attachment is kind of neat and all the educational you know things that could go into it.
3369000	3378000	Of course there's also like a bazooka blaster thing and then looks like a elephant.
3378000	3382000	I was like words I can't make words or you can look in a bird's ass.
3382000	3387000	So that's very proctologist the game is going to be pretty amazing.
3387000	3393000	But there are it's going to go by Nintendo Labo VR kit as two versions which is a full set for 80 bucks.
3393000	3402000	That's the software goggles and five cardboard designs and a smaller one that has the goggles and the designs.
3402000	3411000	You can get the blaster rifle one. I mean honestly the camera one would be more interesting to me but it's pretty pretty neat.
3411000	3417000	I mean it could be bigger than it is you know.
3417000	3424000	But at the same time I don't know if it's going to come off as well in execution as it sounds in theory.
3424000	3430000	I think it looks neat. I mean they better call that gun though the super scope because I mean it's a goddamn super scope.
3430000	3435000	Well you know and I think here's the thing I think we just have to set our expectations appropriately for this VR.
3435000	3438000	There is no strap there is no head helmet thing.
3438000	3443000	So this is meant to be something you're going to hold up and especially for a child you're going to hold this up short term.
3443000	3447000	So whatever experiences are going to be in this VR are going to be meant to be short term.
3447000	3452000	And when Bobby was on tonight talking about this topic I kind of compared it to the Viewmaster 3D.
3452000	3456000	You remember those things like 70s and 80s maybe because you're too young but you remember.
3456000	3457000	They still have Viewmaster.
3457000	3459000	Oh that's right Viewmaster still is a brand huh.
3459000	3461000	It's actually a VR brand now.
3461000	3466000	Oh well that doesn't surprise me but you know how that was a very like you look through the thing and you see like a picture you move.
3466000	3474000	Now obviously I'm not saying literally that but I'm saying like OK like when you saw the 3DS Nintendo might have these little 3D movies.
3474000	3478000	These little 3D animations that you could see and experience for a short time and then that was it.
3478000	3483000	Like you're not going to see like this does not mean Breath of the Wild VR thanks to Labo.
3483000	3484000	That's not what's going to happen.
3484000	3487000	I'm sure it'll be fun. They wouldn't make a game if it wasn't fun.
3487000	3489000	So I'm sure it'll be fun.
3490000	3501000	I just think I don't know. I just I wish it could do more because you know the potential for like Nintendo games in a VR environment that were good.
3501000	3505000	That would be really amazing but this is not going to be that.
3506000	3508000	It's just I don't know.
3508000	3516000	Well let me let me ask this question because I would be super curious to know about this genuinely because you know Dark Sakura previously on the show you've expressed when it comes to VR.
3516000	3521000	There's a lot of you know hesitations and things that you don't like about the VR platform.
3521000	3529000	But the way Nintendo is approaching this with the more short term thing in mind where it's maybe less like attached to you two.
3529000	3535000	Does this seem maybe a little more like I could I could try this I could dip my toe in this or you know kind of like no.
3535000	3536000	OK so no no.
3536000	3537000	Not interested.
3537000	3538000	OK.
3538000	3540000	I mean it was a fair question to ask.
3540000	3543000	It's a neat idea but I'm not interested in it personally.
3543000	3544000	So OK.
3544000	3545000	What else.
3545000	3546000	What else.
3546000	3547000	All right.
3547000	3551000	But but for those of us that are cool beans enjoy your headaches.
3551000	3552000	All right.
3552000	3553000	All right.
3553000	3554000	Well let's move on.
3554000	3556000	Loki what else do we have from this week.
3556000	3558000	Well let's talk a little bit about PlayStation.
3558000	3573000	So PlayStation had a brand new firmware update six point five that brings remote play to iOS so you can use your iPhones and iPads to be able to play as a second screen kind of like you can on that console.
3573000	3576000	The Vita that no one ever talks about anymore.
3576000	3580000	To be fair the Vita was our kickoff topic on last week's episode.
3580000	3581000	I don't know if you recall.
3581000	3582000	I know that's the joke.
3582000	3584000	Oh OK.
3584000	3587000	We pretend.
3587000	3588000	Whatever.
3588000	3589000	Anyways.
3589000	3591000	So you can actually do that.
3591000	3600000	The only issue though right now is that they don't really have a way to pair like a PlayStation 4 controller to it.
3600000	3611000	So you either have to use another brand Bluetooth controller that is compatible with it or the on screen controls.
3611000	3617000	I've got a chance to actually try this because I don't have an iOS device that can actually do this.
3617000	3622000	But you know it's a neat thing that I like how they are supporting more devices.
3622000	3624000	I hope they support Android soon.
3624000	3625000	That would be pretty cool.
3625000	3632000	Although I don't really want to play on my phone but it would be neat just to see more support for that type of stuff.
3632000	3633000	And then this is kind of cool.
3633000	3646000	So in Asia regions previously you know for us in North America and other regions we use the X button as our select button for mainly everything.
3646000	3650000	Whereas in Asian regions they use the circle button as their select button.
3650000	3660000	Well now we can have parity across all regions because you have the ability now to switch that for X to be confirmed and O to be back.
3660000	3663000	So you can decide to do that if you want.
3663000	3664000	That's pretty awesome.
3664000	3667000	Couldn't you do that before with the accessibility options?
3667000	3673000	The accessibility options you can but I think this is just strictly just to have the menu select options as something different.
3673000	3675000	But yeah you could with this accessibility do that.
3675000	3678000	Sounds like same feature in new packaging type of thing.
3678000	3680000	Maybe a little quicker to flip it around.
3680000	3689000	Yeah or so you don't have to completely like I maybe they have it set up for menus so that like in game it's not all backwards because I've done that before.
3689000	3697000	Where like my my younger son when he was playing games he had trouble like with the controls like how to drive a car in like Lego games.
3697000	3701000	So I had to switch his acceleration from the triggers to the X button.
3701000	3706000	And so that way he could use that easier for him because his hands are really small.
3706000	3708000	So that's worked in the past.
3708000	3711000	But then I like and we played another game later on like what was this all back.
3711000	3713000	Oh that's right. I switched that.
3713000	3715000	I completely forgot about that.
3715000	3719000	Yeah so it's nice to have that separate where it's just in menus.
3719000	3721000	Okay that's fair. I get it now. Cool.
3721000	3726000	All right. Well I have to download you know since I'm an iPhone person I'll have to download that and check that out.
3726000	3732000	Although I just I feel like the only thing I'm going to really be able to do with that is like I'm not going to play games.
3732000	3734000	You're really going to be able to do nothing with that I think.
3734000	3738000	Well here's the thing I would think like oh I could watch Twitch on my PS4.
3738000	3740000	Wait why would I do that? I have a Twitch app on my phone.
3740000	3742000	Okay I could watch Netflix.
3742000	3744000	Wait why would I do that? I have a Netflix app on my phone.
3744000	3747000	So I'm kind of like well what everything kind of feels redundant.
3747000	3755000	I guess maybe if there's like a low intensity game that doesn't really use the controllers as much or something maybe there's something to play there.
3755000	3757000	But I just I don't. I think realistic.
3757000	3759000	Tetris Effect. No.
3759000	3762000	I it depends on that latency.
3762000	3765000	I think the latency will probably be too bad to do it.
3765000	3767000	But you know I guess Tetris Effect would be something you could play.
3767000	3769000	But anyway.
3769000	3774000	Alright let's move on and talk a little bit about some updates for Sonic.
3774000	3778000	So Sonic is going to be at South by Southwest.
3778000	3782000	And if you can't be there the live panel will be streamed.
3782000	3785000	So there's going to be a panel on what is it it's the 16th of March.
3785000	3791000	And there's going to be some guests there on the panel that have to do with Sonic the Hedgehog.
3791000	3795000	I do not believe this is about Sonic the movie necessarily.
3795000	3800000	Although there's a good chance maybe this is when the trailer finally hits.
3800000	3802000	Is this panel right.
3802000	3803000	I suppose.
3803000	3810000	Yeah because they actually have what they have like Takashi Iizuka and folks that are at this.
3810000	3821000	So I don't I think it's probably about the games the journey of Sonic and everything but not necessarily the movie until maybe the end will probably be like and here's that worldwide debut trailer right here at South by Southwest.
3821000	3822000	Maybe I don't know.
3822000	3827000	I'm still holding that hope that it's not crap.
3827000	3835000	All right. Well speaking of the trailer many people are talking this week and this is more of a visual so I can't really get I mean yes I could put the B roll.
3835000	3838000	But where is that beautiful B roll footage.
3838000	3841000	Remember it is a podcast over the audio folks I don't want to be like look at this.
3841000	3848000	But if you do go to Google and the different websites and take a look at you know this this leaked Sonic picture or what have you.
3848000	3852000	There's a pretty good idea of what Sonic looks like in the movies at this point.
3852000	3858000	Or you go to you go to our discord because Tiger Claw has been posting all the latest updates on the Sonic movie there.
3858000	3864000	Or you imagine a smurf that's taking crack kind of and is running.
3864000	3869000	So anyway some of the materials are out there increasingly garbage looks like branded materials.
3869000	3872000	I don't know. You know what. I just I need to see the trailer.
3872000	3875000	I just I'm going to reserve judgment until I see an emotion.
3875000	3878000	It's a little bit like this is a departure.
3878000	3888000	Like imagine like imagine if we had just some of the stills from the Pokemon Detective Pikachu trailer like some of like the more like lick tongue and shit like that.
3888000	3892000	Everyone would be like oh my God what the fuck have they done to this shit.
3892000	3895000	You know that's surprisingly a good point from you Loki.
3895000	3900000	But I have a feeling that we're just going to see this shit in motion and it's just going to be shit anyways.
3901000	3902000	But Jim Carrey's in it so you'll see it.
3902000	3906000	I am going to see it no matter how garbage it is.
3906000	3910000	Okay. Jason1 in our chat wants to know what's worse Sonic or the Genie.
3910000	3912000	Honestly truly the Genie.
3912000	3913000	The Genie.
3913000	3914000	The Genie.
3914000	3915000	It just it doesn't look right.
3915000	3916000	Easily the Genie.
3916000	3918000	I don't have a problem with Will Smith as the Genie whatsoever.
3918000	3922000	Nothing is ever going to be Robin Williams and that's the first thing you got to accept.
3922000	3925000	But the way they projected the face it didn't look right.
3925000	3927000	It's like fucking Scorpion King bad.
3927000	3929000	Like I mean it's pretty bad.
3929000	3933000	Like they should have just made him made the Genie just the Genie.
3933000	3935000	Don't make it fucking Will Smith.
3935000	3938000	Just make it a Genie that he's voicing the character of.
3938000	3941000	Why did they make it look like goddamn Will Smith.
3941000	3946000	They didn't make the Genie look like Robin Williams.
3946000	3951000	I mean I don't understand why they couldn't have just made it its unique character and he does the voice.
3951000	3952000	What's the problem with that.
3952000	3953000	Yeah.
3953000	3954000	Wait wait.
3954000	3958000	I want to see it in motion until I really make a decision one way or the other.
3958000	3959000	So.
3959000	3960000	Alright.
3960000	3961000	Um.
3961000	3962000	Let's see.
3962000	3963000	Let's move on.
3963000	3965000	I think that's all I want to say about Sonic for now.
3965000	3966000	Until we have a trailer.
3966000	3967000	Um.
3967000	3968000	Let's talk about some classic.
3968000	3969000	Not the classic of the week but some other classics.
3969000	3970000	Right Dark Sakura?
3970000	3971000	Yes.
3971000	3972000	Well.
3972000	3977000	SNK is going to be doing monthly collections of some of their classic arcade soundtracks.
3978000	3985000	So if you want that old school Neo Geo ear bleeding synthesizer you can have it.
3985000	3986000	Boy do I.
3986000	3987000	It will be.
3987000	3991000	Volume one will be launching in Japan on April 24th for 3200 yen.
3991000	3993000	About 28 bucks US.
3993000	3994000	Um.
3994000	3995000	And.
3995000	3997000	It will have.
3997000	3998000	Actually.
3998000	3999000	Um.
3999000	4005000	Each volume of the SNK arcade sound digital collection will be available to preorder from City Connections Clary store.
4006000	4007000	Um.
4007000	4008000	I can put a link to that in the chat.
4008000	4009000	But.
4009000	4010000	Um.
4010000	4013000	I'm trying to see what's going to be on the first series of them.
4013000	4014000	Okay.
4014000	4017000	Volume one will have Beast Busters Chopper 1.
4017000	4020000	Bermuda Triangle and Prehistoric Island 1930.
4020000	4021000	Which.
4021000	4023000	Not super popular games but.
4023000	4025000	I want to say those are some deep cuts.
4025000	4026000	Like.
4026000	4027000	Where's Crystalis?
4027000	4028000	And.
4028000	4029000	As a.
4029000	4030000	In the chat Quest Buster says Magician Lord.
4030000	4031000	That's a good one too.
4031000	4032000	Right.
4032000	4033000	Or um.
4033000	4034000	Fatal Fury.
4034000	4035000	Fatal Fury had some sweet.
4035000	4036000	Background music.
4036000	4037000	Baseball stars.
4037000	4038000	Yeah.
4038000	4039000	So.
4039000	4040000	Alright.
4040000	4041000	But I understand.
4041000	4042000	SNK did have a very rich.
4042000	4043000	Especially in the arcade.
4043000	4044000	There's a lot of games that came out.
4044000	4045000	Like in Japan.
4045000	4046000	That maybe there was a couple of machines here.
4046000	4047000	I want a Last Blade soundtrack.
4047000	4048000	Yeah.
4048000	4049000	Something fierce.
4049000	4050000	I wonder if they will do.
4050000	4051000	Um.
4051000	4052000	Like.
4052000	4053000	You know.
4053000	4054000	Capcom's all over Spotify now.
4054000	4055000	So I wonder if um.
4055000	4056000	And I assume they're on the.
4056000	4057000	The Apple platform and.
4057000	4058000	Yeah.
4058000	4059000	I've got a bunch of.
4059000	4060000	Pandora's and all.
4060000	4061000	You know.
4061000	4062000	The comparable stuff.
4062000	4063000	Um.
4063000	4064000	So.
4064000	4065000	Yeah.

4249000	4249960	Just witnessing that section on the right.

4258000	4259000	Mm hmm.
4259020	4260000	Uh.
4260000	4265500	I'm writing the fanfic and yeah right now where you know they're gonna get up there on the stage and be like we have a
4265880	4271940	$99 system in store today and a partnership with Nintendo whack like that is well
4271940	4278780	And they're saying that the the pre-orders are gonna open mid-april is the rumor right now so pre-orders in April for what a June launch
4278780	4280780	maybe I
4281360	4282620	Just
4282620	4288160	Man Microsoft made that this this is this is the year where they're gonna go for it
4288160	4291760	You know to make up for what happened to them at e3 a few years ago
4291760	4297440	And if they can put a $99 so when's their next system launching though is my question though is if you're gonna do this
4297440	4298920	Then you launch your next system
4298920	4305620	But haven't haven't they said since the beginning the new system will still or the old system will still play the new systems games
4305680	4307440	They've said that from the beginning
4307440	4312580	It'll just be that it might have a shitty framerate and stuff, but it will play the new system
4312820	4320540	Well they also have well if I remember correctly they also supposed to have their Xbox cloud
4320780	4324580	Thing that they're gonna be the cloud streaming service that they're supposed to be introducing as well
4324580	4329500	So maybe that's the way they're gonna get these newer games on these older systems is basically
4330460	4336080	Running everything in the cloud, and it's gonna. You know kind of like how we do with Assassin's Creed Odyssey and like the switch
4336420	4339860	Okay, I'm being corrected in chat to be fair that the Xbox one is still
4340500	4342220	249
4342380	4345740	Detiorama s predicts without the optical drive and the three terabyte drive
4345740	4350740	I could see it going for 199 you are all making a point that the drive inside
4350740	4355940	It could be something that you know maybe makes it not able to be $99 cuz there's gonna have to be a pretty beefy
4356140	4357300	hard drive in that thing
4357300	4363660	But maybe 149 is still a pretty sweet price to go for but can I just if they could do it again?
4363660	4366180	You know set your expectations that may be like 199
4366180	4370660	But can you imagine if Microsoft could do it if they could say we've figured out a way to get the cost and we're gonna
4370660	4376560	Put out for 99 bucks, and if you want to expand the storage you just plug in your own hard drive in the back here
4376620	4377860	Maybe that's how they do it
4377860	4383100	they say it's got a really crappy little hard drive in it you know, but you could just plug in your own into the back and
4383740	4387980	You're good to go hard. There's no very expensive nowadays. That's true. That's true. We'll see
4388740	4390740	anyway
4390820	4395340	Other comments in chat here Deidre my ass is convinced. They can't do it for 99 bucks
4395580	4401020	Yeah, 99 it's a bit that's a bit of a stretch, but I would see like $200 they could do
4401020	4405820	I wish it was lower. I mean never obviously lower the better. I think but yeah, whatever
4406780	4409880	You know if they could I don't know it will be interesting to see what they do
4410380	4415700	It sure will so we'll see what happens. I mean we were all going off kind of rumors right now, but these are
4416260	4419820	We've kind of seen that this is where Microsoft wants to go
4420180	4423660	We kind of already saw this with the original Xbox one in some of their direction
4424460	4427100	Good deal, I just wish it was on PC
4429440	4434660	Jason one says subsidized consoles super low-cost all digital version
4434860	4437620	Microsoft is pulling a lot of moves to get you into their ecosystem
4437660	4442620	I would feel safe betting on this being their generation. You know what there's there it is
4442620	4445620	I think Jason one just said it. That's how they say $99
4446500	4448500	$99 with one-year agreement
4449500	4455100	Mmm, how about that? How about that? They could they could and then they're still saying
4456260	4457420	$99
4457420	4461620	You know and that's gonna be a big deal if they can do that, but I've and that could that could be it
4461620	4466020	It'll be nine out with one year agreement. I know I'm so fixated on this 99 thing
4466020	4467980	I won't let it go, but it just it just sounds so good
4467980	4471060	It's it is because it's undercutting everybody by a lot
4471060	4475460	And I think that's just the way to do it because you're looking at like you know late in the week's life
4475460	4478900	The Wii was going for 99 late in the cycle any like you're looking at the switch
4478900	4484500	So I mean like think about your you're talking about buying your switch for your switch or an Xbox and you know for your kids
4484500	4490220	You're like, okay. Well, you can have this but then you get this full library of games that's included for like 10 bucks a month
4492060	4493860	Okay, anyway
4493860	4497500	We'll think it's actually been an ongoing trend though with different developers
4497500	4501340	Like remember the PlayStation the very first models of PlayStation how?
4501740	4505380	They would take stuff out and the price would go down they take stuff out the price would go down
4505740	4510340	Until the finally we had just the most bare bones of systems and then we had the ps1. Mm-hmm
4510340	4513100	It's the same thing and I really do think that
4513740	4519640	Either 99 or 129 are gonna be the price points. Those tend to be averages
4519640	4525860	I don't know why they pick ending in 9 as a number instead of just something even it's like how they sell gas
4526140	4528780	It's just that whole that it sounds cheaper
4529420	4534260	99 cents sounds cheaper than a dollar. Where do you go shopping dollar tree or 99 cent store?
4535460	4537460	dollar tree
4538380	4543620	Unless I really want obscure me. Oh, she's different unless I want obscure Mexican sodas
4544500	4548020	Then I go to or the guava soda
4549000	4551860	then I go to 99 second I got weird shit look look I
4552460	4556980	We I I'm saying it so much that I'm setting an expectation there and I don't want to do that
4556980	4560860	I want to give Microsoft a fair shot and see what they can pull but I don't I I
4561660	4565180	Just feel like if they if they could just really undercut and I mean on it
4565180	4565460	But you know
4565460	4568780	I've been I've been having this fanfic if you've been listening to all our for any length of time
4568780	4574140	I have had a Microsoft fanfic her up for a long time that if anybody is gonna do something big and crazy
4574140	4576380	I really feel like it's gonna be Microsoft
4576380	4580780	You know, how long have I been saying Microsoft's gonna be the first one to come out and say, you know
4580780	4582860	We've been making you pay for gold for all the player all these years
4582860	4589100	Not anymore gold is free and that they're gonna shift their payment system to the their things like game pass
4589100	4591100	It's gonna be what what carries them. They're not gonna
4591380	4594400	It would be amazing. But no, but that has been fanfic
4594400	4598420	I've been saying on the show for five years and have you as yet to come true. So it's it's fine
4598740	4605680	Anyway fanfics are meant to be a fantasy. That's right. You live yours. That's right. I will I'm feeling my fantasy right now
4606860	4608860	Ignore the reality Valentina
4609660	4611660	Alright red M&Ms only
4612060	4615300	Let's move on and talk about a fantasy a lot of feelings
4616300	4620620	Let's talk about a fantasy. A lot of people are feeling right now Tetris 99, right?
4620620	4626520	It's like who knew that a battle royale game without guns would do so flippin well
4626620	4630700	But people are going crazy about Tetris 99. I'm actually really sad. I didn't get to do this
4630700	4634720	So sadly this event is over now, but I just want to talk about the fact that it happened
4634860	4636640	So I was in Vegas the whole time
4636640	4640500	I don't know if any of you guys checked it out, but from March 8th through March 10th
4640580	4643540	So actually is it still going right now today's yeah, today's the 10th
4643540	4646060	So actually technically it's still going on for a few hours
4646060	4648920	So if you're listening live you can get it in and out you can go into this
4649100	4654800	Maximus Cup and when you get first place you get Tetris Maximus on the screen the top
4655780	4660380	999 players with the most Tetris Maximus is will get
4661340	4664700	999 gold points that be maxim ease or maximize
4665660	4668420	It's just Maximus. I don't know anyway, but
4669220	4673100	999 gold points is basically nine dollars and ninety nine cents. I mean
4673740	4677880	Give it I mean because you can't you have like a max number of gold points
4677880	4680460	You can apply towards a game, but if you're buying a brand new see star game
4680460	4684560	You can take ten dollars off essentially. That's what that's what this is doing cool. I know it's me hey
4684560	4688620	I just think it's rad that Nintendo is getting into this kind of competition
4689740	4697140	For like real shit. You know even if it's like okay. It's just gold point. Hey, you know what I used gold points
4697140	4703100	Last time I bought something digital a free game. You're getting free stuff on top of the free game. It's well
4703100	4708340	Well, yeah, I know you have to pay asterisk little footnote little footnote. Yeah, you do have to be an online subscriber
4708340	4712680	But technically there's other games though that you have to pay for and then you have to pay for the service
4712680	4717120	So it technically is a free game that you have to have the service for but whatever
4717860	4722080	Get them have the console too. I mean so technically it's ever free dark Tetsuya
4722080	4726500	I kind of hate you for this comment, but I don't isn't that kind of what one versus 100 did
4727140	4728500	Yeah
4728500	4734780	Gave away something for nothing. Yeah, I miss that game. That's the battle royale game. We deserve
4735420	4741820	Game room go back. I know I know y'all are making me cry here. Can you imagine if Microsoft came out and said?
4742700	4746620	$99 yeah, we're bringing game room back. I wonder is this 100
4747620	4749620	and Ridge Racer
4750380	4755860	We're big fans of orange lounge radio here at Microsoft. We're gonna give those fools everything they give them all of the things
4756420	4759380	We even know who you are we're granting wishes
4760140	4764440	We remember you you had an icon on our service
4765780	4767780	You're not nobody's to us
4769700	4772140	Yay, somebody cares alright
4772340	4778020	Let's let's take a trip down memory lane to some classics that we certainly care about
4778020	4780020	It's the classic game of the week
4780220	4785940	Every week dark soccer goes into the gaming vault and finds a game ten years or older that she thinks hey
4786220	4790240	You brats you should be playing this game to put put down your fortnight's
4790660	4797480	Yeah, fuck night, and you're Tetris now now. They haven't made that game yet, and you're four skins
4798020	4803980	And pick this up instead yeah, and actually I don't for this week's particular choice
4803980	4807860	I think you you didn't have to go into the vault you just reach in your pocket right I did all right
4807900	4809900	What is the classic game of the week no B no B boy
4811240	4814220	Remember how we were all kind of minorly obsessed with this weird shit
4814940	4816940	Well you but yes
4818340	4820820	Someone else in this room was playing it on the console
4820820	4824860	I didn't play it as much as you know we know we know it. No we know we know it. No we know B
4824860	4826660	boy for smash
4826660	4830620	Right in any rate. It's a weird fucking game. Can I just say first?
4830660	4835180	This is ten years old because I very vividly remember chats about this game on
4835260	4837940	Olr because katamari namashi guy made a new game
4838380	4844500	He also is working on another game coming out right now, but it's due later this year Chad is having the same reaction right now
4845100	4848220	This is over ten years old fuck damn. I'm old
4849300	4853720	Those were all different comments by the way fuck damn. I'm old. I don't know I made all those in one in my head
4854800	4860400	Anyway, so the game no B. No B boy. It's it's a weird one is by Takahashi Keita
4860600	4866880	It was published by Namco Bandai, and it came out in Japan on February 19th
4867640	4869640	2009
4869720	4875520	That's for ps3 the iOS version came out February 18th 2010 which is when I played the most of
4876200	4881760	But in the game you play a character named boy who can stretch his body one of the meanings of no B
4881760	4886960	Is stretch no B. No B. Also means carefree, so it's kind of a pun
4887400	4891700	You know which many many neat games are named after a pun
4892080	4896760	So anyway, he's he's kind of a worm character who has four legs
4896760	4903280	And you use the controller the left analog stick for is the front of boy and the right?
4903600	4905600	Analog stick is the back of boy
4905640	4910200	and so you move them in opposite directions to try to get boy's body to stretch and
4910600	4914240	Then you maneuver boy around his environment and he can eat stuff
4914240	4920920	And there's also like barnyard animals and shit hanging around and people and weird things
4920920	4927400	Is that a person riding on a bear anyway? It's a guy riding unicycle with chicken on his head
4928600	4934120	anyway, you accumulate points by how much you stretch in the game and you
4935000	4940800	Transmit these points online via a character called Sun to know the character called girl and
4942360	4944360	So basically all
4944520	4952440	All the cumulative this is everybody playing the game all these points that boy played by everybody transmits to girl
4953240	4956640	causes girl to stretch and get new levels and so
4957040	4962680	You know you start on earth, and then girl will stretch to the moon and Mars and Jupiter etc
4963320	4968480	Until she's strings back around to earth and you get other environments that way, too
4968800	4973440	Maybe someday we'll get a sequel and she'll simply be known as girl girl
4974320	4976320	Girl girl what you been?
4980320	4984020	It's like she expanded out into outer space this time anyway
4985200	4987200	So they expected
4988040	4992360	It to take between one to two weeks to reach the moon it took four days
4993800	4995560	so
4995560	5003920	As of December from the week of December 25th to December 31st 2011 they reached Uranus or Uranus
5008520	5011360	So basically it took girl a
5012240	5019400	Full loop around the solar system girl. She's loopy. She got around okay girl
5019640	5024520	She gets around and so she got she's been around Uranus
5024520	5029320	She got back to earth on December 14th 2015 so that's a good solid
5031560	5036280	Six years of play a little bit longer, maybe and then after
5037120	5043160	2489 days of playing girl reached the Sun and everyone died no
5043160	5046200	But that's actually the end of the game that girls on fire
5050240	5052240	Step that pussy up on fire
5053280	5054840	anyway
5054840	5059320	There were also look you pick a weird game like no B. No B. Boy you get a weird segment
5059440	5061440	Can't you eat your own ass in this game?
5062320	5065880	That makes no B. No B. Boy the Ouroboros
5068880	5070880	Anyway
5072860	5079940	Anyway there were lucky weeks that went on where a random number was chosen and every time the player reported
5080560	5082560	Their length, but not their girth
5083560	5088360	It was multiplied by that number so the first one was May 11th to May 22nd on
5089200	5095360	2009 and then there were different ones and he basically Keita would write about lucky week
5095360	5098280	Thanks to everyone's effort girl has managed to stretch out a lot
5100040	5104520	So long way to go and reaching Mars, but we will see you in June for the time being so he kept going like that
5106000	5112120	There was one multiplier that increased to two hundred two million
5113040	5114600	15 and
5114600	5117040	That finished girl. That was the one that finished girl's journey
5118000	5123960	So it is a weird game and basically the announcement of the game started by Takahashi
5124440	5128040	Holding out a stretch hose with two pink balls on the end
5128840	5135720	Remember that though we saw that he said it wasn't a controller, but a visual to help display the game, and then they showed boy
5136840	5142600	The playable prototype was at game city 2007 international interactive entertainment festival fuck that song
5143080	5145720	Where it was delivered as the
5146120	5152040	festivals vision statement of the year and it had three boys that were interacting with the animals and doing stuff and
5152680	5154680	and tangle their boys
5159280	5163640	So it was originally developed on Xbox on an Xbox 360 development kit
5163640	5166680	but was ported to PlayStation 3 and that was because
5167200	5170820	Takahashi stated that the symmetrical design of the analog six on the ps3
5171380	5173380	offered better control
5173500	5175220	and then
5175220	5177620	It had on April 29 2009
5177620	5185460	it was updated to include an offline player mode for up to four players where all the boys could play and stretch their things and
5186820	5188820	You know play with each other's boys
5189820	5194060	But it got pretty good ratings it on Metacritic was 75 out of 100
5194820	5196580	and IGN
5196580	5201020	Stated that the game was unique it could have been played on the ps1 and as of May
5201540	5204300	2009 it sold about a hundred thousand units and
5204900	5210220	But Takahashi himself said he was not completely satisfied with the game. What girl?
5211260	5217460	There also is a website at o dash dash o dot JP
5218660	5222580	Which I guess is supposed to be boys body so you can play with boys body online
5223420	5225420	You
5226220	5228820	Can stretch them out is that it that's it
5229300	5232420	Thank you, but thank you for that memorable class to give it a wee segment
5232420	5235220	They're getting out of the new window your classic game of the week
5235460	5236980	No be no be boy
5236980	5242140	Which I remember being a mobile phone thing cuz I played it mostly on the play most on the phone you would talk about it
5242140	5245740	Every week on the show be like how is your gaming week? Well? I played nobody boy
5246780	5248780	Girl girls gone around
5248780	5254500	Pluto yeah, so good pick. I can't believe that game is over ten years old. It's crazy. Yeah, I mean
5254900	5262460	It just is such a crazy little freaky game, but technically they reached endgame, so good job girl. Good job boy
5263100	5264380	All right
5264380	5270740	Nobody nobody boy is your classic game of the week girls got goals. She's going places, and you know what?
5271340	5277620	The boy is the support character. It's really the girl story. Where's she going all right for our next story?
5277660	5280380	We're gonna go to this pre-recorded segment from earlier today
5282220	5285580	Okay hello from a streaming studio, and this is pretty cool
5285580	5291540	We're taking a look tonight at Diablo not Diablo 3 or unfortunately not a new Diablo
5291540	5296820	But the old-school Diablo this is actually Diablo 1 in all its glorious
5297020	5299140	You're kind of limited to moving in eight directions
5299900	5302660	The graphics are a little bit subpar glory
5302900	5307420	But you know this game is what well over what like 20 years old at this point
5307420	5313840	And it just the reason why it's in the news this week is because it just recently was released on GOG or good old games
5314340	5316340	not through battle net
5317020	5320680	Activision Blizzard's own client, but actually released with a partnership with
5321220	5324040	GOG or you know I still call them good old games even though
5324040	5328460	I think everybody is supposed to be calling them GOG.com at this point, but anyway
5328460	5335340	It's just the way I remember with the giant subtitles when you talk to people and everything
5335340	5341540	Let me see if I can make my way over to the church. I'm playing a sorcerer here, which of course I named mr.
5341540	5343540	Smoosh after
5343900	5345900	My cat I
5345980	5351100	Think the church is up here in the corner. It's interesting because you don't even have a map in the town
5351880	5356000	When you go back and play an old game like this you really realize the types of quality of life
5356280	5361900	Improvements that you've got oh yeah, something's going on here. This isn't good. They got a wounded guy there listen to me
5363560	5368700	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we gotta go kill things come on, so let's see if I can get down here into the dungeon
5368700	5370700	Oh my gosh
5370920	5372920	Have problems just moving around
5376840	5380120	Here's the chest this is what Diablo used to be
5380760	5387420	Before the game that probably more people know about now there we go killing some of the skeletons here anyway
5388240	5394900	So yeah, I guess there's some type of partnership now between Blizzard and good old games in fact
5394900	5399760	There was a press release that came out where the vice president of executive producer over at Blizzard Rob
5400120	5404680	Bridenbecker said that you know they were bummed that these games weren't available for their players
5404720	5408280	So they've kind of worked out a partnership to make them possible
5410160	5413640	You actually have to click to collect the gold in the old Diablo games
5415880	5419280	So you notice I'm just kind of killing some mobs here using my staff although
5419280	5423360	I think if I remember right it wasn't left. Oh, no you can right-click, okay?
5423360	5426440	I thought you always had to push s to actually cast the spell
5427160	5432560	But that'll do that I can set these other guys on fire, but anyway the game is gonna run
5432560	5435640	Yeah, $9.99 if you decide to pick it up on good old games
5435640	5444760	No word yet on like when other old Blizzard games may come out if any I think they have talked about
5445640	5450960	Warcraft orcs and humans and Warcraft 2 also coming to the service. That would be kind of neat if that happened
5451120	5456800	I would imagine Warcraft 3 probably not gonna happen anytime soon because they have that remaster coming out
5456800	5458800	How do I get in this room there we go?
5459360	5461360	Boy these guys are like taking away my health
5461360	5465680	There we go, maybe a new new item here
5467280	5468640	That yeah
5468640	5473320	When you see the original Diablo like this you see just how different this is
5473920	5479840	Versus when they did that event in Diablo 3 that just kind of put like an old-school skin on
5480280	5487040	Diablo 3 and it just it just plays Diablo 3, but this is definitely the old-school experience and oh
5487480	5490680	No, I died I forgot how weak this guy is
5491400	5497280	So that's it cuz you're in hardcore mode when you play in the original Diablo. So now I have to
5497880	5500960	Let's see. I guess that's it. I gotta start a new game
5501600	5505160	All right. Well, maybe I could go back to the hero. I was on I
5505880	5510520	Gotta cast more of my spells or I'm gonna die more often. I guess yikes. That wasn't good
5511240	5514440	Does that make me not a real gamer since I died in the dungeon?
5514440	5517160	Is that like dying in the tutorial level and cuphead? I don't know
5517200	5521720	I guess I'm just too used to all the conveniences that come with Diablo 3 including a
5521880	5524840	Little bit of an easier difficulty and the fact that you know
5524840	5530680	If you play a wizard, you probably shouldn't be up there in the fray. I really should be standing back and casting spells. I
5531520	5537680	Also kind of wonder if my loot is gonna be where I died there previously if I can like oh no
5537680	5539780	Oh, no, it was rearranged
5541600	5544240	Those good old random dungeons
5545080	5548860	Do let's see I gotta I gotta actually pick my spell again. There we go
5550800	5559220	Yeah this time there we go now I can kill these guys from a distance and it's gonna work a little better
5561360	5563900	So when you first launched the game in the
5564840	5566840	GOG launcher or whatever you
5566960	5573280	It's called you actually get a little pop-up window that allows you to pick between two different versions of Diablo
5573320	5577560	You can get the original with the old school graphics
5577560	5582540	Like what was it like 320 pixel resolution like it's it's really old and scaled back
5582760	5586660	But I believe that's the version it'll actually still work with battle net if you
5586960	5593320	You know want to be able to play with friends and all that stuff or you can do the souped up version of the game
5593320	5594520	Oh, I ran out of mana
5594520	5596520	You could do the souped up version of the game
5596800	5601000	Which is what I'm playing now that allows you to play up to like 4k resolution
5601520	5607820	Which is kind of it again, they didn't go back and oh god, I called out too many mobs. I'm gonna get killed again
5611080	5616680	Trying to talk and concentrate on the game it's very difficult. Anyway, there we go now I'm frying some of these guys from a distance
5618680	5622640	But you can still do land mode even with the
5624120	5627680	Souped up graphics. Oh, I'm out of mana. I'm gonna have to get it. Oh, no. Oh, no
5628320	5631380	Wow, look at that I died twice
5632560	5634920	I'm really good at this old-school Diablo
5636160	5637360	well
5637360	5641560	There you have it a look at the original Diablo if you want to go back to like, you know
5641560	5642640	when Diablo was
5642640	5647840	Probably like Dark Souls hard or at least maybe I shouldn't be trying to play a wizard if I want to get up there and close
5647840	5652220	In combat, maybe I need to partner up with somebody through land mode actually play with somebody else
5652680	5655040	To help getting through the dungeon a little bit easier
5655120	5658000	But if you want to go back and play this game when it's a you know
5658000	5664040	A little more difficult you can do that now thanks to the partnership between Blizzard and good old games. And again, it's good cost
5664760	5666760	$9.99 and
5666760	5671200	Warcraft and Warcraft 2 likely on the way soon, except we don't know when so
5671780	5677880	Look forward to me being really bad at those games too in the very new future. Anyway for now back to the studio
5681120	5684760	Alright so yeah, I almost didn't want to air that because of how bad
5684800	5690320	I did playing Diablo, but you know, it's funny. That wasn't even the first take that was because the very first I was like
5690320	5694440	Oh, I'm just gonna jump into a blind, you know, cuz you can just kind of pick up Diablo 3 and go
5694440	5698720	So I'm just gonna jump into this Diablo 1 bride blind and see what I can remember you bringing mr
5698720	5704440	Smoosh on for a cameo the twitch people are gonna love that. Although I don't know if smoosh likes being held that long. Ah
5706220	5708980	He's probably just all curious there anyway, oh he's
5709760	5712280	He's he's ready to take a break. Oh
5713280	5720240	You might want to make sure he gets down, okay, I don't think he's gonna like trying to get up from there. Yeah. Anyway, um, so
5722000	5724000	No, mr. Smoosh don't knock over the camera, please
5726320	5730160	Thank you for the distraction dark saga, that's alright it was a worthwhile one, um
5730760	5735880	I'm sure somebody's clipping that as we speak anyway, um, but as far as the Diablo goes
5735880	5740920	I I couldn't remember where the church was and there's no like map or anything
5741040	5743040	I was like do I have to pick up a quest?
5743080	5746680	Like what do I have to like it took a minute for me to get oriented for him?
5746680	5751120	So let's do I couldn't like just jump in and play so it does kind of say something about like oh, yeah
5751120	5754160	Like it's not necessarily the games got easier
5754160	5759460	I mean they did a little bit but also I think to some extent just like the quality and the
5760880	5762800	accessibility is the right word in this context
5762800	5769520	But just the ease of jumping it right into the game has certainly improved quite a bit and then obviously like in the video
5769520	5774920	I I clearly should not have just started out with a sorcerer and I didn't go around town trying to buy things
5774920	5779280	There's probably I should I probably should try to buy armor because I'm sure you said get started with a little gold
5779280	5782560	You know try to buy something to help me out in that story would have helped a little bit
5782560	5785560	But you live you learn and that's how you did it back in those days
5786640	5793280	I've only ever played the demo. So, you know, it came with PC gamer. Oh, really? So I never got that far. Ah
5793880	5797140	All right. Well, I thought I thought the partnership was very interesting, too
5797140	5800300	I just I'm really surprised that Blizzard didn't do it themselves
5801300	5806980	When they have the infrastructure set up to do that, so just really surprised me. So anyway, alright, well, let's move on
5806980	5814260	We're gonna travel around and check out some rapid-fire news and some other quick hit stories for the night. So you're free epic game
5815020	5819920	This mother free game on the Epic Game Store is slime rancher. So you should definitely go check that out
5819920	5821920	It's a pretty fun little indie game
5822040	5827920	And it's free until March 21st, and then the next game is gonna be oxen free
5827920	5832680	So pick it up while you can and I recommend you do that because it is a pretty good game
5832680	5834680	It's been on my steam wish list for a while
5835080	5837080	Now I don't have to
5837280	5840960	And then this is pretty cool. Sadly. We don't have the footage of it, but
5841800	5843800	apparently the
5844520	5851160	DuckTales, you know, they have the new DuckTales cartoons. So they had an episode with Della duck and
5851920	5855000	It was called, you know, I think I don't remember the episode name
5855000	5857600	I don't know if it was called whatever happened to Della duck, but basically
5858240	5860160	she is
5860160	5861680	consoling some
5861680	5868720	Like space aliens and she says oh, well, I'm I'm gonna sing you a song. I used to sing to my kids and
5869440	5871440	ends up being the
5871760	5875120	Moon theme from the DuckTales game and it's pretty awesome
5875920	5877920	so
5878920	5883880	Pretty sweet, I would definitely worth checking out the episode, but it's a neat little kind of
5884480	5886200	Thing they have there you can try to pull it up
5886200	5889240	I was gonna say usually I don't I don't do this because of copyright things
5889240	5892040	But I guess if I don't show the video, I just play the audio which I think I can do
5892040	5896680	I think I'll be alright, but have you heard this dark Sakura? This is now now it's no Brental floss
5896680	5900640	But I will say Brental floss has acknowledged this and said I think he can yeah
5900640	5902240	He's the only appointed he gave it kudos
5902240	5906840	But um, so let's see if I can actually so I sadly I'm not gonna pump the video through but I will do the audio
5907120	5909120	I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit here
5912800	5916720	Look to the stars my darling baby boys
5918680	5920680	Life is strange and vast
5922480	5925120	Filled with wonders and joys
5926320	5928940	So they see each new son
5930480	5933240	I mean, I really like the way they did this right? It's pretty cool
5933240	5939080	Like, you know, just the the way they did like that throwback to the original moon theme is really rad. So
5939920	5944400	Anyway, I know this new DuckTales series getting a lot of cool. No, it's it's it's great
5944400	5948200	Like I've I've seen some of the episodes for it and it's it's solid
5948200	5953280	I mean, I when the whole thing that they're gonna read like do DuckTales series and stuff
5953280	5956080	I kind of was hesitant, but it's it's been good. So
5956920	5960240	Pretty cool just to throw that in there just for like fans of the game
5961040	5966720	Because I think not a lot of kids probably watching they're gonna pick up on that so pretty cool
5966720	5970820	But now if they go back and play the game because of course not only do you have the old-school DuckTales
5970820	5973820	But you have DuckTales remastered was right. Yeah, not that long ago
5973820	5978760	So if they go back and play that it'll be like, oh, I recognize this from the cartoon. Yeah, exactly
5978760	5981860	So yeah, it's kind of funny how that works out. So a lot of folks in chat
5982480	5989700	First off some folks saying dammit Rob wipes tears. That's from Rama and then act-def says DuckTales is freaking awesome
5989740	5992940	As 200 Matt says I wish I could catch it more. We need a full song
5992940	5996100	I think yeah, a lot of people saying that would be really cool if they kind of
5996840	5999820	Put that out in like a full song. We'll probably get a lot of streams
6000100	6004600	Anyway, um, let's talk about something a little bit old-school like the quake engine
6004980	6010660	That's right a brand new game coming out from 3d realms called wrath a on of ruin
6011140	6016160	It's actually something that's tapping into the quake engine, which is pretty cool
6016760	6020000	So, of course as you know quake was the follow-up to doom and so forth
6020000	6025180	So what happened is the one of the designers that was I think on the original doom
6025880	6032520	Or one of the yeah, I'm sorry one of the designers that works on levels for like quake like modding still to this day
6032900	6037280	His name is kill pixel and he's made a full-fledged game. It's called wrath a on a rune
6037280	6040600	It's kind of built on the actual quake engine. So that's pretty cool
6041680	6043880	And they're saying it's an authentic 90 shooter
6043880	6046480	Not just something that's pretending to be and so it's it's pretty much
6047280	6052200	The game it's not recognizable as quake. They've turned it into something completely different, but it runs in that engine
6052200	6058280	I guess kind of like hexen was kind of cool. I can it'll get some high frame rates on my computer then you're right
6059360	6061240	All right. Anyway, um
6061240	6065480	As you may or may not be aware on International Women's Day was this past week
6065480	6072480	Which I believe was Friday if I have my calendar right in my head and a Sony PlayStation actually put out a PlayStation 4 theme
6072760	6079840	To celebrate International Women's Day. So it's something that actually has characters from various games. So it has
6080480	6083120	Am I saying his name right alloy from I alloy?
6083120	6083360	Yeah
6083360	6084800	I like from horizon zero dawn
6084800	6090380	Kara from Detroit become human and Chloe and Nadine from uncharted as well as cat from gravity rush
6090680	6093840	so some of their it's also got I don't know that the
6094480	6097320	From the paper a tearaway. I don't know a toy
6097440	6098760	But
6098760	6101680	Yeah, at oh I a toy a toy. Yeah, so
6102200	6108440	Sat girls there too. So there's just you know, there's some of Sony's girl power showing up there in the theme. So very cool
6108440	6113200	I haven't heard that there is a deadline to download it or anything. It's just something that they released
6113320	6119160	So I imagine if you haven't got it yet and you want some girl power on your PlayStation 4 you can go get it
6119200	6125100	Let's get some girl power on olr with some headlines from dark Sakura. Oh, this one makes me particularly happy
6125180	6127860	We have the return of Sega Tucson Shiro
6128780	6133940	Well kind of um, he's gun. He's gonna be returning for Sega fest
6134660	6136660	Even though he's dead in Canon
6137200	6140940	Well remember cuz he sacrificed himself riding a rocket ship to save the dreamcast
6141940	6143940	Because right? Yeah
6144300	6149780	Talked about this on the show before I didn't really true mascot of Sega. He was at least the mascot of the Sega Saturn
6150580	6152140	at any rate
6152140	6155420	He was portrayed by Fujioka Hiroshi
6156180	6159540	And he was memorable. He even had his own game
6159940	6166220	So anyway, he's going to be headlining for a Sega fest and that's March 30 30 through 31st
6166220	6168980	and hopefully he won't get blasted off on another rocket and
6169660	6175300	Then blood-stained curse of the moon will have a physical release through limited run
6175820	6180340	so it is going to be March 15th 2019 and
6180860	6183540	It's going to start at 10 o'clock Eastern
6184380	6190440	It doesn't say if it's p.m. Or a.m. So I will assume a.m. Because maybe they would have done military time otherwise
6191300	6198820	But at any rate it is they sell out like that. So you want it you be ready for it. I
6199900	6206900	Like what this company does they do this for a lot of you know, kind of like in strong indie titles will say and yeah
6206900	6211820	They're they're limited runs go very very strongly. So there's one for to jam and Earl on pre-order right now
6211820	6217480	Yeah, but I was gonna see if they had it up on a pre-order win jammers for switch. Holy crap
6218240	6225400	Yeah, that game had a resurgence not that long ago because some popular youtuber other. Yeah, it was gaming with sacks. Yeah
6225980	6230700	Which is the game sack guys? Yeah. Yeah. So alright. Well, that's it for rapid-fire news
6230700	6234140	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates some things that are coming to you real soon
6234140	6241620	It's a bit of a slower week this week. We've got the Caligula effect overdose on PC switch and PlayStation 4
6242660	6247980	one-piece world seeker on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and finally
6248260	6254300	Tom Clancy's the division 2 on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one. That's probably the big release for us this week
6254300	6258400	Oh, yeah, all right traveling over to Japan. It's a little busier than it was last week
6258400	6262940	I remember last week was kind of not as many releases, but we do have this week speaking of Sega
6263020	6268700	They're releasing on the PlayStation 4 blade Arcus rebellion from shining is coming out in a regular and premium edition
6269180	6274820	Sengoku musu for DX and a regular and 15th anniversary box. So I guess that's some type of
6276020	6281680	Remaster of that game because I think that already I'll be dying Sengoku musu's dynasty warriors, right?
6281860	6287220	Yeah, so it's a I think a remaster for the PlayStation 4 of the fourth one in that series. So anyway
6287740	6291220	So that is out this week as well as a game called lover in Japan
6291980	6294340	Destiny connect is also out in Japan this week
6295300	6298900	Alias carnival sacrament plus in regular and limited edition and
6299500	6306180	Kemco RPG selection volume 2 is out this week. So this is like a greatest hits. I'm trying to see what's in this
6307100	6309060	revenant dogma
6309060	6315620	Alastair chronicles as divine hearts 2 and ferns gate and those are some deep cut JRPGs, you know
6315620	6321200	But if you're a fan of those you're probably very excited to hear that's coming out on a PlayStation 4 in a box set this
6321200	6322640	Week, that's pretty cool
6322640	6325160	Taking a look real quick at the switch to see if they have anything there

6440460	6443500	But did you read one from Rama? Uh, yes, I did last week

6485740	6491800	Why does he Nina flowers because that's Evie oddly is like drag sister or something like that. No, Nina not Nina flowers
6492900	6498520	Nina West, you know West. There you go. Okay. Yes, because I was voting for I was reading for soju
6498860	6505380	But soju was terrible and I'm so glad I called that bitch out on getting a wish outfit
6506100	6510900	I'm like girl. No. No, I will find this and post in the chat. I believe I was like
6511380	6516220	You it's like a little while Lolita kimono and I bought one just to see what they look like
6516220	6519760	So I'm not saying anything. I had worn it cuz it didn't fit at the time. It might fit now
6520180	6524620	but this bitch got it on wish cuz it's the only place you can get this shit and
6525780	6530740	I commented and she's like, yeah, I did it. I'm sorry. She oh she commented. Yeah
6532580	6538540	So what she got dressed on wish who cares not about but it's bad Bob the drag queen won a challenge in a Tron outfit
6538540	6542580	That she bought on Amazon's and somebody was like, here's the Amazon listing for that outfit. She's
6543500	6547860	Yeah, right. I need that. Look it up. I'm actually when I get when I do Disney bounding
6547860	6553300	I have that Tron shirt now. It's got the the identity disc on the back and everything. Yeah
6553300	6559060	I'm good. I might order the Quora one though. That'd be sweet. Um so far Evie oddly is my favorite, too
6559060	6564140	I really wanted to like silky but that is annoying as fuck that first episode
6564140	6567620	I just want a big girl to win already. Damn it. Okay silky
6567900	6571500	I'm sending it because my Apple watch it's fine. Stand up silky
6572260	6574260	makes me think of
6574300	6579580	Jiggly Caliente Snooki except nothing but an entire episode of that fucking shit
6579900	6580580	All right
6580580	6581220	anyway
6581220	6583220	If you would like to send us an email
6583500	6589240	Participate at orange lounge radio.com or we will further the drag race talk next week when I catch up on the show one more thing
6589820	6591820	Scarlet envy I can't stand that heifer
6592100	6593220	Okay
6593220	6597140	Moving on let's get back into some video game. Loki's just sitting here this whole time going
6597140	6599140	It's like it's like they're speaking a foreign language. All right
6600260	6601660	All right
6601660	6608660	Loki what do you have next for us? So there was issues with amp. I think it's still going on issues with anthem crashing
6609540	6611540	PlayStation 4s
6611900	6614540	To the point where I believe a patch came out over the weekend
6614540	6615020	Okay
6615020	6615300	well
6615300	6618300	originally it was crashing them to the point where you had to actually
6618620	6622320	They would shut the console off and you'd have to rebuild the file system
6622800	6625600	Which is bad, but apparently I guess they have
6626320	6630080	Patched it out. So that's good. But really shouldn't have been doing that in the first place
6631640	6636040	But yeah, I know that there was a scare for a while that actually it was bricking consoles
6636040	6640800	But thankfully once people found out that they could boot in the safe mode and rebuild their file system
6640800	6644400	Then everything was which is what happens when your PlayStation 4 shuts down unexpectedly anyway
6644400	6649100	But it was doing it like it wasn't allowing you even to just close out the application. It was also kind of
6649780	6654940	Breaking stuff in that sense Oh quest buster and chat is correcting me saying the patch doesn't cover the crashes
6655100	6659420	Only some of the loot issues and a few other things. Oh, I thought this is a fix for that. Okay
6659420	6661420	Well, I say fucking good
6662700	6667380	People are liking it. I'm just I I've put out the reasons why I'm way karma
6668380	6674420	Put out the reasons why I'm waiting if y'all are enjoying it have fun, you know fire were fucked over there good fans. So whatever
6674420	6676420	You
6677180	6679180	Do you I guess I
6679860	6683660	Don't want to keep shitting on this game. I just want to move on with our lives. So
6684500	6685820	Okay
6685820	6687820	Well, let's just move on. All right
6688100	6690100	then
6690100	6694560	X link in chat says it's still crashing systems and the patch is out later this week
6695260	6700240	Shad Leland Shane is in chat saying as much as I'm enjoying anthem. I can't defend that issue
6700920	6705880	Talking about the breaking and so forth quest buster does reiterate it's not breaking them
6705880	6712760	It just forcibly shuts the game down and made me think it bricked my PlayStation 4 so and act F points out
6712760	6716360	It's not great when the people that want to like anthem are giving it a truly
6716360	6721520	It's also like if it's it's doing it's shutting your system down in a way that needs to rebuild the file system
6721920	6723160	Because it won't start up
6723160	6730080	Normally, there is a risk for data loss or data corruption because of that so it may not be doing
6730120	6732720	It yet, but it it's not a good thing
6733360	6737040	All right. Well, let's move on somewhere out there McCrea saying it's high noon
6737040	6743120	And this is a story about Pokemon go and what's gonna happen at high noon on March 13th from 12 p.m
6743120	6747360	To 1 p.m. In your local time zone, so it's not based on you know
6747360	6752280	Everything is central is centralized on Pacific time or you know, the Asia Pacific all has one time
6752280	6758440	It's 12 to 1 in your time zone. The number of raids in Pokemon go will be increased
6758600	6765240	So they're actually calling this an experiment with lunch hour raid battles and they're saying if the one-day trial runs
6765240	6768000	Well, if we sell a lot of raid passes
6768600	6771900	Then this might be a regular thing to look forward to now
6771900	6779440	I don't really get to do this at my work because where my work is is not really a very commercial office building area
6779440	6782680	This is I'm like I work at the one random office building in the area
6782800	6787440	So I don't think I'll really get to benefit from this but I definitely know people and if Shane still
6788120	6791520	Watching he can protest this because I know he used to play with the group
6791860	6798480	Over here in Rancho Cordova more in your neck of the woods where they actually go out on lunchtime raids and they you know
6798480	6802660	They're like, okay, we see that there's a five star over here and a five star over here and they actually plan their route
6802720	6804840	So I'm thinking for those guys man
6804840	6809220	They're gonna have a field day that day because there's gonna be stuff spawning. I imagine every go to the park
6809400	6811840	Yeah by my work this guy like a few
6811840	6813840	I
6814120	6820780	Ex raid there's ex raid and there's usually another one they do raids on I'm just trying to grind raids right now just to
6821440	6824120	Because I'm doing the melt and thing and I got it in ten raids
6824520	6827920	So what I've been doing because I don't like actually doing the raids as I go there
6828040	6831840	Go into it my free raid pass get the credit for it and quit out
6835920	6838520	Yeah, but you can you can do one in two stars on yourself
6838520	6840520	These are all five
6840880	6847080	A lot of three stars are very scalable. Yeah, so but that knew that new one legendary dialga
6847080	6851480	I don't know if I'm saying the name, right? He is he's he's more useful than the ones we've had previously
6852520	6856880	He's he's worth having at least one of and apparently I don't think you need a ton of people to take him down
6857040	6858720	So I got very lucky
6858720	6865600	Like the first one that spawned in all of Sacramento happened to spawn right by my work and I caught him on the first ball
6865640	6869640	So I was like great I'm done for this month and he was a pretty decent appraisal
6869640	6875240	So I'm like, wow, the Pokemon gods are smiling on me today. I'm done. So that was that no
6875240	6880020	I'll probably still try to go catch more especially if Alan, you know, cuz if Alan can't get one now that there's trading
6880020	6885700	In fact, I think I think he missed reg ice and I got one today in my little bonus box
6885860	6890560	So I'm gonna give it to Alan if he doesn't have one already. He's missed. I know he's missing one of the regs
6890560	6892560	I think might be red rock though
6892600	6895180	Anyway, let's see other comments in chat
6895840	6900720	Act F says Palkia is also useful. Dialga is doable if you have really good Machamps or grudons
6901240	6907360	Shane is saying I was getting ready for Rayquaza this weekend and spent 1.1 million stardust to power up my Pokemon for it
6907400	6911640	Since my husband and our friends are not as high a level as me and I'll be doing the heavy lifting
6911640	6914600	There were requires of things coming up next weekend though, right?
6914600	6919240	That's not that it I didn't miss it when I was in Vegas did I might have I don't know
6919240	6923200	I think it's next weekend when that all goes down. So do you do Pokemon rating misty?
6923880	6925880	Not really, especially considering
6926720	6931740	well one I'm usually working during raid times and and I'm also
6932360	6938580	In a when I am at work and at home. I'm not in a very stop slash gym dense area. So
6939380	6940720	You know and that is a good point
6940720	6946560	Is that you know 12 to 1 might be your standard lunch, but there's a lot of people out there who don't work standard hours
6946840	6949960	We even have in chat as Joe and Hunter Matt saying I won't be able to do this
6949960	6951400	I'm a supervisor at my job
6951400	6954880	So I can't leave and let the inmates run the asylum for me to raid
6955040	6956360	Fair point and you know
6956360	6963920	There's plenty of industries where you don't get to work the standard again nine to five noon to one on March the 13th
6963920	6968920	Which would be today's the 10th. So Monday Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be at work
6968920	6973600	So yeah, so not everybody can do it, but I guess they just note that well, it'll be there
6973600	6976380	That's why they're trying it. Maybe there's trying to see what's the engagement like
6976760	6981600	So hmm, I would love if I if I'm able to get away from my desk for an amount of time
6981600	6985760	I would love to try to find some raids and you know just for fun, especially if
6986280	6989400	They put out some super I think it would they would really draw people out
6989400	6992100	They put out some surprises like not just Dialga
6992100	6997200	But maybe you know, some of the shiny variants coming back or something. We kind of neat. We'll see
6997200	7001320	yeah, I hope this does turn out to be a successful experiment because
7002320	7008360	Granted they get in scheduling patterns with me, but Wednesday seems to usually be one of my days off. All right
7008360	7014040	Well, you never know. All right. Anyway, so we'll see. Yeah, we'll see how that goes for those of you that are playing Pokemon
7014040	7019520	Go, I'm sure we'll hear about it this next week because not every Pokemon go event always goes swimmingly
7019520	7022920	There was that whole Phoebus event they did that was kind of a nightmare
7022920	7025600	But then they improved on it when they did clam pearl so, you know
7026400	7030200	Things are fixable anyhow speaking of fixing things dark Sakura
7030840	7032200	well
7032200	7036840	This one I was a little bit confused about this one because I thought it had already been
7037800	7038800	settled
7038800	7042000	but Alfonso Ribeiro filed to drop a suit against
7042840	7046860	The fortnight creators over the Carlton dance being in the game
7047440	7051840	Which I thought that it had been thrown out already. I can clarify a little bit
7051840	7054720	What happened is that he tried to get a copyright on it?
7054720	7056720	And that was the thing that was denied
7056800	7060640	Previously is the copy they based at the office came back and said it's a very simple dance
7060640	7065240	You're denied and I think when we heard that we kind of saw this coming
7065840	7069400	But now it's it it's here. He just yeah, he
7070080	7074980	Withdirected it. Yeah withdrew is his filing and said he was gonna drop the case
7075400	7082140	So there you go. Everyone get your Carlton dance on and on top of that. He doesn't own the dance anyway, because it's owned by
7083100	7085020	By ABC
7085020	7092320	NBC NBC, but no whatever BC well actually copyright says no one owns it. No, so Carlton all you want. Here we go
7092320	7095700	Just kidding. I'm not doing it again. Um, I did that on the first
7096220	7100860	I did it on the first stream. I'm not doing that again. Somebody gift it and I'm like, oh boy
7100860	7105700	I learned my lesson about what to do and what not to do on stream. Um, but anyway, I
7106380	7110740	Don't I think it was all the folks that were suing got thrown out
7110740	7115460	Right because the same lawyer was representing everybody right like backpack kid and all that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know man
7115460	7117460	I think they all got thrown out
7118220	7120220	so yeah, I just
7120780	7124300	It seems like it's a money grab. Yeah. All right
7125300	7127300	You know an attempt to you know
7128700	7131700	Relevancy well, yeah, and I think for somebody like, you know
7132460	7139700	Alfonso Ribera who's who's known for that like that is playing that role really defined his career and he worked it into dancing with the
7139700	7143660	Stars and everything like, you know that I think was important to his brand
7143660	7148060	So for him to lose that probably sucks, but at the same time like I kind of think, you know
7148260	7150260	Having seen Alfonso Ribera on
7150540	7151700	Dancing with the Stars
7151700	7157380	He's much more than just like he's capable do more and now he's turned that into more hosting gigs and things like that and like
7157380	7157780	You know
7157780	7163740	We'd love to see a good 90s personality show up as a host every now and then and so I feel like the dude's gonna have
7163740	7166980	a career that he doesn't have to own that dance to have a very
7167260	7170860	Great career that a lot of us would be gifted to have so
7171540	7176860	Maybe there's a point where he even said, you know what? I just I don't want to be known as the guy that shut down
7176860	7178860	fortnight, I mean
7179020	7184800	Just think about it. You might be able to turn that gig into a CG genie someday. No
7186260	7189380	Alright moving on just a few more stories for you guys Loki
7190100	7195860	Alright, so this is kind of cool. I mean it just came out and I haven't picked it up because I saw him played through the
7197260	7204100	The third one, but apparently just cause four is already included in Xbox game pass
7204580	7210980	So you can go ahead and check that out with your $10 a month subscription and that just came out. Yep. Yeah
7212020	7212980	December
7212980	7214980	So that's pretty quick
7215140	7218460	But I mean, I guess it's not as quick as like say so in the first party game
7218460	7221100	So this is notable just because it's a third party game
7221100	7225580	But you know usually like stuff is day and date with like crackdown stuff
7225620	7228220	But it's a pretty good game from what I hear
7228220	7233060	I just I can't see myself diving into it because I still haven't played the third one
7233060	7239820	Which I own and bought and there's plenty other games that are still in backlog Kingdom Hearts 3 Final Fantasy 15
7240340	7242340	that I haven't
7242500	7247400	Gotten chance to play it. So I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to hold off on more Square Enix games at this time
7248460	7250020	All right, then
7250020	7253780	Alright and one more story for you guys tonight before we open up our discord

7265940	7267700	We'll try take your call a little later on in the show

7272700	7274700	To call in about tonight
7274740	7280340	Meanwhile before we get there, let's talk about this is pretty exciting a new NES game was unearthed
7280500	7284580	So a brand new wrestling game for the NES it was called
7285500	7287500	UWC which is probably some type of like
7287960	7289960	Universal United Wrestling
7290660	7296140	Conspiracy, I don't know but it was a game that was made by Sada and it was discovered recently on a review cartridge
7296180	7300080	So the game was near completion, but for whatever reason was not released
7300080	7305140	Maybe it was just something that was came out in the the late in the lifespan of the NES and they just decided it
7305140	7306300	Wouldn't be worth it
7306300	7307620	So anyway
7307620	7314620	This thing was discovered and I guess it was it's going to the classic archive that they've been putting it that
7314740	7320700	Classic video gaming museum and they're trying to get it all deconstructed and I believe we're planning on releasing the ROM soon
7320780	7325120	So more people can enjoy that, you know, if you want to check out a little piece of history, so
7325700	7332360	There you go. UWC a brand new NES game unearthed this week that just never happened
7333040	7336120	Dark to see you in chat saying I think this was like the precursor to
7337160	7343460	WCW at least what I read looking into this story. Yeah, probably so, you know and obviously, you know
7343460	7349160	It wrestling is a sports standard that always has video games that come out like this is all and you know
7349160	7354360	even back in the NES days we had that really awesome WrestleMania game that had like Hulk Hogan and
7354920	7356360	Andre the giant was in it
7356360	7360840	like all all the faves we grew up with were in that WrestleMania 8-bit game and of course like
7360840	7366320	You know if you want to go on to the switch online library pro wrestling which probably isn't as good
7366320	7371040	But it's still you know, it's a wrestling game and it's it's competent and you can play it and have a little fun for a few
7371040	7373040	Minutes, so pretty cool. Anyway
7373920	7379940	Dark to see a also confirming in chat. I do know the ROM should be out there soon. Yeah, so alright
7380240	7384980	Well, let's head on into our listener roundtable where we're gonna open it up for some
7385420	7390980	Calls via our discord or if you would prefer you can also just jump in and
7391220	7393100	Anything you want to ask in our chat room?
7393100	7394440	You can go ahead and do that
7394440	7397340	You can jump in our chat room and anything you want to ask us
7397400	7398780	You can do that in there as well
7398780	7402180	If you're feeling too shy to call in and want to participate still with us one way or the other
7402420	7406620	You can do that there. So I think we do already have a call on the line
7406620	7413540	I'm just not set up because again that freaking power outage from earlier screwed us up
7413580	7418540	But anyway, let's get to it and we'll let's start with this call. Hi you are on orange on radio. Who's this?
7419220	7421220	Yeah, this is metal man. Yeah
7422020	7424020	Hey good metal mayhem. How you doing?
7424820	7426820	Pretty good. Can't complain
7426900	7428640	well since
7428640	7430640	you mentioned
7430940	7435220	Gable earlier during the show as I talked about since it's relevant
7435860	7441520	Yeah, bear in mind back in the 90s. I was not a PC gamer or strictly console
7443540	7448020	I gave up a PlayStation 1 and there was a ps1 port of Diablo
7448260	7452420	There was respect that to say Diablo was on consoles. Yes
7453920	7458900	Along with Warcraft 2, but I'll see you there. Sorry for no show
7460500	7463720	Yeah, I played the ever-loving half of Diablo
7465140	7472580	Unfortunately, I never got a chance to play the PC version because I didn't have a PC back then PC gaming was too expensive for me
7472580	7474460	back then but
7474460	7477900	you know if what I've been told, you know told if I were they
7478500	7485220	Somehow come across a box copy of Diablo. It would not run on modern machines for one reason or another
7485900	7486940	so
7486940	7489940	When I heard that the elbow was re-released
7490660	7494460	And they got working on modern PCs. I like
7496220	7501460	We haven't had the ps1 version of the game in years I've been wanting
7502100	7504720	You know to play the original Diablo again
7506060	7510020	you know be able to that's my first PC game, but
7511780	7516860	So be able but at the same time a little conflict is
7518580	7519980	The
7519980	7525940	Before you probably remember there's a thing a little bit of a brouhaha a few months back
7526700	7528700	regarding dog in the
7528780	7532780	You know, you know, you know CD project right that you know red and
7533580	7538380	One of their other companies, I guess they you know, so the branch that was working on
7539140	7540340	cyberpunk
7540340	7548320	2077 yes, I'm I'm well aware of that and it's it's one of those things where this this news of a partnership with
7548420	7550420	Blizzard is is really too big to ignore
7551260	7558520	and also, I think we've heard of a lot of really dumb fuck moves by PR people lately and I hope the
7559060	7559980	entire
7559980	7562800	PR industry is really evaluating some of their
7563500	7567140	Edgy things that they do out there and I I'd prefer to leave it at that
7568500	7571660	Yeah, you know, so, you know all that being said, you know
7572100	7579060	You know, I've been kind of like for lack of a bear in the LD kind of like it here stuck in the headlights, you know
7580100	7583420	You like buy the game that I really want to play do I not?
7583420	7585420	Well
7585740	7586940	Here's the thing
7586940	7590700	Here's the thing rage nator. It's probably harder than you remember for one
7590700	7595900	I mean take a look at that clip that I just did earlier where I died twice now if I really kind of sat down
7595900	7601100	And like forced myself to get good so to speak I could probably remember like oh, these are the things that I'm doing wrong
7601100	7605980	maybe I'd have to consult a walkthrough or something to kind of help me out a little bit and kind of jumpstart my brain as
7605980	7611100	To what we were kind of doing back in the day with those games which to be fair you on BBS's and stuff
7611100	7614580	We were trading the same, you know knowledge and the internet was still in its early days
7614660	7618460	So, you know game facts did exist and in earlier forms and so forth
7619020	7624380	So, you know you can kind of pick up what you're supposed to be doing in Diablo and and and get it that way
7624500	7626500	But you know at the same time
7627060	7633580	It may you kind of may go back and go to it and you like oh shit when I play something like Diablo 3
7633580	7636060	I really do have all these quality of life
7636300	7640660	Improvements that I sometimes forget about because Diablo 3 really got shit on when it first came out
7640700	7642580	I mean, it's a fine game now
7642580	7647700	But you still you kind of start to realize like oh in a game like Diablo 3 you really kind of good
7647700	7652380	You could just like jump in there and get going whereas then the original Diablo you could you couldn't do that
7652380	7656340	Or if you did you kind of ended up like I did in my little sample stream that I did there earlier
7656340	7657420	So, you know
7657420	7662980	I think as long as you go to it with the right mindset that it may take a bit for your brain to adjust to
7662980	7664620	the 90s experience
7664620	7667020	Then I don't think it's necessarily a waste of money
7667020	7670300	Especially if it's a game you enjoyed just because it's old doesn't make it bad
7670500	7674420	But some of the conveniences of new are gonna be lost if that makes sense
7675500	7681980	Exactly, you know that but admittedly, you know, I have bought some other rupture games, you know
7681980	7683980	I'm God in the past
7684220	7688300	Yeah, we're available and like Dan 64 like for example
7689180	7694460	the two rock games and shadows of the Empire and at least with those
7694460	7701420	You know, you know, I'll start them off, you know play for maybe I know if I came in and say oh, yeah
7701420	7705260	I remember this level. I'll remember that sounds fact. I remember that weapon
7705900	7708780	Yeah, all right. I've gone out, you know go play something else now
7709500	7716140	So then the question would be how much is ten bucks worth you is ten ten bucks worth a five-minute thrill and something to have
7716140	7721180	In your library, or do you think you're really gonna sit down and spend the three four hours?
7722140	7727920	Whatever your time is worth to you to really make that ten dollars valuable that's something unfortunately buddy. I can't answer for you
7728900	7730100	You know
7730100	7736620	You know if I can't find some people to play with the game with either online or land or whatever
7737340	7742820	Then and then really bring the character to the point where he's so overpowered
7743620	7745060	ridiculously
7745060	7747120	Turn on friendly fire and like
7748120	7753000	I'll kill you. Sorry. Yeah, just kind of like totally troll it
7755000	7761080	Well until you got to the trolling part I was thinking that that was you know, you could easily find a group either
7761520	7766440	You know on different web forums out there. Maybe you'll find some like-minded vog people on our discord
7766440	7770520	But even if not there, you know a social media places like Twitter or Facebook or so forth
7770520	7773520	I bet you could find some other people to play through with and maybe have fun
7773520	7777040	But you know, it's funny because we're talking about these old games from the 90s being new again
7777040	7781740	You know, you can team up with friends and anything's more fun with friends. Diablo will be fun with friends
7781740	7786360	What was something I was talking about last week on the show was Phantasy Star online, you know
7786360	7791640	I recently rediscovered that playing blue burst with my buddy Delvin over at VG realness and and Bobby joined in for some too
7791640	7794840	And I think Shane joined in at least for some of the chat and that was great
7794840	7799140	I mean even though that game has some ways that it shows its age as well
7799340	7805400	You know, there's a lot that especially playing with friends makes a game like that more fun
7805580	7809700	So I think that's something else to consider maybe if you could find the friends to play with
7809940	7814340	It's gonna make the Diablo experience even though it's something old-school that much sweeter
7814340	7819860	But certainly and as being said in chat to just because something is old doesn't mean it's bad. So but anyway, uh
7820420	7822460	Metal mayhem I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls
7822460	7825980	But thank you so much and take care and I want to know if you end up getting it or not
7826980	7829260	Yeah, the very earliest I can get is
7830500	7835260	At the earliest just the 15th. I'm literally penniless until then bud. All right
7835260	7837980	Well, keep us posted keep us posted on if you get the game or not. All right
7839480	7846500	Take care. All right. That was a metal mayhem here on orange launch radio. We've it's our lobbies filling up here
7846500	7850860	Let's get to another call and get somebody else here on the line. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
7850860	7852860	Nope
7853340	7858940	No, they're gone that person dropped out loud no, no you were in the green room you're coming on the show
7858940	7862020	Let's try that one more time. Hi, you're on our songs radio. Who's this?
7864100	7870340	Book this is excellent. Hey, that's alright. I know it's it's a new way of doing it. It's it's not Skype anymore
7870340	7872180	How what's on your mind, buddy?
7872180	7877140	Nothing much. I'm sorry. I haven't pushed the talk on so that's probably reason why no worry
7877180	7881600	No for a minute you went back to the other channel and I was like no you get back here
7884260	7889060	What's on your mind tonight, so so anyways, I got done being Kingdom Hearts 3
7889060	7893420	I'm not gonna give any spoilers or anything. I just want to say it was worth the wait
7894380	7898820	Though I had a lot of questions, but it was definitely worth the play through
7898820	7903920	Let me put it that way and I'm glad nothing happened. It didn't break my console or didn't do anything crazy
7904160	7906640	So I was really happy with the purchases
7908640	7912780	That's that's I'm glad to hear you how many hours would you say you dumped in the game Oh
7914720	7916720	Probably a little over 30
7917200	7923440	So at 30 35 hours is still a pretty it's a you know, I was just talking to a metal mayhem
7923440	7924360	I always want to say his old name
7924360	7926440	I was just talking to metal mayhem about you know
7926440	7931480	The value of like $10 for a game like Diablo and how many hours you get out of it, but that's that's not bad
7931480	7933080	That's about 50 cents an hour
7933080	7934420	for
7934420	7937180	Kingdom Hearts, that's a pretty good value. So cool
7937800	7940440	What do you think about this story about the DLC?
7940440	7942640	They're thinking to do it because I think that was on last week
7942640	7947960	Yeah, we talked a little bit about the DLC. That was do you think there's room for DLC again?
7947960	7952900	Please keep it spoiler free. You know that but what do you think there's room for DLC and what they could do? I
7956660	7959960	Think we lost oh we did we lost him he alright he dropped out
7959960	7964840	Well, maybe he can speak up in chat on his thoughts there. Unfortunately, he dropped off a discord
7964840	7965720	I don't know what happened there
7965720	7970440	Maybe the lightning in his neck of the woods took him out just like it took out our show earlier there
7970440	7974040	So well bummer because I would have liked to have heard his thoughts from somebody that beat it
7974040	7979240	But maybe he can get that in our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network in the meantime
7979240	7981920	I am gonna move on to the next call. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's this?
7984920	7986920	Hey Rama, hey doing buddy
7987400	7989900	I'm just enjoying the warmer weather here. Finally
7990360	7995720	I'm I'm enjoying the change of pace here too, but I'm also I get my mood is affected by the weather
7995720	8000960	So I'm just I'm I'm thankful to have a break from the rain or supposedly until six o'clock tonight
8000960	8005160	I thought we were gonna break from the rain. But yeah, I find the rain relaxing in a stress atlas
8005200	8010380	Yeah, but it's if you have certain season effective things
8010380	8016040	It can definitely take its toll on you after the summer is what stresses me out. Hmm. Interesting. Anyway, what's on your mind Rama?
8017520	8020560	You also gotta say we got a bless the rains down in Africa
8022400	8025600	But I don't I don't live there I live in California Rama
8029800	8033960	Okay, it's California dreamin on a winter's day remember or anyway
8034800	8036800	Touche, okay
8037840	8042000	Be on my merry little way, so I watched an episode of DuckTales and yes
8042000	8048600	I found myself tearing up a bit not just because of the nostalgia of the music the fact that she's saying that as a
8048800	8052480	Lullaby to that one creature in the episode. I was like, this is too much for me
8052480	8055320	Did you know that it was coming or did it was it a surprise?
8055960	8061080	It was a surprise cuz a friend of mine was watching it and she just made a screen cap
8061080	8064520	I was like wait what so I watched it and I believe
8064840	8071800	She they played it three times in the episode the first time she was singing it like she was fighting the creature the first time
8072600	8079840	The second time it was like in a background music. And the third time was when she actually sang it as a lullaby. Oh, that's cool
8084600	8086600	There are moon mites
8090480	8095960	I actually from the little clip. I thought she was on the moon but to be I haven't she was on the motion
8095960	8098840	Okay, I haven't watched the new DuckTales. Sorry. I I
8099520	8101520	Was in Vegas for God's sake
8101800	8106840	She is on the moon. Basically. Gotcha. She's trying to get back home to her kids
8109440	8113480	Well, yeah, so it looks in that thing just a larva of the bigger creature
8114440	8118560	The child of the bigger creature. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what I said a larva
8120600	8124300	Spoilers y'all spoilers. Did it make you want to go back and play DuckTales?
8124300	8130780	Well, you know, I mean I do have remastered for ps3, so yeah, I'm
8131540	8137220	That was a free or you know free game for PlayStation Plus at one point wasn't one of those gave it away
8137260	8142820	It might have been the Microsoft platform. They gave away somebody made away. I don't know. It could be my backlog. Who knows?
8142820	8146500	Yeah, it's hey, the remaster is pretty solid. I think it's a fun one to go through
8146860	8149380	They change a little bit, but it's fun. I
8150180	8157100	Would love to see DLC for the game where it's using updated graphics and voices from the current get from the current series
8157140	8161100	That would be kind of cool. Mmm. That would be cool. That would be very cool
8161500	8164680	Well, I'm anything else on your mind tonight Rama besides DuckTales
8166980	8168980	Mario Day, I have a funny story
8169620	8175340	This story is several years old. But here's the thing when I was living back in my old town
8175340	8180380	I had other roommates and we would sit there and play Super Nintendo all the time that were in 64
8180540	8187020	My roommate said that he had the highest score in the house of Super Mario World and nobody could beat him
8187020	8190100	And he's just talking about like he is the king of Super Mario World
8190900	8194780	So one Saturday morning, I said, you know what? I'm going to shut him up
8194820	8201520	So I went out got some soda and some chips turn the TV on turn on the Super Nintendo and sat there
8202320	8209360	And I went through the entire levels of the game now he's watching me and he's going you're not going to beat my score I
8209800	8216800	Ignore him as I'm going through all the levels and once I unlock Bowser's castle, I stopped I go back
8216800	8218920	I open up the star road. I
8220160	8222560	Open that up and get the special zone. I
8223700	8227160	Opened that up and I go to the inverted Super Mario World
8227740	8231240	Beat Bowser look at him hand in the controller and walk out the living room
8232180	8233860	I
8233860	8239860	Perfect. Sometimes a spite is a wonderful motivator. That's how I live my life
8247760	8254280	Well, thank you for the Mario memory we love a good spiteful revenge story for a Mario memory Rama
8254280	8259160	I'm gonna let you go though so we can wrap up but take care and I'm sure maybe we'll hear more about DuckTales on Tuesday
8259160	8260720	an anime jam session
8260720	8266200	We might just cuz me and mako-chan were here watching it. So we definitely may talk about it. Sounds good. Take care, buddy
8267080	8271660	Awesome. Take care y'all later. All right, I think that's gonna do it for a discord stuff tonight
8271660	8277480	but I did want to respond to some of the stuff that was in our chat over at twitch TV slash vog network and
8278080	8281640	They were talking about Pokemon go and where was that? Oh, yes
8281940	8290120	Shane had said my go hype is wearing down now that sword and shield were announced all my Pokemon thoughts are directed towards those games
8290220	8295580	Why not both though? That's why can't you like both? I mean, I don't know that's kind of where I'm wondering
8295580	8300540	There's gonna be a different sword shield, but I'm still gonna play go any inner connectivity between let's go and
8301240	8306860	The new one well, oh you mean you mean between let's go and sort of show or between sword and shield and go because I could
8306860	8310800	See that I either there'll be connectivity like they had and let's go
8311020	8316300	Not that like you'd be able to send a Pokemon over but maybe it will unlock kind of like how
8317300	8323200	Meltan you get I wouldn't be able to send Pokemon over well, maybe you will maybe because I mean, it's Gen 8
8323200	8326480	It should all be in there. Yeah, maybe I don't know well because
8327640	8334760	Because I'm you too, but there's a big difference between catching them and go and catching them in the role-playing game format
8334760	8338920	I mean, I don't know it I guess if that's what they want to do they can but I'm not gonna expect that
8339080	8339560	Yeah
8339560	8344800	So but I I would think there's gonna be some type of functionality between the two just to encourage
8345160	8349000	Fans of one to get the other and fans of the other to get the one and so forth
8349000	8350820	You know that this would be a lost opportunity
8350820	8354040	Otherwise, I wonder if they're gonna re-release let's go like they do
8354040	8357500	You know how they do like a yellow version or something like that where they have
8358020	8363480	You know all this stuff combined in the one. Mm-hmm. I wonder if they'll do that. Who knows?
8364040	8365320	Let's see
8365320	8366840	Shane does continue in chat
8366840	8372580	I can like both but I won't care as much about go when I have sword and shield but what if then okay
8372640	8376320	But isn't like gen 5 is not your favorite starter coming up
8376320	8378800	So, I mean at some point, you know
8378800	8382680	The new sort of shield will come out and then you know people are gonna be focused on that for you know
8382680	8390520	A couple months but then couldn't go just suddenly say guess what gen 5 is out. Come get your oshwat, right and
8391160	8397060	Shane I you might change your tone. I don't know because I would think gen 5 is gonna be next so I don't know
8397320	8401220	Right. Am I right my way of thinking? Yeah. Yeah, so, uh, let's see
8402600	8408240	Shane does say let's be real gen 5 won't be in go until like 2026. I I don't think you're right on that
8410040	8415800	Let's see act deaf does say I do need a let's go expansion with the Johto region. I bet that'll happen
8415800	8420200	I bet there will be a let's go for gen 2 that I think that game did well enough
8420280	8425560	That may be in the off year. So next year, I bet we were maybe the year after we'll get a let's go for gen 2
8425560	8430140	It just seems it's it seems like maybe that's where the remakes are now, you know
8430140	8433360	It used to be that the remakes were always kind of like a few gens behind now
8433360	8438520	Maybe that's you know where the remakes are gonna be is in the let's go series. Who knows who knows?
8440280	8445160	Anyhow tiger class says they will probably do a let's go but with a different Pokemon
8445160	8447080	Well, of course, it would have to be a gen 2 Pokemon
8447080	8450440	But what iconic gen 2 pokemons could they pick?
8450860	8458260	Because there isn't anything like Pikachu and Eevee unless they did like Espeon and Umbreon or something that I think that might be the way
8458260	8463100	To do it over the shins over the starters. Oh and well, but you had three three
8463100	8463580	Yeah
8463580	8470940	And remember when it was like the color games when it was Pokemon silver and gold that didn't affect the starter pokemons
8470940	8477160	It just affected what you would encounter in the wild. So your starter Pokemon still end up being let's see. That was Chikorita
8479340	8483780	Water was the toad dial right the little crocodile thing and then
8484660	8486300	fire was
8486340	8492500	Cyndaquil I got it Cyndaquil. So those were those were your gen 2 starters, but I just don't say thank you for the applause
8492500	8498380	I just don't see them doing three separate games. You know, I mean, yeah, so we'll see
8498380	8506100	I see a Tiberius thinks Snubbull and Meryl would be the ones who know I don't know. It's hard to say so
8507380	8509100	Sentret and
8509100	8510900	What are the ones that are just everywhere?
8510900	8515880	What are the ones that are just like that just the shitty Mon that ever wish Sentret and the little spider dudes
8516300	8517620	um
8517620	8523340	What am I thinking of spinner X? Yeah spinner axe. That's it. Anyway
8523860	8529080	All right, but doof said no, but doof is gen 4 they better do it. Let's go, but doof
8529860	8535860	That would be fucking badass. I'd love that. All right. Anyway, um, all right. Well, that's gonna do Pokemon rusty
8536700	8542540	That's gonna do it for the calls tonight and we're going to start to wrap up the show tonight as we start to get into
8542540	8543780	final thoughts
8543780	8549300	First off I want to say misty. Well, actually I should ask are there any last-minute stories? Yes. I have a couple actually
8549300	8551760	All right. All right, go there's been some
8553500	8555500	Images leaked online
8555500	8557500	from the patent for
8558260	8564120	Google's new handheld Chromecast device and we have a picture what the controller might look like and it looks like a
8564500	8566500	PlayStation controller except kind of
8566980	8572820	Flat and it's like halfway PlayStation halfway. Oh, yeah, and I hate the oh, yeah part of that but you see this coming week
8572980	8579260	No, but yeah, maybe I know it's coming up. But the Google announcements supposed to be on the 19th
8579260	8581260	So that's a couple weeks
8582100	8584100	so there's that and then
8585180	8589180	Apparently the trend nowadays is to remake Star Wars games in Unreal 4
8589180	8593100	so we have someone that's remade when the levels of pod racer and
8593580	8600980	Unreal 4 and then someone that's now working on a recreating Star Wars dark forces in Unreal 4 and you can actually download
8600980	8603460	Both of those so I will link them in chat
8604060	8605420	neat
8605420	8607420	That's it. That's it. All right
8607660	8611500	Misty, thank you for being here. I hope you had a good time tonight. Thanks for being on the show great
8611500	8613700	It's always great to have you here you come such a long way
8613700	8614820	I know you've been a
8614820	8619660	Hardcore fan of this show for a very long time and your support really means the world and I say that to all the fans
8619660	8621660	Out there. So thank you so much for
8621660	8625060	Taking the time out to be all the way out here with us in studio. It's great
8625060	8629380	I love it when the the the fan I always feel weird saying fans the listeners
8629660	8633300	Can part the participants that was always a good word that we use with vogner where the participants?
8633300	8637420	I love in our participants can kind of come to the table and actually be at the table with us
8637420	8639220	It's always a great feeling so
8639220	8642300	But Missy, you know, I'm gonna ask you any final thoughts for our listeners tonight
8644460	8650100	I'm already sort of thinking about next time I come out. I do I do still need to cover some Bay Area trains
8650100	8652100	So I'm gonna spend a few days there
8652340	8656940	Considering some other stuff I want to do. I'm gonna spend a couple days in San Jose, I think next time
8656940	8659040	Oh, yeah, good. Good call go to round one
8659580	8665420	Well, actually round one will be here by this time next year. So but I do already have a round one card for San Jose
8666780	8670520	But if if you know my Twitter if you know have me on Facebook
8670520	8674880	And if you have ideas or want to meet up and you have permission to poke me wherever you know me
8675580	8677940	Well, that's that's quite generous permission misty
8677940	8679940	Okay
8680500	8682140	That's also
8682140	8685700	Considering that's why I'm saying if you already know the correct info. Ah, gotcha
8685700	8686380	All right
8686380	8692200	Let me ask this real quick because I don't I don't get to indulge your your deep knowledge of transit and your travels
8692420	8698580	But what would you say is like, you know of all the cities that you've gone to in the world and you know experience
8698580	8704980	They're they're trans and so forth. What is like the the train ride you need to go on in the u.s
8704980	8706980	What is the train ride you need to experience?
8707940	8709940	I
8710140	8715900	Even with how am checks and sort of seems to be falling apart if if you could if you could go
8716500	8717860	on the
8717860	8723260	Accela runs between Washington and Boston don't have to necessarily go the whole route
8723260	8727620	But I would recommend that especially in first class because that is the closest thing
8727620	8735180	We have to real a high-speed rail and even remotely empower with international trains. Okay, are you mean Washington State or Washington DC DC?
8735180	8738300	That's my figure. Okay, so DC to Boston. Okay, very cool. All right. Thank you
8738300	8743400	All right, we'll see you next time and they'll see you in chat in the mean in the interim. So, all right
8744060	8749460	Let's see act Efton chat saying I wish misty and I could have met up this time around but sadly my schedule couldn't let me
8749460	8753260	And it wasn't easy for me to make the trip to where it would have been convenient to meet up
8753260	8755820	So, but he says again
8756340	8762540	Maybe we'll work. Maybe we can work the logistics up because while I don't tolerate flights
8762540	8766540	I was half-poking on Greyhound a
8766980	8770540	Flight would be tolerable to the to the buses in this case
8771060	8776500	Sometimes sometimes an hour up and down. It ain't so bad as yeah also considering
8777180	8783480	If even with my very little grasp of languages, I know more Japanese than I do Spanish
8783480	8788460	So it's like well fuck I might as well just not deal with transferring in a foreign city
8788460	8790460	No better way to learn than immersion
8790980	8794340	Or so I hear anyway, thank you for being here misty
8797340	8801100	All right, let's go around and get our other final thoughts I'll save Jamie for later
8801100	8804880	So this is our first show back in a bit. So Loki I'll go to you. What's your final thought final thought is?
8806220	8807780	Maybe I'll play games this week
8807780	8812500	That would be a good idea to come to a video game podcast to talk about the things I'm working on
8813300	8815300	my final thought this week is
8815940	8818540	cross your fingers and send me your
8819380	8821380	Motivational vibes I guess because
8821740	8823520	Thanks to Alan's new job
8823520	8829500	We have a gym membership again, and so I need to it's time to turn this a jigglypuff into wigglytuff
8829860	8835220	So that's gonna be the upcoming plan. So there's that sex. I didn't I didn't invent that that's on a shirt
8839620	8845160	Well sadly I have to work, but you know I'd love to otherwise and last but certainly not least dark soccer
8845160	8847300	It's great to have you back here permanently
8848300	8850300	What's your final thought for our listeners tonight?
8851540	8853540	I
8853780	8855780	Love acupuncture a lot
8856140	8860260	but don't go to someone who does distal acupuncture make sure it is direct and
8860780	8863020	Then be prepared to be really lightheaded
8863900	8870380	That's it all right a life tip from dark soccer. That's gonna do it for us here in studio. Have a wonderful week everybody
8870380	8876140	We'll see you in seven days right back here on Twitch for a special st. Patrick's Day edition of olr
