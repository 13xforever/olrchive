14000	19000	This week, EverQuest turned 20, and it may not be old enough to drink in the US, but if you played it, you are!
19000	27000	If that doesn't drive you to drink, in celebration and moderation, then join us for the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	46000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show, where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 769 for this March 24th of 2019.
46000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you with my co-hosts in studio DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
52000	53000	Hello.
53000	54000	Hi, how are you?
54000	55000	Hungry, for once.
55000	56000	Yes, I know.
56000	57000	I'm hungry now.
57000	65000	So, unlike the show, what was it, like three weeks ago, when Mr. Smoosh actually got out? I think that was, you weren't here for that, it was like your last show, not here.
65000	72000	So, unlike that show, when somebody showed up with food delivery unintentionally, you're planning to make food delivery show up intentionally tonight?
72000	73000	Absolutely, on purpose-ly.
73000	76000	How do you like those services? I've never used them, am I weird?
76000	82000	I've only used this once, and I had it delivered while I was doing my hair, getting my hair done, so it was actually really convenient.
82000	83000	Goat curry, yum!
83000	87000	That's interesting to get it delivered places. Yeah, I guess, okay.
87000	89000	I am so getting goat curry.
89000	92000	Interesting, you've had it delivered everywhere but your house. Okay, cool.
92000	93000	Pretty much.
93000	96000	Anyway, also joining us, of course, here in studio, Techmaster Loki.
96000	97000	Hello.
97000	98000	Hi, Loki, how are you?
98000	99000	I'm fine.
99000	100000	I like your Pokémon themed shirt, it's very cute.
100000	105000	Yes, it's one of my new shirts that I have, can't really see it, I guess. Here, I'll stand up.
106000	115000	Because now that we are on Twitch TV, because we do tape live at twitch.tv slash vlog network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
115000	121000	And since we are on Twitch, we have to make more like wardrobe choices and style, like I can't come out here in my PJs. Well, I guess I can.
121000	128000	I was gonna wear, I had worn it on stream the other day, I think, maybe I did, I don't remember.
128000	129000	Oh, when you were doing your DDR, like-
129000	134000	I had a Thomas the Tank shirt, it's a tank, you know, it's hilarious.
134000	135000	I like that.
135000	144000	So I had that and then I have a few other Nintendo shirts, but this is what I went with today because I was playing Pokémon Go.
144000	150000	Well, we'll come back to that because I think there was quite a bit of Pokémon Go going on this weekend and probably next weekend too.
150000	156000	But we talk about a lot of video games, not just Pokémon Go, but it's, you got to admit that one's pretty convenient because it's on the mobile game.
157000	166000	But we're going to talk a lot about games tonight with you guys in our chatroom, of course, over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where Fifth Dream Today says about the food delivery stuff saying,
166000	168000	I get them delivered to hotels, very convenient.
168000	177000	I need to think, you know what, because I was just in Vegas a couple weeks ago and we got probably like seven different pizza places slipping the like flyer under the door.
177000	181000	And I'm like, I did not come to Las Vegas to order cardboard pizza, okay?
181000	185000	I came to Las Vegas to eat because there's a lot of good restaurants there.
185000	187000	Food delivery, I didn't think about that one.
187000	189000	I'm going with Lamb Korma.
189000	197000	You know what we were, I guess I can say this now because we're not at that hotel anymore, but do you know what we were right across the street from when we were in Vegas, our hotel?
197000	204000	This giant new, and I've not seen anything like it here in California, but this gigantic MedMen store, you know what they sell?
204000	205000	Huh?
205000	206000	Marijuana.
206000	207000	Yum.
207000	212000	It was a gigantic, like it looked like a fricking like Bel Air, Raley's, like Safeway, like shopping thing.
212000	213000	Yeah.
213000	221000	But it was all marijuana because I guess I didn't even realize Nevada made it legal, like we did in California.
221000	231000	So yeah, I just, I was, like here in California, even the places to get, I mean, not that we're a weed podcast, but it's a thing.
231000	233000	It's going on in culture right now, right?
233000	234000	It was just made legal in California, right?
234000	239000	But all the places to go buy it here, they still look like shady back alley places.
239000	242000	At least all the ones I've seen, still like they have the scarred out front.
242000	243000	Just order it online.
243000	245000	That's what I've heard too, is that online is like the way to go.
245000	249000	Speaking of, you know, delivery to your door, you can just do that.
249000	256000	That's what I do actually, except they don't do it to my door and where I live, but I go to Natomas and have it done at a friend's house.
256000	257000	I go to Chibi's.
257000	259000	Wow. Okay.
259000	261000	That's where I get my CBD pen for my nausea.
262000	266000	You get your food delivered, you can get your weed delivered, you can get your-
266000	268000	Get my fake weed. Well, CBD pen.
268000	270000	How long until I can order a beet?
270000	272000	Did you hear the speakingness now that we're going-
272000	274000	Would anyone in this room prefer a mango lassi, by the way?
274000	278000	Now that we're going into the marijuana podcast, did you hear that?
278000	282000	It's not episode 420, it's 769. That's a different number.
282000	284000	Seriously, does anyone want mango lassi?
284000	286000	No, I don't.
286000	293000	But anyways, the guy that's the founder of Jelly Belly or whatever, they're making jelly bellies now.
293000	294000	I heard, yeah.
294000	295000	I would eat that.
295000	301000	I don't know. I don't smoke weed, so it's not, you know. I don't care if other people do it, and I understand it's great for nausea and other things like that.
301000	305000	It's just, I drink, isn't that enough? Anyway.
305000	311000	All right, so I guess, but you know what? Look, I know it's a video game show, not a marijuana show, but I'm no idiot.
311000	312000	And I could-
312000	315000	What are you allowed to do when you get high? You play video games.
315000	323000	And based on, you know, the billboards that I've seen, I can also apparently have had my Slurpee delivered to me as well.
323000	328000	But what's the point at that point? Because, you know, you have to go get it, and it's immediately melting.
328000	333000	I just don't understand that, but you could do it if you wanted to, if you're that lazy.
333000	339000	Pixel Pacas in chat says, that's on the strip. No, we were off strip, but not far.
339000	344000	If you know where the Hard Rock Hotel is in Vegas, that's, well we weren't at that hotel, but we were like right in that area.
344000	346000	And that's where the store was that I was-
346000	348000	And this place is pickup only, so that sucks.
348000	353000	So, all right. Oh no, you put in a whole food order, and then they were like, oh, only pickup?
353000	355000	Yeah, so I have to cancel it.
355000	359000	Oh boy. All right, well anyway, let's get into our kickoff talk.
359000	362000	Well, you know what? It's funny, because we're talking about all this instant gratification stuff,
362000	367000	and that actually does tie into the news this week a little bit, because Game Developers Conference happened,
367000	372000	so we had a lot of news around Game Developers Conference, and probably the big thing that we,
372000	379000	the big, big news out of Game Developers Conference is finally, we know what Google's dive into gaming is going to look like.
379000	383000	And the twist is, it's not a console, right?
383000	384000	Yeah.
384000	386000	So tell us a little more about it, Logan.
386000	396000	It's a service, if you will. So, they're calling it Google Stadia, and of course, Phil Harrison, who's now over at Google now,
397000	403000	was talking about their platform and everything, what they're basically going to use, their high-end backbone,
403000	412000	running these really high-end gaming PCs or whatever, are going to be streaming up to, well, they said eventually 8K,
412000	417000	but right now, 4K, 60 frames per second, to any screen you can think of.
417000	423000	Can I just quickly say, like, the 8K, 120 frames a second, like, when they were talking about all that stuff,
423000	428000	I just, I thought instantly of, like, gigaflops, and things that they just say, because it's like,
428000	430000	Gigaflops are real things, though.
430000	436000	I know they are, but they're things that they just say, there's more of it, it's more better than what you know today.
436000	438000	It's just, I don't know.
438000	444000	It's just, yeah, I don't know, it's a neat idea.
444000	452000	I just don't know how practical it is with our network infrastructure that we have, but okay, let's just pretend that that wasn't an obstacle.
452000	454000	Then, yes, this could be a thing.
454000	461000	So, what they're going to do with Stadia is basically, you know, you would be able to, they're kind of linking it with a bunch of different things.
461000	469000	So, for example, they have it linked with YouTube, so, like, you'd be playing a game and then have a link on there to join someone that's actually playing a game,
469000	478000	or you can basically create save states, sort of, with your different games, so you can actually share those out as well, which is kind of cool.
478000	486000	They have, you know, it's basically going to allow you to jump into a game without having to download anything.
486000	494000	They're showing off, you know, being able to kind of, you know, go from your PC to your TV to tablets.
494000	507000	They have this dedicated controller that looks kind of like a Nintendo Switch Pro controller, but a little bit like Ouya as well.
507000	512000	It's kind of like all the existing controllers mushed together type of thing.
512000	513000	Yeah.
513000	520000	It's a very, like, when I saw the controller, I was like, this looks extremely unoriginal, but that's actually not a dig on Google.
520000	522000	Like, I don't want you guys thinking I'm, like, here to hate on this.
522000	524000	You don't really need to improve too much on the PC.
524000	529000	Yeah, I was just like, okay, this is what I would expect in gaming today.
529000	531000	This is a par for the course controller.
531000	540000	Yes, exactly. And they're saying that theirs is different because it connects directly with Wi-Fi, and it's supposed to lower latency that way.
540000	543000	So we'll have to see how that actually works out.
543000	548000	Right now, though, they didn't give too much of a hint of what they're doing.
548000	556000	They did, you know, show that Jade Raymond's going to be doing games using it for their...
556000	559000	They actually have their own first party company that's going to be doing games now.
559000	560000	We have no idea what the game is.
560000	561000	No idea, but...
561000	574000	But being that this is Game Developers Conference, it is logical that they would be focusing more on the platform, the delivery, the canvas, I suppose, and then we'll see the paintings at E3 or at different times.
574000	576000	So I'm not, like...
576000	577000	Yeah.
577000	579000	I know there was a lot of talk out there about why did they bring her out.
579000	585000	They got nothing to show, but it's maybe GDC is not usually the time to announce games.
585000	588000	Although there have been exceptions to the rule, right?
588000	597000	PlayStation Move was announced at GDC, but again, that's also more like a platform, a delivery, a canvas, if you will, not a game.
597000	598000	So...
598000	599000	I would be...
599000	614000	Now, what they didn't talk about, which I think would be pretty cool if they could do this because, you know, really one of the things that we run into with VR, for example, is having hardware powerful enough to be able to run it.
614000	638000	So if they're talking, you know, assuming that they can actually push 8K at 120 later on in the future, I mean, that might be something worthwhile for, like, VR because then you can have, you know, VR headset that's basically just a receiver and everything's being done in the cloud and you can stream these really powerful games to it.
639000	642000	But once again, that has to do with your network infrastructure.
642000	646000	And let's be honest, that ain't all that great in the United States.
646000	647000	So...
649000	658000	I like where they said that they only need 30 megabits down to be able to run games at 4K in 60 frames per second.
658000	660000	But I would be...
660000	664000	I would need to actually see this thing running and be able to check it out.
664000	675000	So hopefully when they do announce price and all that stuff, which apparently is going to happen in the summer at their own separate event where they talk about games and everything or come out to it, then I guess we'll have to wait and see.
675000	688000	But, you know, some of the games they talked about coming to it, obviously Doom, they were showing off Assassin's Creed, which, you know, that's the part of the project stream testing.
688000	694000	Which apparently, by the way, for people that I know that were doing that and participating in that said it looked really good.
694000	697000	I didn't see it myself, you know, so it's hard for me to know.
697000	700000	I think it's one of the things you kind of see yourself to really believe in it.
700000	714000	But I do feel like people that participated in that in general were big believers in what Google was delivering at this conference, whereas people who hadn't had their hands on it, admittedly myself, were a little more in the skeptical like,
714000	722000	I don't know, you know that Google just has that server behind the stage and it's not really, which by the way is the case.
722000	727000	Like there's not, it's not actually beaming over the internet from another, you know, location in another city.
727000	731000	Like it's on site and they do this at E3 with these types of streaming things all the time.
731000	738000	But I get it, I get it. This is a concept, it's not like it's releasing tomorrow, so I'm not going to like judge it harshly.
738000	746000	And it is benefited a little bit by the fact that, you know, people that I do know that had, did play the Project Stream thing, walked away from it with a pretty favorable impression.
746000	751000	You know, and to my thing, though, with it is like everyone's saying, oh, well, this is going to kill consoles and stuff.
751000	766000	I don't think so, because once, you know, first off, you have the issue where it's, you know, your network infrastructure has to be able to, and bandwidth caps for that, have to be able to withstand something like this for one.
766000	771000	And two, they have to have the games you actually want to play on it, like, cool, it has Assassin's Creed and Doom.
771000	778000	So do these other consoles. So does my PC. It's like, why do I need yet another service to play the same fucking game?
778000	785000	I don't need it. I need to see what they're going to, you know, offer on this platform that I can't get on these other platforms.
785000	792000	I can get it, this and a bunch of other things, and it makes it more convenient for me, because honestly, that's what it's going to come down to.
792000	798000	I don't care what your tech is. You just have to show me that it's going to work and that it has stuff that actually I'm interested in.
798000	806000	And it might be a thing you kind of have to try for yourself, but at the same time, if it's as easy as click here in your Google Chrome browser and bam, game.
806000	811000	I mean, this is not exactly something they're going to have to figure out. How do we get it in Best Buys and GameStop?
811000	819000	Like they should, hypothetically, be able to have like a 10 minute demo or something that you could just click a button and bam, you're going, right?
819000	820000	Yeah.
820000	824000	So it should be easy to make us believers, I suppose.
824000	833000	Okay, so my thoughts on this, and I want to know your guys' thoughts too in our chat, and I see some popping in already, and definitely Jamie, if you have thoughts on this thing as well.
833000	839000	My thought on this is that I do think this is the future of gaming. I think that's the reality.
840000	850000	Here's the deal. Broadly, this is the future of gaming. Specifically, I'm not sure this is the future of gaming. Does that make sense?
850000	851000	Yes.
851000	852000	Okay.
852000	855000	Immediate versus long term? Maybe?
855000	873000	Google versus the industry, if that makes sense, is that I'm not sure, and this isn't like a Google hate or anything like that. Although, I'm going to say it, Google has a track record of kind of closing things maybe before they really, you know, what Google Plus is sunsetting next month.
873000	875000	But okay, fine. That never really caught on.
875000	876000	Oh no.
876000	884000	Google inbox is going away, which I thought, you know, I was using that for a little bit and I thought it was kind of neat. It was just a different way, but I guess not enough people were doing it.
884000	886000	Didn't they have like Google Reader or something like that?
886000	900000	Google Wave, Google Reader, that was a big one that I still miss. I really wish that was around. And so on and so on. I mean, you know, okay, so Stadia and gaming, it's a different thing, but you can't help but kind of look at that and go, hmm, here's another big concern I have.
900000	909000	And I'm actually going to read a chat comment on this because I think he summed it up very well, and that's SSJ100Matt in our chat said, it frightens me that this is being powered by YouTube.
909000	925000	They're making it so that creators can have fans join games live. Google has a horrible track record in moderation in terms of YouTube. I understand the power of moderation will be in the hands of the creator, but the YouTube community is notoriously toxic at times. That is one of my top three concerns.
925000	939000	Yeah, but I don't think that's necessarily what they're talking about as far as that because it's more of like that you can share out. They were giving examples and obviously they're going to name their own services if they're giving examples, but they're basically saying like as a streamer and they only have to do it through Google.
939000	953000	You can have a hyperlink basically that you could put in the description for your show, podcast, livestream, whatever you're doing, where they would be able to jump into the instance that you're in as well to be able to play with you if they wanted to.
953000	967000	Or you can send them a link to play this game online or like, hey, I got stuck here. I'm going to put you in the same scenario. It's like a save state basically that I can have my show me how you would get out of this or something.
967000	976000	You're like, hey, you know, we're going to set up this Minecraft instance and you set it up and now show me what you're going to build with these blocks or something like that.
976000	989000	That could be neat. I'm going to say like in theory, I do have some concerns about it being tied to YouTube. I hope due to antitrust concerns, especially because we've seen what's happening in Europe where they're getting smacked down, I do hope that this will actually be open.
989000	1001000	I hope it's more of a case of what you're saying, like YouTube is the example, but in reality, it'll be open to Twitch, it'll be open to Mixer and things like that. After all, on your Xbox One, you aren't locked into Mixer. That's the one that kind of pushed, but you can do Twitch.
1001000	1010000	But the thing I did like, though, that they were talking about with the game streaming and stuff is this is opening up game streaming for other people that may not have the hardware to be able to do that.
1010000	1025000	Because what they're saying with this is when you basically can hit a button to stream your gameplay, whatever, it's not taking your actual gameplay, it's taking what it's viewing in the cloud. So it's being streamed at 4K and 60 frames per second.
1025000	1037000	So whereas I don't have hardware on my laptop to be able to do that, I could play this game in Stadia and be able to stream it out and it would be in the highest possible quality that you can get.
1038000	1047000	Now, here's what I mean about the industry. This is where the industry is going and I'm not sure this is it, but this is definitely a good tea leaves the future.
1047000	1053000	Actually, one thing I want to address real quick, because a lot of people are calling this OnLive, right? They're saying, Oh, OnLive did this a long time ago.
1053000	1057000	You know why OnLive failed? Here's why OnLive failed, like straight up.
1057000	1072000	OnLive failed. It wasn't like the fact that it was streaming and all this stuff. It was the fact that they wanted to charge you the same price for a retail game to own it in the cloud, essentially, and not have anything physical for that with no answer as to what would happen when the whole thing went away.
1072000	1078000	Like you're paying 60 bucks and I believe OnLive had a monthly fee. Am I not correct? I believe that was the case.
1078000	1079000	I remember.
1080000	1087000	OnLive had a monthly fee and still wanted to charge 50, 60 bucks a game so you could play it digitally, hopefully, you know, and obviously now they're long gone.
1087000	1096000	I think it is obvious. Who knows? Maybe I'll be proved wrong. I think it is obvious Stadia is intended to be subscription based.
1096000	1104000	Stadia wants to be Netflix for games, end of sentence. I don't think there's going to be more money and more things that are in this.
1104000	1112000	And you might wonder how, uh, studios are going to be able to make money. And so, well, I mean, Netflix is like, do you guys know?
1112000	1116000	I still think that they're going to sell actual games with it.
1116000	1122000	I don't, I, they might for like premium, premium things. I don't think it'll be successful if they do.
1122000	1130000	Does Netflix sell movies on top of what they're doing now? What would happen if they did that? I don't think, I don't think it would do well. I really don't.
1130000	1134000	I really don't. I don't know. But I mean, doesn't mean that they're not going to try.
1134000	1142000	Yeah. So anyways, it'll, it'll be interesting to see what happens in the near future when other people jump into the fray.
1142000	1151000	Um, but anyway, let's see, uh, other comments in chat, um, S2100 Matt says, I think that content creators struggling to gain viewership will be forced into having their gameplay open to viewers.
1152000	1160000	Sure, they can make their gameplays close, but if they want to differentiate themselves between other streamers and creators, they will be forced to keep up with the Jones by having their streams open.
1160000	1165000	Uh, PixelPaca says they talked about the Stadia store as a means to sell games.
1165000	1176000	Okay. Personally, if that is the case and I misunderstood something I'm, I'm seeing, or I missed that part of it. If that's the case that they're going to like sell, I, I don't think this thing will work.
1176000	1185000	I don't think the industry's ready for it. I think we're back where we were with Xbox One and them wanting to do as much digital as they did in the first announcement.
1185000	1186000	It's going to go the way of the glass?
1186000	1197000	I think so. I think it will. Um, well, Jamie, I haven't really heard your thoughts on this and I don't know if you've thought a lot about it, but what do you think of this whole like streaming only sensation?
1197000	1204000	I don't base my judgment off of the initial statements. You know me, that's just not how I work.
1204000	1207000	I want to see the damn game in motion. You want to see the damn game?
1207000	1208000	Exactly.
1208000	1223000	Fair. Honestly, fair. It's fair. Um, I've learned not to judge things on the hype or on other people's opinions just because, you know, how long did I say, Oh, I'm not going to like Mass Effect. I'm not going to like Mass Effect.
1223000	1231000	And what game do I super love? Mass Effect. How long did I go, Oh yeah, this particular thing is going to be really awesome.
1231000	1237000	Everyone says it's going to be great. And then I play it and I'm like, this is kind of shit, you know, but other people love it.
1237000	1245000	I'm, my own opinions can't be affected by what other people are saying about it. I have to experience it for myself.
1245000	1251000	Sure. Now we do know that existing games will be on the platform because you know about Assassin's Creed and all this stuff.
1251000	1258000	So let's say it is something that's up your alley. Like, I don't know, Tekken 7. Just make believe with me here or Tekken 3. Better yet.
1258000	1260000	Which was the best of the series.
1260000	1267000	Let's say, let's say they've got a nice retro collection and you know what? Something like that could win me over in HD.
1267000	1276000	Something like that could win me over in a heartbeat. If Google was like, we have like Stadia retro that has all these Atari classics on demand and PlayStation.
1276000	1280000	I don't, well, obviously it wouldn't have PlayStation, but make believe with me here, classic games on demand.
1280000	1284000	That would, I would kind of go, okay, you got my attention, right?
1284000	1293000	But anyway, that stuff aside, what about just the concept of you're not going to have a cartridge or a disc to play Tekken whatevers.
1293000	1298000	You're going to just go on to Google Chrome and click go and rely on the stream to do it.
1298000	1304000	I also don't want to rely on Chrome. So there's that too. I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.
1304000	1311000	I have one computer that Chrome runs really well on and that is still kind of iffy.
1311000	1318000	I do most of my stuff on a Mac. Chrome kind of doesn't run all that great on a Mac and this I can tell you from the back end of it.
1318000	1324000	It does not run great on a Mac. So I don't want to be tied to a...
1324000	1326000	So you have to see it for yourself on said Mac.
1326000	1333000	Exactly. Exactly. And if anyone wants to talk to me about the back end stuff on it, I'd be happy to talk offline.
1333000	1337000	But it just doesn't, it runs very inefficiently on a Mac.
1337000	1346000	And so I'm afraid that with all of the inefficiencies with running, for example, every tab that you open opens three extra processes on the back end.
1346000	1354000	Which will slow down. So imagine you're running extra tabs or you've got all these processes running and then you're trying to stream on top of it.
1354000	1364000	That to me is looking like a disaster because, again, Google does not program efficiently for this OS.
1364000	1370000	And I'll be perfectly honest, it's not super efficient on a PC either if you look at what runs in your task manager.
1370000	1375000	Okay, I want to read this comment and it's really funny because he just pasted it again to make sure I see it.
1375000	1380000	No, I was going to get to this comment a minute ago but then I ended up on a tangent as sometimes happens.
1380000	1388000	But this is a great comment because I was talking about the industry versus Google. Here's VG Realness' comment in chat.
1388000	1396000	I also think that it's only a matter of time before Microsoft drops the bomb on Game Pass for PC with a massive library.
1396000	1403000	So it will be hard for Google to catch up. Sony could make PlayStation Now available on PC as well to combat this.
1403000	1406000	So it comes down to the available library.
1406000	1410000	Hell yes, and then I'll have all my games in one place. That's what I really want.
1410000	1420000	And yes, that is why I say this is where the industry is going. Not necessarily PC, but maybe, although we know Sony loves their proprietary shit, right?
1420000	1422000	But here's, in my opinion...
1422000	1424000	Oh God, what memory sticks do I have to buy now?
1424000	1432000	In my opinion, expect this shit to be built into the next Xbox and the next PlayStation. Guaranteed.
1433000	1439000	And I'm not saying it's going to be the only thing. I'm not saying it's going to be that they're going to completely walk away from discs.
1439000	1442000	They might. I don't know. We'll find out.
1442000	1447000	And I don't think necessarily PlayStation 5 is Sony's version of Stadia.
1447000	1456000	But you can absolutely expect something like this will probably be a feature, a part, a component of the next consoles.
1456000	1459000	Fuck, we've already heard. Microsoft, haven't they talked before?
1459000	1461000	Correct me if I'm wrong, somebody in chat, somebody in the studio.
1461000	1472000	Hasn't Microsoft already talked about a game that would play on the disc, like a normal game, but it would be enhanced by the cloud, by an internet connection?
1472000	1474000	Yeah, Crackdown 3.
1474000	1477000	Okay, so does it actually do that?
1477000	1487000	Yeah, it does for the multiplayer, and it's alright. They have destruction in the game, but I can't help but think that it looks better even in Battlefield.
1487000	1492000	They've done this like real time destruction stuff in Battlefield, and it's just kind of a pointless game mode.
1492000	1498000	It was supposed to be like, oh, you can destroy any of the buildings in this game, but I don't know.
1498000	1502000	It's just it's kind of not all that great.
1502000	1510000	It's not compelling enough for me to play the multiplayer in there because, yeah, cool, you can break things, but the multiplayer sucks.
1510000	1513000	Like, not the co-op, but like the multiplayer versus sucks.
1513000	1520000	So it's like, I don't give a shit they can break stuff because it's just a boring game. I don't want to play this.
1520000	1531000	Right, right. So, I mean, one other thing we got to get into because this is a very legitimate concern people are having about Google Stadia is the bandwidth situation.
1531000	1537000	What did they say for this? 4K, 60 frames a second was going to be what? 20, 30 gigs?
1537000	1539000	30 gigabytes down.
1539000	1543000	So a lot of us are capped at one terabyte on our Internet.
1543000	1548000	And I kind of tried to get to this on Twitter, and some of the replies I got was, well, my Internet's unlimited.
1548000	1551000	And I'm like, that's great for you, and it is.
1551000	1557000	And Google Stadia will be great for you and your house, but the problem is if you're going to catch on everywhere,
1557000	1561000	which Google's, you know, a big initiative like this needs to catch on everywhere,
1561000	1566000	then we do have to take some things like what is this going to look like for bandwidth caps into consideration?
1566000	1571000	Because I don't know about you guys, but, like, I already use, like, a lot of Internet around here.
1571000	1575000	I mean, shit, we're doing this show right now, right? I stream a lot. Alan streams a lot.
1575000	1578000	You know, and it's just we're almost consuming more and more.
1578000	1586000	I kind of wish Google would use some of their leverage as a powerhouse in tech to kind of force the hand of cable companies to help these data caps go up.
1586000	1592000	I kind of think my gut kind of says these data caps will go up eventually.
1592000	1596000	I think what's going to be well, what's going to end up happening is real quick.
1596000	1602000	They've already gone up. They've got we were just at 250 gigs, not even what, five years ago.
1602000	1607000	So the industry has already bumped this up due to pressure to bump it up to it.
1607000	1609000	So it's not like it can't get bumped up again.
1609000	1614000	But I just feel like this may need to happen a little sooner before Stadia.
1614000	1617000	You know, some people are going to have some real concerns about it. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
1617000	1621000	No, I was just going to say, I don't think that they're going to have bandwidth caps for much longer.
1621000	1625000	Eventually, they'll go through Congress or the FCC and stuff.
1625000	1635000	And we'll eventually, once we capture it, we'll be able to pass legislation to make that stuff unlawful.
1635000	1638000	You know, the whole net neutrality stuff probably pushing that back through again.
1638000	1643000	But I think they're going to have to get rid of it anyways, because eventually it's just going to get faster and faster.
1643000	1647000	And obviously they're keeping it there just as a monetization means.
1647000	1649000	Well, and I've said this on a show before.
1649000	1656000	I think what's going to happen in the next couple of years is that cable is going to have a real competitor in places where there aren't options.
1656000	1662000	Like here in this specific place where I live in the Sacramento area, we only have one option.
1662000	1664000	And I know other people in Sacramento that have more than one option.
1664000	1668000	But unfortunately where I'm at, just one option for internet.
1668000	1673000	But what's going to happen, you know, because I think there's a lot of people in places where there's only one, maybe two choices for internet.
1673000	1678000	What's going to happen, 5G getting adopted more and more and more.
1678000	1681000	And look how fast tech is moving now in just a few years.
1681000	1685000	I think 5G and over air and that is going to be the real competitor to cable.
1685000	1686000	You want to jump in, Jamie?
1686000	1690000	Are they going to use this to push Google Fiber?
1690000	1692000	You would think.
1692000	1695000	Google Fiber has kind of failed in a lot of places, though, because...
1695000	1699000	But they've used this as a promotion point.
1699000	1704000	You would think that Google could use like their own internet and this stuff.
1704000	1707000	But you're right, like wasn't Google supposed to be in every city by now?
1707000	1713000	No, because I was even reading some online today, they're showing like some of the Google Fiber stuff where they were...
1713000	1721000	The plan was to just basically bury it a few inches below the ground and cover it with like asphalt or something like that near roadways or whatever.
1721000	1723000	Just kind of do it faster.
1723000	1727000	Yeah, some folks in chat are saying that Google Fiber is essentially dead.
1727000	1729000	They got... Bobby says they got legislated out.
1729000	1731000	G.G. Rama says they're not expanding it.
1731000	1733000	Yeah, which is too bad.
1733000	1736000	Well, unfortunately, add that to the list of failed Google projects.
1736000	1741000	Well, and we have Verizon 5G in like the middle of Sacramento right now.
1741000	1744000	I just wish it would come out further because I do have Verizon.
1744000	1747000	It will, but Logie, it will eventually.
1747000	1750000	Yeah, but how it wins eventually, 2020, 2021.
1750000	1754000	Think of where our cell phones were at when OLR started.
1754000	1758000	I had that hideous flip phone thing, right?
1758000	1760000	That's what I had. And look how far we've come in this.
1760000	1762000	I mean, granted, we've been doing this show 17 years. It's a while.
1763000	1766000	But we've come all the way from that crappy little flip phone to what?
1766000	1769000	Edge, 3G, 4G, right?
1769000	1774000	So it's just a matter of time before we get to a 5G era where it's everywhere.
1774000	1776000	But you're right. How soon?
1776000	1781000	And is the fact that 5G is not going to be available in X percent of the nation right away,
1781000	1786000	is that going to hinder Stadia's availability?
1786000	1788000	Success rate, I guess.
1789000	1793000	Although, granted, that makes it sound like I'm saying, oh, Stadia is only available on 5G. I'm not.
1793000	1797000	Well, here's the thing. I don't know that all, I think, you know, for other consoles,
1797000	1802000	like for everybody that jump in on this is not necessarily a good idea.
1802000	1809000	May we not, may we forget that not literally a few years ago,
1809000	1813000	everyone was like, you know what's going to be the big thing of the future?
1813000	1815000	3D in your household.
1815000	1818000	It's like it's pictures, but they're coming out of your face.
1818000	1823000	And everyone jumped in full bore in the 3D and where the fuck did that go?
1823000	1824000	Nowhere, because it flopped.
1824000	1825000	Virtual reality.
1825000	1828000	Yeah, but that's virtual reality. That's different.
1828000	1832000	But like when you say 3D, I'm like, it's just that just kind of shifted a little bit.
1832000	1837000	But what I'm saying, though, is like people jump on board like they don't make 3D TVs.
1837000	1840000	Well, I mean, not nearly like they were trying to do like three years ago.
1840000	1845000	Yeah, companies jump on board like with this stuff to try to push this new tech.
1845000	1850000	But like if the infrastructure is not there to support it, it's kind of a waste of time.
1850000	1853000	Maybe just make a nice console and stick with that.
1853000	1856000	Do we really need to be planning for like 20 years in the future?
1856000	1859000	You're going to have like two or three consoles by then.
1859000	1863000	I mean, let's just one step at a time here. Make better games.
1863000	1868000	Anyway, I think what ultimately becomes a Google stadia, you know, I'm interested to try it for myself.
1868000	1871000	But I just, you know, the cost is going to be a big thing.
1871000	1875000	And if they're going to say, oh, you've got to pay a monthly fee and you've got to pay like 30 bucks a game.
1875000	1877000	Or even if you've got to pay like 30 bucks a game.
1877000	1882000	But I don't like, I don't know how I'm going to feel about that when it's like, oh, but I've got to be thinking about my cable bill too.
1882000	1888000	I don't know. I've got to, I think I'm going back to kind of where Jamie's at where like I really have to see it for myself
1888000	1893000	and not in a controlled environment, in a real environment to really be able to make that decision.
1893000	1898000	But if Google's going to make first party games with all stars like Jade Raymond.
1898000	1904000	Who knows what they're capable of making where they might have a game where it's like, shit, I got to play that.
1904000	1910000	Yeah. You know, but I can't like if it's something that I would play as much of as like World of Warcraft.
1910000	1914000	I don't have the frickin bandwidth for that. So that's got to be addressed. I don't know.
1914000	1919000	I'm curious. I'm more curious about some of the things that VG realness was saying.
1919000	1925000	How the rest of the industry is going to respond to it. Because again, I do kind of think this is where industry is going.
1925000	1929000	I do want to address the physical thing real quick and why I didn't call out Nintendo either.
1929000	1936000	So, I think physical, there may still always kind of be a place for that. It's harder to tell with games.
1936000	1944000	Because, you know, you look at music. Music has really shifted to things like Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, right?
1944000	1949000	That's a lot of where music is, is in that streaming area right now. But you could still get a CD.
1949000	1953000	You can still get, I mean, you can't exactly walk into Best Buy and get one anymore.
1953000	1959000	But they're collectibles oftentimes. Not always necessarily in other countries, too, as well.
1959000	1965000	CDs are the predominant way of getting your music instead of streaming like in Japan for real.
1965000	1973000	That's also a damn good point when we talk about things like Stadia is like how adopted is something like Stadia going to be in Brazil?
1973000	1985000	You know? And I pick on that because isn't that the country where things like the Mega Drive and the Genesis were still big years later on?
1985000	1991000	Because the stuff that we might be playing in the States was impossibly high to import in a country like Brazil.
1991000	1996000	So, I'm kind of curious, you know, obviously there's gamers in Brazil. Are they going to be able to play Stadia like this?
1996000	2000000	So, probably, I don't know. But anyway.
2001000	2003000	But it's not coming out in all regions, too.
2003000	2011000	I guess that's true. It's probably not something they're going to target right away. But I guess neither do a lot of gaming companies officially.
2011000	2022000	But anyway, movies. Movies within the past few years have really made a shift to things like Netflix, Hulu, and more to come.
2022000	2031000	We know Apple is likely doing something in the next couple weeks involving streaming. Disney is certainly doing a streaming thing. We know that.
2031000	2036000	And this whole like streaming solution for film, TV, movie, that's just getting bigger and bigger.
2036000	2044000	But it's not like Blu-rays are dead. People still buy them. Why? It's collectibles, right? Or things to watch on the go on an airplane, right?
2044000	2047000	But I can't. When was the last time you brought a Blu-ray? Because I don't remember.
2047000	2055000	I haven't bought a Blu-ray. Well, no. The last Blu-ray I bought was part of a Kickstarter. And I didn't even really need it.
2055000	2062000	It was for Kung Fury. Because like, oh yeah, I want that on Blu-ray so I can watch as much as I want.
2062000	2068000	Come to find out, the Blu-ray got delayed for so long. I've already watched this movie like 80 times online.
2068000	2073000	Oh, hey, there's a Blu-ray now. I'll just put this in a pile of stuff I'm going to forget about.
2073000	2078000	Here's why I don't think the gaming industry will be completely detached from physical games.
2078000	2083000	It's the same reason why I didn't name Nintendo earlier. I don't think they're, why would they do this?
2083000	2087000	I don't think Nintendo has any plans to do anything like this. Why should they?
2087000	2090000	Why try to figure out what the future is when you can just do what works?
2090000	2099000	And Nintendo's big business is portable. Sure, the Switch is docked, but it also makes a lot of bread and butter by the fact that it's portable.
2099000	2106000	And, you know, although maybe soon, maybe in 5, 10 years, we'll be in a 5G world where maybe I'll want to evaluate this statement.
2106000	2111000	I think we all agree that Nintendo would be the last company to move to something like this.
2111000	2116000	And I think Nintendo also underst... You're sitting on a joke over there, I know it.
2116000	2125000	I just, they couldn't even, they can't, they can't even get a storefront working, let alone, you know, game streaming service.
2125000	2129000	Let's, let's, let's not like, let's not scare Nintendo into doing something they're not prepared for.
2129000	2135000	I bought Blaster Master Zero 2, just fine. Their storefront's fine. Anyway, here's the thing.
2135000	2142000	When Nintendo, and I think Nintendo understands the value of IP, their collectibles, their characters,
2142000	2147000	where I think, you know, a lot of the movies and music industry kind of make their money right now,
2147000	2152000	selling shirts, selling posters, selling collectibles, and even the game industry is kind of moving in that direction,
2152000	2155000	which I talked a little bit on Bobby's show at the end, in the call, like if you go to a Target,
2155000	2161000	you start finding loot boxes for games that don't have the game in them, it's just a bunch of, like, collectibles.
2161000	2166000	But anyway, I think Nintendo can still hang on to that stuff for a long time.
2166000	2172000	So I just feel like, I think we all have a general understanding that Nintendo would be the last company to adopt something like this,
2172000	2178000	and I don't think they would be in any rush to do so, and why should they?
2179000	2186000	They're not, because they're successful, and I think it's just these other companies that are gonna try to figure out what the next big thing is,
2186000	2191000	and I don't think we even know, they're just pushing it, they're just trying to tell you this is what the next thing is,
2191000	2198000	but we don't know until we get there, because, I don't know. Well, let's just see what happens, okay?
2198000	2205000	Let's see how well the service runs, and what's even available in it, because if it sucks, then it's gonna fail.
2205000	2207000	That's what it's just gonna be.
2207000	2215000	Let's see, other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwell says, I buy 4K Blu-rays because you can't rent them via Netflix DVD or Redbox.
2215000	2223000	And I know that, I know that, like, Netflix does some 4K, but it's kind of limited, right?
2223000	2227000	Like, their originals are all in 4K, but usually the stuff that's, like, licensed on Netflix, not a lot of that is in 4K.
2227000	2234000	I can never tell because it usually upscales some of that stuff on my TV, so, like, I can't really tell sometimes if it's in 4K,
2234000	2248000	if it's just 1080. But, yeah, I mean, 4K looks nice. I wish I would, see, I would get the Ultra 4K stuff for watching them on my TV,
2248000	2255000	but, oh darn, that PlayStation Pro, it doesn't play 4K content via the Blu-ray drive. Thanks, Sony!
2255000	2258000	Thank you, Sony, I appreciate that so much.
2259000	2264000	But we also know that this conversation about the future of gaming is not going to be had on the PlayStation 4.
2264000	2273000	The PlayStation 4 is kind of in its, I don't want to say it's sunsetting, but it's in its, we all know that the PlayStation 5 is on the horizon.
2273000	2278000	It's more like, more like the sun is rising on PlayStation 5, it's just a matter of time.
2278000	2285000	And this is where we'll have these conversations, but the PlayStation 4 is not where these conversations are going to be had. Anyway.
2285000	2295000	Or where I could just get an Xbox, you know, 1S, and a 1S, not the X, but the S, and that can do that shit just fine.
2295000	2301000	Oh, but Sony, fuck them, they just wanted to save some money on that Blu-ray drive.
2302000	2310000	Dartatia in chat says, I was just telling someone on Twitter, that's why I love Nintendo, they don't really do any of the loot boxes slash microtransactions stuff.
2310000	2317000	They did do some DLC, but at least it's always been good. And how long did it take Nintendo to finally come to the table with DLC?
2317000	2320000	But, but you're right, it's all been very good.
2320000	2326000	But that's the thing though, they're like 10 years behind in trends as far as online goes.
2326000	2332000	Remember back when we used to get decent expansion packs and DLC for games?
2332000	2340000	We used to have that, but now we have this bullshit. Just give them 10 years and they'll be in straight in bullshit again.
2340000	2350000	I feel like though, we live in an industry that will forgive Nintendo time and time again because Nintendo makes those IPs you gotta have.
2350000	2355000	It's kind of like Disney coming to the table really late on streaming.
2355000	2359000	We all still know it's going to be a big fucking deal because it's Disney, right?
2359000	2364000	And they got the Star Wars and they got their, what they just said, all of their classics.
2364000	2369000	There is no longer a Disney vault because all of their classics will be on the streaming thing and that whole thing.
2369000	2379000	That's a big deal. So even though it took Disney forever to come to this table, compared to Netflix and Hulu and so forth, the industry's kind of ready for it.
2379000	2385000	And I think in some ways a lot of those same rules apply to Nintendo. They can get away with it for a long time.
2385000	2396000	The only time I think Nintendo didn't get away with it was when they made a huge mistake of naming one of their consoles something as atrocious as Wii U and not being able to explain that to their audience.
2396000	2402000	And I'm telling, I will still stand by that. The Wii U failed because of its name. Period.
2402000	2420000	Yeah, sure. On that note, we'll move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week, whether it was on the Wii U or not.
2420000	2422000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
2422000	2432000	It was pretty good. Of course, some of my gaming week did include the GDCN party. And so what I played, I finally found the...
2432000	2435000	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Back up. Because you actually went to GDC, sort of.
2435000	2439000	Not into the convention, but I went to the party. Just two of the parties.
2439000	2440000	Just for some networking.
2440000	2444000	You were in the area. How was that? Tell us a little bit about your experience there.
2444000	2455000	Well, the Unowns were G, D, and C for Pokemon Go. I didn't catch a C, but I caught another D and another G because OG, I got the D.
2455000	2457000	Well, you know what's sad is that I would have...
2457000	2459000	This is not sitting properly on my head.
2459000	2461000	You got a lot of compliments on the hat in chat, though.
2461000	2462000	Thank you. Target.
2462000	2471000	The problem with GDC, guess what? Guess what letters I already have? DragonCon. So, D-R-A-G-O-N-C. I have all the letters already because of DragonCon.
2471000	2473000	I need another C, then.
2473000	2480000	I can trade you a C. I've got Unown out the Unown right now, okay? I'll trade you one. It's fine.
2480000	2490000	But at any rate, the Unparty was okay. The whole thing was supposed to be a quiet thing, and so they would have this wave go through it.
2490000	2495000	It would get quiet for two seconds and it would be unbearably loud because it was in a freaking warehouse.
2495000	2502000	So, I mean, I had a good time. It was really nice. And they got us pizza. I haven't had Papa John's since I was in college.
2503000	2504000	Pizza's awesome.
2504000	2506000	Even Papa John's pizza's okay.
2506000	2508000	But he's not the CEO anymore, so...
2508000	2512000	I don't know if that's... All that stuff aside, which I really...
2512000	2514000	I'm not gonna say no to free pizza.
2514000	2517000	I can't follow that anymore, but that's not exactly the pizza chain I get up and cheer for.
2517000	2522000	But they said, there's gonna be tea, and it was bring your own tea. So there was hot water.
2522000	2526000	It was nice. It was a good place. I'm not complaining.
2526000	2531000	Instead, Dark Soccer walked up and said, okay, well let's talk some shit. You wanna talk some shit? Let's talk some shit.
2531000	2537000	No. But anyway, there were... I saw two games there that were on demo.
2537000	2542000	And one of them was called Hyperdot, which if you go to hyperdotgame.com, you can see.
2542000	2545000	And really the point is to dodge everything.
2545000	2549000	You have a hundred trials that you go through in your campaign mode and you have to...
2549000	2555000	There's even a multiplayer mode. And you can do custom challenges, but basically you're a little green dot avoiding all these blocks.
2556000	2564000	And I don't know, maybe it got a little bit of inspiration from Undertale, maybe? The boss battles in Undertale.
2564000	2572000	But at any rate, it is a neat little game. It actually reminded me of that game I love, Fractal, in just it's style.
2572000	2575000	So, really neat. Check it out, guys.
2575000	2583000	And then I spoke to the guy who's behind Zephyr Fox Games.
2583000	2589000	And I'm so sad. I have his name on a business card and I left the business card at home.
2589000	2598000	But he actually is local. So I said we should... I talked to him about getting him in that spot so he can hide Pikachu.
2598000	2603000	He's a really cool guy, too. But he's working on a game actually in Unity called Space Uber.
2604000	2613000	And he actually showed me two different demos. And one of them is going in in your spaceship and fixing it up and hacking into stuff on it.
2613000	2621000	And then the other one is actually where you pick up passengers in space, but at the same time you have to dodge mines in space.
2621000	2629000	He said as you go later on, you can pick up other vehicles like you find in space.
2629000	2635000	You have to hack into them or you find different creative ways to get the machine started, to get the ship started.
2635000	2640000	I just remembered it because the name of his ship in the demo was the Lopey Bovine.
2640000	2643000	And it was just really, really kind of funny.
2643000	2650000	But I did take some video of it and once I get it edited down we can do it during a mid-break thing.
2650000	2653000	But it was a really neat little game.
2653000	2662000	And actually if you go to zephyrfoxgames.com, his most recent update on March 5th actually shows some of the gameplay of Space Uber.
2662000	2665000	And it's just a neat little game.
2667000	2670000	For me now, I will warn you, it made me super motion sick.
2670000	2674000	I could not play or control it because my motion sickness got way set off.
2674000	2676000	But the guy next to me had no problem with it.
2676000	2679000	So everyone knows I got crazy motion sickness.
2679000	2685000	When I told him that I couldn't play Goldeneye, he's like, oh.
2685000	2688000	So it was like that.
2688000	2694000	But it's a really, really, and he's doing it in Unity and he's done some amazing stuff with it already.
2694000	2697000	So I'd say check both of them out.
2697000	2702000	So zephyrfoxgames.
2702000	2705000	And then the other one was hyper.game.com.
2705000	2707000	Alright, well I'm sure they appreciate those plugs.
2707000	2712000	And I play a lot of pinball, like I do.
2712000	2715000	I'm playing Pokemon Go. I played Ingress.
2715000	2718000	I used up all my stupid bursters at work, thinking I could take it down.
2718000	2721000	Now I have no bursters. Thanks, Rob.
2721000	2723000	Why are you thanking me?
2723000	2724000	Because you should give me more bursters.
2724000	2727000	I'll give you more bursters. It's fine. I got a ton of them yesterday, so it's fine.
2727000	2734000	At any rate, I'm also still playing idle pouring because of stupid, addictive reasons.
2735000	2737000	And I started playing Pocket Camp again.
2737000	2740000	Which reminds me, I should probably open up Pocket Camp and get stuff.
2740000	2743000	But I didn't do it yesterday, so whatever.
2743000	2748000	Well then, while you do that, we'll go on over to Loki and check out Loki's gaming week.
2748000	2754000	I didn't play a whole lot this week. I mainly played just Pokemon Go while I'm doing other things.
2754000	2759000	Because I always turn it on so that it automatically plays while I'm out and about.
2759000	2761000	So that's what I did.
2761000	2764000	I played that, and then I played a little...
2766000	2769000	Was it H2 Overdrive?
2769000	2771000	Arcade, the Hydro Thunder.
2771000	2773000	Yeah, H2 Overdrive is a sequel.
2773000	2775000	So we played a little bit of that today.
2777000	2779000	Yeah, that's about it, unfortunately.
2779000	2781000	Didn't get to play a lot.
2781000	2783000	Oh, a little bit of DDR.
2783000	2786000	But I didn't stream a ton of it.
2786000	2789000	I'm probably going to try to stream some more this week, though.
2789000	2792000	I wanted to stream a lot more last week.
2792000	2795000	But it just didn't work out because I have to cook things.
2795000	2797000	And I always have to cook things when I get home.
2797000	2799000	But this week, I didn't prepare for crap.
2799000	2802000	So I don't have any meals to cook this week.
2802000	2804000	So it'll be perfect.
2804000	2806000	Alright, so look forward to that on your Twitch channel.
2806000	2807000	Yes.
2807000	2810000	My gaming week actually was not a lot of...
2810000	2812000	I didn't really get into new stuff.
2812000	2814000	So here's the weird thing about gaming week.
2814000	2816000	I still was playing quite a bit of Pokemon Go.
2816000	2820000	I feel like we're like the Pokemon Go talk channel or whatever.
2820000	2824000	But I did play a bit for Community Day.
2824000	2826000	Because Community Day was yesterday.
2826000	2827000	Yeah, 3 to 6.
2827000	2828000	Yeah, it was 3 to 6.
2828000	2832000	Well, the funny thing was, OK, so that morning I was playing Ingress
2832000	2836000	because there was things that we were getting together and doing in Ingress.
2836000	2838000	That's all I'm really going to say about that. We were having fun.
2838000	2840000	A social event, we'll say that.
2840000	2844000	And then with Pokemon Go in the afternoon,
2844000	2846000	I kind of went right into that.
2846000	2850000	And so we went downtown, and by that point I was already kind of sick of staring at my phone.
2850000	2852000	So I was like, alright, I'll just kind of play.
2852000	2856000	So the very first Trico I tapped on, Shiny.
2856000	2859000	And then we get to the park, get another Shiny pretty quick in about five minutes.
2859000	2861000	I get a third Shiny by the time we walk over to the Rose Garden.
2861000	2863000	So we're 15 minutes in, I have three Shinies.
2863000	2865000	So I was like, alright, I got what I need.
2865000	2868000	So I kind of closed my phone, put it in my pocket, and I turned on my Bluetooth catcher.
2868000	2871000	And I was just like, I'm just going to catch a Bluetooth, whatever.
2871000	2873000	So we just kind of, we walked around.
2873000	2877000	I was more into the walking, I've been trying to get more in tune with fitness and things like that lately.
2877000	2882000	So I was more into the walking, and seeing what Alan was up to, and cheering him on, and so forth.
2882000	2887000	By the time it was done, and we really, we kind of went to go eat at one point.
2887000	2890000	We just really took it easy, even though we were still down in the capital.
2890000	2893000	We went to, you know, it's kind of where we always go is the capital park.
2893000	2895000	I had 11 Shinies by the time it was done.
2895000	2897000	I had none.
2897000	2899000	What? I'll give you one.
2899000	2901000	I don't care.
2901000	2903000	Loki, I have 11. Take a goddamn Shiny.
2903000	2904000	Fine.
2904000	2905000	Alright.
2905000	2906000	Shiny what?
2906000	2907000	Trico.
2907000	2908000	I'll take one.
2908000	2909000	Okay, there you go.
2909000	2911000	If you don't take it, I can do one a day, because they're special trades.
2911000	2913000	So yeah, so I have like 11.
2913000	2914000	What am I going to do with that many?
2914000	2915000	I don't know.
2915000	2916000	Recycle them.
2916000	2919000	I'll give, yes, obviously other people don't have such great luck.
2919000	2922000	But I always say that's what, like, I have a million Cyndaquil.
2922000	2924000	I have a million, you know, some of the others.
2924000	2926000	Now some I didn't get so lucky on.
2926000	2928000	Like Charmander, I only have like the three.
2928000	2933000	Bulbasaur, I was out of town when that happened, so I'm only, I only have two, so I don't really have enough of those.
2933000	2936000	But you know, some of them I just barely skip by with three or four.
2936000	2938000	But like, yeah, what am I going to do with 11 Shinies?
2938000	2940000	And I always say, I'll trade the extra ones.
2940000	2943000	And it's like, I never, it's like all those unknowns I'm sitting on.
2943000	2948000	Never, I think being limited to one special trade a day kind of sucks.
2948000	2951000	Because I can't really unload those as fast as I want to.
2951000	2952000	So, anyway.
2953000	2956000	Pat Deft asks, how many did Shane get?
2956000	2962000	I don't know, sometimes he's, sometimes he's listening or watching, so if he's out there maybe he'll reveal himself and tell you.
2962000	2964000	It was more than me.
2964000	2969000	I think he said his husband got 12, and I think he said he got 15?
2969000	2971000	He'll correct me if I'm wrong.
2971000	2972000	But, yeah.
2972000	2974000	So anyway, but here's the other thing.
2974000	2977000	So I did play a console, here's the crazy thing.
2977000	2980000	So you know I kind of got into Skyrim VR last week.
2980000	2982000	So I played a little more of that.
2982000	2983000	Yeah.
2983000	2989000	And then I got to the point where I'm like, okay, this is fun and all, but I'm like, I don't, I don't know if I want to keep playing this in VR.
2989000	2995000	I want to go back to the PC. You know, I haven't seen Skyrim on the PC in a long time, and I have a 4K monitor now.
2995000	3000000	And I don't even have the Skyrim Special Edition, but I got like an HD texture pack at some point, I don't know.
3000000	3002000	So I started playing Skyrim on the PC again.
3002000	3009000	Well, the Special Edition, I think, didn't they give that to you for free if you had bought it?
3009000	3011000	If you had all the expansions, which I didn't.
3011000	3012000	Oh, yeah.
3012000	3016000	No, they didn't give it to me for free. They gave it to Alan for free because he had all the expansions, but he had already played it a lot more.
3016000	3025000	So I spent a lot of gaming time this week playing Skyrim, because I'll tell you what, in 4K, even on the regular version.
3025000	3029000	Yeah, I don't play the HD version either because half the mods don't have them.
3029000	3033000	Well, it's not, well, it's not, yeah, I do use mods, especially like inventory mods.
3033000	3035000	Very, I don't, I don't mod heavy it like you do.
3035000	3045000	But like, I do run a few mods in the old one, but I also feel like maybe because it wasn't like optimized for like HD, I can actually play it in 4K.
3045000	3050000	Because a lot of games, my video card isn't strong enough to actually support full 4K gameplay.
3050000	3053000	But Skyrim is great and it's gorgeous.
3053000	3056000	And so I've just been playing it on PC, like, ooh.
3056000	3063000	So I got, you know, enough through the story where what I got to, well, I don't want to spoil the whole thing, but you know, there's dragons.
3063000	3068000	So I fought the dragon, I got Lydia, and doing that thing where I got to go up to the top of the mountain. That's where I'm at right now.
3068000	3072000	So I played a little bit. And then, of course, as I'm going up to the mountain, what happens?
3072000	3077000	Ooh, cave! Ooh, giant! Ooh! You get distracted with everything.
3077000	3081000	And that's, that's the Elder Scrolls experience, basically. So, yeah.
3081000	3083000	Now we're in Blackreach.
3083000	3090000	I've been spending a lot of my gaming week playing a game that's eight years old, but whatever, right?
3090000	3093000	Skyrim was 2011, right? Oh, it's kind of a...
3093000	3096000	It speaks to the longevity of the game design.
3096000	3101000	Oh, no, for sure. For sure. I mean, hell, Skyrim just came out on Switch, what, a year ago?
3101000	3105000	So, I mean, you know, there's still, there's still a lot of longevity in that game.
3105000	3107000	But I am definitely looking forward to Elder Scrolls VI as well, that's for sure.
3107000	3112000	So, anyway, that was my Game of Week. Mobile phone games in Skyrim.
3112000	3115000	All right, we're going to get into some gaming news here.
3115000	3118000	Let me just quickly say, though, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
3118000	3122000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3122000	3127000	And, yeah, the next show we will not be here is Memorial Day weekend, but that's a long ways off.
3127000	3131000	So, let's talk about some gaming news for now. Loki.
3131000	3141000	So, they had this Nindies Nintendo Direct this week, and they announced a bunch of games that are coming out on the Switch.
3141000	3145000	And some even were released that same day because that's something that they like to do.
3145000	3155000	So, starting in order of when they're coming out, Blaster Master Zero part two, or number two, is coming out.
3155000	3159000	Well, came out earlier, and I guess we'll see some of that later.
3159000	3161000	Yes, we're going to see some of that later in our break.
3161000	3170000	There's, was it Nuclear Throne is coming to the Switch, so that was also released as well.
3171000	3182000	And then, in a few months here, they're going to be releasing Cuphead on the Switch, which was kind of interesting because that was pushed by Microsoft to try to put that there.
3182000	3189000	So, that's April 18th. Katana Zero is coming April 18th. I think that's from Devolver Digital.
3189000	3200000	And there's some more Vlambeer games, so Super Crate Box also coming out in April, and Ultra Bugs is another thing that they have coming out.
3200000	3206000	There's a game called Darkwood, which is also coming to the Switch in May.
3206000	3213000	My friend Pedro is also coming out in June.
3213000	3219000	And then, they have this one, which was kind of a release surprise here.
3219000	3227000	So, from the makers of Crypt of the Necrodancer, they have a game called Cadence of Hyrule.
3227000	3228000	Cadence, I think.
3228000	3229000	The musical term, yes.
3229000	3234000	Cadence of Hyrule, and it's basically Crypt of the Necrodancer in Hyrule.
3234000	3239000	It looks like a mod for Crypt of the Necrodancer is what it looks like, but it's not a slam.
3239000	3244000	I think a lot of people were like, whoa, cool. And yeah, I'm into it too.
3244000	3249000	One of the games they have, Neo Cab, which is going to be coming out this summer.
3249000	3255000	There's this game from Double Fine called Rad. It's an isometric 3D action RPG.
3255000	3260000	And then, they've got a game called Swim Sanity.
3260000	3267000	Bloodroots, Creature in the Well, which looked kind of cool.
3267000	3271000	This was a game that was like a pinball action game.
3271000	3275000	So, the whole game is played like pinball almost, but it looked pretty cool.
3275000	3281000	They have the Stranger Things retro game that's coming out on July 4th, the same time as season 3,
3281000	3283000	which we've got a trailer for this week as well.
3283000	3289000	Pine, Overland, and a game called The Red Lantern,
3289000	3296000	which is about a woman getting stranded in Alaska with her sled dogs.
3296000	3298000	Did you mention Cuphead?
3298000	3299000	Yes.
3299000	3302000	Okay, I must have missed when you brought that up. Okay, that Cuphead thing.
3302000	3306000	Okay, hold up though, because Cuphead, I mean, that's obviously, you know,
3306000	3308000	that's a game that's going to be great for the Switch,
3308000	3315000	but it also means that a lot of those Microsoft Nintendo things that have been rumors in previous episodes,
3315000	3319000	hold up, it's happening.gif, right?
3319000	3321000	Because Cuphead is coming to the Switch,
3321000	3327000	which may indicate that some of these other things we've been hearing about could happen as well,
3327000	3332000	namely Ori and the Blind Forest and some of these other Microsoft things,
3332000	3335000	which is funny because I saw people on Twitter going,
3335000	3337000	I predict that Ori and the Blind Forest is next.
3337000	3340000	I'm like, yeah, because that's what all the rumors already said. Hello?
3340000	3342000	But anyway, whatever.
3342000	3349000	And the fact that maybe Xbox Game Pass, which that was kind of the big warning.
3349000	3353000	I don't know how that would work though, but like, how does Hulu work?
3353000	3356000	You know, I don't know. We'll see.
3356000	3358000	But that's a little different. They're running on the actual hardware.
3358000	3361000	Yeah, you're not going to be dealt, but I mean, maybe like a streaming, like, you know.
3361000	3364000	Yeah, whenever they talk about their streaming thing, which we still haven't heard about,
3364000	3366000	and maybe we'll hear about later this year. Who knows?
3366000	3370000	VG Realness in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says the budding
3370000	3376000	Microsoft Nintendo relationship is very interesting in it,
3376000	3379000	which is also kind of goes back to what we were talking about earlier about,
3379000	3381000	you know, the future of gaming is that maybe.
3381000	3384000	Oh, my God. My God. What did they join forces?
3384000	3387000	You got Microsoft with the back with the the tech.
3387000	3391000	You've got Nintendo with the games. They could defeat everybody.
3391000	3395000	I think there's a lot of fan wank that comes into situations like that.
3395000	3399000	I mean, both of them are still in it to make profit, you know, for themselves.
3399000	3403000	I don't think we're in a you know, when people say Microsoft should just buy Nintendo,
3403000	3407000	they forget how much money Nintendo has and they end up buying them.
3407000	3411000	They just team up. Yeah. I mean, a team up could be interesting,
3411000	3417000	but I just I don't I don't know how far that goes and where what.
3417000	3421000	I mean, I guess Nintendo gets, you know, some more things on their switch platform
3421000	3424000	and maybe Microsoft has an agreement. They're not going to address the portable market.
3424000	3428000	And that's not something they're going into with, you know, the next Xbox.
3428000	3433000	Nintendo probably knows. And this is this is fascinating to think about.
3433000	3441000	Nintendo probably knows exactly what the next Xbox is for a lot of this to happen.
3441000	3445000	If we're going to go this far, I mean, Cuphead on Switch is one thing.
3445000	3450000	But if we're going to go this far down to talking about, you know, a true like alliance
3450000	3454000	or whatever to dominate the gaming industry, if that's really where we're headed,
3454000	3458000	then wouldn't it be logical to know that Nintendo already knows what Microsoft's working on?
3458000	3462000	And for them to agree to this, they know it's not portable.
3462000	3465000	And it's not something that's going to step on the toes of the switch.
3465000	3473000	Microsoft. Microsoft is not going to come out with an Xbox that pops off a dock and you can take with you.
3473000	3477000	Nintendo would never have agreed to this whole thing if that's what Microsoft's doing.
3477000	3481000	We'll see. Oh, it's kind of, I don't know, interesting to me.
3481000	3489000	S.H.A. 100 Matt points out this is messing with everyone's Apple and Nintendo fan fix that people have been writing for decades.
3489000	3492000	It's in that same vein. It certainly is.
3492000	3498000	Renji two to one in chat says something that wasn't brought up is Castle Crashers remastered on the switch.
3498000	3504000	That was the thing right out of this week. But that was also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.
3504000	3509000	And it's also like, with all respect to Castle Crashers, that game's pretty old at this point.
3509000	3514000	I mean, I say that and then I talk about how I played Skyrim all week.
3514000	3516000	So, you know, an old game is still a good game.
3516000	3523000	But I was just kind of like, I think I would have been more excited if it was a Castle Crashers sequel that was coming out to all these platforms.
3523000	3530000	And maybe the first game with it or something, you know, just the fact that it's, oh, it's that same game again.
3530000	3536000	And I'm not as excited about, but it's not like it was a bad game. So there is that for sure.
3536000	3542000	Let's see. V.G. Realness says both companies have what the other needs.
3542000	3550000	Nintendo needs better hardware and network infrastructure. Microsoft needs stronger Japanese presence. Interesting.
3550000	3554000	That's true. You know, we didn't bring up the Japanese presence part.
3554000	3559000	But that is a very good way for Microsoft to shove their foot in the door in Japan is the Nintendo partnership.
3560000	3567000	Fifth Dream Today says people still think Microsoft will make a handheld. People think a lot of things. Go onto Reddit or Twitter.
3567000	3573000	It's still out there, of course. So anyway, we will see what develops.
3573000	3576000	So what did you think, though, quickly before I move on to the next story?
3576000	3579000	Was there any of those Nindies that really jumped out at you where you're like, oh, I got to get this?
3579000	3586000	Blaster Master Zero 2 looks good. I still haven't played through Blaster Master Zero, the first one.
3586000	3592000	I have it. I purchased it, but I haven't played through it. So I need to probably do that.
3595000	3600000	No, that's about it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really want to play through Cuphead again.
3600000	3607000	I might pick up Cuphead because I'm just it's such a good game and I might be a sucker for it, especially with the portability and all that.
3607000	3611000	Is your play through video? Was it that old school musical yet?
3611000	3615000	You know what? No, I didn't pick that up. I really should know. You're right.
3615000	3620000	So many so many games I need to catch up on. Yet here I am playing Skyrim from how long ago?
3620000	3624000	I don't know. All right. It'll keep sucking you back in for hundreds of hours at a time.
3624000	3634000	And that's money well spent, though. All right. Let's get into our next story, which has to do with a rumor from the past that's kind of come true,
3634000	3638000	because this is one of those rumors based on ratings in another country.
3638000	3641000	And sure enough, those are usually the ones where it's like, yeah, this is going to happen.
3641000	3650000	So Konami put out information this week that they are in celebration of their 50th anniversary doing some different collections.
3650000	3655000	And the first one is the Konami Anniversary Collection Arcade Classics.
3655000	3661000	So it's going to have eight arcade masterpieces, according to the list, from the 1980s.
3661000	3664000	So here's what's in Konami's collection.
3664000	3668000	They've announced the list here because this is out on April 18th, which is a pretty big deal.
3668000	3672000	And this is coming out on all the platforms. Right.
3672000	3677000	I missed it. It's Switch for sure. Right. Was it PS4 and Xbox One as well?
3677000	3680000	It's got to be. But it's digital. Right. Because it's like 20 bucks. Right.
3680000	3683000	I'm pretty sure it's on all the all the major gaming platforms.
3683000	3686000	Yeah. It's PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.
3686000	3688000	OK, great. Oh, PC as well. Cool. All right.
3688000	3698000	All right. So anyway, in the arcade classics, Haunted Castle, which, if I'm not mistaken, was like Castlevania's kind of first game.
3698000	3701000	Right. It was Haunted Castle. Probably an arcade game.
3701000	3704000	Yeah, it was. Or was it or am I mixing it up with Vampire Killer?
3704000	3706000	No, Haunted Castle was Castlevania.
3706000	3712000	OK. All right. Let's see. Typhoon or Ajax, which that one's not ringing a bell.
3712000	3714000	I don't remember that one. Is that one that you recognized?
3715000	3720000	Typhoon. No, she's just shaking. No, Nemesis or Nemesis.
3720000	3727000	Yeah, well, of course, Nemesis is basically Gradius, Vulcan Venture, Gradius 2, Life Force or Salamander.
3727000	3733000	That one has me excited for sure. Thunder Cross, Scramble and Twinbee.
3733000	3737000	So those are the games that are going to be in the arcade collection, which is that's kind of neat.
3737000	3741000	So. Oh, thank you, Dark Tetsuya. That's why it's throwing me off.
3741000	3745000	Haunted Castle was the arcade. Vampire Killer was the MSX version.
3745000	3748000	OK, thank you. All right.
3748000	3754000	Now, speaking of Vampire Killer and Castlevania, the other collection they announced, one of the other two,
3754000	3759000	was a Castlevania anniversary collection for early summer 2019.
3759000	3763000	There will be eight games in this collection, two. We only know four of them.
3763000	3770000	The original Castlevania for NES, Castlevania 3, Castlevania 2, Belmont's Revenge.
3770000	3777000	That's the Game Boy one, not Simon's Quest, which is notably missing, at least so far,
3777000	3780000	because there's also four games we don't know yet.
3780000	3783000	And then Super Castlevania 4 is the other entry here.
3783000	3786000	We don't know what the other four games are. We don't know if it's Simon Quest.
3786000	3791000	We don't know if it's, you know, Symphony of the Night or some of the 3DS games or what.
3791000	3794000	So it's to be determined still on what that could contain.
3794000	3797000	But that could be interesting, especially for 20 bucks.
3797000	3801000	And then lastly, a Contra anniversary collection.
3801000	3804000	Now, I would think there's only so many games they can pick from for this,
3804000	3809000	because I don't think Contra's had as many games as Castlevania. Really?
3809000	3811000	All right. If you say so.
3811000	3813000	And some weren't even Contras originally.
3813000	3815000	Maybe that's what it is.
3815000	3819000	And it's one of those things where it's like these games that were kind of like derivatives of Contra
3819000	3821000	are probably going to be included.
3821000	3826000	But the original list is Contra, the arcade version, not the NES version.
3826000	3828000	They really are the same thing.
3828000	3831000	It's just the arcade version didn't have the 30 lives code.
3831000	3834000	But I think Konami would be stupid not to put a throwback
3834000	3839000	where you would just unlock 30 lives in the arcade version by putting in the Konami code.
3839000	3842000	Super Contra, also the arcade version.
3842000	3845000	Super C, which was the 1990 NES one.
3845000	3850000	And then Contra 3, the Alien Wars, the pretty sweet Super Nintendo version of the game.
3850000	3854000	Those are the four that they've announced for the Contra collection.
3854000	3856000	So again, four more to be determined.
3856000	3859000	We have noticed the lack of Contra hardcore in all the Genesis ones.
3859000	3864000	So far, but they could be some of the Secret Four that are in there.
3864000	3866000	So we'll see.
3866000	3868000	But what do you guys think so far?
3868000	3872000	I mean, I know Konami's gotten a lot of shit lately and rightfully so,
3872000	3874000	but as far as like retro throwbacks and so forth,
3874000	3877000	this seems like I think what a lot of people would be interested in.
3877000	3881000	I know I'm probably going to be a sucker for that Castlevania collection, that's for sure.
3881000	3884000	I wish the arcade collection, some of those...
3884000	3887000	I mean, I might get it just for Gradius and Life Force, honestly.
3887000	3893000	Where's my throwback Bomani arcade collection?
3893000	3895000	It's doing a presidential move.
3895000	3899000	Distracting us from the real issues with, you know, little tidbits.
3899000	3904000	Yes. But, well, I mean, if these sell well, maybe there will be more.
3904000	3907000	You know, like Beatmania, popin' music.
3907000	3910000	Do you know how much I would love like a five-key Beatmania collection,
3910000	3916000	but also I just feel like it's so niche that like we're asking for it.
3916000	3919000	Some of our listeners that date, you know, to the music game days
3919000	3921000	and our fans and that stuff are asking for it too.
3921000	3923000	Put it only on PC.
3923000	3925000	Enough people asking for it? I don't know.
3925000	3928000	I would love it, but I just don't, I don't, I don't totally see it happening,
3928000	3930000	but we'll see. You never know. You never know.
3930000	3932000	I have a collection.
3932000	3937000	Tiger Claw and Chat says what this Konami collection needs
3937000	3942000	is the two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games and Simpsons and Sunset Riders.
3942000	3945000	I only need the arcade ones for sure.
3945000	3949000	Well, Ninja Turtles and Simpsons, that's going to be very hard
3949000	3952000	with the licensing and all that stuff.
3952000	3955000	So that's why those got pulled off of the other digital storefronts.
3955000	3960000	Right. But Sunset Riders is certainly a realistic prediction for maybe the future.
3960000	3964000	Like if, if a second collection is released, but, uh, yeah, we'll, we'll see.
3965000	3968000	Honestly, for 20 bucks, I'll probably pick it up,
3968000	3970000	but I love that it's on PC as well.
3970000	3973000	But then, oh, do I get it on PC because it's where I play a lot of stuff
3973000	3975000	and like have really good graphics and all that,
3975000	3977000	or do I get it on Switch so I can be portable?
3977000	3979000	Ah, the struggle.
3979000	3981000	I don't know what to do.
3981000	3983000	All right. Wait for the sales.
3983000	3985000	Yeah, I guess, I guess. All right, let's move on.
3985000	3987000	Uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
3987000	3992000	Well, I have some news about Mortal Kombat 11, which I think is pretty neat.
3992000	3997000	Um, but basically, now we all know what a beautiful thing the original Mortal Kombat movie was.
3997000	4000000	It was one of the first video game movies done right.
4000000	4004000	Well, um, the guy who played Shang Tsung, who is, uh,
4004000	4010000	Kari, uh, Hiroyuki Tagawa, um, is coming into Mortal Kombat 11
4010000	4013000	and lending his likeness to Shang Tsung in the game.
4013000	4017000	And he will be the first character to be downloadable content for the game.
4017000	4022000	He's also the, uh, guide for the Crypt, Mortal Kombat 11's campaign style mode
4022000	4025000	that gives you challenges and unlockables.
4025000	4031000	Um, also, um, when he was unveiled, it was our first look at the Crypt
4031000	4034000	at Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo, C2E2.
4034000	4038000	Um, there actually is a clip of that out and about.
4038000	4042000	Also, there's a confirmation of a return of Noob Saibot.
4043000	4048000	And I think in the Noob Saibot clip, there was also Jackie was in there as well.
4048000	4052000	Oh no, there was Kotal Kahn. There was like a separate, I think a separate thing. But anyway.
4052000	4056000	But yeah, but there's some cool stuff. I mean, we're getting some of our little classics back.
4056000	4060000	Allen always makes it a point. You know Allen really likes Mortal Kombat games, right?
4060000	4062000	And you all know where I'm at with these.
4062000	4065000	Where it's like, I love the old Mortal Kombat games with the new ones.
4065000	4068000	They're, they're like kind of like ultra violent for me. I don't know. It's a bit much.
4068000	4072000	I kind of prefer Injustice as far as like the NetherRealm games go.
4072000	4079000	But, um, Allen makes it a point when they go, when like, oh, look, uh, there's a Noob Saibot Fatality.
4079000	4081000	You want to see it? You should see it. Let's see.
4081000	4083000	And it holds the phone in front of my face. So I have to watch it.
4083000	4088000	And I'm just like, this is, this is, y'all, y'all.
4088000	4089000	You've turned into your mom.
4089000	4095000	I know I have. It's crazy. But seriously, like, did you see that Noob Saibot Fatality?
4095000	4097000	What the hell? That's, who thinks of that?
4097000	4100000	I don't think I saw it. Ew. Anyway.
4100000	4102000	So what was it in graphic detail?
4102000	4110000	I don't know. He fricking like pulls out the intestines and then like uses that to like go inside the body and then like jump out of the mouth.
4110000	4113000	Like his hands like go to the mouth and like rips the head. It was disgusting.
4114000	4115000	And then it's also impossible.
4115000	4117000	Does he go happy birthday?
4118000	4119000	At the end?
4119000	4121000	I thought you were telling me he was going to rip out.
4121000	4122000	I'd play that game.
4123000	4127000	I was thinking you were going to tell me he's taking out the guts and macrame with them.
4127000	4128000	And so he gets a nice hanging plant.
4128000	4130000	I like the happy birthday.
4132000	4137000	I'm still imagining the macrame like with the head is the plant in the middle and have it swinging like in the breeze on a porch.
4137000	4140000	I want to see like, I don't know if they do this in games.
4140000	4143000	Sorry, real quick. With these really gross fatalities,
4143000	4151000	I think it does say something that this guy is still lending his likeness to the game, knowing that it's going to be ripped apart in hideous pieces.
4151000	4155000	That's that's a strong actor willing to do this as an added bonus.
4155000	4156000	What are you talking about?
4157000	4159000	Maybe he's just like, leave the head intact.
4160000	4161000	Well, that you can't do that.
4161000	4165000	Not if you could do a fatality on him anyway.
4166000	4171000	Oh, I was just saying, you know how they do like the whole like X-ray things when you're like breaking bones and stuff like that.
4171000	4173000	And it gets really gross and up close.
4173000	4179000	I want to see them do that for friendships, but like maybe something a little bit differently, you know, baking a cake.
4179000	4182000	And I don't know what they do. They still leave friendships in.
4183000	4185000	I feel like Mortal Kombat nine had them.
4185000	4191000	I don't remember X because I didn't play enough of it because I was like, you know, I just think it'd be funny.
4191000	4195000	The parody that probably somebody in shadow probably yell out where the friendship thing is at.
4195000	4197000	But yeah, when you are bad balladys. Yes.
4197000	4198000	They saw the balladys.
4199000	4201000	I don't know if the balladys have been in the game in a while.
4201000	4207000	I don't know. I think that's maybe that was in nine to nine was really like a throwback to the classic like Mortal Kombat games.
4207000	4210000	Those are the last one that I kind of played, to be honest.
4213000	4216000	I do hope they find a way to work in with the Shang Tsung actor.
4216000	4223000	I really hope they do find find a way to get him to actually do the your soul is mine.
4223000	4225000	That whole thing like for the movies that has to be there.
4225000	4228000	Like, please tell me they got him to do that.
4228000	4231000	Like, you know, their little walk ins when they're all bad ass when they walk into the arena.
4231000	4236000	I really hope he does that. Your soul is mine with the, you know, big eyes and all that, like in the movie.
4237000	4240000	So, yeah, the hilarious. So let's see.
4241000	4245000	Comments and chat as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Jax still hasn't been announced.
4245000	4249000	There's still time, right? They didn't announce Jackie was she was hers.
4249000	4253000	The one I saw another fatality because, again, Alan makes me watch them all because he's sick.
4253000	4258000	There's one where, like, they're putting up fake walls like a laser wall or something.
4258000	4261000	And like the laser wall is totally splits this guy in half.
4261000	4263000	And I was like, this is great. I think that was Jackie.
4263000	4267000	Didn't I steal that like from the first Resident Evil movie or something?
4267000	4270000	I think, well, but you could also say Resident Evil stole it from Cube.
4270000	4273000	So hard to say.
4273000	4275000	Cube was a good movie.
4275000	4278000	You know what's weird? As much as I hate gore and violence and all that stuff.
4278000	4280000	I actually thought Cube was a great movie, too.
4280000	4282000	I really liked Hypercube better, though.
4282000	4284000	I never saw the sequels. You know that?
4284000	4286000	Actually, the reason I liked it better is because it does like it.
4286000	4291000	Hypercube is another word for a tesseract, which is a fourth dimensional cube.
4291000	4294000	No, I heard like the sequels get super nerdy with the math.
4294000	4296000	The third one is shitty. The third one is absolute shit.
4296000	4298000	Were there four or three?
4298000	4300000	There was Cube, Hypercube and Cube Zero.
4300000	4302000	So these are like, if you've never heard of these movies like Cube,
4302000	4305000	they're like super like cold, like low budget.
4305000	4306000	The first one was really low budget.
4306000	4308000	They were Canadian films.
4308000	4311000	I thought, well, Nicole DeBoer is in the first one.
4311000	4313000	I'm almost positive the first one's a Canadian film.
4313000	4314000	Yeah.
4314000	4315000	Yeah. And so I think it had a limited release here.
4315000	4318000	If anyone doesn't recognize that name, she was Ezri Dax in Deep Space Night.
4318000	4319000	Yeah. Yeah.
4319000	4321000	She's also like one of the big main characters in it, too.
4321000	4326000	But yeah, it was basically these people are put in like this shifting room cube
4326000	4329000	and they had to figure out how to find the exit.
4329000	4331000	But the rooms are shifting.
4331000	4333000	Cube two is when it's also shifting in time.
4333000	4335000	Cube would have made a great video game.
4335000	4337000	I was just thinking that.
4337000	4338000	I'm surprised they never did that.
4338000	4339000	I don't think I can eat Indian food anymore.
4339000	4341000	It could have been on the GameCube.
4341000	4346000	And if Cube came out in this day and age, it would be an escape room.
4346000	4347000	Right.
4347000	4350000	Because you know how like those those escape rooms are huge and everywhere,
4350000	4351000	like cube is an escape.
4351000	4352000	That would have been a thing.
4352000	4354000	But I think the movie's a little old now at this point.
4354000	4355000	Anyway, everyone should still watch it.
4355000	4356000	It's it's a classic.
4356000	4358000	See, it's not really that gross either.
4358000	4362000	See a Tiberian chat commenting on as I'm talking about Jackie Bridges.
4362000	4366000	Fatality is asking, when do we get the two to seven crossover?
4366000	4368000	I want to see Jackie Harry.
4368000	4371000	I want to see Jackie.
4372000	4373000	Oh, God.
4373000	4374000	Just think.
4374000	4378000	Think one of those actresses from two to seven just won an Oscar.
4378000	4379000	Think about that for a minute.
4379000	4381000	Anyway, moving on.
4381000	4383000	Let's move on.
4383000	4384000	Dr.
4384000	4386000	Sue is saying, isn't there already an escape room horror movie?
4386000	4388000	Yes, but I'm talking about the other way around.
4388000	4390000	Like if Cube was a movie that came out today,
4390000	4394000	they do an escape room based on Cube, I think is a good concept.
4394000	4398000	That would be crazy, though, because I mean, it's not feasible.
4398000	4399000	It's true.
4399000	4400000	I know.
4400000	4402000	I keep but they should do a game.
4402000	4408000	I keep seeing commercials on Facebook for a saw themed escape room in Vegas.
4408000	4410000	And I'm like, nope, nope.
4410000	4411000	The fuck out of there.
4411000	4412000	Nope.
4412000	4414000	The fuck out of that block ad report ad numbers.
4414000	4417000	But I definitely was like, I'm not interested in this.
4417000	4419000	Oh, I'm blocking ads left and right, though.
4419000	4421000	But still.
4421000	4422000	All right.
4422000	4425000	And I'm going to actually officially say I would put this as a dream game.
4425000	4428000	They do a cube video game.
4428000	4429000	No, I'll be rad.
4429000	4430000	I'll be glad.
4430000	4432000	Pissal Blanca says there is a game based on Cube.
4432000	4433000	Ugh, what's it called?
4433000	4436000	But Pissal Blanca, there certainly wasn't one based on the movie,
4436000	4439000	but maybe it's inspired by Cube.
4439000	4440000	That I could see.
4440000	4441000	There probably is a game out there.
4441000	4443000	And this is not intelligent Cube either.
4443000	4444000	That is very different.
4444000	4447000	I'm just going to say right now, everyone needs to watch Cube.
4447000	4449000	And also, one last thing.
4449000	4453000	Someone recreated the end of Hypercube in Unreal.
4453000	4454000	Are they on streaming service?
4454000	4455000	I take that back.
4455000	4456000	They did it as a Quake mod.
4456000	4458000	Is that movie on streaming services and stuff?
4458000	4461000	I'm sure it is, but I own, like, old-ass DVDs of them.
4461000	4463000	Yeah, I know, I know.
4463000	4465000	Somebody else in Chat has seen it.
4465000	4467000	Only Sonic in Chat says Cube was cool.
4467000	4469000	Somebody else knows what we're talking about.
4469000	4471000	That's good.
4471000	4473000	And Tigerclaw found the IMDB, so that's good.
4473000	4474000	All right.
4474000	4477000	Let's move on and talk about some more gaming news,
4477000	4479000	because we're running a little long tonight, but that's okay.
4479000	4480000	We're having good discussions.
4480000	4481000	Let's go, Loki.
4481000	4484000	I was just looking for Cube, the video game.
4484000	4486000	They have a game on Steam called Half Dead
4486000	4488000	that people are comparing to Cube,
4488000	4490000	because you just survive through rooms of traps,
4490000	4492000	so that might be something they'll look up.
4492000	4495000	Anyways, speaking of Steam, though,
4495000	4498000	it's getting an overhaul, especially the libraries.
4498000	4501000	So they had some screenshots put up
4501000	4505000	and a bunch of information coming out during GDC
4505000	4508000	talking about how they're going to overhaul the Steam library page,
4508000	4510000	and yes, it looks amazing.
4510000	4514000	They've got basically different sections,
4514000	4516000	like, for example, parts.
4516000	4517000	Not everybody's a fan.
4517000	4518000	I've been looking on Twitter.
4518000	4520000	Some people are like, what's this, you know?
4520000	4521000	I think it looks cool.
4521000	4525000	I mean, they have different games that have updates recently,
4525000	4527000	games you have completed.
4527000	4529000	Well, that's going to be a very small list for me.
4529000	4531000	They should have games I haven't played yet.
4531000	4533000	That's going to be all of it.
4535000	4536000	But yeah, they've seen...
4536000	4538000	It should feature in the library very big.
4538000	4540000	Here's a game that you paid money for,
4540000	4541000	but you still haven't touched.
4541000	4543000	Feature of the day.
4543000	4544000	Yes.
4546000	4551000	But basically, they have a carousel of dedicated games and updates.
4552000	4555000	They've got different things that show different friends' activities.
4555000	4561000	It almost looks a little bit like the PlayStation events page.
4561000	4563000	What do they call that?
4563000	4566000	That social media thing that they have on the PlayStation 4
4566000	4568000	that's like kind of whatever.
4568000	4570000	That shows your friends' activities and stuff.
4570000	4571000	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
4571000	4573000	I don't know the branded name of that, though.
4573000	4574000	The feed or...
4574000	4576000	Yeah, I think it's something like PlayStation feed or something.
4576000	4577000	Anyways, whatever that is.
4577000	4580000	But they're going to have something that shows what your friends are playing,
4580000	4581000	the type of stuff.
4581000	4582000	So that's kind of cool.
4584000	4586000	Yeah, and then they have different events,
4586000	4589000	so you can actually see what's coming up,
4589000	4592000	like different tournaments and online games.
4592000	4595000	Like free weekend of DLC or something.
4595000	4596000	Yeah, let's be honest.
4596000	4599000	I think Steam could use a little bit of a refresh.
4599000	4602000	I mean, so I'm down.
4602000	4603000	Isn't that funny?
4603000	4607000	Right around this time where we talk a lot about the Epic Game Store
4607000	4609000	and we talk about good old games
4609000	4611000	and we talk about all the competition out,
4611000	4613000	Humble Bundle and all the competition out there,
4613000	4619000	isn't it funny that Steam is suddenly kind of feeling the need to refresh
4619000	4620000	and tidy up house a little bit?
4620000	4621000	It's funny, though,
4621000	4623000	it's like actually looking at the layout that they have
4623000	4625000	kind of reminds me of the Epic Game Store a bit.
4625000	4626000	A little bit.
4626000	4628000	Actually, speaking of game stores, though,
4628000	4630000	this came across my Twitter feed this week,
4630000	4632000	and I didn't really realize this.
4632000	4636000	Did you notice Discord's game store is gone?
4636000	4639000	It was quietly removed from the app,
4639000	4643000	and it's been replaced with a section that focuses on that Nitro thing
4643000	4644000	that they sell.
4644000	4649000	So not so much the piece by piece game store things,
4649000	4652000	but the subscription service, basically.
4652000	4654000	Oh, yeah, I forgot all about it.
4654000	4656000	Which is basically a Discord's paid version,
4656000	4657000	you know, and that whole thing, right?
4657000	4658000	Yeah.
4658000	4659000	Isn't that interesting?
4659000	4662000	Discord kind of quietly slipped out the back door
4662000	4663000	on all those games things,
4663000	4665000	but they, you know, as much as,
4665000	4667000	and I still think, and I've said this on the show before,
4667000	4670000	I think Discord is a pretty brilliant gaming company
4670000	4674000	and the way that they got themselves on all your computers
4674000	4676000	and all your mobile phones and all that stuff,
4676000	4678000	I think it's pretty brilliant what they did,
4678000	4682000	and I'm kind of surprised to hear that the store has exited as a result,
4682000	4687000	but it did come out at kind of like exactly the wrong moment
4687000	4691000	when all of a sudden now Epic Games Store comes in and says,
4691000	4693000	oh, no, by the way, the price cut we're given is, you know,
4693000	4697000	so it's almost like Discord probably, in a weird way,
4697000	4701000	had a problem standing out with that.
4701000	4702000	So I don't know.
4702000	4707000	So anyway, Pixel Pacas also says this is kind of a change here.
4708000	4711000	If you have a, and I remember reading about this in the press release too,
4711000	4714000	Pixel Pacas says if you have a verified Discord server,
4714000	4717000	then you can sell your game on the server,
4717000	4720000	and so that's pretty clever too because, you know,
4720000	4722000	there's all these Discords out there.
4722000	4725000	There's obviously a cheap plug for the VOG Network Discord
4725000	4729000	at vognetwork.com slash Discord where we talk about the shows,
4729000	4732000	and a lot of people drop topics in the OLR chat room,
4732000	4734000	and I know for Bobby's chat room too, we use them.
4734000	4735000	We absolutely use them on the show,
4735000	4737000	and I love some of the discussion that happens on there too
4737000	4739000	because some of the people who can't listen live
4739000	4741000	will kind of go into like a long form kind of feedback,
4741000	4743000	and I love reading it.
4743000	4745000	Even if I don't always respond to it directly,
4745000	4747000	I just, you know, love that it's there.
4747000	4749000	So anyway, cheap plug for our own Discord,
4749000	4751000	but game makers all have their own Discord too,
4751000	4755000	so wouldn't it be something if like you were to join the Discord for,
4755000	4758000	you know, Indie Adventure 11 or whatever game is under development,
4758000	4760000	and then when the game's ready to go on sale,
4760000	4763000	oh, here's in our Discord because we're a premium.
4763000	4765000	You can click right here and get the game right now.
4765000	4769000	So it's not to say that the store is gone, gone,
4769000	4773000	but it's not like a traditional store at this point anymore.
4773000	4779000	So anyway, let's move on.
4779000	4781000	Let's talk.
4781000	4784000	Maybe let's not move on for a minute because I need a drink. Sorry.
4784000	4785000	Oh, Rob.
4785000	4788000	Well, I did discover that I apparently can't eat Indian food like I used to,
4788000	4792000	but I'd be happy to share with anybody else who wants some.
4792000	4795000	Would you like your sinuses blown wide open?
4795000	4797000	I got to wait for it. Did you get really spicy?
4797000	4799000	It's not really spicy, but spicy to me.
4799000	4802000	I was going to say, can't you not like do spicy?
4802000	4804000	I can only have like some pepper stuff.
4804000	4806000	It's not to where I'm going to need any Benadryl yet.
4806000	4807000	Okay, gotcha.
4807000	4809000	For those who don't know, Jamie has a pepper allergy.
4809000	4812000	That's right. All right. Anyway, I'm ready. Sorry.
4812000	4816000	I've rinsed my mouth with water, and I'm ready to talk again.
4816000	4819000	Hopefully. Oh, girl. I know. Right.
4819000	4822000	All right. Anyway, let's talk about Nintendo's Labo
4822000	4827000	and the next Labo kit that they've announced, which is Labo VR.
4827000	4830000	Remember a puppy came back? We could call him Black Labo.
4830000	4834000	I would love from way back in the day.
4834000	4835000	God, what was the last time he was on the show?
4835000	4837000	I wish puppy would come back.
4837000	4838000	Ten years ago was probably last time.
4838000	4840000	Everyone who knows puppy told him to come back.
4840000	4842000	You know, he's got like a kid now. That kid's probably like five years old.
4842000	4845000	It's perfect time to get his kid introduced to our podcast.
4846000	4849000	We got to recruit. We got to recruit still for people.
4849000	4850000	Get him young.
4850000	4855000	We got to recruit for people to co-host the show with Josh and Julian.
4855000	4858000	Julian. So we still got to get a third host somewhere.
4858000	4860000	Julian's going to be 12 next month.
4860000	4862000	Oh, my God. You got to be kidding me. 12?
4862000	4863000	12.
4863000	4865000	How old was he when he was on the show? Like nine?
4865000	4866000	It was a while ago.
4866000	4867000	He was like 10.
4867000	4870000	Was he? All right. Anyway. Anyway, back to Labo.
4870000	4873000	The next kit for Nintendo Labo is a VR kit.
4873000	4876000	And so, of course, a lot of people went, oh, my gosh.
4876000	4878000	Nintendo is taking on Oculus Rift.
4878000	4881000	No, Nintendo is not taking on Oculus Rift.
4881000	4884000	This is not playing Breath of the Wild in VR.
4884000	4887000	In fact, Nintendo actually has put out a video that's really demonstrated
4887000	4891000	some of the things that they're doing in their Labo VR kit.
4891000	4896000	And I got to say, it's pretty like the amount, the depth,
4896000	4898000	and the amount of stuff they're doing.
4898000	4902000	If it's like a mini game collection, there's a lot of freaking mini games in it.
4902000	4904000	So like there's a thing where you can build like a blaster
4904000	4907000	and there's like a blaster little mini game that you can play.
4907000	4911000	But there were some other cool little things, too, like a 3D paint.
4911000	4913000	So it's not Mario Paint.
4913000	4915000	I don't know why they didn't brand it Mario Paint.
4915000	4916000	That would have been...
4916000	4917000	It looks like an elephant.
4917000	4920000	With that elephant thing, that was like the painting thing, though, right?
4920000	4922000	That's what's so confusing because it's like an elephant thing.
4922000	4925000	I also feel like it's a missed opportunity for Mario Paint 3D, but that's all right.
4925000	4928000	But I mean, it was like a neat concept.
4928000	4930000	You know, just the idea of like painting in the 3D space.
4930000	4932000	Anyway, so here it is. Here it is.
4932000	4936000	Really, the VR is like a plastic goggle thing that just goes on top of your Switch.
4936000	4939000	And it's never going to be like the Oculus.
4939000	4941000	It isn't strapped to your head.
4941000	4944000	There's no strap to keep it there, but you have to hold it to your head.
4944000	4948000	I get why they're doing that, because they can do the math with the two controllers
4948000	4954000	with the angles and stuff, since it can tell, based on the angles of the two controllers,
4954000	4958000	where it is in 3D space, because there's no real way to track it.
4959000	4961000	But it's still weird.
4964000	4968000	I'm looking in chat over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network,
4968000	4971000	and I see they're talking a little bit about some of the...
4971000	4973000	Okay, so Bobby says, I can explain the elephant.
4973000	4977000	It's using infrared stickers to mimic 6DOF controllers,
4977000	4979000	like the Vive controllers or Oculus Touch controllers.
4979000	4983000	The infrared stickers are on the headset of the elephant.
4983000	4991000	I mean, it's cool, but it's also the way we expected Nintendo to get into VR in some ways.
4991000	4994000	Although, I've got to say, because there's a whole video.
4994000	4997000	There's a 10-minute video you can watch out there about LaboVR,
4997000	5001000	and you can see all the things, because they show all these different experiences,
5001000	5005000	and then they go, and there's 64 more that are just for the goggles.
5005000	5007000	And it's like, jeez.
5007000	5009000	They're not all full-featured games.
5009000	5012000	Some of them are just like, look in this fish thing.
5013000	5020000	But you've got to wonder, did Nintendo start to go down this path of VR,
5020000	5023000	and these were all the concept things they built,
5023000	5026000	and then they were like, eh, maybe not.
5026000	5031000	And so they repackaged it into this, because you know Nintendo is never going to be one
5031000	5033000	to throw something away completely, right?
5033000	5039000	They're going to repackage it, just like the Wii U, the Miyamoto experience,
5039000	5043000	they repackaged it into a Star Fox spin-off, right? Remember that?
5043000	5046000	Yeah, I know. You're Project Guard.
5046000	5049000	Yeah. They ended up making a Star Fox spin-off out of it.
5049000	5054000	So it's like, you almost wonder, was this all made originally with Labo in mind,
5054000	5057000	or was this kind of like the whole, this is what we're going to do with it?
5057000	5062000	I don't know. It's kind of interesting to think about where Nintendo's brain might have been with this.
5062000	5067000	But that all being said, I think it'll do pretty good.
5067000	5070000	I think it'll be the type of thing, even though it's out kind of early,
5070000	5073000	I think especially for that younger audience.
5073000	5080000	I don't know if you, me, Jamie, I don't know if we would be at the start of the line to get this sort of thing,
5080000	5086000	but I think for the younger kids, the teens and the tweens, this is going to be right up their alley.
5086000	5091000	If I was 12 and gaming right now, I'd fucking want this. You know what I mean?
5091000	5092000	Yeah.
5092000	5095000	But don't be under seven years old, because there's all sorts of health warnings.
5095000	5098000	Put all that aside, like this is pretty, and it's, you know,
5098000	5102000	what you learn from the experience of building it and all that stuff as well is an important part of it.
5102000	5106000	Yeah, the thing that sucks is, I bet this would be pretty hard to stream this.
5106000	5109000	Bobby in chat says, I'm at the start of the line getting it.
5109000	5114000	Yeah, but you're a VR enthusiast and it's a little different. It's to be expected.
5114000	5121000	So I think it's, I think it's a logical step for how Nintendo goes into the VR.
5121000	5125000	They can kind of put one foot in the pool and be like, okay, that was nice.
5125000	5129000	And then go back to do with what they were doing.
5129000	5133000	All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
5133000	5141000	Well, who remembers a particular game where you took, holy crap, did I just lose?
5141000	5142000	I lost my story.
5142000	5145000	I don't remember a game where you took a holy crap.
5145000	5146000	That was in.
5146000	5148000	There was, try not to, was it?
5148000	5149000	Don't shit your pants.
5149000	5150000	Don't shit your pants. I remember that.
5150000	5154000	Anyway, um, where you took a manual, you dipped it in water or a letter,
5154000	5161000	and you would get a code on it that you would put in after you submerged your submarine.
5161000	5164000	Although, in retrospect, I wonder how they would have gotten it out,
5164000	5168000	gotten the letter out of the submarine in the game to then get it back to get the code,
5168000	5171000	because that would depressurize the submarine and everyone would die.
5171000	5173000	But I'm talking about Star Tropics.
5173000	5177000	I was like, you are going to tell the kids the Children's Z is what game we're talking about, right?
5177000	5178000	Okay, yes, Star Tropics.
5178000	5184000	Well, Star Tropics is going to be on the Switch, but guess what is missing?
5184000	5185000	The letter.
5185000	5186000	Yeah.
5186000	5187000	That has the thing.
5187000	5191000	It didn't work out well for me when I was, you know, when I originally got this game,
5191000	5194000	because I bought it used a long time ago and it didn't have the letter.
5194000	5196000	I had to call it 800 numbers.
5196000	5201000	Well, some people think that's why Nintendo did this, because y'all probably wouldn't remember,
5201000	5207000	but back in the day, back in my day, when these video game rentals,
5207000	5210000	game companies were really pissed about video game rentals,
5210000	5213000	because they're like, it's preventing people from dropping money on the game.
5213000	5215000	They beat the games. They never buy it.
5215000	5218000	And they don't get to see those returns on the rentals.
5218000	5220000	So the gaming industry hated the rental.
5220000	5224000	They probably still do, but it's probably just not as big of a deal as it used to be.
5224000	5227000	Now they have, you know, licensing deals with rental companies.
5227000	5228000	That's true.
5228000	5232000	Some say that DLC online pass, the EA did. Remember that?
5232000	5234000	That was the used game market and all that.
5234000	5238000	But anyway, this was Nintendo's way of kind of combating that.
5238000	5241000	Back in the day, it was like, oh, you don't get past a certain point without a special code
5241000	5244000	that's only with new copies of the game.
5244000	5245000	Yeah.
5245000	5251000	But at any rate, the manual is not going to be there.
5251000	5254000	Nobody said anything about the manual being there. It's not there.
5254000	5256000	Of course, we do have the internet today.
5256000	5259000	They're just at the same time, Nintendo themselves aren't really...
5259000	5261000	They're not providing the code.
5261000	5263000	Well, I'm really surprised they didn't just put it in the description.
5263000	5265000	Like, there's little descriptions.
5265000	5269000	Well, they had, in the Wii U version, they had the whole manual, like the digital manuals,
5269000	5273000	and you could actually, it did a little animation where it dips it in the water and all that,
5273000	5275000	but why couldn't they just port that over?
5275000	5276000	Because they...
5276000	5277000	Reasons.
5277000	5278000	It's not like they're...
5278000	5280000	Because they half-assed it, is what they did.
5280000	5281000	Well...
5281000	5283000	And spoiler, the code is 747.
5284000	5288000	Yes, if you need it, the code is 747, like an airplane, 747.
5288000	5290000	Even though you're in a submarine.
5290000	5291000	Yes.
5291000	5293000	So, whatever.
5293000	5296000	But you'd think they would just put that in the description or something.
5296000	5298000	This is weird.
5298000	5302000	Anyway, the point in the game is when Babu, who is the uncle's assistant,
5302000	5304000	is possessed and says,
5304000	5308000	Evil aliens from a distant planet, tell my nephew to use code 1776.
5308000	5310000	Tell Mike to dip my letter in water.
5310000	5314000	You know, StarTropics was a really unique kind of game.
5314000	5316000	If you haven't played StarTropics, you really should.
5316000	5317000	It was lateness.
5317000	5318000	It was lateness.
5318000	5319000	Well, you know what's funny?
5319000	5322000	The Super Famicom had already been out in Japan for a few weeks when this game released.
5322000	5325000	Dark Tetsuya says, I think StarTropics was too late for me.
5325000	5327000	I think I moved on to the Super Nintendo by then.
5327000	5329000	I think people did, but some people forget.
5329000	5331000	Did you guys remember? There was a StarTropics 2.
5331000	5332000	Zoda's Revenge.
5332000	5333000	Zoda's Revenge, yeah.
5333000	5336000	And you want to talk about a game, because Zoda's Revenge, if I'm not mistaken,
5336000	5340000	was the next to last NES game, the last being Warriors Woods,
5340000	5343000	that Nintendo did, period, for the NES.
5343000	5345000	Like, Zoda's Revenge was next to last.
5345000	5346000	That was very late in the cycle.
5346000	5351000	But if you haven't played the original StarTropics, it's a good, it's neat.
5351000	5353000	Yeah, I've actually beaten that game.
5353000	5354000	It mixes elements of, like, Zelda.
5354000	5358000	Here's the other fascinating thing, though, you might not have known about that game.
5358000	5360000	Because, you know, on the Switch Online right now,
5360000	5363000	we got StarTropics and Kid Icarus, right?
5363000	5366000	And then, over in Japan, they got Kid Icarus,
5366000	5368000	and they got their special Japanese-only game.
5368000	5371000	I don't remember if this was the month that the Sumo Wrestling game came out.
5371000	5374000	But they got some Japanese-only thing that was never here.
5374000	5376000	But they didn't get StarTropics in Japan.
5376000	5380000	They got Fire Emblem, which we never got here, right?
5380000	5382000	Why didn't Japan get StarTropics?
5382000	5385000	It was never released in Japan.
5385000	5389000	Even though StarTropics was developed in Japan,
5389000	5393000	it was this rare product of a company that said,
5393000	5400000	we're going to develop a game here for the audience over here in the States.
5400000	5404000	And so, StarTropics was developed in Japan for an American audience.
5404000	5407000	And that's why that game is kind of interesting.
5407000	5410000	And UK. I believe the first StarTropics was in the UK.
5410000	5412000	I don't think the sequel ever was.
5412000	5416000	I think Zelda's Revenge, and I think I maybe played Zelda's Revenge once,
5416000	5417000	but I don't remember it.
5417000	5421000	I want to say, Zelda's Revenge tried to teach you history or something.
5421000	5424000	It had a lot of historical stuff that was kind of built into it.
5424000	5426000	It was learning. I don't want to do any of that.
5426000	5427000	Which is why it didn't sell.
5427000	5428000	So, anyway.
5428000	5429000	Murica.
5429000	5430000	Yeah.
5430000	5432000	S2100 Matt in chat says,
5432000	5434000	I think Rob needs to do a stream playing StarTropics.
5434000	5436000	Be careful what you ask for.
5436000	5439000	Bob Coffee brings up Like Secret of Evermore.
5439000	5441000	Close.
5441000	5446000	Secret of Evermore, remember, there was a Square USA for a hot minute.
5446000	5448000	I think it was in the Seattle area, right?
5448000	5451000	So, there was a Square USA for a hot minute,
5451000	5454000	and Secret of Evermore was like the game that they produced.
5454000	5457000	So, it was still like a Japanese company,
5457000	5459000	but with a US office.
5459000	5461000	This was years before they ever had like Eidos or things like that,
5461000	5462000	you know, and that whole thing.
5462000	5465000	So, a little bit different, but like,
5465000	5467000	I see where you're going with that.
5467000	5470000	Which, then the interesting thing about Secret of Evermore is that was,
5470000	5472000	oh God, what's that composer?
5473000	5475000	Sulay? Jeremy?
5475000	5477000	Is that his name?
5477000	5479000	Who did Skyrim and Oblivion.
5479000	5481000	Does all the Guild Wars.
5481000	5482000	He does a lot of great soundtracks.
5482000	5485000	That was like, he was probably a young guy when he did that.
5485000	5487000	Yeah, Jeremy Sulay.
5487000	5488000	Thank you.
5488000	5491000	Okay, I knew it was like, yeah, he was on Secret of Evermore.
5491000	5493000	Random.
5493000	5494000	Go Fig.
5494000	5496000	Weird ass fact, but yeah.
5496000	5498000	So, it was developed here in America.
5498000	5500000	It was the first game that brought us that guy
5500000	5502000	who still does a lot of these, you know,
5502000	5504000	everybody knows the Skyrim stuff, right?
5504000	5506000	Dovahkin. Dovahkin. Dovahkin.
5506000	5507000	Right, that whole thing, right?
5507000	5509000	So, that was his first game.
5509000	5511000	So, there you go.
5511000	5513000	Anyway, actdeftinchat says,
5513000	5514000	here, there, everywhere, indeed.
5514000	5515000	All right.
5515000	5517000	And we are going here, here, there, everywhere.
5517000	5520000	Let's go to another story from Loki.
5520000	5522000	All right.
5522000	5524000	So, this is pretty awesome.
5524000	5528000	So, they announced, they were showing this off at GDC.
5528000	5531000	I want to say that this was a Kickstarter one time,
5531000	5537000	but this device called the NES, the NES Maker.
5537000	5539000	So, you know, you may have your Mario Makers and stuff,
5539000	5541000	but this actually makes NES games.
5541000	5542000	Mentos, the NES Maker.
5542000	5545000	And it's coming from, what was it?
5545000	5548000	It's coming from the 8-bit, or,
5548000	5551000	what was it, the group that did the 8-bit Heroes film,
5551000	5554000	in which they made a game called Mystic Searches,
5554000	5556000	which is an NES game.
5556000	5559000	And so, they released, basically, their tool set
5559000	5561000	to make these games.
5561000	5563000	And so, it is, it's very much,
5563000	5566000	you can make stuff without any programming.
5566000	5568000	You can make your own NES cartridges
5568000	5570000	and actually play them on an NES,
5570000	5572000	which is pretty awesome.
5572000	5574000	So, if this is something you're interested in,
5574000	5579000	you check it out at www.thenew8bitheroes.com,
5579000	5582000	and they sell, you can download the software,
5582000	5584000	you have to buy the activation code for it,
5584000	5587000	and then they also sell the flashers and stuff.
5587000	5591000	Plus, there's dozens of tutorials on how to do everything.
5591000	5592000	This is hot.
5592000	5594000	I'm into this now.
5594000	5597000	Loki, you're the one that, like, tries to make games.
5597000	5598000	You don't ever finish, but, you know,
5598000	5600000	it's a long-running joke here on the show.
5600000	5601000	Surely, this looks up your alley.
5601000	5603000	Are you gonna try to make a game in NES Maker?
5603000	5605000	It looks interesting.
5605000	5608000	I'd be interested to see what it can do.
5608000	5610000	But, yeah, I mean, it looks pretty cool.
5610000	5613000	I don't have an NES to play games on, so, I don't know.
5613000	5614000	I have three.
5614000	5616000	I mean, I could play them in an emulator.
5616000	5618000	I know so many people just do emulator these days.
5618000	5619000	Well, I was gonna say you could probably borrow a NES.
5619000	5622000	Throw it on my NES, or Super NES Classic.
5622000	5625000	Could I take the ROM that I make in NES Maker,
5625000	5629000	burn it to a Dreamcast disc with the NES emulator on Dreamcast,
5629000	5631000	and play my NES Maker game on the Dreamcast?
5631000	5632000	Probably.
5632000	5633000	Yes.
5633000	5634000	Fuck yeah, how meta.
5634000	5635000	And then you could also, like, you know,
5635000	5638000	put it on the SNES Classic or an NES Classic.
5638000	5639000	You can flash it to those.
5640000	5643000	Oh, an NES Classic, but it's all games I made up.
5643000	5645000	That'd be cool.
5645000	5646000	I like that.
5646000	5647000	It's very cool.
5647000	5648000	We'll call it the Rob ES.
5648000	5649000	Anyway, some comments in our...
5649000	5650000	The Rob Entertainment System.
5650000	5652000	Some comments, not to be confused with the robot, right?
5652000	5655000	Some comments in our Twitch over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
5655000	5657000	Again, where we do tape live on Sunday nights.
5657000	5658000	Bobby Blackwell says,
5658000	5660000	If you can't finish a game in Unity,
5660000	5662000	you won't be able to finish a game in NES Maker.
5662000	5664000	I call shade.
5664000	5666000	Although, he's right.
5666000	5667000	It is true.
5667000	5668000	It is more...
5668000	5669000	That's a lie.
5669000	5670000	I don't find it.
5670000	5671000	It is true.
5671000	5678000	I mean, it is, um, it is more restricting to build something in it for an NES cartridge
5678000	5680000	because they have a lot of limitations there.
5680000	5681000	True.
5681000	5684000	Because if it's going to run on the actual system, they can't just like...
5684000	5685000	Yeah.
5685000	5689000	You have to file these sizes and you have to make sure your sprites are all small enough
5689000	5690000	and compact enough.
5690000	5692000	And yeah, so there's a lot of limitations.
5692000	5694000	You're only using so many colors in the palette at a time.
5694000	5695000	Right.
5695000	5696000	And your sprite palette only has...
5696000	5697000	The RAM only has so much to load.
5697000	5698000	Exactly.
5698000	5699000	Exactly.
5699000	5700000	Yeah, it is a challenge.
5700000	5701000	You have to have a...
5701000	5704000	You probably have to have a bigger brain to develop for NES.
5704000	5705000	Is that what you're saying?
5705000	5706000	No.
5706000	5707000	You need to be a little smarter.
5707000	5708000	You need to be a little smarter.
5708000	5709000	A lot more planning, I think.
5709000	5711000	I'm just being an asshole.
5711000	5712000	I'm just kidding.
5712000	5715000	That's what I was doing this week, by the way.
5715000	5721000	Which I haven't been playing any games because I'm fucking playing with Unity, okay?
5721000	5723000	So that's why I haven't been playing games.
5723000	5725000	Am I going to talk about what I'm working on?
5725000	5726000	No.
5726000	5729000	No, because many of you people care about that crap.
5729000	5732000	Just give me a hard time forever so the hell with you.
5732000	5735000	People watching this stream cannot see how red the two of you both are right now.
5735000	5736000	It might be able to see a little bit.
5736000	5738000	Me from laughing, him from being angry.
5738000	5739000	So is Loki...
5739000	5740000	You look more amused.
5740000	5741000	Are we saying, Loki?
5741000	5747000	Are we saying, Loki, that you're not going to be talking about Unity Develop anymore
5747000	5748000	because you're sick of all these jokes.
5748000	5749000	You're sick about people joking.
5749000	5750000	You never finish a thing.
5750000	5753000	And you're just going to come on here one day and you're going to say,
5753000	5755000	I fucking released a game.
5755000	5756000	Mic drop.
5756000	5758000	We don't want to drop the mics.
5758000	5759000	They might break them.
5759000	5760000	Drop it on the couch.
5760000	5761000	Drop it on the couch.
5761000	5763000	Put it on Pikachu's little pillow there.
5763000	5764000	Drop it on Pikachu.
5764000	5765000	He'll hold it for you.
5765000	5766000	There you go.
5766000	5767000	There we go.
5767000	5768000	Let's drop it on Pikachu.
5768000	5770000	We got to think about the mics.
5770000	5771000	All right.
5771000	5775000	Okay, so Loki's new plan is to catch you all off.
5775000	5776000	It's Beyonce.
5776000	5777000	He's going to do the Beyonce.
5777000	5778000	He's going to be...
5778000	5781000	Because now Beyonce is a verb ever since what she did in the music industry.
5781000	5783000	He's going to Beyonce his game on us all someday.
5783000	5786000	So we will eagerly await it.
5788000	5790000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,
5790000	5793000	this is why game developers aren't as open with gamers.
5794000	5796000	Now you're learning this firsthand.
5796000	5798000	Eh, whatever.
5798000	5799000	All right.
5799000	5806000	Anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about Final Fantasy Fan Fest in Japan.
5806000	5809000	So you guys know I'm a fan of Final Fantasy XIV.
5809000	5810000	I've played that game quite a bit.
5810000	5816000	And the new expansion, I went to this in Las Vegas and they announced in Japan,
5816000	5821000	they had their kind of like final Fan Fest because they did one in Paris as well a couple months ago.
5821000	5826000	So this one that they did in Japan was kind of the last one that's going to be leading into this expansion,
5826000	5832000	Shadowbringers, which is going to be coming out pre-play, I think it's June 28th.
5832000	5837000	So for those that pre-order, you can play on June 28th.
5837000	5841000	And so they announced a brand new class that's going to be playable in the game.
5841000	5845000	So we know that we already had Gunbreaker was going to be the first class, a new tank.
5845000	5849000	And the other job that they have unveiled is Dancer.
5849000	5853000	That's right. You can live out your Mog fantasies and be a Dancer.
5853000	5857000	Interesting though, a lot of people predicted the Dancer would be another healer,
5857000	5860000	but Dancer turns out to be a ranged DPS.
5860000	5866000	Although they're saying that Dancer will be able to do certain buffs that will have an effect on your party,
5866000	5869000	which is interesting because we kind of thought that's what Bard's going to do.
5869000	5872000	Bard does have some limited things, but it's like shared with Machinists.
5872000	5878000	But anyway, they have talked about a battle system complete redesign anyway.
5878000	5883000	So we'll probably hear about exactly how that's going to work in a couple months in May or so forth.
5883000	5886000	They announced some new areas for the expansion.
5886000	5894000	They announced that the new raid, not the one, the 24-man that's the partnership with the folks behind Nier
5894000	5896000	and that whole thing. They talked about that in Paris.
5896000	5902000	But the new raid here is called Eden, and it actually is going to have characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura
5902000	5907000	from Kingdom Hearts and all that, so that's got a lot of people's attention for sure.
5907000	5910000	And then they announced, because a lot of people have been looking forward to,
5910000	5916000	they announced the Viera in Paris, so the Viera from Fran from Final Fantasy XII.
5916000	5920000	They're going to be in Final Fantasy XIV, but when they showed it off in Paris,
5920000	5926000	there was nothing but female Viera and characters that kind of look like Fran, right?
5926000	5932000	And so a lot of people were kind of waiting, oh, they're going to show off the male Viera in Tokyo.
5932000	5936000	Well, guess what? They dropped the bombshell. There are no male Viera.
5936000	5941000	There are going to be instead the Hrothgar, which is a class that,
5941000	5946000	and I'm not going to get too far into the Final Fantasy lore, but basically this whole next expansion
5946000	5952000	is going to take place in another realm where every race has a mirror race.
5952000	5959000	And the mirror race for Hrothgar is the Ronso, which if you guys remember Final Fantasy X, Kilmari.
5959000	5967000	So Hrothgars are basically Kilmari from Final Fantasy X, but Hrothgars are male only.
5967000	5974000	So you cannot be a female Hrothgar, even though female Ronso's were present in Final Fantasy X.
5974000	5983000	And I got to be honest, when I kind of saw the footage of the Hrothgars, I was like, this looks a little rushed.
5983000	5990000	I got the feeling watching this, they made this decision, especially when you look at the words,
5990000	5995000	when they talked about in Las Vegas, we were there about how Viera would be the last race.
5995000	6000000	They're not going to do another race. And then in Tokyo, they say, I know we said Viera was going to be the last race.
6000000	6008000	We're actually going to do one other race because I have this feeling that in these few months between Vegas and Tokyo,
6008000	6014000	they made the decision to flip out. And I know there was leaks back and forth. I've heard all that crap.
6014000	6019000	But I think somewhere in there, they made the decision they're not doing male Viera for whatever reason.
6019000	6022000	And I think it's a shit decision.
6022000	6023000	They're like the Gerudo then.
6023000	6024000	I think it's a shit decision.
6024000	6028000	They have one male every hundred years and then he turns out to be Ganon.
6028000	6031000	Do they have male Mithras in this game?
6031000	6032000	Yes, they do.
6032000	6036000	Here's. Yeah. There's that pretty the pretty boy with the neck tattoo.
6036000	6038000	So here's here's the whole thing.
6038000	6045000	When they originally went from Final Fantasy 14, so 11 had gender locked races, right?
6045000	6051000	So the equivalent of the Roga and the Galca in Final Fantasy 11 were males only and the Mithra,
6051000	6054000	which are the Makoto and 14, were female only.
6054000	6060000	And because 14 was a lazy ass fuck copy paste of 11 in many ways, they kept it the same.
6060000	6065000	14 1.0 what they did, they did, which was a terrible game. They did a lot of the same.
6065000	6070000	So when they made Final Fantasy 14 2.0 or Realm Reborn, they were like,
6070000	6074000	why would we gender lock these things? Let's just open it up.
6074000	6080000	Let's do. And they did male Makoto and they did female Rogan and it's worked.
6080000	6083000	So when they announced Viera, a lot of people got really excited about.
6083000	6088000	Oh, well, Final Fantasy 14 has been like super progressive on a lot of this, like genders.
6088000	6094000	They listen to their player base and they made the glamour and the bunny stuff you can put on male or female.
6094000	6100000	And Final Fantasy 14 is infamous for the sublegar, right, which is dudes not wearing pants.
6100000	6102000	Look it up. Dudes and females not wearing pants.
6102000	6103000	11 as well.
6103000	6104000	But basically in Final Fantasy.
6104000	6105000	11 had that too.
6106000	6112000	It did. But basically in Final Fantasy 14, not only do the women look like hoes, but so do the men.
6112000	6115000	And that's what a lot of people love about the game.
6115000	6120000	So it's really fucking weird and off-putting to suddenly hear the development team go,
6120000	6126000	we just, you know, male Vieras, we just, it just felt weird.
6126000	6128000	So we're doing this instead.
6128000	6134000	What? What? You just, but, but everything you did in 2.0.
6134000	6138000	And you better believe people are pissed.
6138000	6140000	And you know who's pissed?
6140000	6142000	A lot of women.
6142000	6147000	A lot of women out there on Twitter and so are pissed because they were looking forward to playing their bunny boys.
6147000	6154000	And to be fair, why shouldn't they get to play the sexualized male class or whatever?
6154000	6156000	Even though the kitty boys are kind of sexualized as well.
6156000	6160000	And honestly, I've got to admit, I was really fucking looking forward to playing a bunny boy.
6160000	6162000	I really wanted to see how they were going to do it.
6162000	6166000	And I just think the fact that they're now gender locking in 5.0,
6166000	6172000	when they realized that that was a bad decision in 2.0 is fucking, period, ridiculous, period.
6172000	6174000	Do you have a comment or sorry?
6174000	6179000	Just something, a little bit of history thing that I just had to check because I was really curious to see if it was a real thing and it was,
6179000	6181000	or what the real thing was called.
6181000	6186000	Subligar was actually called the subligaculum, which basically means little binding underneath.
6186000	6188000	Exactly.
6188000	6191000	I knew what sub, what some of it meant, but I had to look up the rest of it.
6191000	6194000	That's what a drag queen uses as their trick too.
6194000	6195000	Tucking panties.
6195000	6196000	Yes.
6196000	6201000	But in this case, it was actually the dress of gladiators, athletes, and actors on stage in Rome.
6201000	6203000	And it was a precursor to the bikini.
6203000	6207000	Well, it makes sense because that's how you make sure you're not sewing a moose knuckle when you're on stage.
6207000	6210000	If you're wearing, you know, a dancing thing.
6210000	6212000	That's why they have like a dance belt, right?
6212000	6214000	So that it makes it look a little more Kendall.
6214000	6217000	Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
6217000	6218000	All right.
6218000	6223000	Now that our viewers have seen and listeners have heard much more than they want.
6223000	6224000	Anyway, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
6224000	6226000	Anyway, just saying it was the precursor to the bikini.
6226000	6227000	Yeah, no, I know.
6227000	6229000	Thanks, Rome.
6229000	6230000	So anyway.
6230000	6232000	I have to throw some education in this shit.
6232000	6237000	So I'm just, I think it's, I don't think these Hrothgar look very good at all.
6237000	6242000	And I think there's a lot of question marks in the way this news was delivered.
6242000	6245000	There's a lot of fan art out there about male Veras that look great.
6245000	6247000	I don't understand why Square can't fucking figure it out.
6247000	6249000	But I kind of think they need to figure it out.
6249000	6252000	I think they're like, it's 2019.
6252000	6256000	Like, just figure it out.
6256000	6258000	Give us the boy bunnies, dammit.
6258000	6262000	And honestly, I got to admit, as much as I enjoy Final Fantasy XIV,
6262000	6266000	like, I do feel like a lot of the announcements we're getting is like,
6266000	6268000	here's the new eight man raid.
6268000	6270000	Here's the new 24 man raid.
6270000	6272000	Here's the new dungeon.
6272000	6276000	Here's all the cookie cutters for this expansion
6276000	6279000	that are just like the ones in the last expansion.
6279000	6282000	And we haven't heard enough about what's really, like, game changing.
6282000	6284000	I'm going back to WoW.
6284000	6285000	For real.
6285000	6287000	I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft.
6287000	6289000	And I don't think that game's perfect.
6289000	6291000	I think I get why people are mad at WoW, too,
6291000	6295000	because I think a lot of the lore, the lore in this new expansion is straight up bad.
6295000	6299000	Like, what they did to Sylvanas, it's dumb.
6299000	6300000	It's just dumb.
6300000	6304000	I've been still working on the previous Illidan stuff just because it's more
6304000	6306000	Demon Space Elf Husband Boyfriend.
6306000	6310000	But like this new, I'm sorry, the new expansion, the lore is bad.
6310000	6311000	Anyway.
6311000	6316000	But I will say, when I log into WoW, I don't feel like a shortage of things to do.
6316000	6322000	Like, I'm like, I could go, and the way you can gear up and feel progression in World of Warcraft,
6322000	6325000	and granted, they've had like eight expansions to perfect this.
6325000	6327000	Final Fantasy is on what, their fourth?
6327000	6331000	But you can go do a world quest, or you can go run mythic dungeons,
6331000	6333000	or you can raid if you want,
6333000	6338000	or you can do PvP, or, and I feel like there's just like more things to kind of do
6338000	6343000	to feel a sense of progression in World of Warcraft than maybe in Final Fantasy XIV.
6343000	6348000	Like, I feel like, even though Final Fantasy XIV, like, especially the expansions have had a great story,
6348000	6351000	I feel like kind of like once you beat that story, it's like,
6351000	6355000	well, why do I keep paying my monthly fee?
6355000	6361000	And when I think one of the biggest criticisms about Final Fantasy XIV is that people are like,
6361000	6365000	I'd love to play it, I'd love to experience the story, but bummer about that monthly fee,
6365000	6367000	because I ain't going to play it because of that monthly fee.
6367000	6372000	I kind of think Final Fantasy XIV really is at a point in its growth,
6372000	6375000	they need to really justify that monthly fee.
6375000	6380000	Sure, it's got a great story, you've justified the cost of buying the expansion,
6380000	6383000	now justify that monthly fee.
6383000	6386000	And I say that as a long time supporter of Final Fantasy XIV,
6386000	6392000	but I kind of feel like there's been a lot of decisions made at Square Enix
6392000	6396000	that are very much like, we exist in this bubble, and we're going to make this decision
6396000	6399000	just because we think it's best.
6399000	6402000	They need, like, accounts.
6402000	6405000	I mean, they've been pretty good about listing their player base,
6405000	6407000	and I hope they do it on this male VR thing too, anyway.
6407000	6410000	Anyway, I've talked long enough, sorry.
6410000	6414000	Looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
6414000	6419000	Sia Tabiri says, ugh, this bikini talk reminds me that I need to finish catching up on the Ace Attorney anime.
6419000	6423000	Garth the Wolf in chat says, I keep thinking of resubbing to XIV,
6423000	6427000	but also got to justify if that fee is worth the time I'm going to spend on it.
6427000	6431000	I would say it's super worth it for that month you're going to spend to beat the story,
6431000	6435000	but I'm kind of overrating.
6435000	6438000	I don't really do it anymore. I don't do it in WoW, I don't do it in Final Fantasy XIV.
6438000	6440000	I'm kind of over that part of it.
6440000	6442000	Dungeons are okay because you need far less people to do those,
6442000	6447000	but I'm not interested, and again, you game how you want to game,
6447000	6450000	and I've been a raider in the past, and there's a lot of joy in it,
6450000	6454000	but for me, I just don't want to sit there for two hours learning a fight anymore.
6454000	6455000	You know what I mean?
6455000	6458000	I like having my DBM.
6458000	6460000	Oh, the Deadly Boss mods?
6460000	6461000	Yeah.
6461000	6464000	Yeah, but even then, even with that, you still, when you rage, you got to know.
6464000	6465000	But it's still not hard to learn.
6465000	6466000	No.
6466000	6471000	I watch one YouTube video, do one practice run, and I usually have it a third time.
6471000	6475000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, did they implement the NPC helpers for Dungeons?
6475000	6479000	So that's the big thing in this next expansion.
6479000	6481000	So instead of endgame content,
6481000	6486000	trusts are the brand new thing in this expansion where they are making a shift.
6486000	6489000	So to be fair to Square Enix, they are kind of listening to feedback
6489000	6493000	where people don't really want to play an MMO as a multiplayer game,
6493000	6496000	which I get it.
6496000	6498000	So they are implementing that as this new expansion.
6498000	6503000	So you will be able to beat the Shadowbringers story with just yourself
6503000	6508000	and with a little help from your NPC friends instead of your IRL friends.
6508000	6511000	And so for those that are a little more nervous about tanking and things like that,
6511000	6513000	which I don't like to tank either,
6513000	6516000	it'll be a lot easier because you won't be worrying about,
6516000	6517000	oh, I'm going to get other people killed.
6517000	6520000	It's just, oh, I'm getting these NPCs killed.
6520000	6521000	And they're expendable.
6521000	6524000	Yes, they are expendable, which is like in Skyrim.
6524000	6526000	Hooray, I have Lydia.
6526000	6529000	Oh, Lydia died, right?
6529000	6530000	All right, anyway.
6530000	6532000	Or they just disappear sometimes.
6532000	6535000	She'll disappear and then all of a sudden she'll come back and be like,
6535000	6537000	oh, where the hell did you come from?
6537000	6540000	All right, let's go back to a time when games were a little simpler
6540000	6544000	and we had to just put trust in the development of the game.
6544000	6547000	It was going to be a good game, but there weren't NPCs following you around,
6547000	6548000	especially not in this game.
6548000	6551000	Well, maybe, I guess there were, but maybe a little bit in this game.
6551000	6553000	But anyway, it's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.
6553000	6556000	What is the classic game of the week that you picked for us this week?
6556000	6561000	I went into Namco Land and did Winning Run.
6561000	6566000	Winning Run is a first-person Formula One racing game.
6566000	6573000	It was released in 1998 in Japan and in 1989 January in the European Union.
6573000	6576000	Well, actually, that didn't exist back then, so in Europe.
6576000	6584000	And it was the first game to run on the 3D Namco System 21 polygonizer hardware.
6584000	6589000	Music was composed by Kawada Hiroyuki, who had also worked on Galaga 88.
6589000	6591000	And since you mentioned music, it's going to shift here.
6591000	6593000	We're going to play some stuff from the soundtrack
6593000	6597000	because the ambient noise of the game is just kind of...
6597000	6598000	Pretty much.
6598000	6601000	Yeah, so we switched it out for the actual soundtrack here in the video.
6601000	6606000	At any rate, development for this game actually began over three years
6606000	6610000	before the game's release when they were developing the hardware.
6610000	6614000	Now, I'm sure people are familiar with Namco System 21,
6614000	6618000	but just to go ahead and tell you what else came on it was
6618000	6623000	Winning Run, Winning Run Suzuka Grand Prix, Galaxian 3rd.
6623000	6627000	I never want to call it 3 because it's got the cube, so Galaxian Cube.
6627000	6631000	Driver's Eyes, Winning Run 91, Starblades, Solavu,
6631000	6636000	Air Combat, Cybersled, and Attack of the Zul'gir.
6636000	6640000	So, some pretty big names came out on that.
6640000	6648000	But anyway, this was the first 3D game that Namco had released on that system.
6648000	6649000	It was the first game on that system.
6649000	6653000	It was also considered a milestone in 3D polygon graphics.
6653000	6657000	It pushed 60,000 polygons per second,
6657000	6662000	and it used the shapes basically as the building box for the structures within the game.
6662000	6668000	It's basically in one of those little sit-down cabinets
6668000	6671000	like most of the other Namco racing games at the time.
6671000	6672000	And you had two game modes.
6672000	6675000	You had an easy drive with an automatic transition and slower gameplay,
6675000	6679000	or a technical drive that was manual transmission with faster gameplay.
6679000	6687000	It also featured a Dunlop style tire bridge over the track with the text of Namco on it.
6687000	6691000	And, you know, it had many musical things in common with Final Lap.
6691000	6695000	It also had a rear view mirror so you could see what was behind you.
6695000	6697000	And of course it had two sequels, like I mentioned.
6697000	6700000	Winning Run, Suzuka Grand Prix, and Winning Run 91.
6700000	6705000	Driver's Eyes, also that was on the same hardware,
6705000	6712000	was a three-monitor game that was considered in the family but not a true sequel.
6712000	6716000	At any rate, it was a really, really successful game too.
6716000	6720000	Famicon Tsushin, which was the arcade earnings chart,
6720000	6728000	had it hit number one in August of 1989, so that was almost a year later.
6728000	6731000	The first game that overtook it was actually Super Monaco GP,
6731000	6734000	so another thing at the same time.
6734000	6738000	At any rate, it was also super well received in Europe.
6738000	6741000	It got really great reviews.
6741000	6745000	And then, I mean, really it just got so many raves over,
6745000	6750000	especially since it did push early 3D back in the day.
6750000	6754000	I'm trying to find what other releases came out.
6754000	6759000	It doesn't have it all listed together.
6759000	6764000	But it actually did get a mention in Commodore User back in the day
6764000	6767000	when it was starting to come out in the UK.
6767000	6769000	And basically most of the...
6769000	6772000	Yeah, it doesn't look like it ever got any kind of home release from what I can see.
6772000	6778000	This definitely looks like a game of an era when hard drive-in...
6778000	6783000	You know those very polygon-heavy, creating 3D experiences of these huge polygons?
6783000	6787000	I mean, those of you that are kind of watching it on Twitch with us
6787000	6789000	are probably like, boy, this definitely looks dated,
6789000	6793000	but this is definitely a product of its time.
6793000	6797000	There were a lot of similar games, and the consoles couldn't frickin' do it.
6797000	6800000	They did an NES or SNES version of stunt drive-in or one of those.
6800000	6803000	It was kind of terrible.
6803000	6807000	Well, yeah. But now look at just the playthrough here, right?
6807000	6810000	And just see the general layout and how things are lined up.
6810000	6813000	Tell me of another Namco game that this makes you think of.
6813000	6816000	When I saw the map, I thought Pole Position.
6816000	6820000	I know that's Atari. But then, of course, obviously the logical step would be Ridge Racer.
6820000	6824000	Exactly. A lot of the track layout and elements...
6824000	6827000	I firmly believe Ridge Racer would have been a nod back to this one.
6827000	6830000	Even though this one's still a Formula One-style game,
6830000	6832000	it has so much in common with it.
6832000	6836000	It even looks like it flows like Ridge Racer does.
6836000	6840000	I wouldn't doubt that they looked at this game
6840000	6844000	to bring it into the modern era to make it Ridge Racer.
6844000	6847000	By the way, I'm out of footage, so I've got to come back to us to the studio.
6847000	6849000	That's all I have, anyway.
6849000	6852000	Well, there it is. Your classic game of the week. Winning run.
6852000	6855000	It was neat because, again, even though it's definitely...
6855000	6858000	I think that's an important racing game because without that game,
6858000	6861000	you probably wouldn't have what you have today with Ridge Racer.
6861000	6864000	When was the last time they did a Ridge Racer game? It's been a while.
6864000	6866000	Wasn't it R7?
6866000	6872000	No, they had the one for the Vita, and then they did one for PC and consoles.
6872000	6874000	But it wasn't really the Ridge Racer team.
6874000	6881000	It was the guys at Bugbearer, I think, that did those games.
6881000	6885000	Actually, Dr. Suya in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,
6885000	6888000	actually, pole position was Namco in Japan.
6888000	6895000	So when I called out that track, maybe pole position led to this in some ways.
6895000	6897000	It's indeed possible.
6897000	6901000	I actually will tell you what my inspiration for picking Winning 11 was.
6901000	6902000	You mean Winning Run?
6902000	6903000	Winning Run, sorry.
6903000	6905000	Winning 11 is a different game, yes.
6905000	6910000	One of the YouTube channels I like to watch, Retro Core, does Battle of the Ports.
6910000	6913000	And I was watching the pole position Battle of the Ports.
6913000	6916000	And I was like, I know Namco did another game that we never got over here,
6916000	6918000	so it sort of sent me down that rabbit hole.
6918000	6922000	And it was Winning Run, so I was like, that's what inspired me to do it.
6922000	6925000	And if you guys have never watched Retro Core's stuff,
6925000	6928000	I mean, he's funny and some of his assessments are not at all right
6928000	6930000	and his grammar is terrible.
6930000	6934000	I'm not judging because, I mean, seriously.
6934000	6938000	But anyway, go definitely watch his videos because they are top notch.
6938000	6939000	All right.
6939000	6941000	Classic Game of the Week is Winning Run.
6941000	6942000	Good pick.
6942000	6944000	That was a very educational pick this week because, again,
6944000	6947000	I think that's a game that a lot of people have heard of.
6947000	6950000	Well, I know a game a lot of you guys have been hearing about this week
6950000	6954000	is Blaster Master Zero 2, thanks to the Nindies.
6954000	6957000	So we're going to take a moment here to go to a prerecorded bit here
6957000	6959000	from earlier today with me.
6961000	6962000	Okay. Hello, everybody.
6962000	6964000	I thought for our prerecorded segment this week,
6964000	6969000	we could take a look at the just released Blaster Master Zero Part 2,
6969000	6971000	which I'm sure at this point we've talked about earlier in the show
6971000	6973000	as it was kind of that surprise announcement
6973000	6976000	during Nintendo's presentation this week during their Nindies event
6976000	6980000	that this Blaster Master Zero Part 2 was available today.
6980000	6984000	And certainly, you know, for fans of the first Blaster Master game,
6984000	6987000	it probably left folks feeling like, oh, well,
6987000	6989000	the first Blaster Master was a reimagining of, obviously,
6989000	6993000	that first Blaster Master game from the NES so long ago.
6993000	6994000	Where are they going to go with the sequel?
6994000	6998000	Because, yes, I think many of us know that the original Blaster Master
6998000	7002000	had sequels on the Genesis and what there was that Wii game
7002000	7004000	that was a reimagining a while ago.
7004000	7005000	I think there was one on the Game Boy as well.
7005000	7009000	But let's be real, none of those were particularly good.
7009000	7012000	So I think it kind of left this Blaster Master,
7012000	7015000	and I'm going back into the opening sequence here,
7015000	7018000	where it kind of sets the tone for the game while I'm talking,
7018000	7020000	it kind of leaves Blaster Master Zero Part 2
7020000	7022000	to do something a little bit more original.
7022000	7025000	So if you actually kind of watch this opening sequence
7025000	7028000	where it's basically recapping the events of the first game,
7028000	7031000	you learn that Jason, you know, obviously the frog jumped in
7031000	7034000	and got lost, which I think many classic game fans know
7034000	7037000	is the plot of the original Blaster Master games.
7037000	7040000	But something new that they kind of introduced in Blaster Master Zero
7040000	7042000	when they did the reimagining of the Switch
7042000	7044000	is that there was this other character, Eve,
7044000	7047000	which is funny because Eve was one of the characters
7047000	7049000	that was actually in that Blaster Master book
7049000	7054000	when you had those like Worlds of Power books by FX9 some time ago.
7054000	7057000	So it was kind of interesting because that ended up being
7057000	7059000	like a canon thing due to Blaster Master Zero.
7059000	7062000	Anyway, it's kind of funky how the whole thing works.
7062000	7065000	But the plot and the setup for this new, I guess, original story
7065000	7069000	that Inti Creates is making with Blaster Master Zero Part 2
7069000	7072000	is that Eve got infected with a parasite.
7072000	7075000	Yes, she became Parasite Eve.
7075000	7077000	And so she got infected with a parasite,
7077000	7080000	so they're going to go to Eve's homeworld, Sophia,
7080000	7083000	to find the cure, I guess, for this plague.
7083000	7085000	So that's where this game sets up here.
7085000	7087000	So we're looking at the menu,
7087000	7089000	and if you kind of look at the how to play section,
7089000	7091000	and actually this is my very first time looking at it.
7091000	7093000	I didn't really prep this in advance.
7093000	7095000	I just thought, oh, I'll just kind of do a quick little playthrough
7095000	7098000	since we don't want to spend a whole lot of time during the show,
7098000	7100000	but give ourselves a little break in studio.
7100000	7103000	We can kind of look at kind of generally what this game looks like
7103000	7104000	and how it works.
7104000	7106000	And you can even look at from this how to play menu
7106000	7109000	is that you have a lot of the same features
7109000	7110000	that you're kind of used to in Blaster Master.
7110000	7113000	It doesn't look like they invented a lot of original things,
7113000	7116000	except I'm not sure what it's trying to say
7116000	7119000	with one of these screens here where you can see that the,
7119000	7121000	and again, I know there's folks listening on the podcast,
7121000	7122000	you can't see these screens,
7122000	7124000	but there's one where the vehicle is falling
7124000	7126000	all the way down to the bottom,
7126000	7128000	and it's got some type of like,
7128000	7130000	I don't know if that's supposed to be like a climb or a move
7130000	7131000	or something.
7131000	7133000	I'm just not connecting to a special move from the first game.
7133000	7136000	Maybe somebody in chat is probably yelling it out right now.
7136000	7139000	But it also looks like they may have changed the top down view a bit,
7139000	7140000	that portion of the game.
7140000	7142000	That's what it looks like in the second menu
7142000	7144000	is that it looks like it's more of like a slanted view.
7144000	7146000	So I'm excited to try to at least in this little segment here
7146000	7148000	get to one of those sections
7148000	7150000	because I want to see if that looks any different
7150000	7152000	because this how to play definitely makes it look like
7152000	7153000	it might be a little bit different.
7153000	7154000	So let's get to it.
7154000	7155000	I'm going to jump into the game
7155000	7157000	and just kind of see where it throws us off here.
7157000	7160000	So like the first game you have several different save slots
7160000	7162000	and I wonder if they aren't going to be planning to expand it
7162000	7164000	with DLC later on
7164000	7166000	like they did the original Blaster Master Zero
7166000	7168000	is that you can play with all these other characters
7168000	7170000	that weren't really connected to Blaster Master,
7170000	7174000	but it was kind of neat to see them in the game anyway.
7174000	7176000	So all right, here we are.
7176000	7178000	So we're going to a new planet
7178000	7181000	and the original cutscenes kind of set that up that we saw earlier.
7181000	7183000	So now we have Jason saying it was close.
7183000	7186000	We touched down right before our energy ran out.
7186000	7188000	Eve is the Gaia system holding up
7188000	7191000	and you can see if you're looking on the Twitch stream
7191000	7193000	you can kind of see Eve's got that little
7193000	7194000	she looks sick.
7194000	7196000	She looks like she might be part zombie there.
7196000	7198000	So that's part of the story here.
7198000	7200000	So yes, things are converted
7200000	7202000	and I'm sure it's probably setting things up here
7202000	7204000	to be like, oh, but the thing is powerless.
7204000	7206000	You're going to have to find all the features
7206000	7211000	that's a true landmark of any Metroidvania game
7211000	7213000	and you're going to have to go around and find everything.
7213000	7215000	So, all right.
7215000	7218000	So it should allow for limitless planet exploration.
7218000	7220000	So I guess when you fall, you get SP
7220000	7222000	and maybe that's what that how to play thing
7222000	7223000	was saying earlier.
7223000	7225000	I'm not sure.
7225000	7227000	I see no more hover functions.
7227000	7229000	So you're going to have to kind of find that.
7229000	7232000	So, yeah.
7232000	7234000	So as the dialogue is going on,
7234000	7235000	we're kind of learning about that.
7235000	7238000	Oh, the car is a little broken, but that makes sense.
7238000	7242000	You know, you got to start over since it is a new game.
7242000	7244000	So hopefully we'll get through these cut scenes here.
7244000	7245000	All right. There we go.
7245000	7246000	Now I can play.
7246000	7247000	So, yeah. Oh, yeah.
7247000	7249000	This feels very similar to the first game
7249000	7251000	where you can drive around in the car right now.
7251000	7254000	You can it looks like immediately right away
7254000	7257000	fire through bricks, which was a power up in the older games.
7257000	7258000	So kind of interesting.
7258000	7260000	They give you that feature right off the bat
7260000	7262000	and it looks like there might be some
7262000	7266000	you can see some things on the screen,
7266000	7267000	but they're a little high up.
7267000	7268000	So I can't get them yet.
7268000	7269000	So it's one of those classic.
7269000	7271000	You got to come all the way back to the beginning
7271000	7272000	probably to get those lists.
7272000	7274000	There's something I'm not thinking of,
7274000	7277000	which that very, very possibly could be the case.
7277000	7281000	So now they're kind of setting up some of the story that
7281000	7284000	there are, in fact, aliens on this planet, too,
7284000	7287000	that are bad and you're going to have to kill those.
7287000	7292000	So there's it's talking about the SP conversion still.
7292000	7298000	And basically, that's how you power your special attacks,
7298000	7302000	it sounds like.
7302000	7304000	So it sounds like that could be an interesting
7304000	7308000	kind of limited feature.
7308000	7310000	So it said, oh, yeah, look at that.
7310000	7313000	When I fell a long way, bam, it converted.
7313000	7316000	That's kind of an interesting little feature.
7316000	7318000	I want to see how that plays out.
7318000	7320000	Now, how do I?
7320000	7321000	Oh, there we go.
7321000	7324000	Okay, so you can actually choose by holding the L button
7324000	7327000	what it is you want to fire.
7327000	7330000	I don't know if you use the L button to fire.
7330000	7332000	Ah, no, it's the A button.
7332000	7334000	Gotcha.
7334000	7336000	Okay, so I just killed a little crab
7336000	7338000	and I had to hit him with the missiles first
7338000	7340000	and then kind of attack him.
7340000	7342000	So I bet if I fall from the...
7342000	7346000	Oh, that's an interesting way to recover special units
7346000	7350000	is to have to fall from a distance to do that.
7350000	7352000	Hmm, kind of interesting.
7352000	7353000	All right, so now there's...
7353000	7356000	Okay, let's see if we can...
7356000	7358000	So you have to really time this right
7358000	7361000	to hit him with the missiles and then fire at him.
7361000	7363000	All right, let's see.
7363000	7365000	Obviously, I can't spend too long looking at this game
7365000	7367000	because I know we're going to want to get back to the show
7367000	7369000	before too long, but I want to see if I can get to one of those
7369000	7371000	top-down sequences to see how that plays.
7371000	7373000	So hopefully there's one of them before too long.
7373000	7375000	All right, there's a save spot.
7375000	7377000	We know those.
7377000	7380000	So that saves the game.
7380000	7383000	Aha, there's one of those little doors.
7383000	7387000	So we will have to go hop in there.
7387000	7390000	And they're saying that with the dialogue as well.
7390000	7392000	And how convenient.
7392000	7394000	Eve can't leave and go with you to help fight.
7394000	7397000	She's stuck in the car because of her sickness.
7397000	7400000	That's what they're kind of saying there in the dialogue there.
7400000	7404000	All right, let's see.
7404000	7407000	I get through lots of dialogue, lots of press an A.
7407000	7408000	All right, ribbit, ribbit.
7408000	7411000	Okay, let's see.
7411000	7412000	Here we go.
7412000	7414000	So I'm making our way down to this little.
7414000	7421000	Okay, so there's a ladder here, but it's one that we're going to have to exit.
7421000	7425000	But this also means now Jason can't really fall a great distance.
7425000	7428000	Ooh, there we go.
7428000	7432000	I had to kneel down there because I got hit with a bullet.
7432000	7434000	Oh, tricky.
7434000	7436000	I lost a little bit of health doing that, but I made it to the door.
7436000	7438000	So now he can see the top-down sequence.
7438000	7440000	So it's loading, and here we are.
7440000	7441000	Oh, it does.
7441000	7447000	Okay, it kind of, it does look like the first game in a lot of ways.
7447000	7450000	But Jason definitely looks like overpowered.
7450000	7456000	Like he looks like he's definitely grown a lot since the events of the first game.
7456000	7459000	And obviously, again, for those on the podcast that are listening
7459000	7464000	and can't see the visuals right now, you know, it's got a definitely unique sort of skin to it
7464000	7466000	that doesn't look like the planet from the first game.
7466000	7471000	It looks a little more like this kind of purpley planet that we fell onto.
7471000	7477000	But otherwise, a lot of the gameplay still kind of feels like the first game,
7477000	7480000	although you have things like floating platforms and things.
7480000	7483000	Okay, so you had to push that platform down.
7483000	7487000	And that's how you get your first item, a map.
7487000	7488000	We found it.
7488000	7492000	Oh, and the frog is very happy, and he made a little portal up here
7492000	7496000	that immediately warps me out the door so I don't have to walk all the way back.
7496000	7498000	Well, that's a convenient feature.
7498000	7499000	I sure like that.
7499000	7500000	So let's see.
7500000	7502000	So he should have given me a map, which where would I see that?
7502000	7503000	Would I see that?
7503000	7504000	Oh, there we go.
7504000	7506000	So you can actually see now a map of the area,
7506000	7509000	and you can see where the other items are and where the boss is,
7509000	7512000	and we can start to make our way from here.
7512000	7515000	So all right, we got to take just a quick peek,
7515000	7518000	but we wanted to take a look and see what it looks like in motion,
7518000	7521000	and definitely something I want to explore a little bit more later
7521000	7524000	because now Inti Creates kind of has this canvas
7524000	7527000	where they're not beholden to the original story anymore.
7527000	7529000	And even though I think they did a really good job
7529000	7533000	with the first Blaster Master Zero of reinterpreting the first game
7533000	7535000	but kind of doing their own thing with it,
7535000	7538000	even though some people criticized it for being too easy,
7538000	7542000	I think a lot of us kind of look back at the original Blaster Master and go,
7542000	7545000	that's a really hard game to beat, especially in one sitting
7545000	7547000	like you used to have to do back in the day.
7547000	7550000	So I think Blaster Master Zero kind of tried to make it a little bit easier
7550000	7553000	but then had some more challenging modes with the different characters
7553000	7557000	and the difficult modes that they added in there as well.
7557000	7560000	So I'm very interested to see what more they do with this different canvas.
7560000	7562000	It sounds like you might be going between different planets
7562000	7564000	and other things like that.
7564000	7568000	So there it is, a first look at Blaster Master Zero Part 2
7568000	7571000	because apparently the first one sold well enough.
7571000	7573000	So good job, Engine Creates.
7573000	7575000	They're making some great games so far.
7575000	7578000	So we're going to go back to the studio.
7578000	7581000	Okay, we are back. Thank you, me.
7581000	7584000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio In Progress tonight
7584000	7592000	on March 24th, 2019, and episode number 769 already in progress.
7592000	7594000	We are going to get into some rapid-fire news here shortly,
7594000	7597000	but I know a few weeks ago on the show here, Dark Soccer,
7597000	7600000	you were giving a shout-out to another podcast doing a little plug there.
7600000	7604000	For our old OLR pals that used to be here a lot, Chris and Meg Z,
7604000	7606000	although they moved.
7606000	7609000	But you got a lot of positive feedback from plugging podcasts,
7609000	7612000	and we always say support indie podcasts.
7612000	7613000	Precisely.
7613000	7614000	Here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7614000	7615000	So you want to give another one a shout-out tonight?
7615000	7619000	I do, and I'm going to be taking suggestions from people on Twitter.
7619000	7622000	So if you've got one that you would like to have a shout-out to
7622000	7627000	as long as they are like non-hateful asshole podcasts.
7628000	7631000	I mean, if they're not asshole podcasts, I will.
7631000	7632000	You know what I mean.
7632000	7634000	I had a show called The Asshole Podcast. Oh, well.
7634000	7636000	Was it about bleached assholes?
7636000	7637000	No.
7637000	7640000	Okay, then. So I don't care. Anyway.
7640000	7642000	But if it was about bleached assholes, you would care?
7642000	7644000	We would point it to Extrofer.
7644000	7646000	Let's not ruin the shout-out.
7646000	7651000	Anyway, so the suggestion on Twitter comes from SpringTieMe,
7651000	7656000	and it's a podcast called Riptide Podcast.
7656000	7661000	It is a pinball podcast for women in pinball, in competitive pinball.
7661000	7664000	I'm sorry, I got the name wrong. Riptide Pinball Podcast.
7664000	7666000	And it's at Riptide Podcast.
7666000	7668000	You can find them on iTunes.
7668000	7672000	I didn't see anything super recent, but I guess it does it during, you know, releases and whatnot.
7672000	7678000	But at any rate, I definitely want to give them a shout-out.
7678000	7681000	We need more women in pinball, especially competitive pinball.
7681000	7684000	We have a ladies' league up here.
7684000	7686000	I'm not competitive, so I don't want to play.
7686000	7688000	I just like to play and lose by myself.
7688000	7690000	But at any rate...
7690000	7692000	Literally in the privacy of your own home.
7692000	7694000	In the privacy of my own home.
7694000	7698000	Even when Dan's not there, or he's asleep, and Midna's in the other room.
7698000	7701000	So she's not judging me with her cat eyes.
7701000	7704000	But anyway, so yeah, give them a check-out.
7704000	7707000	Alright, thanks for the tweet, and thanks for the shout-out.
7707000	7709000	Send me more suggestions. It's at DarkSakura.
7709000	7713000	Or you could probably send them to the show on Twitter, and I could pass them along too.
7713000	7716000	But I want more people to talk to me on Twitter.
7716000	7718000	Are you lonely on Twitter?
7718000	7720000	A little bit. I'm trying to give my Twitter more attention,
7720000	7723000	and really put more focus on games, unless it's yelling at politicians.
7723000	7724000	Alright.
7724000	7727000	Okay, let's move on to some rapid-fire news,
7727000	7729000	and talk about some other things going on in the game industry right now.
7729000	7731000	Loki, we'll start with you.
7731000	7733000	So Nintendo was doing their directs.
7733000	7737000	Microsoft has their little thing that they do.
7737000	7741000	Now Sony's joining in the game with their state of play live broadcast.
7741000	7743000	Inside Xbox is what you're trying to think of.
7743000	7745000	Whatever, I don't give a shit.
7745000	7749000	So they have their state of play,
7749000	7753000	and they're doing live broadcasts to talk about different games that are coming out,
7753000	7755000	and their platform announcements and whatnot.
7755000	7758000	So the first state of play is going to be March 25th,
7758000	7761000	at 2 p.m. Pacific time, 5 p.m. Eastern.
7761000	7764000	And they're going to show something.
7764000	7766000	Hurray!
7766000	7768000	Hurray!
7768000	7771000	Well, remember, Sony's not doing E3 this year,
7771000	7774000	so they're going to be showing the PlayStation 5.
7774000	7776000	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
7776000	7779000	But wouldn't that be a gag if they did?
7779000	7781000	No, I think they would give us a little more announcement.
7781000	7783000	Probably some unreleased PS4 games,
7783000	7785000	some things to carry them through the summer and the rest of the year.
7785000	7787000	Very similar to what we would see if Nintendo said,
7787000	7788000	we've got to direct tomorrow.
7788000	7790000	It would be a very similar sort of thing.
7790000	7791000	Yeah, we'll see.
7791000	7793000	And then, of course, as usual, Bethesda's announced
7793000	7795000	that they're going to be doing their E3 press conference
7795000	7797000	right in the middle of our goddamn show.
7797000	7801000	So, 5 p.m. Pacific time on Sunday, June 9th.
7801000	7803000	So, of course, we'll be interrupting for that.
7803000	7805000	Hurray!
7805000	7806000	Hurray!
7806000	7809000	Hopefully, we won't be disappointed by their announcements.
7809000	7814000	Alright, moving on, talking about Apex Legends.
7814000	7817000	There is a new patch for Apex Legends on PC.
7817000	7821000	So, apparently, there were a lot of crashing issues for Apex Legends on PC.
7821000	7825000	So, Respawn went and did some tweaking with the game,
7825000	7826000	and they did a patch.
7826000	7829000	So, it's supposed to be some stability, some performance issues.
7829000	7835000	It also capped the frames per second on PC to 300.
7835000	7839000	So, you can get no more than 300 frames a second on PC.
7839000	7843000	And if you're getting 300 frames a second, you must have a BBBC.
7843000	7846000	But anyway, also, apparently, it will actually,
7846000	7849000	when the game crashes, it will do like a text dump.
7849000	7851000	So, you can learn more about, I guess, why it's crashing.
7851000	7853000	So, that's kind of neat.
7853000	7856000	Also, it should be mentioned that there was a new champion,
7856000	7858000	or what is it called, a legend?
7858000	7859000	I don't know what they call the fighter's name,
7859000	7864000	but Octane is the newest playable person.
7864000	7868000	No, no, he doesn't look like one of the psychos from Borderlands at all.
7868000	7871000	He also kind of has like the Junkrat thing going on.
7871000	7877000	I think his legs are replaced with, they're not like...
7877000	7878000	What did you mean, cybernetic?
7878000	7881000	Yeah, I think they're cybernetic legs or something, I don't know.
7881000	7883000	They're not, they don't look like...
7883000	7885000	They look enhanced or something.
7885000	7886000	They've got magic legs.
7886000	7888000	Yes, we'll say that.
7888000	7891000	A lot of people are very excited about this news,
7891000	7892000	which was kind of released a long...
7892000	7895000	I know I say that GDC is not the place for game announcements,
7895000	7899000	but here's one that was announced during the GDC timeframe,
7899000	7903000	Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2.
7903000	7907000	So, there is going to be a second game, that's pretty cool.
7907000	7909000	The game is going to be in 2020.
7909000	7913000	It is a sequel to the original Bloodlines that was out on PC and console,
7913000	7915000	and if you're a fan of Vampire the Masquerade,
7915000	7917000	this might be something that you're into.
7917000	7919000	I know a lot of people I saw on Twitter were excited about that.
7919000	7922000	This game is being developed by Hardsuit Labs,
7922000	7925000	and the story involves a vampire insurrection,
7925000	7928000	where you're going to be making an alliance with warring clans,
7928000	7933000	and there's politics and volatile climates and all sorts of fun things.
7933000	7936000	They had a lot of announcements during GDC, actually, for games.
7936000	7938000	Pre-order now for 60 bucks.
7938000	7943000	Because I was watching the Unity press event thing that they were doing,
7943000	7947000	and they showed off a new trailer for System Shock 3,
7947000	7950000	and they announced Call of Duty Mobile.
7950000	7953000	That's kind of the weirdest place to do that, but okay,
7953000	7955000	because it's built on Unity.
7955000	7957000	That's going to be a big mobile thing.
7957000	7961000	Yeah, and I'm not to say they never talk about games at GDC,
7961000	7963000	and certainly indie developers get their games out there,
7963000	7965000	but it's just like, it's not E3.
7965000	7969000	And I think people kind of have it in the right perspective now,
7969000	7971000	but there was definitely a period of time where people thought,
7971000	7974000	oh, GDC is like a mini E3.
7974000	7975000	Not really.
7975000	7977000	Not really. It's for the developer audience,
7977000	7979000	but because it's for developers,
7979000	7983000	sometimes you get, these are the new tools to be developed on.
7983000	7985000	But sure, sometimes developers are going to want to show off here,
7985000	7986000	is what we've been working on.
7986000	7988000	So you get some game announcements.
7988000	7991000	And again, this is a pretty big deal to some people.
7991000	7993000	Questbuster in our chat, yay, Bloodlines 2.
7993000	7996000	And I think there's a lot of people that are saying yay to this.
7996000	7998000	We have a few more rapid-fire stories,
7998000	8000000	but they're coming from Dark Sakura.
8000000	8005000	Yep. Well, one might remember that I talked about
8005000	8013000	Pierre Taki, who played Hamura Kyouhei in Judgment Eyes in Japan.
8013000	8019000	They pulled the game out of sales because he had been busted for cocaine.
8019000	8022000	They're actually fully removing him from the game,
8022000	8025000	replacing his model with a different character
8025000	8028000	in different Japanese voice acting or a different actor
8028000	8031000	to be released in the Western market and redone in Japan.
8031000	8036000	So those first original release copies, kind of rare. Someone find me one.
8036000	8040000	He's being replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog.
8040000	8041000	Fucking A.
8041000	8045000	Who thought we'd have a highly collectible type of game here
8045000	8048000	in the year 2019 like this, in the age of digital distribution?
8048000	8050000	But this is going to be a rare game
8050000	8052000	if you can get the one that has the original guy in it.
8052000	8054000	Someone get it for me.
8054000	8057000	And then in other news, EverQuest turned 20.
8057000	8060000	Yay. People are still fucking playing EverQuest.
8060000	8062000	It's hard to let it go, man.
8062000	8066000	So they're celebrating with new progression servers,
8066000	8073000	new in-game events, and 50% experience point bonus through March.
8073000	8075000	So, yay.
8075000	8078000	As Jason kind of alluded to in tonight's intro,
8078000	8082000	this is one of those stories where on Facebook all the time
8082000	8085000	we see these stories about such and such turns XX today.
8085000	8087000	Oh, no. Here's the big one.
8087000	8089000	Do you know that in theaters this week,
8089000	8092000	they have Cruel Intentions re-released in theaters?
8092000	8095000	The movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe and all that.
8095000	8098000	Do you know why they re-released it in theaters this week?
8098000	8102000	Because the movie turned 20 years old.
8102000	8105000	And it's one of those things where we're like, thanks.
8105000	8107000	I didn't need a reminder.
8107000	8109000	I know, right? I didn't need a reminder how old that was.
8109000	8111000	Thanks. Appreciate that.
8111000	8112000	And there you go.
8112000	8115000	I know SSG and her mad just replied with a bunch of dots.
8115000	8116000	Right?
8116000	8117000	And I was like, wait, wait.
8117000	8119000	Cruel Intentions is like 20 years old.
8119000	8120000	You know I've never seen it, right?
8120000	8121000	Oh, really?
8121000	8125000	It's like it's not an Oscar movie.
8125000	8128000	Should we have like a 90s?
8128000	8130000	We should go to the theater and see it.
8130000	8131000	Although, here's the problem.
8131000	8132000	I do want to see that.
8132000	8135000	But I also, now that I know it's not super gory
8135000	8136000	because I asked somebody about it,
8136000	8137000	I really want to see us.
8137000	8138000	Me too.
8138000	8140000	Although I understand that if you are a bunny lover,
8140000	8141000	then there is sadness.
8141000	8142000	Oh, no.
8142000	8143000	Like Fatal Attraction.
8143000	8144000	That's depressing.
8144000	8145000	I don't know.
8145000	8146000	Then my sister should see it.
8146000	8147000	Oh, my God.
8147000	8148000	My sister loves bunnies.
8148000	8150000	Well, I saw it when someone warned Marissa.
8150000	8151000	Okay.
8151000	8153000	Because you know she has her spotted bunny named Snoopy.
8153000	8154000	Oh, yeah.
8154000	8155000	Okay.
8155000	8157000	But apparently it does actually contribute to the storyline.
8157000	8158000	Okay.
8158000	8159000	Oh, boy.
8159000	8160000	All right.
8160000	8161000	That's one of those.
8161000	8162000	Because that's one of those,
8162000	8165000	even though you may not want the minor story spoiler or whatever,
8165000	8167000	it's still one of those things where it's like,
8167000	8170000	why they have websites of does the dog die or what is it?
8170000	8172000	There's some website where you can go
8172000	8176000	and you can check on any film to see if the dog dies.
8176000	8177000	So that way, you know,
8177000	8179000	like I ain't seeing this movie because I know the dog.
8179000	8182000	I wish I had been warned about Drag Me to Hell.
8182000	8183000	Cat.
8183000	8184000	Hold up.
8184000	8185000	Hold up.
8185000	8186000	Hold up.
8186000	8188000	You went to see a movie called Drag Me to Hell.
8188000	8190000	Because Tiara wanted to see it.
8190000	8194000	But you were shocked by something in a movie called Drag Me to Hell.
8194000	8195000	I wasn't shocked.
8195000	8199000	The only reason I saw it is because it was a Sam Raimi movie.
8199000	8200000	Okay.
8200000	8201000	It wasn't really all that fucking good.
8201000	8205000	I mean, she liked it, but I just didn't understand.
8205000	8209000	I would have liked to have been warned if a cat was being sacrificed in a movie.
8209000	8210000	Okay.
8210000	8211000	Oh, yeah.
8211000	8212000	Yeah.
8212000	8214000	But at any rate, Drag Me to Hell is really stupid.
8214000	8215000	I really did not like that movie.
8215000	8216000	Tiger Claw.
8216000	8217000	Speaking of old.
8217000	8219000	And then we'll move into release dates.
8219000	8222000	Tiger Claw on chat is talking about that it's C2E2,
8222000	8224000	the big Chicago event that was this week.
8224000	8226000	They had a clueless reunion.
8226000	8227000	They sure did.
8227000	8231000	Except, rest in peace, Brittany Murphy wouldn't have been able to be a part of that.
8231000	8233000	But I think they had everybody else involved.
8233000	8238000	I don't think Stacey Dash was there, but, you know, everybody else was.
8238000	8239000	So, that could be.
8239000	8241000	But rest in peace, Brittany Murphy.
8241000	8246000	And in my opinion, although Brittany Murphy is fabulous in the movie Clueless,
8246000	8250000	if you really want an underrated Brittany Murphy role
8250000	8256000	and an underrated movie in general, you need to go see the cult comedy classic Drop Dead Gorgeous.
8256000	8258000	It's perfect.
8258000	8259000	I love that movie.
8259000	8264000	By the way, I just got a black cat in Animal Crossing named Kiki.
8264000	8267000	Oh, the universe heard you calling out for more kitties.
8267000	8268000	I needed a Kiki.
8268000	8269000	All right.
8269000	8273000	Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some things that are not 20 years old.
8273000	8276000	They're brand new as they are released in different parts of the world, starting with the US.
8276000	8278000	How ironic that you would transition with that.
8278000	8287000	Because our first release for this week is none other than the brand new Final Fantasy VII on the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.
8287000	8293000	And then we have Generation Zero on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8293000	8297000	MLB The Show 19 on PlayStation 4.
8297000	8302000	Outward on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8302000	8305000	Space Junkies on PC.
8305000	8308000	I guess that's, I thought that was already, maybe that was early access.
8308000	8312000	Now it's coming out of early access, which is a VR game.
8312000	8316000	Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel on PC.
8316000	8318000	Or I'm sorry, PlayStation 4.
8318000	8322000	The Princess Guide on Switch and PlayStation 4.
8322000	8325000	The Walking Dead, the final season, Episode 4.
8325000	8330000	Take us back on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and...
8330000	8334000	Is that like the former Telltale stuff that got picked up by...
8334000	8335000	Yeah, yeah.
8335000	8336000	Okay.
8336000	8338000	So they're releasing another episode of it.
8338000	8340000	Who picked that up? Somebody, it was a logical...
8340000	8345000	Anyway, anyways, PC Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
8345000	8351000	Xenon Racer on PC Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8351000	8354000	And we've got a couple more for this week.
8354000	8357000	Fun Fun Animal Park on the Switch.
8358000	8361000	Assassin's Creed 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8361000	8363000	I'm assuming that's the remaster.
8363000	8364000	Yeah.
8364000	8367000	And finally on the Switch, Yoshi's Crafted World.
8367000	8368000	Oh, cool.
8368000	8369000	That's it.
8369000	8370000	Alright.
8370000	8372000	Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.
8372000	8378000	In Japan this week we have, on the PlayStation 4, we have Remilore,
8378000	8381000	is a game that's out this week, as well as winning post 9.
8381000	8384000	So we've talked about winning run, winning 11,
8384000	8387000	and now winning post 9 is out in Japan this week.
8387000	8389000	And a game called Full Kiss.
8389000	8391000	We just need a game called Winning!
8391000	8395000	Starring Charlie Sheen.
8395000	8398000	No, just a game called Winning. Starring me, because I'm winning.
8398000	8404000	The Lego Movie 2 video game gets a Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 4.
8404000	8405000	It's different.
8405000	8406000	It's different.
8406000	8410000	Did I mention Full Kiss in a regular and full version that's out this week as well?
8410000	8413000	Call of Cthulhu gets a Japanese release this week as well.
8413000	8419000	And Memories Off, innocent file for dearest, in a regular and limited edition.
8419000	8426000	And Utaware Urumono, there's two versions of that releasing this week on the PlayStation 4.
8426000	8430000	And then one other game that's coming out this week, Konosuba,
8430000	8435000	God's blessing on this wonderful world, the labyrinth of hope and gathering of adventurers.
8435000	8436000	That is the name.
8436000	8438000	Sign me the fuck up.
8438000	8439000	That sounds epic as fuck.
8439000	8442000	That's a very long title, but that is out.
8442000	8446000	I want to fucking climb a mountain now.
8446000	8453000	Anyway, the main character is Kazuma and parties alongside Aqua, Megumin, Darkness,
8453000	8456000	and one other character to make a five person party.
8456000	8461000	It looks like a very basic old school RPG, but on the PlayStation 4.
8461000	8464000	And when you go through the story, you get new costumes.
8464000	8465000	Whoopee!
8465000	8469000	To quote Mystery Science Theater 3000, whoopty shit.
8469000	8476000	On the Switch this week, Winning Post 9 is out there, Remolore, Diabolic Lovers, Chaos Lineage,
8476000	8480000	and the LEGO Movie 2 video game is out in Japan as well on the Switch.
8480000	8482000	Memories Off, innocent file for dearest.
8482000	8486000	So a lot of those same games also on the Switch this week.
8486000	8488000	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
8488000	8489000	Oh, a bunch of stuff.
8489000	8492000	We have The Walking Dead, the final season.
8492000	8495000	All these that I'm naming right now are on the 25th.
8495000	8498000	Outward, we have Space Junkies.
8498000	8502000	We have Xenon Racer for the major three.
8502000	8505000	We have Generation Zero, looks like a mecha game.
8505000	8508000	Dragon Marked for Death, which looks really fun.
8508000	8509000	That's going to be on Switch.
8509000	8510000	Squishies.
8510000	8512000	Squishy!
8512000	8515000	Kingdom Hearts, the story so far on PlayStation.
8515000	8517000	Actually, that's the 20th.
8517000	8520000	Squishies, Dragon, and Kingdom Hearts are all on the 28th.
8520000	8525000	And also on the 28th is Nelke and the Legendary Alchemists,
8525000	8530000	Tropico 6, and The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel,
8530000	8535000	and Yoshi's Crafted World, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered.
8535000	8536000	That's it.
8536000	8539000	All right, going to some comments in chat,
8539000	8541000	Act F is talking about Konosuba.
8541000	8542000	It is an anime.
8542000	8543000	It's very popular.
8543000	8548000	The story is about a guy who dies and gets transported to an RPG-esque world.
8549000	8550000	Interesting.
8550000	8555000	Speaking of animes, did you know that Ingress anime is finally coming out in the US?
8555000	8556000	Yeah, isn't that coming out soon?
8556000	8558000	Finally. It was supposed to come out last year in late November.
8558000	8560000	I think it's been out in Japan.
8560000	8562000	It's already done in Japan, I think.
8562000	8565000	Finally hitting Netflix, I think, the end of April is when that's finally coming out.
8565000	8567000	It better have the option for subtitles.
8567000	8569000	Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.
8569000	8571000	Most of the Netflix anime stuff is pretty good about that.
8571000	8575000	So anyway, let's get to our mailbag every week.
8575000	8576000	You guys email us.
8576000	8578000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8578000	8581000	and we read our favorite emails here on the air.
8581000	8583000	And do we get it? We got one, right?
8583000	8585000	We got one. There's one.
8585000	8587000	Okay, just one. All right.
8587000	8590000	And it's actually subject line is, oh, man.
8590000	8592000	Uh-oh.
8592000	8595000	I had zero interest in the Toy-Con elephant set
8595000	8598000	until they showed what was essentially Tilt Brush with it,
8598000	8601000	even if you can't walk around or through your artwork.
8601000	8603000	And that comes from Robert M.
8605000	8606000	That's it.
8606000	8607000	That's it.
8607000	8609000	Thank you for keeping it short and sweet.
8609000	8611000	I'm sorry, I might have missed,
8611000	8613000	because I was prepping for the next story over here.
8613000	8615000	Was there a question in there for us?
8615000	8616000	No.
8616000	8617000	Just an observation.
8617000	8619000	Yeah. I mean,
8619000	8621000	I guess it would be kind of cool to walk through your artwork,
8621000	8623000	but I don't expect that on Nintendo.
8623000	8624000	Yeah.
8624000	8627000	I do wonder how, like,
8627000	8630000	I've been without this game, without Animal Crossing,
8630000	8632000	for, like, essentially the last three months,
8632000	8634000	and now I'm fucking addicted to it again.
8634000	8636000	Just wait until Animal Crossing is on the Switch.
8636000	8637000	Oh, fuck.
8637000	8639000	Our Switch is never gonna be at the house again
8639000	8640000	while I'm, you know, at work.
8640000	8642000	My wife, since...
8642000	8643000	You didn't have to buy a second Switch.
8643000	8644000	No. No, my wife, since...
8644000	8646000	We didn't buy our first Switch.
8647000	8650000	Christmas, I got, you know, the kids their 2DSs,
8650000	8652000	and I got them Animal Crossing on those.
8652000	8656000	Guess who's been playing Animal Crossing since
8656000	8658000	they got their system.
8658000	8661000	My youngest son hasn't had his 2DS for months now,
8661000	8663000	because she's been playing Animal Crossing
8663000	8664000	every day.
8664000	8666000	Good for her. Your wife's a gamer after all.
8666000	8667000	How about that?
8667000	8669000	She's gotta do something without any new Excite Truck.
8669000	8671000	You know what you need to do?
8671000	8673000	This is how you get her back.
8673000	8675000	So next time she's sitting there on the couch
8675000	8677000	playing the game, you just walk in there and go,
8677000	8679000	games, games, games, games,
8679000	8681000	because I remember she used to do that to you.
8681000	8684000	Well, she's doing that and watching the act on Hulu,
8684000	8685000	so, you know.
8685000	8689000	Because she needs to get her drama-filled
8689000	8691000	show with, you know.
8692000	8693000	I understand.
8693000	8695000	That's why I watch MSNBC.
8695000	8698000	I need to get my weekly filled with drama every week.
8698000	8699000	Fucking A.
8699000	8701000	There's been a lot of it this weekend.
8701000	8703000	You know what? I can't stand MSNBC.
8703000	8705000	I, I, I don't like it.
8705000	8707000	I can't stand MSNBC for the same reason
8707000	8708000	I can't stand Fox News.
8708000	8710000	It's too, it's too at least-
8710000	8712000	Too skewed. Way too fucking skewed.
8712000	8714000	If you deal with any news source that is too skewed,
8714000	8716000	you are not going to get the whole story,
8716000	8717000	so that's why I read BBC.
8717000	8719000	I also, I also don't,
8719000	8721000	not to go too far down this road,
8721000	8722000	I don't, I also,
8722000	8724000	I kind of know that when I watch it,
8724000	8726000	so I kind of have that perspective in mind,
8726000	8728000	so I don't, like, let myself-
8728000	8729000	Yeah.
8729000	8730000	be swayed.
8730000	8732000	I, the only reason I'm actually saying that
8732000	8734000	is because there are people who take it as much gospel-
8734000	8735000	Oh, I'm sure.
8735000	8736000	as some people take Fox News.
8736000	8737000	Oh, I'm sure.
8737000	8739000	So, as I warn everybody,
8739000	8741000	this is your PSA of the evening
8741000	8743000	and not just educational radio.
8743000	8745000	Take everything that you see with a grain of salt
8745000	8747000	and research, research, research.
8747000	8749000	But if it's on Wikipedia, it's true.
8750000	8751000	That's a joke. That's a joke.
8751000	8752000	All right.
8752000	8754000	Moving on, we got some more news for you guys,
8754000	8756000	and we're going to try to squeeze in some calls.
8756000	8757000	We're running a little long tonight,
8757000	8759000	just some good discussion here happening in the studio.
8759000	8762000	Um, so we will have time for Discord stuff,
8762000	8765000	um, and if you want to call us, uh, the show, uh, via Discord,
8765000	8766000	you can by joining our green room,
8766000	8767000	but I am going to warn,
8767000	8769000	it probably is going to be a short segment tonight
8769000	8771000	for that part, so have your question ready to go,
8771000	8773000	and you can, uh, tell us what you're going to talk about-
8773000	8774000	You also want FUs.
8774000	8775000	Huh?
8775000	8776000	I do also want an FU.
8776000	8777000	You want an FU?
8777000	8779000	Can we do that closer to the Discord segment?
8779000	8780000	Sure.
8780000	8781000	Okay, let's get to- remind me,
8781000	8783000	don't let me end the show without it.
8783000	8784000	Uh, let's get to some more news.
8784000	8785000	Loki.
8785000	8790000	Yes, and so Epic had a presentation they did at GDC as well
8790000	8792000	and made a bunch of announcements of games
8792000	8796000	that are exclusive to the Epic Games Store coming soon.
8796000	8800000	So, for example, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls,
8800000	8803000	and Detroit Become Human are coming to PC,
8803000	8805000	but those are exclusive to the store.
8805000	8809000	Aside from that, they announced ten other games as well.
8809000	8814000	So they have After Party, The Cycle, Dauntless,
8814000	8818000	Industries of Titan, Journey to the Savage Planet,
8818000	8823000	Kain, Phoenix Point, The Sinking City, Spellbreak,
8823000	8828000	and Solar Ash are all going to be exclusive on the store,
8828000	8834000	and Ancestors, The Humankind Odyssey as well.
8835000	8836000	So...
8836000	8841000	I'm kind of all about Detroit and that coming to PC.
8841000	8843000	It's not even the Epic Games Store.
8843000	8846000	I mean, whatever, they're wheeling and dealing or whatever,
8846000	8849000	but the fact that these games are coming out on PC is kind of cool.
8849000	8850000	Yeah.
8850000	8853000	So, because, you know, that was one of those games I meant to play on PS4
8853000	8854000	and I just kind of never got around to.
8854000	8856000	But I wonder if when it comes out on PC,
8856000	8860000	they'll cut the price on PS4 just to be like that.
8860000	8861000	Yeah, I don't know.
8862000	8866000	But anyways, yeah, so there's that.
8866000	8868000	Questbuster in chat says,
8868000	8870000	Damn, Industries of Titan and Sinking City.
8870000	8871000	So some folks have their eyes on...
8871000	8875000	They also threw a lot of shade on Steam as well
8875000	8879000	because they were talking about how they're going to really monitor
8879000	8881000	what gets uploaded to their store.
8881000	8885000	They're not going to include porn or...
8885000	8889000	Well, but they also, like, they don't have the door wide open
8889000	8891000	that anybody can publish a game.
8891000	8894000	And you've got to wonder if when Epic gets more and more games,
8894000	8897000	there might be calls to have a more open door
8897000	8899000	where you can publish your own thing on Epic
8899000	8901000	and if they'll have a solution.
8901000	8904000	Because, you know, Steam's kind of been trying these different solutions
8904000	8905000	like the project.
8905000	8907000	I think they really should just go back to the previous solution
8907000	8910000	because that was better than it was now.
8910000	8913000	And now it's really not good.
8913000	8916000	You have to know the right people to get in the Epic Store.
8916000	8919000	Because there's so much crap on there,
8919000	8924000	but I guess neither are the perfect solutions.
8924000	8926000	I don't know.
8926000	8929000	To be continued, to be developed.
8929000	8934000	Also, always under renovations is the game Heroes of the Storm,
8934000	8938000	which, you know, the community's been facing a lot of kicks in the butt
8938000	8940000	lately with the whole fact that, you know, the esports
8940000	8943000	was kind of sunsetted, the official one anyway.
8943000	8946000	And it sounds like a lot of the development on this game
8946000	8948000	is going to kind of go more into support mode
8948000	8950000	as opposed to like develop a lot of new stuff.
8950000	8952000	I mean, not to say they won't ever do new Heroes and stuff,
8952000	8956000	but it has been a while since they've announced a new Hero.
8956000	8957000	I don't know.
8957000	8959000	So the game might kind of be moving into a stable state.
8959000	8961000	But anyway, the news this week is that
8961000	8963000	they're going to be changing the way loot boxes work.
8963000	8965000	You know, Heroes of the Storm does have loot boxes,
8965000	8967000	but it was a free game.
8967000	8968000	So I think a lot of people feel,
8968000	8970000	all right, you can do loot boxes or games free.
8970000	8974000	But you're actually not going to be able to pay for loot boxes anymore.
8974000	8976000	Gems, which are the pay currency,
8976000	8980000	will no longer be usable to get loot boxes.
8980000	8984000	You have to earn loot boxes in game by leveling up and all that stuff,
8984000	8987000	or you use the currency that you get in the game,
8987000	8990000	the gold in the game, to buy those loot boxes.
8990000	8994000	So you can no longer buy with pay currency loot boxes.
8994000	8996000	So that kind of begs the question,
8996000	8998000	where is this game going to make their money?
8998000	8999000	It's money then.
8999000	9003000	Well, don't forget, the things that you get in the loot boxes
9003000	9005000	are still things you can buy piecemeal on the store.
9005000	9007000	You can buy new heroes.
9007000	9011000	You can buy new skins, new mounts, announcers, things like that.
9011000	9013000	You can buy all those things with the gems.
9013000	9017000	It's just they are taking out the random chance fun box,
9017000	9020000	which I must admit, I have never purchased.
9020000	9022000	Pretty much any time I did drop money on Heroes of the Storm,
9022000	9024000	and I have spent a little money on Heroes of the Storm,
9024000	9028000	I bought, they had a sale on an Uber bundle with a hero amount
9028000	9030000	and a couple of things, and I was like,
9030000	9032000	okay, for 20 bucks, I'll get that.
9032000	9034000	And that's about the most money I've spent on Heroes of the Storm.
9034000	9037000	I've probably spent about as much money on Heroes of the Storm
9037000	9040000	as I would have on a retail game release,
9040000	9042000	and I got a lot of enjoyment out of that game.
9042000	9044000	I haven't been playing it as much lately,
9044000	9048000	but there's just been other things, like Overwatch.
9048000	9050000	I need to play Overwatch again and play that new hero,
9050000	9052000	which looks really cool.
9052000	9054000	Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
9054000	9058000	Well, last but not least of my things here,
9058000	9061000	we have The Return of Obra Dinn, which is a fun name.
9061000	9065000	It won quite a few awards at Game Developers Conference.
9065000	9071000	And that one was actually developed by Lucas Pope,
9071000	9074000	who did Papers, Please, and you know how well that game took off.
9074000	9075000	Oh, yeah.
9075000	9079000	But it won, basically the game is about discovering,
9079000	9085000	you know, just different things that happen while sailing a ship.
9085000	9087000	It won the best narrative.
9087000	9091000	It also won the IGF Grand Prize in Excellence in Narrative.
9091000	9097000	And also Game of the Year was, I just had it a second ago,
9097000	9099000	was God of War.
9099000	9103000	It sounds like as far as the more indie development goes,
9103000	9106000	this guy, you know, because Papers, Please was kind of,
9106000	9107000	you know, it was a very interesting game.
9107000	9109000	It was kind of a commentary in some ways.
9109000	9111000	So that being directly in your face about it,
9111000	9113000	it was definitely a commentary on some things in culture.
9113000	9115000	So it sounds like this guy is getting pretty good
9115000	9117000	at making thought-provoking games.
9117000	9119000	It sounds like that's what this new one's doing.
9119000	9122000	Well, here are the Game Developers Choice winners.
9122000	9124000	For Best Audio, Celeste.
9124000	9126000	Best Debut, Mountains.
9126000	9128000	Best Design, Into the Breach.
9128000	9130000	Best Mobile, Florence.
9130000	9132000	Innovation Award was Nintendo Labo.
9132000	9134000	Narrative was The Return of Obra Dinn.
9134000	9136000	Best Technology was Red Dead Redemption 2.
9136000	9139000	I guess it must be all the horse penis.
9139000	9142000	The graphics are pretty stunning in that game, so.
9142000	9144000	Best Visuals is Grease,
9144000	9146000	which I'm actually looking to play, GRIS.
9146000	9149000	I'm actually planning on trying to stream that one,
9149000	9152000	because I haven't been able to get the Super Nintendo hooked up yet.
9152000	9154000	We have to clean out that office a lot.
9154000	9157000	The Best VR AR Game is Beat Saber.
9157000	9158000	Audience Award is Beat Saber.
9158000	9160000	Game of the Year is God of War.
9160000	9163000	Pioneer Award, Reiko Kodama.
9163000	9166000	Lifetime Achievement Award is Amy Hennig.
9166000	9169000	And for the Independent Games Festival winners,
9169000	9171000	we have, for the Seamus McNally Grand Prize,
9171000	9173000	Return of the Obra Dinn.
9173000	9175000	Excellence in Visual Art is Mirror Drop.
9175000	9177000	Excellence in Audio is Paratropic.
9177000	9179000	Excellence in Design is Opus Magnum.
9179000	9182000	Excellence in Narrative is Return of the Obra Dinn.
9182000	9185000	A Nuevo Award that's given to unusual experimental games
9185000	9188000	is Black Room, which I wanted to look into.
9188000	9190000	And Best Student Game is After Hours.
9190000	9192000	So, there you go.
9192000	9194000	That's pretty cool that you have an award ceremony
9194000	9197000	that really honors student-developed games,
9197000	9199000	all the way to AAA stuff like God of War.
9199000	9201000	So, I really feel like we got a full spectrum
9201000	9203000	of different development sites here.
9203000	9204000	Indeed.
9204000	9205000	That's cool.
9205000	9207000	Questbuster pointing out, as far as Papers, Please go,
9207000	9211000	the Papers, Please short film on Steam is also really good.
9211000	9214000	I heard they were making a movie out of it,
9214000	9215000	but it wasn't like a...
9215000	9217000	So, I never saw the finished product.
9217000	9218000	I'll have to check that out.
9218000	9219000	Sounds interesting.
9219000	9220000	Yeah.
9220000	9223000	But there's just quite a number of things
9223000	9225000	that I'm going to be checking out that came out of GDC.
9225000	9226000	So...
9226000	9227000	Cool.
9227000	9228000	And hopefully some folks here in studio.
9228000	9229000	That would be great.
9229000	9230000	I'd love that.
9230000	9231000	Actually.
9231000	9233000	Or via Skype, if need be.
9233000	9234000	Or, excuse me, Discord.
9234000	9236000	Well, I can still do Skype on demand, if need be,
9236000	9238000	if our guests have to do it.
9238000	9242000	To go ahead and point this out,
9242000	9245000	I'm actually planning on working on something
9245000	9247000	with somebody else, and that's all I can say about it.
9248000	9250000	That was an announcement of an announcement,
9250000	9252000	if I ever heard one.
9252000	9253000	All right.
9253000	9254000	We're going to do something with someone.
9254000	9256000	We're going to do something with somebody at some time,
9256000	9259000	and you won't know when, but you're going to love it.
9259000	9261000	All right.
9261000	9263000	Moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys,
9263000	9265000	then we're going to get to the listener round table.
9265000	9267000	If you have some questions for us in chat,
9267000	9269000	or you want to join our green room in Discord,
9269000	9271000	again, I'm not going to wait all night.
9271000	9274000	So, if the green room stays empty, then so be it.
9274000	9276000	But get in there, if you want to give us a call
9276000	9278000	First, we just have a couple more stories for you guys.
9278000	9279000	Loki.
9279000	9283000	So, you may remember that they had developed at one time,
9283000	9286000	I don't know, it wasn't necessarily a mod,
9286000	9292000	it was more of a multiplayer co-op version of Mario 64.
9292000	9294000	Yes, because Nintendo shut that shit down,
9294000	9297000	but they put Wario in it, or Waluigi in it.
9297000	9299000	Well, they brought it, I think they brought it back too,
9299000	9300000	and Nintendo tried to shut it down.
9300000	9301000	I think it's still out there.
9301000	9303000	Well, it was one of those once on the internet,
9303000	9304000	always on the internet sorts of things.
9304000	9310000	So now, there is a new mod, that's now for Zelda,
9310000	9314000	Ocarina of Time, they call it OOT Online,
9314000	9318000	and it allows co-op for two to fifteen players.
9319000	9322000	What would you do with fifteen people in Ocarina of Time?
9322000	9324000	I don't know, but they have video footage showing
9324000	9326000	what they could possibly do with it.
9326000	9327000	So, I don't know.
9327000	9330000	I watched some of the video, and it was a lot of two people.
9330000	9333000	I don't think they showed more than two at a time.
9333000	9334000	Yeah, and it's kind of...
9334000	9335000	It was neat.
9335000	9337000	Yeah, it looks like it's still early.
9337000	9341000	I mean, some of the animations aren't really coming over too well,
9342000	9344000	but it's neat that you can do that.
9344000	9345000	Right, for sure.
9345000	9347000	They found a way to shoehorn it in there,
9347000	9353000	but I'd be curious to see what more they can do with this,
9353000	9355000	and also if Waluigi is going to be in here.
9355000	9358000	Well, they just patched Waluigi in.
9358000	9359000	Why? Because.
9359000	9360000	All right.
9360000	9363000	And this is also very exciting news.
9363000	9364000	I don't know why I saved...
9364000	9365000	Maybe I saved the best for last.
9365000	9366000	I don't know.
9366000	9368000	But it looks like, you know what's coming back?
9368000	9370000	Lucasfilm Games is going to be making a comeback.
9370000	9371000	I saw that.
9371000	9372000	Loom 2?
9372000	9373000	Oh, God.
9373000	9374000	We can only hope.
9374000	9375000	Anyway, here's the deal.
9375000	9376000	No, no.
9376000	9378000	Before we just blatantly make stuff up, here's the deal.
9378000	9383000	Disney has posted some job listings for some new Lucasfilm games.
9383000	9386000	And especially when we've heard stories about layoff, layoff, layoff,
9386000	9388000	this could be a great thing for some of those people
9388000	9390000	to hopefully get there on the ground somewhere else,
9390000	9391000	and this could be pretty cool.
9391000	9395000	So Disney Careers, which is the official website for Disney postings
9395000	9399000	and things like that, they are showing positions at Lucasfilm Games.
9399000	9402000	Now, this has been in the news before,
9402000	9404000	because I guess Lucasfilm Games was looking for people in 2017,
9404000	9407000	but it does seem like things are picking up,
9407000	9412000	because some of the job listings actually mention Nintendo Switch
9412000	9413000	as a potential platform.
9413000	9416000	Now, some places that are running with this story
9416000	9419000	get into this whole talk about Star Wars games
9419000	9421000	and how EA's kind of had the lock on Star Wars,
9421000	9423000	and what have they done with it in seven years?
9423000	9425000	Like, two Battlefront games, that's it.
9425000	9427000	Ruined the Star Wars name?
9427000	9431000	Yeah, so some folks are wondering if Disney is either prepping
9431000	9434000	for when that contract is over and they're going to make their own stuff.
9434000	9437000	I mean, I would assume, actually, they could probably make their own stuff
9437000	9438000	at any time.
9438000	9439000	That's probably part of the agreement.
9439000	9443000	But, you know, still, once this EA thing ends, if it'll be reevaluated.
9443000	9445000	But I also kind of say, you know,
9445000	9449000	Lucasfilm Games didn't just make Star Wars stuff.
9449000	9453000	I joked about Loom, but that was certainly a memorable game.
9453000	9458000	They did the Indiana Jones PC adventure games, which was really good as well.
9458000	9461000	Maniac Mansion was them, wasn't it?
9461000	9462000	Maniac Mansion was them.
9462000	9464000	They also had mercenaries, I think.
9464000	9465000	Monkey Island.
9465000	9468000	We used to call it Mercenaries back in the day.
9469000	9475000	So it may not be, even though, yes, it's Lucasfilm,
9475000	9478000	but, you know, also Lucas isn't strictly involved in Star Wars.
9478000	9481000	Can we get Maniac Mansion right in Disneyland now?
9481000	9483000	That'd be kind of cool.
9483000	9486000	But, yeah, I'm curious to see what they're doing,
9486000	9488000	and I'm curious if it's even Star Wars at all.
9488000	9492000	Everybody's assuming it is, but maybe it's not.
9492000	9494000	Maybe it's going to be something different.
9494000	9495000	Why can't we have both?
9495000	9497000	Yeah, why not? Why not both?
9497000	9500000	So, anyway, Questbuster in chat says,
9500000	9502000	the hiring position seemed to show that the new Lucasfilm
9502000	9505000	is going to be like a branding watchdog, at least for now.
9505000	9508000	It would be nice to see a new Dark Forces, though.
9509000	9512000	All right, well, we are to the part of the show
9512000	9514000	where we're going to do the Listen Around table,
9514000	9519000	and I don't believe I saw anybody in our Discord waiting to call in,
9519000	9521000	but I'll give it just a couple more minutes there.
9521000	9522000	Just a couple more minutes for now.
9522000	9523000	If you do want to call the show,
9523000	9527000	go to our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
9527000	9529000	That'll get you that invite right away into the server,
9529000	9530000	and you're going to join the green room,
9530000	9532000	and then you can mention in the Orange Launch Radio channel
9532000	9535000	what you want to talk about, and that would be great.
9535000	9539000	So we have an idea of what you are wanting to talk to us about tonight.
9539000	9540000	But currently nobody's there,
9540000	9543000	and I mentioned we are running a little long anyway,
9543000	9545000	so maybe just people are shy tonight.
9545000	9546000	I don't know.
9546000	9547000	But if you have a quick question,
9547000	9552000	you can also ask in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
9552000	9555000	While we wait to see if anything pops up there in chat or in Discord,
9555000	9557000	do we have any last-minute stories to cover?
9557000	9560000	Yeah, the Atari VCS console's been delayed
9560000	9564000	because they say they're improving specs of what's going in the console.
9564000	9567000	Totally forgot Atari was making a new console thing.
9567000	9569000	So yeah, I totally forgot this.
9569000	9574000	They say now it's going to be a new Vega graphics-based AMD Ryzen processor.
9576000	9579000	So yeah, now we don't know when that's coming.
9579000	9583000	I think they said the end of 2019 now.
9585000	9588000	Alright, we'll have to wait and see if that's even worth it at this point,
9588000	9589000	but whatever.
9589000	9594000	And then kind of once we were talking about indies and stuff like that
9594000	9596000	and different direct type things,
9596000	9603000	Microsoft is doing an ID at Xbox Game Pass thing
9603000	9610000	that's going to be streamed on March 26th at 9 p.m. Pacific
9610000	9613000	to showcase some indie games coming to that platform as well.
9613000	9617000	So we'll have to take a look at those when those come out.
9617000	9619000	Yeah, I'm kind of curious what their response will be
9619000	9621000	because Microsoft's got a lot of good indie stuff on it.
9621000	9623000	Before we get to the next story, though,
9623000	9626000	we have a question in our chat for this segment from Dark Tetsuya who says,
9626000	9631000	Did y'all see that DDR Ace 20 or A20 finally launched?
9631000	9634000	Apparently there's a Konami 50th anniversary song in it
9634000	9637000	with nods to Gradius and Yirr Kung Fu.
9637000	9639000	I'd love to hear that song.
9639000	9643000	Do they still put rips from the arcade online somewhere?
9643000	9644000	Yes, yes.
9644000	9645000	On like Bimani style or something?
9645000	9646000	I'm sure it's on YouTube.
9646000	9648000	Oh, yeah, it's probably on YouTube somewhere.
9648000	9650000	Check that out. I want to hear that song.
9650000	9653000	Have they said anything about when we get that over here in the States?
9653000	9655000	Is it just location testing right now?
9655000	9657000	Or is it like the official launch?
9657000	9659000	I think it's launched already because it's like they've got...
9659000	9661000	I would have thought they'd wait until 20 November.
9661000	9663000	Actual cabinets and everything.
9663000	9665000	I think it's just...
9665000	9667000	I don't know if it's like a software upgrade that they're doing
9667000	9668000	to some of the other cabinets.
9668000	9671000	I know that they have the new gold cabinets as well.
9671000	9674000	But if all of the Ace machines are going to turn the Ace 20s
9674000	9677000	or how that works now that we live in this digital age
9677000	9679000	with even arcade games.
9679000	9680000	Yeah, I'd be curious.
9680000	9682000	So Dark Tetsuya says he'll put it on the Discord
9682000	9684000	so we can... and that the game is officially out.
9684000	9686000	It's not a location test. It's officially out.
9686000	9687000	I definitely want to hear the song.
9687000	9690000	I would play it on air, but I've got to be content matching
9690000	9693000	and all that. I've got to be careful because I don't want to get
9693000	9697000	a stream muted for the people that do watch the archives.
9697000	9698000	Which you can do, by the way.
9698000	9699000	Cheap plug.
9699000	9702000	If you are a subscriber of our channel here at VOG Network,
9702000	9705000	you get access to the video archives of Orange Ontario,
9705000	9708000	The Bobby Black Wolf Show, and anything else we might be doing in the future.
9708000	9712000	Which, by the way, there may be a special thing on Thursday.
9712000	9715000	I'm just waiting on the final kind of thing on that.
9715000	9718000	But stay tuned to my personal Twitter as well as the VOG Network Twitter.
9718000	9720000	My personal Twitter is at MrRobRoberts.
9720000	9723000	We may have a thing on the stream on Thursday night.
9723000	9726000	And I'm waiting on the T's to get crossed and the I's to get dotted.
9726000	9728000	And a little bit ahead of PAX East.
9728000	9731000	We're all guessing that Borderlands 3 is going to be announced.
9731000	9732000	Yes.
9732000	9734000	But it may not be Borderlands 3.
9734000	9736000	It may be actually Borderlands Game of the Year edition.
9736000	9738000	Now, I know what you're saying, but wait.
9738000	9739000	Borderlands Game of the Year edition?
9739000	9741000	That already came out several years ago.
9741000	9742000	Not on the Switch.
9742000	9744000	It's... no, it's not coming on the Switch.
9744000	9745000	PC?
9745000	9749000	Well, they say that now it's been rated for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
9749000	9754000	They're saying that it's going to be a remaster, possibly, of the original Borderlands game.
9754000	9755000	And I know what you're thinking.
9755000	9756000	Well, wait a second.
9756000	9758000	Didn't I already purchase a remaster of Borderlands games?
9758000	9760000	The Handsome Jack collection?
9760000	9761000	Yes, you did.
9761000	9764000	But that was two and technically the third game.
9764000	9765000	Pre-sequel.
9765000	9768000	So this is going to be the first game.
9768000	9770000	And then, oh, this is oh so nice.
9771000	9777000	In-game purchases are a thing that they have flagged on here for Borderlands Game of the Year.
9777000	9781000	Which is weird because the Game of the Year edition should have all of the fucking content in it.
9781000	9784000	So why am I having to make purchases for things?
9785000	9791000	Because maybe they're going to still have the two and the pre-sequel remaster available within this game.
9791000	9793000	It's just a touch of a button.
9794000	9797000	You can get the Handsome Jack collection for less than $15.
9797000	9798000	True, that's true.
9798000	9799000	No point.
9799000	9801000	Fifth Dream Today says maybe new things.
9801000	9803000	Maybe not the same DLC.
9803000	9804000	Maybe they're going back.
9804000	9805000	I don't really want a remaster for the first game.
9805000	9807000	Do Borderlands 3, you cowards.
9807000	9808000	Yes, do a third game.
9808000	9813000	Or do another, I don't know, a Borderlands prequel or something.
9813000	9815000	They already did a fucking prequel.
9815000	9817000	Borderlands 3 or GTFO.
9817000	9819000	No, it was a pre-sequel.
9819000	9822000	And I say that with the freaking poster hanging behind me here.
9822000	9824000	Three or get out.
9826000	9827000	I don't want a remaster.
9827000	9830000	Anyway, Tigerclass says they're milking that franchise for all it's worth.
9830000	9833000	SG100Matt says Borderlands 2 had that bullshit too.
9833000	9836000	If Fifth Dream Today said maybe the newer characters in the first game.
9836000	9837000	That'd be cool.
9837000	9843000	And SG100Matt says if you got the season pass for Borderlands 2, you didn't get the pre-order bonus content.
9843000	9847000	This has nothing to do with any of that, but it's definitely relevant to our interests.
9847000	9852000	Akira Yamaoka just posted on Facebook because I follow him on Facebook.
9852000	9853000	Yeah, me too.
9853000	9857000	A poster. This is Akira Yamaoka, Pantera.
9858000	9860000	So either he's working with Pantera.
9860000	9862000	That's badass, if true.
9862000	9864000	Or is something...
9864000	9867000	I think he's working with Pantera looking by the logo.
9867000	9869000	Is he gonna produce the...
9869000	9874000	Dude, it would make total sense as a band. Pantera probably played the old Silent Hill games and was like...
9874000	9877000	Far Beyond Driven. Yes, it is. He's working with Pantera.
9877000	9879000	Wow. That's pretty cool.
9880000	9881000	So...
9881000	9883000	Oh, you know what? Never mind. I know what this is.
9883000	9888000	Okay, so I just figured out what it was. I went looking it up and there's a Pantera ad generator.
9888000	9890000	A font generator thing.
9890000	9893000	So apparently Akira Yamaoka just played with it.
9893000	9895000	That's...
9895000	9897000	It's a fucking font.
9897000	9899000	My emotional roller coaster here.
9899000	9901000	I know.
9901000	9904000	This is that clip from Roller Coaster Tycoon.
9904000	9906000	Where they're like...
9906000	9911000	And then the coaster's going, everybody's having fun, and then the track just ends.
9913000	9915000	I was excited about it too.
9915000	9919000	Because I was like, holy shit, working with Pantera, that's fucking awesome.
9919000	9921000	Akira Yamaoka's working with Pantera.
9921000	9925000	And then I just double checked the logo.
9925000	9928000	And yeah, it looks like it's a Pantera meme generator.
9928000	9931000	That's set for Far Beyond Driven.
9935000	9938000	Our chat room is laughing their ass off too.
9940000	9942000	Yeah, it's...
9942000	9944000	I just double checked it.
9944000	9946000	I'll link the logo generator, but fuck.
9946000	9949000	And Chad says, what the fuck, I was lied to.
9949000	9951000	Act F says, I feel betrayed.
9951000	9953000	Look.
9953000	9955000	It's Facebook.
9955000	9957000	Nothing on Facebook is real.
9957000	9962000	I was just like, because usually when people do something like that,
9962000	9967000	it's just like a splash.
9967000	9969000	Something to get you interested in.
9969000	9972000	And that wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility.
9972000	9975000	Yeah, I don't normally buy Pantera albums,
9975000	9978000	but that one I would probably catch my attention.
9978000	9980000	But it's also like a fucking old ass album.
9980000	9982000	Well, old ass, I say this.
9982000	9984000	It's from 1994.
9984000	9988000	Fun fact, that would make it 25 years old this year.
9988000	9990000	Anyway, all right.
9990000	9992000	Well, I don't see anybody else in the green room,
9992000	9994000	and I don't see any other questions in chat.
9994000	9996000	How very dear you all.
9996000	9999000	I think it's about time to wrap up the show.
9999000	10002000	Unless we have other last minute stories we didn't get to yet. Sorry.
10002000	10006000	Oh, no, I'm just watching the new trailer for Earth Defense Force Iron Rain,
10006000	10009000	which I totally need to get because it looks very awesome.
10009000	10012000	My friend's cat's named Pantera.
10012000	10014000	All right.
10014000	10016000	We're going to wrap up the show.
10016000	10019000	We're going to wrap up the show, get everybody's final thoughts,
10019000	10021000	and then we'll head on out of here for the night.
10021000	10024000	But, again, as always, I want to thank you guys for listening to Orange On Radio.
10024000	10027000	Whether you watched us live on Twitch here or Sunday nights
10027000	10029000	at the Voice Geeks Network, VOG Network,
10029000	10034000	or if you downloaded our show free on iTunes or Google Play
10034000	10038000	or wherever it is you listen to podcasts, really appreciate it.
10038000	10041000	As we say here on the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
10041000	10044000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10044000	10047000	If the voices aren't here in our Discord waiting to be on the show,
10047000	10049000	then we can't share them with the world.
10049000	10051000	So please help us spread the word.
10051000	10053000	I'm posting the poster I just made on my fan page.
10053000	10055000	Okay, you do that.
10055000	10058000	Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10058000	10060000	Well, is that your final thought, Dark Sakura?
10060000	10062000	I had a F-you, but I forgot.
10062000	10064000	Oh, yeah, I'll use it as my final thought then.
10064000	10066000	It's not really a F-you.
10066000	10068000	For all the people who says, oh, I went shopping today,
10068000	10071000	or, oh, I had my nails done, or, oh, I did this,
10071000	10075000	and say it's self-care, it's not self-care, that's pampering yourself.
10075000	10081000	Self-care is doing the things every day that maintain your physical and mental health,
10081000	10087000	meaning getting out of bed, taking your vitamins, walking, doing some exercise,
10087000	10089000	leaving the house, getting enough sleep.
10089000	10093000	What if, and I mean this is a totally legit question, what if,
10093000	10098000	because I did this last week, what if I like canceled plans with somebody
10098000	10101000	because I was just so burned out and exhausted?
10101000	10104000	That is something that contributes to your ongoing well-being.
10104000	10105000	Okay.
10105000	10108000	Because you have to have, now that's perfect self-care.
10108000	10110000	That's taking care of your mental state.
10110000	10113000	But just going out and doing something for momentary pleasure,
10113000	10117000	that does not constitute real self-care.
10117000	10119000	That's just treating yourself, okay?
10119000	10124000	You know, if you go, say, get a massage because your back hurts,
10124000	10129000	that's something that contributes to your ongoing physical and mental health,
10129000	10130000	as an example.
10130000	10136000	And for someone who is personally dealing with trauma, myself,
10136000	10141000	who has been through a lot of these, doing something nice for yourself is fine,
10141000	10142000	but it's not therapy.
10142000	10145000	And Peso Pacas in chat says, treat yourself too, though.
10145000	10146000	Treat yourself for sure.
10146000	10149000	That is something that's a momentary uplifting.
10149000	10152000	Did you see a gold sparkly hat that you want to own, by all means?
10152000	10155000	Wear it around in Target for 20 minutes and then buy it.
10155000	10157000	Or don't.
10157000	10160000	But I'm saying, but also on the same thing,
10160000	10163000	if you are, say, financially struggling and you see the hat,
10163000	10166000	and you're like, but you know what, that $5 I'm going to spend on this hat
10166000	10169000	could go into my groceries, that also is self-care,
10169000	10171000	being fiscally responsible.
10171000	10172000	Just saying.
10172000	10173000	All right.
10173000	10175000	Some words of wisdom from Auntie Dark Sakura.
10175000	10176000	Appreciate that.
10176000	10178000	Bitches.
10178000	10181000	Let's see, I'll do my final thought and then we'll do Logie's final thought.
10181000	10187000	My final thought is I need to do about eight more minutes of walking today.
10187000	10191000	So I'm going to go out on a night walk after the show,
10191000	10193000	and I'm going to hope I don't get stabbed.
10193000	10197000	What is it with everybody thinking they're going to get stabbed in these neighborhoods?
10197000	10201000	My wife's like, well, I could go for a walk today, but I might be murdered.
10201000	10203000	I'm like, no one wants to murder you.
10203000	10205000	You won't have any valuables on you.
10205000	10206000	It's daytime.
10206000	10208000	No one's going to murder you.
10208000	10209000	I will say that for-
10209000	10212000	That was a nice thing to say to your wife. Nobody wants to kill you.
10212000	10219000	I will say for women, it is a very real concern for us that we are at a higher risk than men usually are.
10219000	10221000	But that's not what she's saying it for.
10221000	10223000	She's saying it for her because she wants me to go walk with her,
10223000	10226000	and I don't want to because I already walked three miles earlier in the day,
10226000	10229000	and I don't feel like going out for yet another three-mile walk.
10229000	10233000	I think although what Dark Sakura's saying is certainly valid,
10233000	10237000	I think that is not quite the frame of reference that your wife is using.
10237000	10238000	Right.
10238000	10239000	I get it. I get it.
10239000	10240000	All right.
10240000	10242000	And then that was my final thought.
10242000	10244000	So what's your final thought, Logie?
10245000	10249000	My final thought is I'll keep working on my game.
10249000	10250000	I'm not going to show you guys.
10250000	10251000	Sounds good.
10251000	10252000	You don't get to see it.
10252000	10253000	Sounds good.
10253000	10255000	Drop it on us like a surprise.
10255000	10258000	I just want you to come in here one day and go, bam, here's my game.
10258000	10259000	Here's my game.
10259000	10261000	Well, bam, there's our podcast for this week.
10261000	10265000	We'll be back to do it in seven days with whatever happens in gaming news next week,
10265000	10269000	possibly some type of Borderlands news, some we're going to hear about the next week.
10269000	10272000	PAX is going on next week, right? PAX East?
10272000	10273000	Yes, PAX East.
10273000	10275000	So those of you guys still in Boston, right?
10275000	10279000	I haven't been to PAX East in like, God, six, five, six years.
10279000	10281000	So those of you that are going to Boston this weekend,
10281000	10284000	have a ton of fun and don't get in too much trouble,
10284000	10286000	and we'll have some of the news that comes out of that next week.
10286000	10288000	So we will see you in seven days.
10288000	10289000	Good night, everybody.
