Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week Anthem is rumored to become All Realm Were Aborn because every publisher has to have their own open world MMO online experience.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one headline from the rumor mill. Stay tuned for plenty more stories starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 798 for this November 17th of 2019.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
And we're back live. It's great to be back after a week off with a pre-recorded show.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Hope you guys all enjoyed that bonus episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
But we're back here live as we are every Sunday night usually when you know we're not sick or on vacation or something's going on.

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
I know it's been a weird past six weeks but it looks like we're on a nice path of being here every Sunday night over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
That's VOG Network for Voice of Geeks Network.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Who are we here at Orange Lounge Radio?

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Well I am Rob Roberts and she off camera because she wants to be.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yes I want to be.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Her way or the highway is Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh hi.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Hi how are you?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm okay.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Good and are you going to at least show the, because I went to New York City which is why I wasn't here last week.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Are you going to at least show the souvenir I brought you back from the Nintendo store?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
There you go.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
So for those on the podcast feed she's showing off a stuffed Kirby.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Pillow.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
A Kirby pillow that's like an 8-bit kind of style with Kirby holding the star.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
He's on a star.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah so very cool.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I actually, so I went to the Nintendo store obviously.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
You go to New York City and you're a nerd.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
You have to go to the Nintendo store at some point.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And the upstairs portion is a lot of like Pokemon stuff.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Because I think when that place opened it was actually like a Pokemon center.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I think was the branding for those stores.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
So upstairs is still majority Pokemon.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
So I actually FaceTimed our resident Pokemon nerd here at the Voice of Geeks Network, Shane.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
And I actually FaceTimed him to be like is there anything here you need?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Is there anything here that you need?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And lucky me he didn't need anything that was there.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Because I guess a lot of it you can get online if you know where to go.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
But I did buy for the studio.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And for those of you watching on Twitch you may actually see here.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
We had the brand new starters from Gen 8 to go with the Gen 7 starters that were here previously.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
So the little stuffed animal couch here is growing a little bit with a Scobble, Scorbunny.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Excuse me, Scobble.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Sobble.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Scorbunny.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That's what happens when you run the names together.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
And Grookey.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
So they're on the couch.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
So yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
I got that and I got the little stuffed pillow for Dark Sakura.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So because I think I sent you a picture.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I didn't FaceTime you but I sent you a picture.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
I was like I will give you money for everything but I would go poor.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
So you were like I want five of those pillows.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I was like choose one.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
And I'll make it happen.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
I would have I would have sent you money for the others but then Dan would have murdered me.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I understand.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I probably spent more money than I should have in New York.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
But the good news is that most of it was bought in advance.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Like I was sitting on those tickets for Moulin Rouge on Broadway.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
We bought those back in like probably like April.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
So you know we bought them a long time ago and then we saw Jagged Little Pill on Broadway as well.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Like the Alanis Morissette album.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
It was the very very first weekend actually of that show being on Broadway.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
So you know just like what like American Idiot or Mamma Mia.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
They made a musical out of Alanis Morissette songs.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
It doesn't have to do with Alanis Morissette like Mamma Mia isn't about ABBA right.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
But it's just some catchy songs.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I and I loved both musicals for different reasons.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I thought they were both fantastic.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Moulin Rouge especially was just showy.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Like it was the presence of that show was amazing.

03:56.000 --> 04:06.000
But anyway it's not a theater podcast but definitely I sometimes forget about what a theater fan I am until I like go to something like that.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
And then I'm like oh I love this so much.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I wish I need to do this more often.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
So now Alanis talking about going to see Dear Evan Hansen when it's touring here in Northern California later next year.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
So I'm like yay the theater queens and both of us have been unleashed.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't know if he's a fan of the theater but I should introduce over there Techmaster Loki.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Hello.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Hi how are you?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm fine.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
What's your favorite Broadway show?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't know.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Do you have one?

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Out of all the ones I've seen.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I don't know.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
I've seen family operas several times.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Wicked was pretty good.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Oh Wicked?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I haven't seen Wicked actually.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I've seen Phantom.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I think you have to see Phantom.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
High schools go to see Phantom at some point but Wicked.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Wicked was pretty good.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I haven't seen Wicked believe it or not.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I mean I know I know enough about it but.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I've been to a few off Broadway but I've been to one Broadway play.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What is your what's your favorite play?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
It doesn't have to have been on Broadway.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Well it was Broadway though and it was my favorite.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
It was Cats at the Winter Garden Theater.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh are you how do you feel about that movie that's coming?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Intrigued.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Intrigued?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Okay.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Because I'm just gonna go sing with it.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Well wait for that wait for it to come to the Castro theater when they have the big sing-along.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.400
We were doing like a sewing circle today with the sisters and of course Sister Ova is our

05:22.400 --> 05:29.920
theater person so we were just going back and forth singing stuff from Cats and singing.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.280
Also a few things from like Blazing Saddles and History of the World Part One.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.120
See the nice thing about Jagged Little Pill I already knew all lyrics.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.640
I mean they they changed minor lyrics to fit the narrative just like they do in Mamma Mia

05:41.640 --> 05:46.320
they do the same thing there but like I knew all the songs pretty much so it was pretty

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
pretty cool.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.320
I loved it.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.240
Oh my god I loved it so much because they took these songs that were so important to

05:52.240 --> 05:58.160
many of us in the 90s like if you're if you're in your late 30s early 40s Alanis Morissette

05:58.160 --> 06:03.960
probably meant something to you in like the high school or early college era and so like

06:03.960 --> 06:10.400
to see these songs reinvented with a very 2019 narrative to it because this this musical

06:10.400 --> 06:15.360
touches on a lot of very current things going on like the Me Too movement and things like

06:15.360 --> 06:19.680
the things that are very current it was really neat to see these songs that meant so much

06:19.680 --> 06:25.660
in the 90s now have this impact on a 2019 narrative and all I'm gonna say they they

06:25.660 --> 06:30.420
they put a little twist on You Oughta Know it's not what you might expect and it got

06:30.420 --> 06:34.660
a standing ovation in the middle of the show something I understand happens very rarely

06:34.660 --> 06:38.140
on Broadway but it was very very impressive.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.580
You know what my introduction to Alanis' music was?

06:40.580 --> 06:41.580
What?

06:41.580 --> 06:42.580
Flea.

06:42.580 --> 06:43.580
Flea?

06:43.580 --> 06:44.580
Of Red Hot Chili Peppers.

06:44.580 --> 06:45.580
Oh cause he played bass.

06:45.580 --> 06:46.580
Yeah.

06:46.580 --> 06:50.480
And that was what got me on the album because I heard that he played bass on it I was like

06:50.480 --> 06:52.500
I like all things that Flea does.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.600
Okay you want to hear my random Alanis Morissette trivia and then I promise we'll get to video

06:55.600 --> 07:00.080
games okay here's the thing with Flea so on most versions go check your jagged little

07:00.080 --> 07:03.760
pill album because there's two versions everybody bought that album right there's two versions

07:03.760 --> 07:09.380
track two doesn't have Flea it's the last track track 13 has Flea and you can hear it

07:09.380 --> 07:13.640
you can hear that bass in it but now I'll tie it to video games that's why that song

07:13.640 --> 07:18.760
is so important in rock band two I think it was in because it does have the Flea version

07:18.760 --> 07:23.160
remember it had the bass guitar in it so you're playing the Flea part yeah and so you're do

07:23.160 --> 07:29.560
do do and you can really hear what the bass guitar style is pretty dynamic and pretty

07:29.560 --> 07:35.000
much immediately recognizable yeah so all right anyway looking at our chat over at twitch

07:35.000 --> 07:40.040
tv slash vog network metal mayhem says rob please tell us that you had pizza and a bagel

07:40.040 --> 07:44.720
while in new york it's like an unsaid rule that you have to he went to his favorite italian

07:44.720 --> 07:51.060
restaurant Sbarro's no believe it or not true story that was the first place I got pizza

07:51.060 --> 07:56.940
when I was in new york because it was cheap but it was at times square believe it or not

07:56.940 --> 08:03.620
there was no pizza and no bagels however we went to juniors with the world famous cheesecake

08:03.620 --> 08:08.380
we went there twice we went there once for dessert and we went there again for dinner

08:08.380 --> 08:13.940
and actually one of those nights we went there for dessert was with Ranma and Giovedea from

08:13.940 --> 08:20.140
anime jam session and Victoria or Aria snark from shaking and crying so it was like a little

08:20.220 --> 08:25.740
vog network kind of meetup and that was the first time Victoria and Ranma and Giovedea all met and

08:25.740 --> 08:31.180
they they they're all like they all clicked like instant buds so that was kind of fun to see like

08:31.180 --> 08:36.900
watch happen in real time so that was really cool so so no no new york pizza or bagel we did go to

08:36.900 --> 08:42.220
an italian restaurant that's where we went with ssj100 matt so I had some nochi because I like I

08:42.220 --> 08:46.940
like nochi and alan hates it so we don't really usually have it for dinner here gnocchi yeah

08:46.940 --> 08:56.060
gnocchi you know whatever do I look Italian no but it's panoke okie it's like maraschino

08:56.060 --> 09:03.020
whatever well that's what I had and it was good so whatever gnocchi is great um yeah I can make it

09:03.020 --> 09:12.060
well good from scratch yeah why not sweet the holidays are coming up um all right anyway I've

09:12.060 --> 09:15.940
had sweet potato gnocchi and that's pretty a bomb oh I haven't had that that sounds good all right

09:15.940 --> 09:20.700
less food more video games we are here to talk about video games every Sunday night over the

09:20.700 --> 09:25.380
next few hours I feel like it was like kind of a slower news week I don't know if that's yes

09:25.380 --> 09:30.380
because of the big game releases we have this week I mean between last week's Death Stranding

09:30.380 --> 09:36.300
and this week's Pokemon sword and shield and Star Wars Jedi fallen order right yeah you can tell

09:36.300 --> 09:42.540
which one I haven't looked at yet but I know people who have so it's been a pretty freaking

09:42.540 --> 09:47.620
big week in games so I think the news a little bit lighter because everybody's playing but I feel

09:47.620 --> 09:52.580
like one company did put out a ton of news this week and it's the one that admittedly we don't

09:52.580 --> 09:56.980
probably give enough of a spotlight to here on this show and I think a lot of our audience tends

09:56.980 --> 10:03.300
to gravitate a little more for the Nintendo side of things and maybe the Sony side of things but

10:03.300 --> 10:08.140
you have to at least even if you you know don't own an Xbox one yourself you have to at least be

10:08.140 --> 10:12.780
taking a passing interest into this evolution I feel like this generation of gaming has been a

10:12.780 --> 10:17.660
very like self-reflection type of stage for Microsoft you know and you know and I've said

10:17.660 --> 10:21.860
this before on the show they're really setting up these chess pieces and you know under the leadership

10:21.860 --> 10:27.260
of Phil Spencer they've come a long long way and they're doing some really exciting things and so

10:27.260 --> 10:33.140
they had a big event this X 0 1 9 event where they announced a lot and this is just kind of a sign

10:33.140 --> 10:37.260
for things to come and I think it's it's really exciting whether you follow Microsoft or not

10:37.380 --> 10:41.780
they've got a lot of great stuff coming down the pipeline so I thought maybe Loki could run down

10:41.780 --> 10:47.460
some of the big announcements that we heard at the X 0 1 9 event yeah so I did not get to watch this

10:47.460 --> 10:53.500
either because I had just saw like after normally I would try to watch this stuff live but I was

10:53.500 --> 11:00.380
working and then I saw oh it's over I'm like oh crap anyways so some of the things that were

11:00.380 --> 11:06.780
announced they talked about a new game from obsidian called grounded which is gonna be

11:06.820 --> 11:13.100
entering early access this spring it's a sandbox survival game he said literally you are a group

11:13.100 --> 11:18.540
of kids who have been trucked down to a tiny size and have to survive in suburban backyard and not

11:18.540 --> 11:24.060
get eaten by spiders so it's honey I shrunk the kids the game I love it yeah yes it has to be

11:24.060 --> 11:31.220
better than that ride at Disneyland that was pretty terrible it was great wasn't that honey

11:31.220 --> 11:36.220
I shrunk the audience yeah the 4d experience yeah it was like using the captain eo theater for

11:36.220 --> 11:41.420
something else yeah you know it was used last time I went there mm-hmm it was you could go

11:41.420 --> 11:45.540
watch a trailer for wreck-it Ralph too right I don't know yeah I don't know what they're using

11:45.540 --> 11:48.940
that theater oh I think it's a Star Wars thing or it's been a Star Wars thing for a little bit

11:48.940 --> 11:55.420
now no it's not news for anything right now really yeah captain eo back exactly oh wait now there's

11:55.420 --> 12:00.700
all those recent things about Michael Jackson where it's you know you know but I you know what

12:00.700 --> 12:04.740
I just I try not to let that like cloud what I remember in the 80s you know and captain eo was

12:05.100 --> 12:11.380
awesome in the 80s so I don't know anyway all right at least they didn't try to bring back honey

12:11.380 --> 12:15.540
I shrunk the audience I'm sorry it was so bad why did they have I'd like to cuz it had Eric

12:15.540 --> 12:19.220
Idol in it I know Eric Idol is cool but like it was weird to me how like you would walk around

12:19.220 --> 12:23.660
the outside you see like Robin Williams on a poster but he's like he's not in it this

12:23.660 --> 12:28.940
false advertising like Robin Williams was like all one of the posters and it's like he's not

12:29.180 --> 12:35.060
no I never saw him on any of the posters I swear I swear I just saw Rick Moranis and Eric Idol and

12:35.060 --> 12:43.260

platforms PlayStation 4 PC Mac and Linux Sea of Thieves is getting another update on the 20th

15:34.140 --> 15:38.580
called the sea-bound soul I really need to take some time to check out Sea of Thieves because I

15:38.580 --> 15:43.100
know people that like really love that game but I just you know it's the backlog is so big and

15:43.100 --> 15:47.740
there's only time for so many games but this game is still getting a lot of love and support which

15:47.740 --> 15:54.620
is great to see next in has a game called kart rider drift that's coming to consoles it looks

15:54.620 --> 16:00.900
like it's coming first Xbox in 2020 they have a game called west of dead it's a twin stick top

16:00.900 --> 16:06.140
down shooter from raw fury and they have it looks like it's like a Western theme going on right yeah

16:06.140 --> 16:13.060
it's kind of what a west of dead sounds like it's a Western game and that's gonna be an open beta so

16:13.060 --> 16:18.740
like gun dot smoke remember that that old Capcom game that old ass Capcom game not not to be

16:18.740 --> 16:25.660
confused with the television show gun smoke but gun dot smoke anyway it's a fun game bleeding edge

16:25.660 --> 16:32.340
is gonna be available March 24 2020 and that's a ninja theories new multiplayer combat game and

16:32.340 --> 16:40.780
then they've got a game called the flame in the flood and that's coming next year to Xbox and PC

16:40.780 --> 16:50.220
and let's see last stop is coming to consoles PC next year Planet Coaster console edition coming

16:50.220 --> 16:57.180
in summer 2020 and then they had some announcements for other games coming to x cloud don't make cry

16:57.180 --> 17:06.180
5 Madden NFL 20 Tekken 7 and they're also doing I guess a public preview mode in certain territories

17:06.180 --> 17:10.940
next year and they're also bringing support it's eventually the service is gonna be coming to

17:10.940 --> 17:15.460
Windows 10 and they're gonna add more controller support including the DualShock 4 so that's kind

17:15.460 --> 17:21.380
of cool that they'll allow third-party controllers in there as well and then last but not least more

17:21.380 --> 17:28.580
trailers for fight simulator minecraft dungeons Age of Empires 4 crossfire acts art first artful

17:28.580 --> 17:32.300
escape and then they had a trailer for Jedi Fallen Order even though that is technically out already

17:32.300 --> 17:37.900
that's still that's a pretty impressive conference I mean you just spat out like probably 15 games in

17:37.900 --> 17:42.140
that little segment there things that Microsoft showed off and that's all the stuff that's coming

17:42.140 --> 17:46.100
out for Xbox I mean they haven't even announced the stuff that's coming out for the next system

17:46.100 --> 17:50.060
which I'm sure lots of studios are working on stuff so you know what it kind of reminded me

17:50.060 --> 17:54.860
of in a way is that you know PlayStation we forgot they used to do their PlayStation fan event in

17:54.860 --> 17:59.300
November December this year yeah they haven't been doing it for a couple years I don't think

17:59.300 --> 18:03.940
they did it last year I thought they did do it last year they did it like the year before I

18:03.940 --> 18:10.980
think 2017 was last time they did it I could be wrong maybe somebody in chat over twitch TV slash

18:10.980 --> 18:14.740
vog network will correct me but we're technically almost out of the games of all the ones that

18:14.740 --> 18:18.540
they've shown they were been showing year after year so we've got desperate needs finally out now

18:18.540 --> 18:23.180
yeah now Last of Us 2 is really kind of the last thing and then dreams I think well we also know

18:23.180 --> 18:27.700
that like PlayStation 5 is happening right I understand that but I'm just saying for that

18:27.700 --> 18:31.820
see we're running out of the stuff that we've already been shown it's been kind of delayed for

18:31.820 --> 18:36.800
a while so now now it's finally coming out and then we'll have here's a bunch of new shit we

18:36.800 --> 18:40.500
haven't shown you before which will be kind of fun but I would still you know I would still expect

18:40.540 --> 18:44.780
the same thing to happen for Microsoft's side when they start to show off here's our next console

18:44.780 --> 18:49.660
that we're doing so it's still pretty impressive that they had this press conference or I guess fan

18:49.660 --> 18:55.100
event whatever you want to call it you know the media blast yeah of all these different games you

18:55.100 --> 19:00.860
know here in November when you know we're looking at Sony and it's like oh this the engines running

19:00.860 --> 19:05.540
out of steam but you definitely see that Microsoft's like no full steam ahead you know and they've got

19:05.540 --> 19:10.340
even though some of it is playing catch-up a little bit you know the Final Fantasy the Kingdom

19:10.900 --> 19:16.420
that's playing catch-up although certainly an added value to game pass I mean that's pretty

19:16.420 --> 19:21.540
impressive to have all those Final Fantasy games on game pass right yeah so that's pretty I'm kind

19:21.540 --> 19:26.540
of excited because now I don't have to worry about finding a because I'm probably gonna finally get

19:26.540 --> 19:32.940
myself a 4k TV for Christmas so I don't have to worry about finding a disc version a Final Fantasy

19:32.940 --> 19:37.900
13 to get those upgrades like it'll be on game pass you know remember how they did those like

19:37.940 --> 19:44.460
upgrades for 4k for like Xbox one and all that so did they for 13 yeah they did so it was like

19:44.460 --> 19:51.780
any hair or is it 15 I think they did it for 15 to but they did it they did 13 was 360 I know but

19:51.780 --> 19:57.900
you know how they do those in hand yeah 360 things so they I mean I guess it would yeah yeah I mean

19:57.900 --> 20:01.820
I'm not expecting the world to be different but it's still gonna look a little better and that's

20:01.900 --> 20:08.540
nice that I can experience that through game pass yeah as a sorry guys I'm getting over a cold I

20:08.540 --> 20:13.580
brought back disease from New York so if I may be intermittently coughing during the show I'm in the

20:13.580 --> 20:19.300
same boat as you so they'll have to deal so sorry not sorry doing my best people get sick today's

20:19.300 --> 20:23.540
the first day I've actually felt like thank gosh I felt much better today I don't have like that

20:23.540 --> 20:28.900
intense pressure in my forehead like I've had the past few days so I'm okay to be doing the show but

20:28.900 --> 20:35.140
Dan was in full man flu mode yeah yeah it's been it's been not fun but anyway so even if the Final

20:35.140 --> 20:39.820
Fantasy stuff is old news I still think it's like oh but this is still like a cool little value and

20:39.820 --> 20:43.260
like knowing that these have been slightly enhanced it's like if you haven't looked at

20:43.260 --> 20:48.700
these games in a while which let's be real Final Fantasy 13 is probably almost 13 years old yeah

20:48.700 --> 20:54.380
it's pretty old at this point it's a reason to go back and visit him again you know perhaps so I

20:54.380 --> 20:58.140
think it's all pretty cool and then obviously some of these other big games like the rare game and

20:58.140 --> 21:02.540
the you know honey I shrunk the kids game which what's the what's the real name of that game the

21:02.540 --> 21:07.620
grounded grounded that I should be better to the developers than calling it what I'm calling it

21:07.620 --> 21:12.460
but that grounded game you know that those sound like some cool new ideas then the life is strange

21:12.460 --> 21:17.260
you know follow up from that studio and so forth these all are probably gonna be pretty big deal

21:17.260 --> 21:22.780
sorts of games kind of neat for Microsoft to be associated with that you know so I don't know I

21:22.780 --> 21:28.660
like grounded better when it's called earth defense force 2017 if I want to survive against

21:28.660 --> 21:33.900
giant ants and spiders I've already got my game for that okay all right now Bobby Black Wolf is

21:33.900 --> 21:38.420
explaining the Final Fantasy 13 thing a little bit saying Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox 360 was enhanced

21:38.420 --> 21:44.060
for Xbox one they got the original 720p cutscenes and put them in the Xbox one version whereas the

21:44.060 --> 21:50.980
original Xbox 360 version had 480p cutscenes so the cutscenes were re-rendered for Xbox basically

21:50.980 --> 21:57.740
or the high-definition 720p exactly well hey better than what it was on Xbox 360 so I still

21:57.740 --> 22:02.580
think that's pretty cool so neat so yeah sounds like a lot of good stuff out of Microsoft so you

22:02.580 --> 22:07.740
know and I I gotta say I'm enjoying that game pass thing I mean not to get too far into our gaming

22:07.740 --> 22:15.020
weeks that we're gonna get into next but I've been visiting blood-stained on the PC thanks to Xbox

22:15.020 --> 22:20.860
game pass on PC and you know it's just a night even though I had bought it on sorry I had my

22:20.860 --> 22:26.180
backer code on switch or whatever it's really nice to be able to explore that on PC on a version

22:26.180 --> 22:32.020
that's not as buggy it's probably the switch version well I don't know I I'm not as picky

22:32.020 --> 22:35.940
with some of those things but I did notice the switch version had some stutter and some issues

22:35.940 --> 22:40.660
so you know and when I heard they were gonna do all the changes I was like I'm just gonna put this

22:40.660 --> 22:44.100
on the shelf for a little bit and I'll come but what's another few months I'll go I'll go visit

22:44.100 --> 22:50.620
it again in a few months so it's been a few months but my kind of catalyst for going to visit it

22:50.620 --> 22:55.260
again was oh well now I can just get it on the PC for free because I'm already paying for it on the

22:55.260 --> 23:01.340
Xbox game pass and it's it's nice just sit at the PC and play it there and you know so yeah yeah but

23:01.340 --> 23:05.980
I'm I'm enjoying it I also thought there would be achievements but there's actually not but I mean

23:05.980 --> 23:10.860
I try not to just play games for achievements but sometimes they're a fun little incentive right so

23:10.900 --> 23:14.220
but they're actually there's no achievements on the PC version of blood stain that surprised me

23:14.220 --> 23:19.180
but I'm still enjoying the game for what it's worth so all right well with that we'll get into

23:19.180 --> 23:23.780
a little more about our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about the types of video games that we

23:23.780 --> 23:27.860
have been playing this week actually real quick before we get into our gaming weeks I really

23:27.860 --> 23:32.940
should ask you know when we did that taped episode we didn't have a lot of news in it because we had

23:32.940 --> 23:36.700
taped that on Tuesday and not a lot of news has to happen I don't know if anyone wanted to touch

23:36.700 --> 23:41.780
on anything that they kind of discovered you know kind of late last week that we didn't get to on the

23:41.780 --> 23:45.460
on the pre tape showed our soccer I know you were talking about one thing yeah there's a more recent

23:45.460 --> 23:50.620
something it actually did come up since last week but we didn't have it in a show role so I just

23:50.620 --> 23:54.900
wanted to mention Animal Crossing pocket camp is coming out with a sub service they like get you

23:54.900 --> 24:01.260
different perks like two different tiers so one of them will get have you a point in Apple an Apple

24:01.260 --> 24:06.580
an animal as your camp caretaker and get more help around the campsite and the other one you'll

24:06.620 --> 24:11.300
get fortune cookies and can store your furniture and clothing items and warehouses like I don't see

24:11.300 --> 24:16.820
why that's important because you've got it pretty much indeterminate storage anyway but maybe it's

24:16.820 --> 24:22.860
like more decorating ideas you know like you could have your storeroom on the console versions so

24:22.860 --> 24:31.620
it's gonna come out on it looks like the 21st in North America this month it's gonna be called

24:31.620 --> 24:36.140
pocket camp club they didn't say how much it is but if it's like the Mario Kart gold then maybe

24:36.220 --> 24:42.540
five bucks so just thought I would mention the Animal Crossing communities I'm in are kind of

24:42.540 --> 24:52.020
like and I'm like I'm an adult and I'm gonna pay for it it's an interesting thing they're adding

24:52.020 --> 24:56.140
to I mean I I admit I've kind of left pocket camp behind a long time ago but I know you're still a

24:56.140 --> 24:59.700
fan of it and obviously there's other people playing it you're not alone because people have

24:59.700 --> 25:06.180
opinions it's mine but I'm fill in until I have to admit I'm a little surprised or launching it

25:06.180 --> 25:10.940
now when we're what only like three months away from just hit the two-year anniversary for it I

25:10.940 --> 25:17.580
think they're trying to find a way to keep it viable win and on top of that I'm gonna be

25:17.580 --> 25:22.940
quitting idle pouring when my sub runs out it's like 17 bucks for three months for the SV IP

25:22.940 --> 25:27.020
because I'm just not having fun with it anymore the only thing I'm having fun it's telling all

25:27.020 --> 25:33.020
the people says join my guild join my guild just saying no like I've just turned into this cranky

25:33.020 --> 25:40.220
little contrarian in chat and it's been kind of funny well see a Tiberian chat says every so

25:40.220 --> 25:45.460
often I check my friends and I see Rob as being at level 7 I had to break it to you I uninstalled

25:45.460 --> 25:51.820
Animal Crossing while world for my phone a long time ago now world I'm sorry Animal Crossing pocket

25:52.660 --> 25:58.820
I uninstalled that for my phone a while ago now granted that was when I was still on my very small

25:58.820 --> 26:07.220
what 32 gigabyte iPhone 10 179 yeah I ran out of space but now my new guy this iPhone 11 max

26:07.220 --> 26:14.140
whatever whatever has I think a 128 in it so I have a lot more room again so maybe maybe I'll

26:14.140 --> 26:19.780
reinstall it maybe I'll get to level eight just for you and then I'm level 179 Jesus

26:20.500 --> 26:25.260
well they've got like all kinds of stuff since I think you played it last so there are they put

26:25.260 --> 26:30.580
in a lot more minigames like you've got fishing tourney now and you get like items and things for

26:30.580 --> 26:35.660
that you have like this flower thing where you catch bugs and then you can send the bugs to

26:35.660 --> 26:40.220
other people and you get the rare flowers that way and then you get stuff for doing that like

26:40.220 --> 26:45.020
special items and you get all kinds of like challenge tiers that you can do and then like

26:45.340 --> 26:49.860
the scavenger hunt like every couple of months and it's actually kind of fun I mean it's just

26:49.860 --> 26:55.940
been a little way and you can skip the freaking cut scenes like where you give people stuff and

26:55.940 --> 27:00.140
you can actually have who's the pelican guy you can have him deliver all the shit that people

27:00.140 --> 27:06.260
want to them so they've taken out a lot of the really annoying stuff and you get like a cabin

27:06.260 --> 27:10.260
now that you can decorate as well so it's probably why I'd get the storeroom if it's more chance to

27:10.260 --> 27:16.300
decorate hmm I do get the fortune cookies though because some of that shit's pretty well it's

27:16.300 --> 27:20.900
interesting to hear about the subscription thing especially this quote-unquote late in the game

27:20.900 --> 27:26.580
thank you see it very so all right anything else we want to touch on that may not be addressed the

27:26.580 --> 27:30.860
show roll coming up okay if not let's move into our gaming weeks let's talk about how was your

27:30.860 --> 27:34.860
gaming week and the types of video games that we've been playing this week our soccer oh obviously

27:34.860 --> 27:41.820
Animal Crossing but what else um I have been a little bit of idle pouring but like if I don't

27:41.820 --> 27:48.220
if I don't get the the rebirth because you have to like fight Osiris and I can't beat him yet I'm

27:48.220 --> 27:53.980
just like ready to give up on that damn game but I have been doing some Apple arcade stuff I'm kind

27:53.980 --> 27:59.980
of getting really back into pinball wizard it's like this little game where you play a guy and you

27:59.980 --> 28:04.780
have to propel him pinball style through these levels and hit enemies they can also turn red

28:04.780 --> 28:10.780
and attack you back and you hit barrels for like energy and treasure and life I'm reminded of like

28:10.780 --> 28:15.620
pinball quest on the NES where it's like it's pinball but there's a purpose to it type of thing

28:15.620 --> 28:19.900
well and your goal is to get the key that unlocks the door and sometimes you have to take the bars

28:19.900 --> 28:24.340
off the door but you can still unlock the door when the door opens you have a countdown until

28:24.340 --> 28:28.820
it lets you go through it and usually for me that's like more treasure more treasure because

28:28.820 --> 28:34.540
your treasure goes back into your overall score that gives you your level and you can also go in

28:34.820 --> 28:38.900
as you progress along with different levels you get different abilities unlocked but you can pay

28:38.900 --> 28:46.380
for those abilities to go up like my favorite one right now because I hate when I when I drain like

28:46.380 --> 28:51.060
I have a post that comes up that like stays up for like I have it now for like ten cycles or

28:51.060 --> 28:58.660
something but I like the one that like when you drain it takes less energy off of you and like

28:58.660 --> 29:03.380
there's these annoying bat creatures that you have to like hit their bombs it kicks the bombs into

29:03.420 --> 29:07.780
them and blows them up and then you have spiders that throw webs on your on your flippers and

29:07.780 --> 29:12.740
things like that it's kind of fun and then I've actually been playing legit pinball so we just

29:12.740 --> 29:20.580
got Doctor Who working again today and I played some black rose the other day and I played theater

29:20.580 --> 29:24.820
magic because that one was mine and Dan's anniversary machine and I just felt like a

29:24.820 --> 29:29.900
little bit of the it needed some love although it's hard to play anything in the garage right

29:29.900 --> 29:35.420
now because Dan's in the middle of rebuilding at 69 Mustang it was his first car he bought

29:35.420 --> 29:41.500
it off the street for 1200 bucks cash and he's getting it running so that's really oh and I

29:41.500 --> 29:48.780
picked up a thing today and I want people to guess what that thing is it could be a lot of things

29:48.780 --> 29:54.980
star soccer you got to give us some it's a game is it bigger than a bread box no okay let's see

29:55.020 --> 30:03.940
is it oh it's a game okay is it a Nintendo switch game it is okay oh it's in a GameStop bag okay

30:03.940 --> 30:11.580
you know what it is it's in a non GameStop bag gifted all right there it is so she's holding up

30:11.580 --> 30:18.060
on the stream her copy of Pokemon sword finally there you go so yeah all because of one Pokemon

30:18.060 --> 30:24.260
really sir fetch one Pokemon sold it for you sir fetched okay should we not be giving wild animals

30:24.260 --> 30:30.500
weapons now I mean I feel that this is a bad leak that didn't look like a leak in his mouth that

30:30.500 --> 30:36.340
looked like he's holding a sword he's holding the leak as a sword yes I get sir fetches holding a

30:36.340 --> 30:43.540
leak that little grooky gun meme that's a little tiny gun for those would be sword the bunny no I

30:43.540 --> 30:48.300
don't and I'm in actually I think that you know the fact start off with whatever that fire bunny

30:48.300 --> 30:53.100
is they score buddy yeah holding a leak is even kind of more frightening because that means he's

30:53.140 --> 30:58.940
fashioning a shank and they'll know they're they're gonna murder you and you're I'm just glad dark

30:58.940 --> 31:03.780
soccer has Pokemon sword because I have Pokemon shield and I feel like a lot more people like

31:03.780 --> 31:08.020
judging my friends list like I would say like two-thirds are on shield it's it's interesting

31:08.020 --> 31:13.300
how that seems to be the more popular I've already had a handful of people say oh get me a sir fetch

31:13.300 --> 31:19.020
and like and change just like they're a bitch to evolve good luck because everyone wants the fancy

31:19.020 --> 31:25.980
ponytail is what it is oh yeah ponytas only in she's gonna get me one oh oh oh oh is he if I'm

31:25.980 --> 31:31.740
gonna get you a sir fetched fine that'll be the deal is that when we get the hardcore pokey man's

31:31.740 --> 31:38.300
all right anything else for your gaming week um you should talk about I know you haven't been

31:38.300 --> 31:43.660
playing it but I know you've been watching yeah okay so my whole reason for because we I knew I

31:43.660 --> 31:47.100
was gonna eventually be picking up a game but I didn't know if I was gonna get Death Stranding or

31:47.100 --> 31:51.780
not so it ended up just being completely impatient getting sick of people trying to

31:51.780 --> 31:57.260
spoil shit because if someone wants to put spoil shit I'll spoil it for myself first so I watched

31:57.260 --> 32:01.060
an entire playthrough of Death Stranding so I could skip through the walking simulator which

32:01.060 --> 32:06.340
thank God I didn't buy it because the walking simulator part would be boring as fuck to me I'm

32:06.340 --> 32:11.860
just I'm sorry that is I like exploring I don't like exploring when you have to fight shit like

32:12.340 --> 32:17.460
the way that that has to happen and just the scenery was pretty but it was a little too

32:17.460 --> 32:23.260
natural to be fun if that makes sense it's really well rendered though but I did watch the whole

32:23.260 --> 32:28.100
thing cuz I was like what the fuck Kojima I've decided my favorite character is the bridge baby

32:28.100 --> 32:34.180
because I want to be a bridge baby and do watch this I know you know but I do still plan to play

32:34.180 --> 32:39.500
this like my New York trip through kind of this off and now I'm all about Pokemon shield which

32:39.500 --> 32:44.820
I'll come back to in a little bit so I won't pick up Death Stranding until I'm secretly hoping

32:44.820 --> 32:48.980
there'll be a Black Friday sale even though it's a black brand new game I feel like games that have

32:48.980 --> 32:53.460
come out I've still gotten reduced and like I said I'm on I would think there's gonna be a Black

32:53.460 --> 33:00.380
Friday sale and I'll pick up like to me it has a lot that makes me think of end of Evangelion

33:00.380 --> 33:06.300
especially the ending which of course I'm not gonna spoil for anybody but I really did get like

33:06.300 --> 33:11.980
a hardcore end of Evangelion vibe which I don't know the story of that so that's fine and I also

33:11.980 --> 33:20.340
no one does no one that's watching it's more or less like the one of the overrunning themes in

33:20.340 --> 33:26.180
the Evangelion series is how people relate to each other and contact with other people and that was a

33:26.180 --> 33:32.260
big thing in this is the the thought of of contact with people and it's not much of a spoiler because

33:32.380 --> 33:39.700
you find out right at the beginning but Sam the main character has almost allergic reaction when

33:39.700 --> 33:45.900
people touch him he has a big fear of touch and one of the ongoing things in the game is how people

33:45.900 --> 33:51.940
feel about their contact with other people you've got these different you know disparate groups all

33:51.940 --> 33:58.100
over the the country that you're trying to unite and a lot of them don't want to unite because they

33:58.100 --> 34:03.740
think they're safer by themselves and it's you know and keep in mind this is coming from a

34:03.740 --> 34:08.540
Japanese writer and a big thing in Japanese society right now is that disconnection of

34:08.540 --> 34:15.380
personal relationships and you know that goes to something we were discussing well I was gonna ask

34:15.380 --> 34:18.380
you if I could kind of bring this up I was gonna say it's kind of a difficult question but I know

34:18.380 --> 34:21.860
we were talking a little bit about it before the show but I was wondering if I could bring up on

34:21.860 --> 34:27.980
the show there was a controversy on Twitter and social media going around about you know

34:28.500 --> 34:34.660
is is there an anti asexual narrative in the game well I was and I wanted you're a pit year you're

34:34.660 --> 34:39.500
an out asexual woman you've mentioned that on the show before I wanted to know your take you know

34:39.500 --> 34:42.780
even though you haven't played the game you certainly familiarized yourself with the story

34:42.780 --> 34:47.460
start to finish at this point so what's your I dug deep what what's your well what's your take

34:47.460 --> 34:51.100
on the ace because I when I read it I was like oh shit is this gonna ruin the game for Dark Sakura

34:51.100 --> 34:57.340
what's your take on the asexuality my narrative my thing is that first of all that it's supposed

34:57.340 --> 35:03.700
to be one observation of a character in it who probably doesn't identify as asexual we

35:03.700 --> 35:08.620
are kind of mythical to some people they don't really understand because a lot of people meaning

35:08.620 --> 35:13.860
asexual people yes because a lot most people I mean we are what one to two percent of the

35:13.860 --> 35:18.420
population we may be as much as ten percent but that hasn't been proven yet but the majority of

35:18.420 --> 35:23.380
people have a sex drive we are really hard to understand I was gonna quickly say I bet when

35:23.380 --> 35:26.500
you consider that it's probably more of like a spectrum and you have what do you call that

35:26.540 --> 35:31.260
the demisexuality that's kind of like your gray ace where it's like a little bit that probably is

35:31.260 --> 35:38.100
kind of where it comes demisexual is when you can only have an attraction to somebody when you form

35:38.100 --> 35:43.100
an emotional connection to them okay anyway not to not to not even going into romantic spectrum

35:43.100 --> 35:50.380
not to digress but edumacation but but you know they're saying oh we're throwing all the and I

35:50.380 --> 35:55.500
should probably find the comment or the the thing but they're you know but a lot of people like oh

35:55.500 --> 36:00.260
well they're you know using this as weapon against us and saying all this that we're degrading

36:00.260 --> 36:05.580
society and all that like no no no no and keep in mind the writing of this is coming from a

36:05.580 --> 36:12.060
Japanese writer and right now in Japanese society in America starting to have some of this go on to

36:12.060 --> 36:20.060
you is that they are first of all having fewer dedicated relationships and a much lower birth

36:20.060 --> 36:27.580
rate because people in general are not having sex I mean I'll just put it that way it's really low

36:27.580 --> 36:36.260
on the societal priority level a lot more is being brought into career and education and things like

36:36.260 --> 36:40.980
that so I just did a quick search on Twitter and I don't think this is the original tweet but

36:40.980 --> 36:46.900
somebody on Twitter has wrote content warning ace phobia oof warning for asexual folks and anyone

36:46.900 --> 36:53.020
really death stranding has some fucked up trash of a codex entry and it's it has a screenshot and

36:53.020 --> 36:58.140
I'm not gonna read the whole thing but it's called an asexual world record suggests that the

36:58.140 --> 37:02.540
widespread aversion towards physical contact and intimacy was a phenomenon that had been observed

37:02.540 --> 37:06.780
even before the death stranding one contemporary report for example details the increasing

37:06.780 --> 37:11.220
popularity of the sexless lifestyle among young people a growing percentage of the younger cohort

37:11.220 --> 37:16.060
were self-identifying as asexual claiming to be incapable of feeling desire or attraction and it

37:16.060 --> 37:22.820
goes on that's from the in-game yeah and see the thing is though is that I mean I look at it along

37:22.820 --> 37:28.980
as like how autism is going that oh people weren't done autism before that's like well you know this

37:28.980 --> 37:33.460
because they're finding more of us and we feel a lot more comfortable being public about those

37:33.460 --> 37:38.500
things about ourselves you know or like oh what's all this trans business we didn't have this well

37:38.500 --> 37:45.180
now people have a name to put on their identity it's the same thing and I think that yes it came

37:45.180 --> 37:53.780
from a rather tone-deaf point of view and you know they also go in to talk about the quote a

37:53.780 --> 37:59.460
measurable decrease in human fertility blah blah blah but I think it's also if you look in the

37:59.460 --> 38:06.140
context of the universe they're living in when if you get caught in the rain you're going to age so

38:06.140 --> 38:12.700
much that you die you know or if they're creatures out there that if they kill a living person it's

38:12.700 --> 38:19.940
going to create a crater the size of a city block who's gonna want to breed during that kind of you

38:19.940 --> 38:24.220
know thing people are going to be afraid they're not gonna want to bring children into a world like

38:24.220 --> 38:30.420
that so if I'm hearing correctly like maybe if somebody just takes this screenshot and if this

38:30.420 --> 38:36.140
shit happens a lot in our online society we live in we know this that here here in the air bar to

38:36.140 --> 38:42.780
the chat you know 2019 but if you took that screenshot and only that screenshot in no context

38:42.780 --> 38:46.820
you might be able to see why oh this might this seems like a little bit like it's blaming

38:46.820 --> 38:54.220
asexuals for the game but if you consider it that like you said this is one fictional person's

38:54.220 --> 38:58.940
observation on a greater picture and you have to understand that the greater picture is based on

38:58.940 --> 39:06.100
a society where yes sexuality has declined for all of these other reasons as well and you know

39:06.100 --> 39:10.060
again this game doesn't necessarily always come from an American perspective as much as just

39:10.060 --> 39:15.700
Japanese perspective where the view on sex is very different and right now this is where Japanese

39:15.700 --> 39:22.820
society is in general you know that there's just so I mean yeah you do still have like compensated

39:22.820 --> 39:28.980
dating and things like that but for the most part the average person isn't going to put as much a

39:28.980 --> 39:35.260
priority on that in favor of living sometimes a more isolated life I mean you've got the hikikomori

39:35.260 --> 39:40.180
issue right now where people are so stressed out by the outside world and other people that they

39:40.180 --> 39:46.580
will live in in their own homes and not emerge from it and which is actually now again starting

39:46.580 --> 39:53.980
to happen more in America we're getting a lot more of that now I think that it's really I think that

39:53.980 --> 40:00.340
maybe this is more of an allegory for that particular societal event that and in some

40:00.340 --> 40:06.020
cases for people who maybe are afraid I've talked to people who are just like I'm afraid of it I'm

40:06.020 --> 40:10.420
not ready for it so I tell people I'm ace I'm like wait you're not ace if you are clearly if

40:10.420 --> 40:16.380
you have a drive you know that does us harm but from a person who doesn't understand a sexuality

40:16.380 --> 40:21.940
this really isn't surprising to me and I'm not insulted okay well I'm glad I asked and thank you

40:21.940 --> 40:26.380
for helping bring some insight to that big controversy on Twitter right now and also keep

40:26.380 --> 40:31.140
in mind a lot of people complaining about it I'll just throw it out there they're neurotypical

40:31.140 --> 40:36.580
and I don't take that much of an emotional look toward it for me it's a little bit more on the

40:36.580 --> 40:42.340
base of logic so I don't have an emotional attachment to those things I just know that

40:42.340 --> 40:47.740
those people aren't thinking clearly well my perception of what's going on I mean isn't

40:47.740 --> 40:52.460
everything perception my perception of it all is that we are we're not considering the context of

40:52.460 --> 40:57.580
what we're looking at in a lot of these Twitter screenshots and isn't that the way things seem

40:57.580 --> 41:03.860
to be way too often here in this year in in this generation in fact is that there's so much that

41:03.860 --> 41:10.420
gets posted on Facebook and it's a headline that was written to be too sensational that doesn't

41:10.420 --> 41:15.860
really consider the context of what was going on I don't believe any story I look at unless I have

41:15.860 --> 41:21.380
opened it up read it and add my own fucking disclaimer to it and I've posted earlier on my

41:21.380 --> 41:29.420
Facebook today I'm like X X files the truth is out there and I believe nothing so everyone I'm

41:29.420 --> 41:34.020
gonna tell you this right now check two things when people post shit check the site it comes

41:34.020 --> 41:41.700
from like if it's realhealthnews.com it's about detoxing it's probably fake as fuck check the

41:41.700 --> 41:49.300
dates on your articles to check if they're cited check their sources be you have to do your due

41:49.300 --> 41:55.260
diligence when you read any of this I really wish Facebook would integrate the date of the article

41:55.260 --> 42:01.580
I'm getting off of Facebook anyway one way or another diversion but so back to Death Stranding

42:01.580 --> 42:08.060
so my consensus my feeling of what you're saying about it is the game part of it but the story part

42:08.060 --> 42:13.300
of it pretty interesting well and the other thing too is that as these people become more connected

42:13.300 --> 42:18.060
it brings its own danger with it so and I'm not starting out getting into the spoilers on that

42:18.060 --> 42:23.980
but that is also showing you that there are pluses and minuses to everything the fears that people

42:23.980 --> 42:30.620
have and I really do think that it's just a really good corollary for a lot of things happening in

42:30.620 --> 42:34.660
the world right now and the nature of interpersonal relationships and how we deal with our communities

42:34.660 --> 42:40.900
it really is a great commentary I fucking love the story and I wanted to punch a few people in

42:40.900 --> 42:48.020
the face and Conan O'Brien one of them his character is so fucking stupid and I hate Conan

42:48.020 --> 42:52.860
O'Brien okay I don't think he's funny and his character was even less funny except I totally

42:52.860 --> 43:00.380
won an otter hat so someone was to get me an otter hat you can get one I'll give you my address but

43:00.380 --> 43:09.260
but it really was a great just correlation to a lot of things the world are in and from someone

43:09.260 --> 43:15.500
who had I started off I did take a lot of psychology classes deciding if I wanted to be

43:15.500 --> 43:20.620
a major or not and it really did just spike a lot of the stuff I remember from school well and I'm

43:20.620 --> 43:25.420
very fascinated your your review has piqued my interest even more like I thought originally it

43:25.420 --> 43:31.620
would be a hate play of Kojima's you know art fuck project but I will tell you that the true ending

43:31.620 --> 43:36.760
though it's long it's metal it's metal gear solid for long is it true it's a two-hour cutscene at

43:36.760 --> 43:43.240
the end fuck something like that but it was one of the scenes where I wanted to punch somebody

43:43.240 --> 43:48.440
huh and the one thing I like about the true ending is that all of these little flashbacks you get

43:48.440 --> 43:53.240
through the game it puts them into context yeah one thing I've been hearing pretty consistently

43:53.240 --> 44:00.880
about the game is that once you beat it it makes sense that it's not like it's not that vague or

44:00.880 --> 44:06.080
whatever like like the build-up to the game has been it's really good at the foreshadowing and

44:06.080 --> 44:11.860
redirection I'm not gonna say necessarily misdirection because it's kind of guiding you

44:11.860 --> 44:17.880
in the right way but it shifts gears to where you thought it was heading one way a little bit of

44:17.880 --> 44:22.120
miss and redirection all right all right well let's stop there before we even and that's my

44:22.120 --> 44:27.760
non-spoiler spoilery psychiatric review of Death Stranding well now I have to make a game called

44:27.760 --> 44:35.520
hate play art fuck project that's just a great name can we put that on the YY our request no

44:36.160 --> 44:42.200
Loki's gonna do it I just have to get something really artsy and out there I just my head isn't

44:42.200 --> 44:46.560
up my own ass enough to be able to like put something out like that yes just just pick

44:46.560 --> 44:50.880
like an art period like distill or the Bauhaus movement and you've got something to go from

44:50.880 --> 44:56.960
because sometimes distill and Bauhaus we're kind of up there and asked you all right art found up

44:56.960 --> 45:04.640
my own ass by Loki all right Loki how is your gaming week I played a lot of minecraft dirt

45:04.640 --> 45:10.480
because that launched this week so it's the new AR game yay okay great you can tell me what the

45:10.480 --> 45:14.960
fuck it is because I've tried playing it and but to be fair I've been sick all week so I haven't

45:14.960 --> 45:18.800
really left the house a lot you know some for work for a couple days so I've been able to do is tap

45:18.800 --> 45:24.320
stuff on the house I'm like yay I got bricks yay so what what's the game so basically there's not

45:24.320 --> 45:30.320
much of a game there yet so it's just like Pokemon there's not a whole lot of but there's very much

45:30.320 --> 45:38.640
a game in Pokemon Pokemon go not so much but collecting them all yeah so you just you go around

45:38.640 --> 45:44.640
which is kind of nice they have like they don't have so you play the game what you have is

45:44.640 --> 45:49.840
tappable so they're when you pull it up there's like your map which you see your streets around

45:49.840 --> 45:53.760
you and everything and there's stuff that you can tap on the map to get things so they have like

45:53.760 --> 46:01.760
rock or you know it's like stone grass trees there's cows pigs and sheep and so you can tap

46:01.760 --> 46:06.960
on those and you get them and it adds it to your inventory and then you build up your inventory

46:06.960 --> 46:12.080
and then they have these base plates you can use to actually go kind of build something it's sort

46:12.080 --> 46:17.600
of like creative mode and you build it and then using the AR thing so you actually like kind of

46:17.600 --> 46:23.600
project it onto the floor when it works because I was trying to do it here in the studio and mine

46:23.600 --> 46:29.840
kept sinking into the floor so you project it and you build it on it and stuff and then you can go

46:29.840 --> 46:34.880
into like a play mode and actually like actually play with legit Minecraft but it's really small

46:34.880 --> 46:40.320
it's like 16 by or at the most 16 by 16 the ones you start off with are eight by eight and so most

46:40.320 --> 46:45.040
of the stuff that you're doing in the game it feels like you're kind of looking into a hole

46:45.040 --> 46:49.440
because that's kind of what it is so like they have these adventures that you go on

46:49.440 --> 46:56.320
so you'll see these lights that are in parks and it's not like pokemon go where they have specific

46:56.320 --> 47:01.920
points that they spawn in it's basically an area of the map that it's the deemed there's a park

47:01.920 --> 47:06.160
and they'll spawn randomly in there and they'll shuffle around every once in a while and move

47:06.160 --> 47:11.200
to different parts of the park and so like the park near me I have like three of them that just

47:11.200 --> 47:18.160
shuffle around um over by the river there's like a fucking ton of them just like crazy amounts of

47:18.160 --> 47:24.240
those things but they're not all that diverse so each one you when you go on an adventure that's

47:24.240 --> 47:31.360
such an elaborate way to put it it's basically just a small section of Minecraft so you can go

47:31.360 --> 47:36.320
in there you actually have to have a pickaxe and sword and stuff and you dig out blocks and the

47:36.320 --> 47:41.680
blocks that are in there are sometimes different than what you can find normally in your tappables

47:41.680 --> 47:48.560
like for example that's the only way you can get coal which is kind of annoying um so you go there

47:48.560 --> 47:53.680
and then you can fight mobs sometimes and really like for the adventures for me it's collect as many

47:53.680 --> 47:59.600
um blocks as I can before I get bum rushed by skeletons for no fucking reason is what it is

47:59.600 --> 48:04.320
because you'll be like digging into the ground and really all it is is it's a hole so you're digging

48:04.320 --> 48:09.600
down and you've got your eight by eight section and then for no reason there's skeletons coming

48:09.600 --> 48:14.000
to me at the side even though it's daylight out and they should be burning in the sun Minecraft

48:14.000 --> 48:20.560
rules um but I'm getting bum rushed by them so then I have to kill them and do all that if you die

48:20.560 --> 48:27.120
in adventure mode you lose all your blocks that you had yikes well just in your like so you start

48:27.120 --> 48:33.680
off you have like a one line you're like in Minecraft you have like a row of items that you

48:33.680 --> 48:38.880
normally have without going into like your inventory so that row of items you lose that

48:38.880 --> 48:43.520
and then any blocks you picked up in the adventure mode you lose that so what I tend to do is like if

48:43.520 --> 48:47.840
I see myself getting low on health exit out you take everything with you then you can go back in

48:47.840 --> 48:51.280
there if you want and if you dive and who cares so now but you you were saying something about

48:51.280 --> 48:56.800
the creations don't really save where other people yeah so like I can't draw a big dick in somebody

48:56.800 --> 49:02.800
that not that I've found so like right now like you can build your base plates and stuff and you

49:02.800 --> 49:08.640
can you can put them down and then I think there's a way that you can sync it so that other people

49:08.640 --> 49:14.000
can actually see it as well but you have to like scan something on their phone in order to do that

49:14.000 --> 49:19.440
it's not like I can just go to your park or go to a park and build something and it's there for

49:19.440 --> 49:23.600
anybody to see as far as I'm aware because I could see where people would be complete

49:23.600 --> 49:27.760
douche bags about like building you know bags of dicks and things on people's houses

49:28.320 --> 49:33.120
so yeah so you have to like willingly share that and receive that from somebody in order to be

49:33.120 --> 49:37.840
able to see right so they've got yeah because they have like a join a friend mode and you have to

49:37.840 --> 49:43.040
like you have like a space or whatever that you can scan a qr code it looks like and then they've

49:43.040 --> 49:48.560
got um you can do crafting in the game because it is minecraft so you have a crafting table and a

49:48.560 --> 49:53.520
smelter and you can you don't really eat so here's the weird thing so like I can in the adventure

49:53.520 --> 49:58.320
mode I can kill sheep and uh cows like you would expect and you get meat from them but normally

49:58.320 --> 50:03.920
you would cook the meat and eat it and use it for like regain your health you can't do anything with

50:03.920 --> 50:11.200
it like I have meat I can't put it in the smelter uh which is your oven I can't use it to cook it

50:11.200 --> 50:15.200
I can't eat it to regain my health in like adventure modes I don't know what the point

50:15.200 --> 50:18.880
of the game is like really rough around the edge it is really rough around the edges it's but it

50:18.880 --> 50:25.920
is early access it yeah say the tutorial kind of stinks the tutorial stinks um uh you basically

50:25.920 --> 50:29.840
most of the leveling up of the game is just tapables just tap stuff and you'll go up I'm

50:29.840 --> 50:35.040
already level 12 and the adventure mode doesn't really give you that much in the way of um

50:35.040 --> 50:40.240
experience it's more of just here's a way to get like blocks I can get steel from there um

50:42.000 --> 50:47.120
and I don't know it's it's all right so one thing you know there's several things that are wrong

50:47.120 --> 50:52.560
with it right now one it has a really hard time tracking where you are like it that GPS tracking

50:52.560 --> 50:57.200
it especially when I get near the river and I don't know why it's just that corridor between

50:57.200 --> 51:03.120
highway 50 and in the American river there it's just jumping like a mile away and back just going

51:03.120 --> 51:08.480
like all of our coverage is not great with all the wildlife out there I just don't know it just

51:08.480 --> 51:13.600
it cannot track me or like if I'm at my work it's jumping across the street and coming back it's

51:13.600 --> 51:18.080
just don't you work in a tall building I'm talking about outside in the parking lot like where the

51:18.080 --> 51:24.400
like it should be able to read my GPS in the middle of you know open space at my work like

51:24.400 --> 51:29.360
even though I work on the first floor of a three-story building like my GPS always puts me

51:29.360 --> 51:33.840
but I mean it puts me right on top of a pokey stop but it's the pokey stop that's like across

51:33.840 --> 51:38.640
the parking lot at the little stand where you can get sandwiches like clear across the lot even

51:38.640 --> 51:43.600
though that's nowhere near where my desk actually is so um yeah so I mean basically you get like

51:43.600 --> 51:49.680
tappables and then um they have like daily challenges that you can do and you get experience

51:49.680 --> 51:53.600
that way which is another good way to do it um you get experience I see you're tapping shit on

51:53.600 --> 51:57.280
my house right now yeah so it's just like cobblestone like I have so much cobblestone

51:57.280 --> 52:01.920
and everything like I have there's no limit to what you can carry no that's nice there's no good

52:01.920 --> 52:06.080
limit on the inventory about Harry Potter so like of course you want to know like it's a free to

52:06.080 --> 52:12.240
play game so where the microtransactions um not very many actually so what they've got is you can

52:12.240 --> 52:17.920
you earn um rubies as you're playing the game and the rubies can be used for a couple things

52:17.920 --> 52:22.880
you can use them to buy additional base plates so you can have more base plates and the base plates

52:22.880 --> 52:26.880
come with things on them already like it's already like a pre-designed thing so what I tend to do

52:26.880 --> 52:31.680
with the base plates is just clear them out and take all the things from them um you can see you

52:31.680 --> 52:37.440
can buy new base plates you can use it to speed up the time it takes to craft things because it

52:37.440 --> 52:41.680
does take time to craft stuff in here so if like I want to make a pickaxe it's gonna take like

52:41.680 --> 52:45.680
five minutes to do that so if I were a typical mobile game trope right so if I want to speed

52:45.680 --> 52:51.520
it up I can just you know tap it in it it's one rupee per minute um but you earn them so often

52:51.520 --> 52:56.560
like I have over a hundred of them right now and I haven't bought anything so you have that and then

52:56.560 --> 53:02.640
they also have like um with the s2100 mats like this discussion killed chat apparently chat does

53:02.640 --> 53:07.360
not give a shit about minecraft earth I don't know I think it's interesting um see minecraft's only

53:07.360 --> 53:11.760
like the biggest game to come out in the last 15 years so you can create your own skins and stuff

53:11.760 --> 53:15.040
in there and then they have like you can do customization with the skins like they have

53:15.040 --> 53:20.000
outfits that you can buy you can spend money on whatever they're like gold or whatever but the

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
outfits kind of suck I don't know but it's really access you're gonna spend money on it yeah exactly

53:24.000 --> 53:29.440
so it's that's kind of what they have so far let me let me ask this to sum it up is there potential

53:29.440 --> 53:34.000
here yes absolutely I think so like I want to see how like because before they made it sound like

53:34.000 --> 53:38.960
oh you can go to the park and you can see you know someone's creation stuff and it's actually

53:38.960 --> 53:43.360
kind of cool like actually when it is bright and you're out like a park or something like that it

53:43.360 --> 53:49.200
does track pretty well like you can I was playing it earlier today and I'm sure it looks stupid but

53:49.200 --> 53:53.840
like it works like you can walk around and like have strangers coming up to you going are you

53:53.840 --> 53:58.000
playing the poke no no no one came up to me because they they because they do that to me

53:58.000 --> 54:02.960
when I'm playing Ingress are you no but like I like so for me like I had because I'm looking

54:02.960 --> 54:06.800
up and down so I have my phone like this or I'm like looking down at the ground and stuff like

54:06.800 --> 54:12.480
that and like I'm like dodging stuff so it looks a little weird but it's it's fun it's the only

54:13.040 --> 54:18.160
and because it is early access it eats your battery like nothing and it makes your phone

54:18.160 --> 54:24.080
super hot so that's the only uh downside is it will eat your battery it gets all toasty like

54:24.080 --> 54:29.520
early AR games will do yes as as early AR games do so um yeah definitely we're checking out if

54:29.520 --> 54:35.360
you haven't yet and it's it's fun so it is one of those games you can actually probably play it on

54:35.360 --> 54:40.240
your house just without going anywhere because stuff keeps respawning there and you can tap away

54:40.240 --> 54:46.400
and get all sorts of stuff um so aside from Minecraft Earth I played a little bit of Pokemon

54:46.400 --> 54:53.680
Go and I played more What the Golf so I've been going through that and what else working on my

54:53.680 --> 55:00.880
game and that's about it all right uh my gaming week so I guess I've also been AR gaming and

55:00.880 --> 55:04.640
the good old Ingress has double AP right now so I've been trying to play that but it's

55:04.640 --> 55:09.200
it's hard because I've been getting over this cold um but I still I still did some walking

55:09.200 --> 55:13.760
around to the local park just you know smashing what the opponents did and building my own thing

55:13.760 --> 55:18.240
and pretty much it's pretty much sanctioned when trading at this point but whatever I'm getting the

55:18.240 --> 55:24.720
double AP uh so that's nice and then I've been playing Pokemon Go I did community day uh I caught

55:24.720 --> 55:30.800
three shiny Chimchars more importantly I caught two of the bong weasings uh which are uh the Galar

55:30.800 --> 55:36.080
region one they look like big bongs so that was fun big bongs they did what will you trade me

55:36.080 --> 55:41.920
uh I can try I don't know if those are tradable they should be I can trade one yeah um so I caught

55:42.000 --> 55:47.840
those and then um yeah that was fun um and then uh Harry Potter I played a little bit today because

55:47.840 --> 55:51.680
there's a community day in Harry Potter but all I did was I walked to the park that's like right

55:51.680 --> 55:55.280
here because it was all fortress battle stuff so I just did like four battles in the fortress I was

55:55.280 --> 56:00.000
like okay I'm done bye and that was that was my Harry Potter community day um so still still

56:00.000 --> 56:04.080
staying on the up and up on the AR games so there is that um but I'm playing of course lots of

56:04.080 --> 56:08.720
traditional games as well I mentioned Bloodstained earlier in the show um still making my way slowly

56:08.720 --> 56:12.720
through that I just beat what I think is the third boss um so just making my way through

56:12.720 --> 56:19.440
that game still it's it's good times um and still been playing Final Fantasy 14 my machinist finally

56:19.440 --> 56:25.120
hit level 80 so I now have a healer a tank and a dps all at level 80 so I can do whatever I want

56:25.120 --> 56:33.760
in the different uh end game content and I've been playing a lot this weekend of Pokemon Shield

56:34.000 --> 56:39.600
I got the digital copy that unlocked on Thursday night and I started playing I think my playtime

56:39.600 --> 56:44.560
count says it's like at eight or nine hours that seems like a lot when you consider I only have two

56:44.560 --> 56:51.280
badges but it does take a long time to get to the first gym um so I'm I'm enjoying the game so far

56:51.280 --> 56:58.000
uh it's interesting how it throws you into that wild zone pretty early on so the wild zone is

56:58.000 --> 57:03.520
like a very large open map like a very probably the largest map that's been in a Pokemon thing

57:03.520 --> 57:07.600
and because it's on the switch on a newer system you can kind of see clear across this map you know

57:07.600 --> 57:12.080
when you're standing on one side of it so you can see where all the tall grass is and you know you

57:12.080 --> 57:16.000
can see Pokemon on the map now so you kind of have an idea what you're going to run into and catch

57:16.000 --> 57:20.400
although there will sometimes still just be little rustles that exclamation points and you won't know

57:20.400 --> 57:24.640
what that is until you run into them so of course some of the really good stuff is hidden so you

57:24.640 --> 57:28.880
have to kind of you know take your chances and so forth um but I thought it was very interesting

57:28.880 --> 57:35.040
that it's so open before you get to the first gym I mean you can amass easily a Pokédex of

57:35.040 --> 57:39.040
probably if I'd really spent time on it and like done more of the Dynamax raids and stuff which

57:39.040 --> 57:42.640
I'll get into in a minute I probably could have had a Pokédex of 50 or 60 if not more

57:42.640 --> 57:47.040
like before I even took on the first gym um whereas you know in the early games it's like

57:47.040 --> 57:54.240
what okay I caught a Pidgey a Rattata and a Nido Nido male and a Nido female and now I got to go

57:54.640 --> 57:59.920
and a Caterpie and I gotta go take on uh you know Brock you know that your choices are pretty

57:59.920 --> 58:04.240
limited from the early routes so it's kind of interesting it's interesting especially when a

58:04.240 --> 58:09.200
lot of the dialogue about this game has been about the removal of Pokémon and stuff it is interesting

58:09.200 --> 58:15.360
how plentiful the Pokémon seem in these early stages of the game and you know to address that

58:15.360 --> 58:20.000
controversy a little bit like you know sure I was a little bit sad to hear that some of the

58:20.000 --> 58:24.160
starters including you know Litten from the last generation stuff some ones I really like

58:24.160 --> 58:28.880
aren't in it but at the same time you know there are like 400 Pokémon that are in it

58:28.880 --> 58:33.600
and I'm still having enough of a like discovery mode thing where I run into these Pokémon and go

58:33.600 --> 58:40.480
oh this guy and I'm not the hardcore Pokémon fan that some of you are you know or Shane is or

58:40.480 --> 58:45.040
something like that but I do play quite a bit of Pokémon Go so there's a lot of Pokémon that I'll

58:45.040 --> 58:49.600
go like oh it's one of those guys it's the little shell guy from Pokémon Go or oh it's a Hoothoot

58:50.240 --> 58:56.960
those are trash in Pokémon Go you know like I'll recognize I'll recognize excuse me I'll recognize

58:56.960 --> 59:01.680
stuff from Pokémon Go and I think that's kind of fun so you know even though there's a lot of stuff

59:01.680 --> 59:06.000
missing sure there's a lot of stuff that's still there and it's enough to make me go oh it's that

59:06.000 --> 59:11.040
guy oh it's this guy oh fun oh I think what's really interesting about this game though are

59:11.040 --> 59:16.560
the Dynamax raids so you can actually so in the wild area you'll see these big beams of light

59:16.560 --> 59:22.560
and if you walk up to them you can initiate a raid so it's kind of like Pokémon Go in a way

59:22.560 --> 59:26.480
but more the more strategic it's not just tapping as fast as you can it's like an actual Pokémon

59:26.480 --> 59:33.040
battle that's four versus one um so you and three friends take on a Pokémon or if you're like

59:33.040 --> 59:37.840
fuck friends I don't want to play games with other people you can just take three NPCs in with you

59:37.840 --> 59:41.920
and do it or you can do a combination you have one friend they need to have two NPCs whatever

59:41.920 --> 59:47.120
and you can do these raids and um when you're connected to the internet playing the game

59:47.120 --> 59:51.520
you can see when other people are about to start raids and join their raid which I think is really

59:51.520 --> 59:57.200
cool so like the first time so like the other raids the Pokémon are larger than normal oh

59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.640
yeah they're gigantic and then you beat it and then you have a chance to catch it so like I've

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.720
done a bunch of one star raids I've done a couple of the two stars I've usually had no problem

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:12.400
catching and I did a three star raid today for the first time and we beat it it was fine but I

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.840
didn't catch it I threw a great ball at it and I still didn't catch it so catching it's not

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.520
guaranteed you get like one shot and that's it so um and it's just it's luck it's big stupid luck

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.760
like these games usually are it's that little I can't remember the name of this Pokémon it's that

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:33.280
water Pokémon that has a butthole for a mouth that's what it is that's what it's there's little

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.360
water Pokémon with a little butthole for a mouth that's what it is and I didn't catch it

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.520
it ran away for whatever reason so oh yes reverse bidet that's right yes reverse bidet

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.920
ran away damn it reversed bidet ran away

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:58.000
so yeah but um so I'm through the second gym right now and um yeah on my way to the third

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.320
gym and I'm enjoying the game it's you know I don't usually beat Pokémon games because

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.720
I'll go oh shiny and something else takes my interest or I'm like this takes too long to get

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.440
from here to here but um I'm enjoying this one well enough and yeah I like that I think the

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.560
other thing that I like too is that when I do the raids you get experience candy so that helps you

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.880
level your Pokémon so it's like you don't have to sit there and just grind regular Pokémon battles

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.920
as someone who hasn't played the mainline Pokémon games does this have enough of a tutorial in it

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.000
where like I'm gonna know what I'm doing or is it more of like you probably should have played some

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.640
Pokémon games it's kind of the same tutorial all the other games have where it's like it walks you

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.480
through oh you here I'll help you catch a Pokémon so first you want to weaken it then you throw a

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.480
ball at it kind of walks you through those types of things I mean it is for kids so it's Nintendo

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.160
kids could probably understand it Loki I don't know if you can but I think I think yeah probably

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.520
be into it it's fun maybe yeah so um yeah I'm enjoying it enough uh the only thing I could

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.280
really read it on uh if I had to go into like the negative actually wait no there's one more

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.440
positive I actually want to say um it's not a thing that usually gets committed in games but

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.000
I think the music in particular is worth calling out like especially when you're doing the gym

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.680
battles like the big like battle like when you fight like Milo the the grass gym leader the the

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.600
water gym leader when you're Nessa I think her name is when you're fighting them like the gym

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:25.120
battle music's like really good so like a lot of the music in the game is really good okay so I

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.280
guess I should say something negative it's not a perfect game uh the one thing I could probably

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.320
read it on is that it it kind of has some performance issues uh when you're in the wild

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:40.000
area and I think just because it is a Nintendo switch um a Nintendo switch can't do you know the

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.360
same type of power that the other consoles can do and when you are connected and online like what

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.400
happens is that your wild area will get populated with other players will show up and like give you

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.920
gifts and things like that but like they just like pop in on top of you right next to you like

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:02.480
halfway running and it's kind of jank like it's not very flattering to the get like it's almost

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.120
better to just take it offline and then the performance issues aren't nearly as bad so

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.120
that's the one thing I could probably read it on is that performance issues when you're connected

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.680
in the wild although I do love the idea of the Ycom and being able to join in raids and stuff

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.520
like it does it it kind of chokes when you're in the wild area um but I guess it's an optional

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:28.400
thing or what have you so all right oh Shane says you can skip those tutorials if you want

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.640
he's in the chat saying that you can skip those tutorials that's true I do remember you get

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.400
dialogue choices and it'll say like tell me more or I know you know so you can kind of choose if

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:45.040
the game's gonna hand hold you a little bit or or not so all right um that's it for my gaming week

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.000
I think I've said said plenty so let's move on we're gonna get into some news here and talk about

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.120
what's going on in the gaming world and we'll start off with uh Loki let's talk about Google

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:05.760
Stadia so Google Stadia is uh launching pretty soon actually this week so uh November 19th

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.800
it's gonna be launching but it's gonna be missing some of the features that they talked about

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:17.440
originally at um when they were announcing it so some of the things that are missing stream connect

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:24.000
uh state share and crowd play uh the features that allow you to join in other people's games

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.080
um or I believe that you can connect to games through like YouTube when they were gonna have

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:37.600
that link or whatever um that is not coming it's supposed to be out um they said expect the first

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.560
game of streaming connect to launch by the end of the year now this may change too because we

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.880
just had a late breaking announcement with uh Stadia as well so I'll get into that just say

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.960
um their achievement system not going to be coming right away uh the ability to use the

01:04:52.960 --> 01:05:02.240
chromecast ultras uh to play games not launching with that um apparently family sharing is not

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.600
going to happen if you want to play if you're uh you're if you're a parent and your kids have

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:13.520
access to different accounts you're gonna buy the game separately for them um right now so

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:19.680
Google Stadia is about as finished as Minecraft Earth yes actually Minecraft is probably further

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.680
along uh the buddy passes that you apparently agree with the founders edition so if you bought

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:29.040
the founders edition you get like a three month pass um those will be coming out later um you're

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.800
gonna get emailed those later uh the stadia controller uh apparently even though people

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.920
have pre-ordered the stadia will get their codes assigned to the service um starting November 19th

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:46.000
will be able to play on their phones and chrome browsers apparently uh some of the packages

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.040
contain the controllers and chromecast have staggered shipping and those may not make launch

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:02.000
whoops so uh what are the games gonna be at launch originally there was um gonna be just

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.600
a total of 12 games at launch and that kind of sucked oh is this our late like breaking news

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.200
this is our late breaking news okay is not 12 anymore is now gonna be 22 games oh they added

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:20.640
10 more games so the day one games now that are gonna or i'm sorry it's yeah that's only 15

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:26.240
though that i see okay well let's see if i can put together the list here so originally uh the

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:33.920
games that would be coming so assassin's creed odyssey attack on titan 2 final battle uh they

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:42.720
said a ghost recon breakpoint uh let's see here their destiny 2 was gonna be one of the ones that

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:47.680
had with stadia pro that was gonna be uh launching there some of the other games that are gonna be

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.360
coming because destiny 2 is the only one you get on the house like yeah that's people have

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:57.680
to remember this is not xbox game pass yeah this is a virtual console meaning you're still buying

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.800
games for said virtual console yeah some of the other games um coming farming simulator 2019

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:11.200
final fantasy 15 football manager 2020 grid 2019 uh guilt just dance 2020 kine metro exodus mortal

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:19.120
combat 11 nba 2k 20 rage 2 rise of the tomb raider um i believe there's more the two more

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.160
tomb raider games that were in there as well there's more stuff on this shadow tomb raider um

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.040
it just dance wasn't on the original list yeah that was it was on the list but it was one of

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.600
the games that was coming later this year or possibly early next year it wasn't one that was

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:41.200
necessarily um at launch um let's see what else was there here i hate how we do this so yeah

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.400
destiny 2 um guilt was going to be a game that's going to be exclusive to them i think just dance

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:54.240
2020 was actually on the original list kine uh red dead redemption 2 oh uh was one a thumper

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.840
and then of course tomb raider definitive edition rise of the tomb raider and shadow of the tomb

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:06.400
raider definitive edition and samurai showdown i think that's about all of them but well i can't

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:12.400
wait to hear what other people think about stadia i just it's a lot of games that are already out

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:19.680
on other systems but i don't know so i think it's going to be more interesting when like

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:26.000
anybody can just fire up a chrome browser and try it like i think that's going to be make a

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
more compelling case for it because right now it just seems like everything's really like

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.280
bare bones like like they might have rushed it a little bit you know it's funny because there's

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.440
a lot of talk in chat and i've heard the same stuff online about are the new pokemon games

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.480
rushed and i don't know but this stadia thing i mean like you want to talk about something

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.800
that really feels like it's rushed this stadia launch is like especially when you hear everything

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.760
that's not really going to be there and games are being added and you know changed as we're coming

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.720
up on the day like it seems like it's really rushed what's going on over here so it doesn't

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:04.960
sound like a really interesting prospect at all because it's like i i it's not like i i get it

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.600
like if if i didn't have a game console or something i might be interested in it but like

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.440
like at this point like even like say let's say for example i get i i wanted to buy the stadia

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.760
thing in you know with the controller which is like 100 some dollars like if you want to buy that

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.080
founders edition or whatever i mean you could buy a used console nowadays like and i'm sure

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:34.640
you can get xbox one um or even xbox one x for relatively cheap probably like two or three hundred

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.560
dollars and you know you get games passed and then you have access to probably all these games

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:46.080
and more like for probably cheaper plus than you downloading stuff instead of actually having this

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:51.280
streaming all the time which is eating up your bandwidth caps because like i you know what

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.000
their solution was and they had a comment their solution for the bandwidth caps well you see

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.440
the isps are going to see that these that this streaming service is popular and they're just

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.440
going to be generous and raise those bandwidth caps because people are using the service more

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:10.240
i'm like what fucking universe are you on because this is not how anything works well

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.560
actually i'm going to give that guy the benefit of the doubt i don't think he i don't think that's

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.800
the right way to phrase it but i think it's if the consumer demand is there enough especially

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.560
in places where markets can be competitive the unfortunate thing is most of us live in places

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.120
where there's only one option but especially in those competitive markets you know if that's going

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.440
to sway people's decision as to what internet service provider they have and the demand is

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.040
there for it eventually it will raise and here's here's the thing so one thing we haven't talked

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.040
about tonight because it's technically not gaming but i'm sure a lot of people have it on their mind

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.000
that disney plunge plus launched this week right yeah and so disney plus is relatively cheap because

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.720
you all know what they're doing right there it's a cheap price get you hooked for the first

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.960
what is it three years right that they're giving it and then they're going to jack that price up

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.000
after three years watch uh once everybody's hooked on it and they've they've beaten the crap out of

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.360
their competitors and so forth but anyway i digress my point is you can watch the star wars

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:16.240
movies in 4k for 6.99 a month now most people don't have that 4k streaming because you have

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.720
to pay extra for it on netflix and i don't know what the other guys are doing but let's be real

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.720
like the king of streaming right now has been historically netflix it's going to be interesting

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.480
to see what disney plus does to that equation but there's going to be a shit ton of people that are

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.400
streaming 4k movies this month because there's going to be people with that disney plus because

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.200
it's dirt fucking cheap how many families do you think are going to have a star wars marathon in

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.480
4k after thanksgiving think about it after thanksgiving after thanks already started yeah

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.520
see so there's gonna be families that are like we're gonna watch all seven movies i finally got

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:54.800
my kids to watch star wars movies so but are you watching it in 4k probably so it's an hdr what do

01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.840
you think that's doing your bandwidth so my my point is people like this between disney plus

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:07.840
and stadia and all this shit like this conversation with isps and bandwidth is going to happen sooner

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.880
rather than later i'm going to point out that i can watch the unedited beautiful original versions

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.320
that only have the touch-ups um on my laserdisc player just saying you know what i have to say

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:25.840
about that mclunky but i don't have to deal with what's-his-face as anakin i'm just gonna say

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:32.320
though like fucking like i don't want to turn this into the disney plus podcast but watching tron from

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:39.760
1982 in fucking high definition 60 frames a second was fucking sexy like and i know you did

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:44.240
this too dar sakra but tron was the first thing i watched tron was the first thing i watched you

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.920
know what the second thing i watched was tron legacy no sister act that's what that's what my

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.160
wife's making us watch next week i will point out the first thing we actually watched was the

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.800
mandalorian but the next thing i watched after that was tron and then tron legacy and then dan

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.320
wanted to watch the love bug you know what i'm gonna go on record you can quote me on this

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.120
fuck the mandalorian you know why because apparently disney plus is getting sister act three

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:14.080
that mandalorian what seriously this is this is huge news apparently script writers have been

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.960
hired and uh there's this whole thing going on whoopi goldberg she's playing uh deloris uh i

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:26.000
almost said deloris clayborn no deloris van cottier she's playing that on the west end

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.720
production with jennifer Saunders from absolutely fabulous playing mother superior which i would

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.960
i would die to see that production i really would but anyway um and apparently all this

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.280
is bringing awareness back to sister act so that disney will go forward with sister act three

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.800
which is supposed to be a disney plus thing oh that'll be amazing i know anyway sorry

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.240
where were we i was just we were just talking about the last night why isn't there a third one

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:53.200
yet well well wait disney plus is gonna make all our dreams come true hopefully i would be here

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.720
you know what when i was watching sister act all i could think was like

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.440
there really needs to be a remake of this movie starring bob the drag queen

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:08.640
am i right dark sakura like yeah like bob the drag queen as deloris van cartier would be or even

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:16.320
even if it was like like like the the you have to be bob or monae oh i think i think it's i think

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.560
bob would be i think bob the drag queen is the superior pick over any rupaul striker screen but

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.920
maybe that would be the gag is that instead of a nightclub singer it is a drag performer and bob

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.760
plays you know both you know male bob and female bob so i i would love that i'd watch that would

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:41.520
you yeah okay hello disney hey disney hello hello hello straight guy said he would watch sister act

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:47.520
with bob the drag queen do you do you understand what's happening here on this day make it happen

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.800
do the thing do the thing anyway that's the only remake in history i would support

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:58.960
anyway where were we oh yeah google stadia yeah well anyway yeah everything goes to drag queens

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:05.040
rob how long how long before that crashes and burns i mean really um because i think if anything

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.080
like microsoft their offerings that they have with x cloud is far superior than what you're gonna get

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.600
with stadia because eventually with the x cloud stuff we're talking like games pass is going to

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:18.080
be supported on that then who the fuck cares about stadia at that point i don't think this

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:24.320
year is going to matter for stadia it's going to matter most when google flips that switch where

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.520
they say anybody with a chrome browser whether that be your shitty little chrome book whether

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:36.400
that be a phone now google stadia is something for you to try and we have this limited destiny

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.680
2 experience for free for everybody to try to see what this is all about that's the moment that's

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:48.160
going to break google stadia this year i kind of think is a giant beta test that's what it feels

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.520
like to me anyway so anyhow but we'll see bobby blackwolf's actually getting one he's hoping he

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.520
has one before his next show so we can talk about it a little more on the show so and i know there's

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.000
some google stadia centered podcast out there so i'm curious to hear what what folks have to say

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.760
about it but i'm just i've got other games to play right now i'll let y'all beta test it and tell me

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.320
how it is and then i'm gonna wait for them to unleash it for you know where i don't have to

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:17.040
drop drop 100 bucks or whatever it is up front i can just because i do have a shitty little chrome

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.840
book and if the stadia thing works well and i do more business traveling maybe it would give me

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.440
incentive to take my chrome book with me when i travel if i could actually play decent video games

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.440
when i travel so i'm i'm open to it let's let's see it all right moving on let's get to our next

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:36.400
story which has to do oh so we're kind of back on pokemon a little bit because there's been a lot of

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:42.320
twitter outrage you don't say there was this hashtag going around all of twitter that was

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:48.880
hashtag game freak lied and uh of course in response there's a hashtag thank you game freak

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.840
as well but why were people angry about pokemon and game freak lied well because apparently um

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:02.720
one of the examples given was that there was a wireframe bulbasaur from sword and shield which

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.960
is weird to me because fucking bulbasaur isn't in sword and shield bulbasaur is one of the pokemon

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:11.440
that was cut so i don't know if they dug it out of the files or what but anyway there's a wireframe

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.760
from bulbasaur from sword and shield and apparently it's the same wireframe from sun and moon

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:22.160
gasp but then this 3d artist on twitter actually starts to disseminate why it doesn't fucking

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.240
matter what it because it does there are differences and she kind of breaks down like

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.320
what's going on and that you could actually take the wireframe from pokemon quest for mobile phone

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:37.360
games it would be the same as what you see in any of the other pokemon uh games um it's not the

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.960
wire for it's on the model that they're changing its textures on top of it so so fans i'm using

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:47.120
that loosely because i think if you're if you're going so far as to send death threats to the

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.960
developer which please just stop doing that when is ever a death threat against a developer gotten

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.600
something positive from me i would hope the listeners of this show aren't the ones participating

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.640
in that i'd like to think they are so i don't think we need to lecture you guys on that but uh

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.520
you know the those folks apparently are mad because they were told that assets would not

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.880
be reused and then they were reused if you want to see a lot of like the complaining go to the

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:20.080
pokemon reddit there's a dude on the pokemon reddit who every day is doing one family of

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.240
pokemon that was put down or that was will no longer be seen it's so fucking dramatic and like

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.760
pokemon sword and shield and i'm just kind of like okay look i understand where people were

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.360
frustrated with the dex cuts even at first i was very much like well i mean pokemon does say gotta

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.280
catch them all and you're not gonna really be able to catch them all in this game but you know now

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.440
that i've like actually played the game i'm kind of like there's enough to see and do you know it's

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.720
it's gonna be fine maybe they'll just add them in later on i i don't think they will i mean they're

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.440
i think at this point because of all the the belly aching and stuff going on i think in the

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.560
next pokemon game gen 9 or whatever i think they're gonna go back but i mean pokemon gen

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.160
9 is probably not gonna happen till like 2026 at this point because it's gonna take them so

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:13.040
long to put in all those other pokemon i don't i don't know anyway so there's this big hashtag that

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.840
was going around on it and a lot of it had to do with the model remake and that whole thing but

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:25.440
again but dex it as they're calling it was a big part of that as well i just i don't know like

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:31.280
now that i've played the game i'm like whatever it's fine like it's not the end of the world in

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:37.040
fact it's a pretty decent pokemon game and if you think about it like when you played pokemon gen 2

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.400
you didn't unlock the gen 1 pokemon until after you beat the game and there's a lot of pokemon

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.640
games that have had more like limited things where all the pokemon are kind of like post game and

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:52.160
stuff so i think i think people are just i mean it was 800 pokemon it would have been almost like

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:58.080
too many to wrap your head around so like i think i think it's okay it's gonna be okay people the

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:04.800
game came out fine so it kind of reminds me of ddr actually that you mentioned oh god because

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.800
you can't put all the old songs back in there you know as much as you want that's music licensing

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:13.600
you know you know i could understand especially like they should have just always been like we're

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.280
just going to cut the legendaries because it's going to throw off the bat you know i can

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.440
understand where maybe they're trying to make a shift in the competitive space for pokemon by

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.640
cutting all those legendaries and the pokemon that people always use like in in a way it's actually

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.120
kind of interesting because now that they've reshuffled everything with with sword and shield

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.120
it's like it's going to cause the competitive scene to kind of be rebooted and different

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.520
combinations will be looked at and re-evaluated so i kind of think it's interesting in that regard

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:47.040
for what it's worth so yeah and then we have this really disgusting stuff thing where it's like

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.240
some people were upset with reviewers for scoring the game so high yeah the same people that were

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.680
pissed off when they said too much water 7.3 or whatever it was like it's the same fucking people

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.920
they're just mad about something uh and then sj100 matt talking about how sarah b net is

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:09.280
getting threats for posting the news like gross like their fans just people need to calm down

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.520
you need to calm down the game's fine go play the game and then tell me what you think i mean is it

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:26.960
perfect no but is it good enough i think so anyway moving on dark sakura you have more pokemon news

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:37.680
right i do for folks who had let's go pikachu or let's go eevee um well you can uh obtain them in

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.040
sword and shield if you have a save file from one of those games which means i need to borrow

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:49.600
one of your copies of of whichever one of the let's go's you have so i can get a save file

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.400
and then give it right back to you yeah i have let's go pikachu and i'll give you so here's a

01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:00.720
tip you can't evolve the eevee you get for free with this however well you don't get an eevee

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:07.200
anyway with let's go pikachu but on on and this isn't a spoiler i think to say if you need an eevee

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.480
go to route four eevee's there but just may take a little bit before you see because i caught an

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:19.680
eevee on route four however he's a little fucker like i had to use like i tried like three regular

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:25.840
pokeballs two great balls and i think two premier balls i think finally the fucker and like he was

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:31.200
down to one hit point i vault swiped him down to one hit point and paralyzed him with my little

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:35.360
yamper those things are so fucking cute have you seen the yamper's they're little corgis with

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.080
yellow hearts on their butt they're so cute anyway yes i have actually yeah right so anyway

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.120
plus corgi mine yeah so i uh paralyzed him with corgi mon and fault swiped him down to one hit

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:50.240
point and the little fucker would not get in the ball for like seven balls get in the ball shinji

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:55.280
finally finally you should have named him shinji i know finally i caught that fucking eevee so

01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.960
that one will evolve because i caught him on route four well at any rate as rob just said you you get

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:07.040
a freebie of of one of them depending on the version i was also looking at the gigantamax

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:13.280
forms and you get fat pikachu you also get long cat meowth you do you just go into your mystery

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.000
gifts and connect to the internet right now and you will get a long cat meowth long cat meowth is

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.600
the best like but at any rate um the other gigantamax forms are charizard uh meowth and

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:35.200
butterfree and and it's old school meowth by the way it's not not new fuzzy one so yay yeah there's

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.400
a galarian uh meowth that looks like a hobo kind of met with a viking it's kind of interesting

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.240
interesting yeah i'm looking forward to seeing this so but at any rate yeah you can you can get

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:52.080
to freebies if you have the old versions cool so a little benefit for those of you that played um

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:57.040
let's go pikachu just long enough to get to pokemon go park and then stop playing like me

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.800
yeah all right moving on what else is going on in nintendo's world lucky apparently nintendo

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:08.480
published a brand new game on the e-shop called the stretchers and the stretchers is out on nintendo

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:16.640
switch and it's a game where i guess you play like an ambulance crew but um i know the gameplay that

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.480
i watched didn't necessarily just have like ambulance stuff like they were mowing down

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.600
things with a lawn mower but it is a co-op game and it's very strange so yeah they said

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.160
residents of a town are suddenly struck by dizziness and you need to help getting them

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:37.840
to the hospital you have to avoid obstacles and stuff pixel pakas in our chat over twitch tv slash

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.640
vog network says the stretchers gives me big crazy taxi vibes well that's an endorsement to me

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:50.640
yeah it looked weird from like the the screen the video that i saw but i mean um it's it

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.720
art style reminds me a lot of actually fortnite which is kind of weird

01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:02.320
uh just because it's so colorful and cartoony but yeah it is um it looks fun and um definitely

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.880
different than the other nintendo stuff but yeah i do see like nitro ambulances and stuff so this

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:13.360
is an actual nintendo game not some indie release on i mean not that i make it sound like i'm

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.720
poo-pooing those indie releases but you know there's a lot of them on the switch this is

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.800
an actual nintendo game that's kind of in there right yeah and so what's kind of cool though is

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.160
a lot of the stuff because it is a co-op game a lot of like the things that you're doing you're

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.560
kind of coordinating with other people like they had like i just saw a screenshot where they're

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.800
doing uh moving a bomb together so one person's controlling one end of the stretcher the other

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.000
person is trolling the other end of the stretcher and that's a lot of things they're in there like

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.480
they'll have a sawing down a tree or like um you know pushing a lawnmower or something like that

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.520
but because you have to kind of work together controlling stuff is where it gets kind of crazy

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.960
that sounds kind of silly but fun yep all right cool all right well uh let's talk about uh this

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.080
story which was actually posted to our discord server over at vog network.com discord you can

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.960
join our discord server and uh people leave little stories uh ideas for us there in channel

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.720
orange lounge radio and uh sometimes especially on a week like this uh i really turn to what you

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.760
guys are posting to be like well what are they if i don't know what to talk about what are what

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.120
do the listeners want us to talk about and i thought this was a really good one because even

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.600
though it's it's that rumor status it's one of those things where i'm like okay i could see this

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.560
happening because this is what's going on in our game industry these days but apparently um bio

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:28.800
ware is actually working on an overhaul of anthem uh which some are referring to as anthem 2.0 or

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:34.880
anthem next so there's a kotaku report out there that says that uh bio ware developers in edmonton

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.640
and austin are actually doing an overhaul of the game enough for it to be anthem 2.0 or anthem next

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:47.120
unknown at this time if it will be updates an all-at-once expansion or an entirely new game

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.760
but it's going to change the main systems the mission structure the loot and the game world

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:57.440
drastically uh splitting the current game world into segments meaning developers could work on

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.640
certain areas without worrying about bugs attacking other areas uh because right now it's

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.400
all one big world and that can happen um i'm just i'm kind of giggling because i see on the side all

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.720
these sales of like anthem for ten dollars right now i'm like yikes but you know this is the day

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:21.120
and age of gaming now in the year 2019 is that it is possible to reboot relaunch your game and be

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:28.400
successful hello diablo 3 final fantasy 14 no man's sky it shouldn't it's this shouldn't be the

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:35.360
norm it it shouldn't and i it well yes and no like i can kind of applaud a developer who recognizes

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:42.080
that their game sucked and they go back and redo it like i just never expected ea to be the one to

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.640
do it because ea you would think is typically the one that's oh we're just gonna yank pull the plug

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.560
be done with it write it off we're gonna and he still might because it could be a rumor we're

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.440
gonna close bio air you know which i i hope doesn't happen i mean please don't misunderstand me

01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.160
but that's just what you kind of come to expect from ea so if they really are going back and

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:06.320
giving this a second shot then maybe it's a sign that ea is trying to do better and not be so evil

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.680
anymore and that would be quite something going into the next decade but we'll see um but they

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.400
do say as well uh that you know they're not giving up on anthem this is something that's being worked

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:23.600
on more i could i could see maybe a relaunch for playstation 5 in the next xbox there might be a

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:30.320
narrative there for an anthem redo for those systems but i i would seriously hold on give a

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.680
shit i i they're gonna have to come a long way to win me over however any more mass effect well

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.920
funny you should mention that because this same rumor slash report says bio we're still working

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:49.440
on dragon age 4 and a new mass effect game is in very early development mike gamble is the one

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:56.400
directing it who worked previously on mass effect 2 3 and anthem well as long as it isn't you know

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:02.080
the half-assed thing that andromeda was that had so many missteps in it i mean i had fun with

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.600
andromeda don't get me wrong but no more dead eyes please i'm just and no more dead naming i'm so

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.640
curious about are they going to attempt to do something in shepherd's timeline

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:19.760
or what i i i could see them doing a parallel story to shepherd i think that's something they

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:28.160
you know what i want huh the aftermath based on your your ending yeah i mean that would though

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:35.120
be really weirdly dynamic you know like if you did like the the space magic version or the shepherd

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:41.040
lives version or whatever i personally want a shepherd lives version well we'll see i mean

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.840
obviously that is a huge rumor we don't know a damn thing about it um i mean i wouldn't be

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:50.880
surprised to find that ea is not going to walk away from mass effect and thank god but you know

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:57.840
just maybe rebuild your store so i can get another n7 hoodie just remaster the fucking original

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:04.720
trilogy already just you know playstation 5 and next xbox are coming out remaster the original

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.720
trilogy for them i think it would make a lot of people happy and it would buy you a lot of fucking

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:14.560
time to make a good mass effect follow-up that's and i'm gonna leave it at that throw andromeda in

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:21.440
there too if you want all right moving on uh dar sakra from from newer games to retro games right

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:28.080
yes one of my favorite series is fantasy zone because i love the opa opa so they are doing

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:34.960
another sega ages fantasy zone and it's going to have some neat stuff in it uh this information

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.440
comes from uh gematsu um there's actually screenshots it looks pretty good but it's going

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:49.760
to have a coin stock system where uh basically you can uh save these coins that you collect

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:55.360
and then you can use them to increase like your time limit for your shots or the amount of coins

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:00.880
enemies will drop and things like that um extra bosses which includes um some of the sega mark 3

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:10.400
bosses that appeared um you also can have the arcade uh extra boss battles and um and then uh

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:16.320
you can configure your settings it has upa upa mode which stars opa opa's little brother and so

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.880
it has no shot bubbles um you can start playing by withdrawing your savings from the coin stock

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.680
as long as you have a budget all weapons can be used at any time and it's slightly different

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:32.160
ending you also have a time attack mode with infinite lives and you just have to it looks

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:39.360
like there's a boss run in there and then other features for sega ages is the original um shipped

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:45.760
arcade version and the new arcade version um like uh it says that there are unique elements

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:53.360
such as the base marker b a s e that indicates the position of your base off screen and um lead

01:31:53.360 --> 01:32:01.120
online leaderboards replays in hd rumble so it's looking it's looking pretty good and it's got like

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:06.560
some screen overlays it's very interesting but i freaking love fantasy zone well in these you know

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.080
and i agree with dark tetsuya in our chat who says i've been following these sega ages titles

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:15.680
they really go the extra mile and they like these sega you know retro revival games in the sega ages

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:22.560
series they really bring it like it's not just the freaking rom running in high resolution like it's

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:27.360
you know they really go back and add a lot of value to it so i'm really uh hyped to see this

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:31.520
um now interesting also a dark to see it says the one i really want is shinobi when it comes out

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.320
oh yeah that would be cool too so uh yyr says these features basically sound like what they

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:41.520
put into the 3ds versions of fantasy zone and fantasy zone 2 it sounds identical so

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:48.080
season 2 is great as well yeah the tears of opa opa so will you be checking this out when it

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:53.680
releases uh i know i know you're a big fantasy zone fan so i came really close to buying a uh

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:58.480
sega genesis sega ages fantasy zone and then i found out it was a repro so i didn't

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:05.520
don't but man i would love to have though the sega saturn ages version yeah keep an eye out

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.680
you never know what you might find that'd be rad all right well moving on all right tiger claw

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:14.560
listen up because i know you're excited to talk about this and actually a lot of the internet's

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:22.160
been talking about this this week uh and that is that redo of uh sonic uh the new trailer actually

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:28.240
hit the internet this week and uh i think he looks a lot better it looks way better

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.720
wow better here we and you said you couldn't reboot a game how about that they did they went

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:38.800
back and they they really i mean and that's pretty impressive for just what a few months

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.680
that they've been working on it but now instead of looking like this like disgusting like

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:50.960
the hybrid of human and hedgehog song that the hedgehog looks like sonic the hedgehog

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:56.960
i mean maybe a little bit like long in the legs and still humanish body but like the face is so

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:03.680
much better i think it looks just fine yeah i mean it looks really great yeah and even the trailer

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.080
itself like and that yelling like that same yelling sequence which i've seen the side by

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.320
sides and we go back and look at the old one like oh my god it looks so terrible it looks like a

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.200
parody at this point but even the new trailer like they use they don't use gangsta's paradise

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.080
they use a different song like even the trailer was just cut better and it it goes and jim carrey

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:25.840
looks pretty fucking funny i gotta say i know you're a big fan of jim carrey of course yeah so

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.800
yeah i i really can't wait to see the movie it looks pretty great now and uh i'm glad that they

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:38.720
went back and fixed it and so yeah along with that of course uh a lot of people really liking

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:46.240
the redesign and one of the best parts about it so apparently um the you can thank the artist from

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:55.520
sonic mania who helped work at that out with uh paramount so um tyson hese they said i'm honored

01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:02.160
to have been brought in to lead the design on the new movie sonic working with jeff and the modelers

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:07.840
rigorous texture for artists and animators in la london and vancouver was a thrill i'll never forget

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:15.680
and yeah i mean looks looks great so coming out in valentine's day and i'll check it out

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:21.360
that's so interesting that like how the video game series has kind of ended up impacting the

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:27.360
movie and especially this particular one that was like a fan kind of really fan driven type of game

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:32.000
has now had such a positive impact on the movie like fans have saved the franchise i think i mean

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.320
definitely this has a way better chance of being successful now than it was before i i think that's

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.040
for sure i think there's so many more people now on social media that are like oh yeah i'm gonna

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:50.000
i'll see this now and even like you should support and it it goes so far as to make people think the

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.040
whole thing has been a hoax this whole time that we've been we've been hoaxed this entire time

01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.560
and that this is all planned so that the internet would rally behind this redesign and that we would

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:06.000
all go to the theater and support it and it's the conspiracy theories haven't been astounding

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.520
me online this you know what though like if that's their plan and that's what they pulled

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.280
off then prop great fucking plan good job it was a risky plan but you know what people could just

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:21.840
said they don't give a shit about it and that's it but yeah yeah i mean vg realness says i just

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:27.440
really question why they thought the first trailer and vision they had was okay well i mean it's not

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:34.560
like we haven't seen hollywood fuck up video game movies several times before mario who greenlit

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.480
that mario brothers movie seriously you know i think miyamoto was like angry i think miyamoto's

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.680
eyes actually did that whole like you know like uh anger face type of thing like rawr and like

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:51.840
st anger emoji uh did you ever watch the documentary about it i think i did watch part of it there was

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.840
actually a pretty good documentary about making that movie and about uh like what it originally

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.200
was going to be and it was actually supposed to be a far better movie but they rewrote the movie

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:11.440
while it was being filmed yeah yikes so um but hey there's a new mario movie coming what in a

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.960
few years so yeah that's an all animated one to kind of go with the theme park have you ever

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:20.240
watched though the original animated one it's weird it's really freaking weird i don't think

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:25.200
i ever have it's the whole thing's on youtube uh fansubbed yeah it's just really freaking weird

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:30.800
and then also obviously the street fighter movie was was pure camp i mean people find things to

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:36.240
like about the street fighter movie like you know rawr julia owned it like you know he was

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.560
definitely like gina gershon his last role though he knew i know he knew exactly what movie that

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:45.840
was and he he lived it up you know what was it you know for me it was just tuesday it's just

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:54.560
you know and kylie minnow is as cami you know all the little you know yay yes um and uh yeah i mean

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.720
that movie was not yeah but like here's here's the weird part about that the street fighter

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:02.400
the movie or whatever then they have the chunk now i know you've forgotten but they had the chung

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:07.200
lee movie that came out oh you know i didn't forget about that i just wasn't that worse than

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:14.240
the street fighter movie like did it get worse it's like oh we're rebooting stream oh but how

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:20.320
did you make it worse but it is interesting how the internet and that whole campaign had this

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.640
impact and for and usually i don't support the internet anger campaigns right i just made fun

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:30.960
of the pokemon one right but like the one for sonic is the first time i can go wow that internet

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:37.680
hate campaign did some good like but that was accomplished with people saying you know not

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.720
sending death threats it was just like we don't support this we're not going to go see it because

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:48.000
it looks terrible not i want to kill you because you didn't do the thing i wanted you to do

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:54.160
that's the difference yes uh oh metal okay metal mayhem does have the okay here's the

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.240
bad video game movie ready male mayhem says the double dragon movie was a hundred percent pure

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:08.400
usd grade a ass yes it was pretty bad who's wow anyway all right i got the i got to see that as

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.120
a screener that was a long time ago and i was like oh i'm super excited then he watched it like not

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.240
set not excited anymore all right all right well there you go so there's our sonic movie discussion

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:24.160
now tiger claw stay tuned because sonic comes up again later in the show all right don't tune out

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.960
all right here we go but for now i want to move on to uh this announcement which um i think is

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:35.440
interesting uh on our last live episode two weeks ago we were talking about Blizzcon and Diablo 4

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.080
was one of the big announcements that came out of Blizzcon right well you remember when Diablo 3

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.720
first came out and it was kind of like not great i think people were turning to alternatives like

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:52.960
torchlight and another game that was free to play called path of exile and a path of exile

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:58.080
still going after all these years and you know has had several expansions and once again thanks

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.680
to discord this week it was brought to my attention that a path of exile 2 was announced

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.440
this week how convenient right on the heels of Diablo 4 being announced but what's interesting

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:13.360
so i didn't even know there was an exile con but apparently there is but they showed this launch

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.960
trailer for path of exile 2 which we're showing you a little bit of that on twitch here so you

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.800
can see some of the gameplay here after some of these cut scenes um but what's interesting about

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:27.040
it is a brand new seven act story uh that's 20 years after the events of the first game and i

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:32.000
have to admit when i was watching this uh trailer for the first time i was like well this looks an

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.240
awful lot like the original i mean not that it's a bad thing the original i've played path of exile

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.600
so it's a especially when you consider it's a fucking free game it's really good you know um

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.880
so i was like gosh this looks just like the original well here's the reason because path

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:55.200
of exile 2 it's not a new game it is essentially a expansion for the first game uh so when path

01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.240
of exile 2 launches it's going to be the first game and the second game side by side uh that

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:08.480
then this new story will be seven acts long so yeah it's um it's not a new standalone title

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:15.600
and i think this is also interesting because i was kind of poking fun at overwatch 2 on our last show

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:23.600
going i'm not so sure overwatch 2 is a sequel as much as it is an expansion but okay you know okay

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.560
it still looks like it still looks like it'll be good enough and i think a lot of people will be

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:33.440
into it and now here we have path of exile 2 and they're just up front saying it's it's it's kind of

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:40.400
seven acts for the first game we're just branding it as path of exile 2 so i i mean but again this

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.680
whole series is free they make their money off of cosmetics and these expansions kind of like you

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:53.360
know uh you could say the same as uh fortnite chapter two sure yeah it's a new game but no

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.480
okay yeah really that's a great way to put it absolutely so um yeah so i'll check it out i

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:02.880
mean the price is certainly right i think i've dropped like a little bit of money on path of

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.480
exile just to kind of show my support but um path of exile is on what pc it's on playstation 4 and

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.360
xbox one i don't think it's on switch but um who knows maybe just a matter of time before it's there

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.600
so there you go path of exile 2 it's coming anyway uh moving on to a somewhat somber topic

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:28.080
dark sakura yeah i was very sad when i find out found out thanks rob well i thank our discord

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.840
once again because this was brought to my attention on discord and i was like oh that's sad

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:39.760
so onogi uh nobuki who was a namco composer and considered the father of video game music died

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:48.080
very recently at age 63 which i mean still pretty young that's pretty young he was born in 1956 in

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:57.040
chizuoka um and he was an engineering major from chiba university and he applied to namco in 1980

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:04.960
and he was just doing general programming stuff and they liked the end music he made for rally x

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:11.280
the high score music and they're like hey we want you to be our sound uh designer and he's like okay

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:19.680
and so thanks to him we had the soundtrack for mappy and he did um a lot of other work um

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:27.440
mostly though uh effects and programming work for the music but still the composition those

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:34.560
sounds in those early 80s namco games are iconic you know like you you hear those distinctive

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:40.560
sounds and you know like oh this is a product of the 80s but mappy was his first full uh

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:49.520
composition um he also did uh other games one called liberal rabble one called warp man and

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:55.760
metro cross um those were the ones that he did uh music composition in but other games that he

01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:02.560
worked on start with warp warp rally new rally x galaga bosconian pole position pole position two

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:12.160
xevious uh the tower of druaga um mobile suit zeta gundam hot scramble uh wizardry um the quest of

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:18.480
key looking some others on here uh family circuit another wizardry game a couple wizardry games

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:24.720
the last one he did was family circuit 91 in 1991 so there you go um so

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.640
may his memory be a blessing and thank you for all of the good music

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:37.040
i'm trying to see what he actually died of have they just not said out of respect or what have

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:45.840
you yeah that is a very young age to pass so yeah i didn't say what exactly um but yeah okay well i

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:51.200
think um along that note let's move right into our classic game of the week because i think you're

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.760
going to tie it together a little bit tonight uh as uh usual dark soccer likes to jump into the

01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.240
gaming vault uh every week and find a game that she thinks hey you guys should check this game

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:04.480
out this week and obviously it's no secret that this week's selection will be pretty timely with

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.160
this in mind also while we're in the classic game of the week segment for those of you that are

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:12.480
watching live on our twitch broadcast on sunday night we are going to open up the community gift

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.800
chest so if you would like to uh give if you are a twitch prime person and you want to put in some

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:24.160
gifts uh i believe tonight the giveaway is for league of legends team fight tactics it's a twin

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:29.120
egg and skin shard you can contribute to the pot there and uh when the segment is done we will

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:34.880
give those away to random viewers there so i think i've enabled it but if i haven't bobby blackwolf

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.960
will hopefully help me save the day here and turn that on for us here so we can donate to the

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:44.560
community chest while dark soccer takes a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:50.240
week so dark soccer what did you pick for tonight's classic game of the week i picked a game that um

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:54.080
he was actually uncredited on for the soundtrack but it was little rabble

01:45:54.640 --> 01:46:00.880
which um i mentioned earlier during the last story so it came out in 1983 it was a puzzler

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:06.800
that was put out in japan by namco and you basically take um two colored arrows one called

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:13.440
liberal the other rabble to wrap around pegs and surround small creatures called mushlins and you

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.000
have to harvest them by tying the ropes around them like you're cordoning them off it almost

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:26.080
gives me a slight little bit of a kicks vibe in some respects you know um but you also uncover

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:29.840
treasure as you go along so you can search through them and then you once you get the

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:37.440
right treasures you get a bonus stage and it had its own um software actually ran on i'm sorry

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:46.240
hardware it was called the namco liberal rabble uh hardware and i think it was like one of two

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:55.120
games that ran on it um but it was uh it was also called the namco system 16 universal which was an

01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:03.120
8-bit arcade system um and it actually uh predated the sega 16 version so the name wasn't a rip or

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.840
anything and the only get yeah the only other game that ran on it was a game called toy pop

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.560
so uh and which is uh actually a multi-directional shooter game

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:19.760
so going back though um it did have a north american release planned but it got cancelled

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:25.680
its original incarnation was a game called potato and it was created by the pac-man creator

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:35.520
iwatani toru um and of course the music done by onogi um uh iwatani became a little bit too

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:41.120
overwhelmed with other projects that you know were going on at the time so it was passed on

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:48.640
to sato makoto um and who brought in the treasure chest concept and you know everything you know

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.160
other things that are built into the game like bonus stages and whatnot because it's considered

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:56.880
a little too simplistic can i just say i've never heard of this game before you selected it for the

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:01.600
game of the week and i'm getting kind of a kicks vibe from it yeah but like with like that strange

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:07.520
like kind of two-player element like there's one player oh really i believe it is that's what it

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:10.800
looks it looks like it's almost so that's really interesting this so it's one person kind of

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.160
controlling both little arrows i think so interesting i guess you could easily make it

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.400
two-player then but very interesting sorry i didn't mean to interrupt but i was just like

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.200
especially for those that you can't see the video i bet a lot of you probably haven't

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:29.680
heard of this game either and it's it's got this strange kicks meets gluclu land yeah because of

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.400
the pegs did you have to yeah because you're wrapping things around the pegs yeah and capturing

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:43.120
what's inside um well it's liberal l-i-b-b-l-e rabble r-a-b-b-l-e so some you know if you're

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:49.360
gonna look it up um at any rate though it was really praised for how unique the gameplay was

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.760
i haven't seen any other games exactly like this and it's considered a cult classic

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:59.600
it's bizarre but very addictive some people have said and one of the most unappreciated

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.880
namco games out there um there was a super famicom version that came out in 1994

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:11.680
and also home ports for the fm towns marty and the cherub x68000 both systems i've done

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:18.480
as classic systems um and the super famicom version had a cover for the d-pad so you could

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.720
yeah so you could use the twin stick gameplay also an early twin stick game i should add

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.320
um it was digitally re-released for the weaver's uh virtual console in 2009

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:34.480
um and yeah even um one of the sources that i looked up for research on this did a big

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.760
comparison with kicks um but at any rate you also have different enemies that try to

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:47.440
to stop you and of course you know they can put an end to your you know wrapping shenanigans

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.160
um but the whole point in the end is a is basically a corralling game

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.880
yyr is curious how you lose because um in this playthrough we're looking at they're doing very

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.680
well i think when your arrows i think it's your arrows getting hit hold on let me see

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.960
the player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:15.040
she runs out of time so the border is your timer and you can boost that time by looping more

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.600
mushrooms and plants you gain an extra life of forty thousand one hundred and twenty thousand

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.680
two hundred thousand four hundred thousand six hundred thousand and one million points by default

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:30.560
after the tenth season your counter will stop at nine your season counter will stop at 99

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.440
similar to how oh there he just lost a life because he ran into the yeah and king and balloons

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:43.760
will work the same way um so it was i mean like i said it was started the concept was started off

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:49.920
by the creator of pac-man um and he said that he conceptualized the game based on an experience he

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:56.080
added a crowded disco in the night in the 80s he said he envisioned himself using ropes to tie

01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:02.160
people up and throwing them out of the way and you know it also had to do with some games he played

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:08.800
in his childhood and so they initially called it potato because namco was considering a tie-in

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:15.680
with a japanese potato chip manufacturer but that fell through and so um they actually had

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:24.240
to create new software for the game because it was had new graphical effects it was a pretty

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:29.840
big game for its time so they needed that dedicated hardware for it and like i said this

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:37.200
was passed on to satomakoto um and then after looking at the prototype sato said hey this is

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:43.360
too simple and so got the idea for using treasure chest and uncovering them by the apple 2 version

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:51.040
of wizardry so there you go and of course the music was done by orogi looks like a dragon in

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.640
that one this is this is a neat pick just because like this game it's kind of been erased from a lot

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.200
of people's memories and um i don't think it's been in any namco collection that i can think of

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:07.360
so we didn't get it in the us at all in any in any way although the soundtrack did get released

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:13.360
for itunes in 2011 oh i don't know about us um and i just quickly want to say some folks in

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.960
chat pointing out because you know we have a lot of music game fans in chat and namco's done a few

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:21.200
music games over the years like technic beat um orange right points out some people know this game

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:27.200
from the remix in that rhythm game of technic beat so you may have you know heard the song before

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.840
well and then the versions of it that came out at home the only one anyone in the us would have

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:36.080
a relatively easy chance of playing would have been the super famicom version yeah um because

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:42.720
the other systems that came out on were the fm towns marty and the x68000 which were both i mean

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:50.400
right now crazy expensive to to get i mean fuck i love one of either of those but um

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:58.960
but you know it's not on systems that were easy for an american to get a hold of so well i i i

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:03.600
doubt anyone from namco listens to this show but on the off chance maybe somebody does i think it

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:09.440
would be great um you know especially when you consider that you know you know nobody just passed

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:14.160
that maybe we could get some of these games on a modern maybe like ant stream is something that

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:17.440
would be like perfect for something like this where we could kind of revisit some of these

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.840
old games and you know learn a little more about them experience the soundtrack you know what else

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:27.520
this makes me think of and you're gonna probably laugh about it what's that the uh lasso tool in

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:33.920
photoshop a little bit because you know how you can click it around and the corral doesn't close

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:39.280
up until you join the lines yeah that's how the freaking lasso tool works except you have to hit

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:44.080
the anchor point but still all right great pick for the classic game of the week so uh for those

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:47.440
listening live we're going to give about 30 more seconds if anyone wants to make any last

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:53.760
contributions there to the gift box and then i'm going to ask bobby to um uh end that and uh divvy

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:59.440
out the gifts it's like an early christmas after all um you know the christmas decorations are

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:05.280
already going up even though thanksgiving is already music i'm already sick please tell me

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:11.600
i'm not the only one that's heard okay so there's this meme going around and last week it was toad

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.080
singing sia's chandelier and it's just that really like high-pitched screech that

01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:22.560
like it's just really like annoying but today i saw one that was mariah carrey's all i want

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:27.520
for christmas done by toad which i refuse to listen to you need to because the toad version

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.560
because i like cried from laughing so hard it was i am avoiding the mariah apocalypse

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:40.480
i have not heard the song in two years because oh are you are you playing the um what is it the

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:46.480
wam apocalypse where like you have to avoid last uh george michaels the wamageddon the wamageddon

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:55.280
that's it i don't mind the wam song i fucking hate i actually can't stand mariah carrey because all

01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.000
of her fucking songs are like i need a man to be happy bitch you don't you're rich you don't need

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.440
a man to be happy what about like obsessed she sings about a man who needs to leave the fuck

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:11.200
alone no it's still about a man just be happy you should mariah needs to go i will have respect

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:17.040
for mariah if she goes out a song that says bitch i'm rich i don't fucking need you i kind of

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:22.480
figured that was gratitude anyway i just i want her to do a song called bitch i'm rich all right

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.720
anyhow uh let's move on and get into some rapid fire news we're gonna travel quickly around the

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:35.040
industry and check out some other headlines from uh this week loki so there's this pretty awesome

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:44.480
game that was made within dreams um so the the game is um it's very much like wipeout they called

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:51.760
it i'm trying to remember what it was called in here it wasn't wipeout it was like um slide out

01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:57.920
3019 but it's very much like a wipeout game and it's fully playable in dreams i didn't realize

01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:04.320
apparently dreams early access is a thing that you can purchase right now for 2099 or 29.99 and

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.520
you can actually play these games and make stuff i might get in on that actually because i i know

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.840
the full game's not out yet but i didn't realize that they had i know i thought it was like a beta

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.320
thing that you had to get into but apparently it is something they have been selling since april

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:24.960
so i see so i i may have to check that out but um yeah if you have dreams definitely check that out

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:30.000
because it looks pretty awesome and it's just impressive the amount of things that you can make

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:37.040
in dreams and the quality of just the gameplay the graphics the sound everything is just crazy um

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:46.960
and then they go along with that is a brand new mod for super mario 64 called super mario 64 land

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:56.240
it is a brand new uh fan-made game that's already on adds uh new levels new bosses and new power-ups

01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:02.480
and new music and you can check it out uh they have it available um i believe it's linked in

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:08.640
the guy the developer's video well as as no it's been taken down of course nintendo lawyers shut

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.520
that shit down they got cnd a week ago of course really because i thought i just downloaded okay

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:18.000
well maybe not all right i might be thinking of another one but i think i saw this like a couple

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.960
weeks ago and it already got cnd no it's not it's out there still it may be like one link versus

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:29.040
another link but anyway well once on the internet always on the internet right so yeah so uh kazi

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:35.440
um amanor uh on youtube they have a video it's linked in the description there so it is still

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:42.160
out there i just checked uh but you can patch your original nintendo 64 rom to play the game

01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:47.920
it looks pretty awesome it has all the different powers from super mario uh 3d land so so pretty

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:53.840
sweet that's it all right well moving on to talk about tetris effect a game that i hope a lot of

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.960
you checked out on playstation 4 because it's great but there's actually a playstation 4 dynamic

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:05.600
theme that is actually up on the store that you can check out it's actually based off metamorphosis

01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.800
in tetris effect so you can actually get this theme for your playstation 4 if you want to go

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:16.240
like full in on tetris effect yes and so it's i mean and obviously what a tetris effect strong

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:19.920
point is those very immersive themes didn't come with a theme when you bought the game because i

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:24.880
swear i have a tetris effect theme right now on mine i think it might have but this one is now

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:30.640
free so if it if it's not there if it is this one then this is now free for everybody but i think

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:35.920
it's a different one it may be a different one anyhow um i know some folks are looking forward

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:39.760
to the witcher series it's coming out on netflix i don't know how many guys i know everybody's

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.040
talking about disney plus he looks he looks like the character now there's still some things to get

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:47.280
excited about on netflix i think the witcher is one of them uh again it's based on the books not

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:51.360
on the game because the game was based on the books too but obviously there will still be some

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:56.400
similarities and uh if you are um you know kind of wondering like you know is this just going to be

01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:01.920
a one and done type of thing the answer is no uh it was already unveiled that there is going to be

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:07.360
a season two of witcher on the way to netflix so not very often that shows get greenlit for a

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.800
second season before the first is already debuted but the buzz for this must be really really good

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:16.720
speaking of games based on book series i wonder if they're ever going to adapt

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:23.120
uh metro into um a show because i know those games are pretty awesome based on

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:27.600
that book series as well so well there's what seven or eight different subscription

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.760
television services now so there's plenty of places somebody's looking for something yeah right

01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:39.520
yeah anyhow let's move on to dark sakura wheel um shovel knight there's new shovel knight stuff

01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:45.840
happening um the uh developer yacht club uh said that shovel knight king of cards and shovel knight

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:52.080
showdown will both come out on december 10th um the first is a bonus campaign for the original

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:56.560
and the second is a multiplayer fighting game spin-off it was supposed to come out last april

01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:02.560
but it is coming out in december so yay i didn't mean for that to sound as squeaky as it did i'm

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:09.520
losing my voice and so konami has applied for a new trademark for goemon as in the mystical ninja

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:16.080
um and it says game program and game software which the last one that came out was uh goemon

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:22.080
uh took idochu um which came out in 2005 for the nintendo ds i can't wait for that going on

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:27.520
pachi slot machines gonna be awesome this is game program and software which i think if they

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:35.840
if they're putting a trademark for pachi slot it has to be labeled as such so if i remember

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:40.320
correctly well i mean you know we had a castlevania collection that did pretty well not to say it

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.400
would necessarily be just a goemon collection because we also had a new bomber man game that

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:54.960
did pretty well so anything's possible i suppose yes all right and um like yeah those were all

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:59.440
right did i think i closed my other one no that was it okay shovel knight in the goemon so i just

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:04.880
like i completely i guess went over my brain doing shovel knight all good we are going to move on to

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:08.160
release dates we're going to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out to

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:13.760
a store or shelf near you soon uh or what's like i don't know if there's not much we've kind of

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:20.720
the fourth quarter rush is kind of over um so this week we only have a few things although

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:26.400
there are some notable stuff so football manager 2020 we've got that coming out on pc ios and

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:34.400
android not fake football but real football right um and then we have shinmu 3 coming out on pc and

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:42.080
playstation 4 it's kind of a big deal that is and oh finally yes and last but not least sniper ghost

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.800
warrior contracts on pc playstation 4 and xbox one are you going to check out shinmu 3 dark

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:52.480
sakura we didn't even finish shinmu 2 well i mean i would assume it's been so long that you probably

02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:56.800
don't have to have finished the first two games we'll see yeah i'm i have a lot of curiosity about

02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:01.760
it that's for sure anyway shinmu 3 also coming out in japan same date as the rest of the world

02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:07.200
uh as far as other releases this week in japan on the 21st we have demo reborn is coming out

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:11.360
um as well as sonic force is getting a price reduction i think the same thing is happening

02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:16.800
with blaze blue uh cross tag battle so we're seeing some price reductions over in japan just

02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:21.920
in time for the holidays even though the holidays are a little bit different over there um but we

02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:27.280
also have on the nintendo switch we have that same blaze blue cross tag battle but we also get the

02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:33.760
localized version of lego jurassic world comes out in japan this week woohoo and diablo leak lovers

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:39.520
grand edition for a nintendo switch both in a regular and limited edition package um there's

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:46.000
also a deluxe edition version of mutant year zero road to eden coming out and uh there's actually

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:51.440
gosh uh one more game actually because everything else here is for a different region but bukura no

02:02:51.440 --> 02:03:00.320
keshigomu otoshi plus sports shed shed set excuse me is coming out as well which looks to be actually

02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:05.520
funny enough i was just kind of like boohooing about no clubhouse games type of thing on the

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.160
switch from nintendo this actually kind of looks to be kind of like it's like tabletop type of

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.040
games um but it looks like you're like building cars and building like little soccer things so

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:21.200
it's like you like build these little creations and then play like ping pong type of games and

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:25.920
racing games and things with them so it kind of looks kind of interesting like a build it and

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:30.720
play it type of game so it looks kind of neat so i wonder if we have a localized version of that

02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:34.960
here i don't think we do it doesn't look familiar to me how about uh europe dark soccer quite a few

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:42.960
things actually we have football manager 2020 vr ping pong pro shen mu 3 um those are all on the

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:51.120
18th um on the 20th we have a sniper ghost warrior uh contracts asterix and obelix we have blaze blue

02:03:51.120 --> 02:04:01.200
cross tag battle special edition on the 21st civ 6 on the 21st for playstation and xbox um new

02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:07.120
super lucky's tale on the 21st ghost parade uh train sim world collectors edition

02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:26.400
the chatters are hearing thumping was somebody thumping the mic just be careful no but i was

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:31.600
something the bass all right anyway well i mean thank that part that party shut up right when our

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:35.440
show started yeah good and it wasn't it wasn't the same neighbors apparently i have two neighbors that

02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:39.280
like to party i was about to go in your backyard and just scream i know i know you were anyway

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:44.240
i'd do it too well i'm glad the thumbing's gone sorry guys uh but moving on let's get into our

02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:49.440
email bag so every week you guys uh email us participate at orangelandtrader.com and we read

02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:56.160
our favorite emails here on the show so apparently we have one uno one uno mail um do you believe the

02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:02.080
success of nintendo switch will push back against the trend of 60 gigabyte online required games

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:04.400
also bought super multitasking robert m

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:13.760
no i do not believe it will do that first off why are your us a quarter just kidding no that's

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:18.320
great i'm glad i'm glad uh why we are his appearance on the last show got some uh coverage

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:25.440
for super multitasking that's great um the 60 gig trend is the success of the nintendo switch gonna

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:30.080
reverse that uh i'm gonna give a nice big hearty note of that they're gonna get bigger but

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:35.760
nintendo's gonna keep doing nintendo's thing uh i'm kind of with you i actually also would say

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:40.960
nintendo is kind of not immune to these gigantic downloads i mean they are smaller because the

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:45.920
system doesn't necessarily handle full 1080p or what have you or have the onboard storage as a

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:52.960
store 16 gigs correct but well i was gonna say wasn't like xenoblade chronicles 2 like a pretty

02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:59.520
gigantic gals at least 20 if not 30 gigs so i don't i don't i wouldn't say just because the

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:04.240
nintendo switch is smaller doesn't mean that they don't have gigantic games that exist on it so uh

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:08.000
and the witcher like didn't the witcher have to download that was a huge download as well

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:14.480
on switch so i and overwatch has to do that i don't see nba 2k also had like a thing yeah i

02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:19.760
don't think uh i don't think the nintendo switch is really immune to this and it's it's not i i

02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:26.240
no it's not gonna change there's always going to be the small indie hits such as super multitasking

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:32.000
is a great example there you know that's a much smaller game not even one gig uh for that game

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:37.440
you know sometimes good things can come in smaller sizes um but i think you know as we get into the

02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:42.640
next generation of games when we talk about playstation 5 and we talk about the next xbox

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:50.480
you know it's going to be about bigger better graphics 4k more bigger more frames a second

02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:58.400
virtual reality games are only going to get bigger yo unless streaming and the cloud can make up for

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:02.480
some of that which i think is especially going to happen on the xbox side of things we have yet to

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:07.360
see what might happen on sony side of things so um to be determined when we know more about the

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:13.600
system on how the data will work there uh but i i just think the games are going to get bigger

02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:18.240
um if not incorporating more streaming or something like that well one of the things

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:23.040
we didn't talk about uh which was the story that happened last week as well was that patent that

02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:31.760
they had for sony about a cartridge for possibly a playstation oh interesting because we do know

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:37.680
that solid state drive is where it's going to so could could they just be selling games that

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:43.040
are on little hard drives yeah like uh it could be i mean like it could be solid state drives or like

02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:48.480
you know nvms or something like that just inside some sort of cartridge shell huh it's like the

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:55.840
modern day zip disk except much faster yes yes much faster those are actual discs still it's true

02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:00.720
it's true so interesting i'll be i'll be very curious to see where that goes again we don't

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:05.120
know until sony you know pulls back the curtain completely and shows us what the but wouldn't that

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:10.080
be something if the sony the company that was kind of responsible in many ways for shifting the

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:14.480
industry to cd-based stuff you know and then dv and it still could be both could yeah it's true

02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.200
it could be both and it may pull us back towards cartridge well the switch i guess is going to a

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:25.680
cartridge format but but still it'll be it'll be very interesting to see um how that goes yeah so

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:30.480
all right well um moving on then if that was it for our email bag we encourage you to email us

02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:36.320
in a future week participate at orange lounge radio.com in the meantime loki what do we have

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:42.880
in gaming news so there is a brand new feature that's being added to the xbox one it's basically

02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:50.720
like a shuffle button or a new surprise me button is added to the xbox one uh game library i don't

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:56.720
know what i want to play pick for me pretty much that's exactly what it is uh it says the button

02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:05.920
doesn't automatically launch a game but um it will basically do like a roulette and pick a game

02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:14.000
for you misfortune turn turn turn show us a lesson that we should learn so it's like you know neat

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:19.280
i guess but yeah it'll just kind of at random um pick something out for you that would be if i

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.880
think that's going to be fun for streamers okay well it doesn't actually do like a roulette thing

02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:27.040
but it'll actually pick up okay here's a game you know and you pick the option and you're like

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:30.560
oh i don't want that and then you can do something else yeah but that's that's still going to be a fun

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:35.120
thing for streamers i think or it's like you know i'm i need that for steam microsoft pit you need

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:39.760
that for steam yeah yeah i'm kind of surprised there's got to be like a plug-in or a mod or

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.840
something that somebody well they're supposed to with the the redesign of their uh ui they're

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:49.600
supposed to be doing some sort of um thing where it's supposed to show you games you haven't

02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:54.960
they're in your backlog they haven't played in a little while or ever which is most of mine yeah

02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.800
i think i think this is a fun idea especially when you're like i don't know what i want to play

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.120
pick for me or like for games pass or something yeah especially if it's especially if it's like

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:07.520
stuff that's already installed on my end i don't have to i don't have to wait it's like press the

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.160
button it's like hey did you remember that you purchased uh kingdom hearts 3 a while ago but

02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.920
you had never played it no i completely forgot about that i purchased kingdom hearts 3 and would

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:20.560
you like to see the value of your sixty dollar video no

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.160
is that what you've wasted i'm purchasing games you'll never play

02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:32.320
remember all those deals that you thought that you just couldn't pass up that ten dollar ea game well

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:37.360
you played none of them i would like to see you know a nintendo use this on their uh classics

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:42.160
library you know hopefully it gets bigger although come to think of it nintendo hasn't

02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:48.960
expanded than i was just gonna say that the so have we gotten any new snes or nes classics

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:55.440
nope nope nope it's been a couple months but nope nothing yet so wait for that next direct i guess

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:01.440
i'm just not holding my breath anymore for them i that's probably a good call i would think there's

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.240
still plenty of room to expand on the super nintendo side but we'll see we'll see anyway

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:11.360
uh moving on let's talk about pokemon go uh related uh news and this is actually a really

02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:18.080
big deal so niantic wayfarer actually opened up this week uh this used to be operation portal

02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:23.760
recon which was niantic's version of uh adding new portals or places of interest for the ingress

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:28.240
player base what's very notable about this is that you don't have to play ingress anymore if you want

02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:34.320
access to this so now if you have a pokemon go account that's level 40 i was about to say level

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:39.280
40 or higher but level 40 is as high as you can go so if you have a level 40 pokemon go account you

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:44.800
now have access to niantic wayfarer and you can submit places of interest uh you can submit i

02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:50.720
think seven in a rolling two-week period or you can also review other submissions that people

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:58.800
have submitted and mine is still pending from may wow well give it and i did even did that upgrade

02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:03.120
next whatever the hell that did nothing well give it a few more days because now the pokemon go

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.960
players are they're reviewing things and i'm seeing more stuff get processed pretty quickly

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.440
i've had two new things added just in the past week um so we'll see so i got a brand new pokey

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:19.840
stop by work and i got a brand new pokey stop um where i guess i can say it where the mongolian

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:23.680
barbecue place is here there's now a pokey stop there because there's a church a strip mall church

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:28.640
right next door to it ah convenient mongolian barbecue sounds good i know it's it's that place

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:35.200
that looks like it hasn't changed since the 1970s yeah yeah so anyway uh but yeah now folks can

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:39.680
submit their own stops and i i think people are pretty excited about that granted as an ingress

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:48.000
player because ingress is very pvp heavy i've had my reservations about this but i also realized

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.040
that there's a big backlog of submissions on the ingress side of things because unfortunately

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:59.360
clearly there is faction bias coming into play absolutely uh which is stupid and uh something

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:04.000
needs to be done about it so if pokemon go players can come in and help break the tie

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.480
faction bias like do they see which faction you are if you're voting on it i will tell you i have

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:15.520
submitted things in this area where i live and i know that the opposing team sees that it's in

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:24.400
this area knows that it's near me and denies it based on that so i i've seen i've seen and i've

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:30.400
seen people on our side do it too i've seen the criteria applied a little stricter when a portal

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:36.480
pops up on burnin and riverside over in roseville than maybe when it does well not so much anymore

02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:41.920
but maybe a couple years ago like you know i would just not to say they just the criteria will be a

02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:46.800
little more stringent so i think there is sometimes a little more affection bias that comes into play

02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:52.240
um and i think uh the pokemon go players are going to help break that tie a little bit my hope though

02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:59.520
is that because ingress is very player versus player those little libraries on people's lawns

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:04.400
better not fucking become places of interest everywhere you know it's fine if it's in a park

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:11.360
or in a church parking lot because those are public accessible things but you know like private places

02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:16.240
need to not become portals and stuff and they really shouldn't be pokey stops or jimmies

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:22.160
gyms either just because you want one on your couch um so hopefully it's going to take a

02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:28.640
consensus of the players from both games to get things added and i think at the end of the day

02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:34.800
that'll be a good thing if that's the case so anyway i just have a news flash by the way what's

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:39.760
that you know how i've been waiting for detroit to become human to be out on uh pc oh is it now

02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.880
release date december 31st oh oh the new year's new year's eve present to yourself how about that

02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:50.320
yeah i just thought i would make a mention yeah so anyway uh yeah so sj100 matt says pokemon go

02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:55.280
players on my discord from my local area have been buying large sculptures for their front lawns

02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:01.120
to make it into pokey stops they should save their fucking money because any ingress player

02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:06.880
especially is that who has is in our chat and i know has reviewed at least 10 000 portal

02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:13.120
submissions how many is that are you at right now um the minute you see that that's on private

02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:18.560
property deny and i do the same thing if it's if it's in a residential neighborhood and on private

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:22.320
property i mean if it's a park in a residential neighborhood obviously that's okay if it's a

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:26.560
mural for a church that's like interest i mean as long as you know i'll look at google maps to make

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:30.640
sure it's denoted as a church and things like that but for the most part if it's in a residential

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:36.000
neighborhood we're fucking denying it like because that's not a valid place and i'm not creeping in

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:41.120
my car at 2 a.m to throw a blocker for somebody's front lawn and whoever you know you might think

02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:46.400
that's a good idea until that ex raid shows up at your house and then you know everybody's there

02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:51.360
that's gonna be a bad idea so if you think buying a sculpture for your front lawn is a good idea

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:57.760
don't what is a good idea let's say you live in a really underrepresented part of the nation like

02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:02.080
a rural part of the country or you live in a country that you know is really poorly

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:07.360
represented with stops like mexico or you know most of central america and south america for

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:14.640
heaven's sake then the park your public park nearby the sign should be a portal the playground

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:18.720
structure should be a portal if there's like a community garden that should be a portal

02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:23.680
uh you know all that stuff submit them submit them all because they're all valid um basketball

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:29.280
courts horseshoe places all that stuff should be fine but they should be at public places of

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:38.240
interest not your fucking toilet so no pooping stops unless it is a park restroom all right

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:49.200
anyhow uh azet by the way in our chat room has reviewed 17 835 so we we she's she's pretty

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:57.280
infamous can you review my place it's been there since may you might need to send a support to

02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:00.560
especially if you've had it upgraded you should send a support ticket going there's still no

02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:06.240
resolution i upgraded that months ago that's that's weird that it's still in the system so

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.640
all right anyway i'll be curious to see how this plays out by the way this is a chance for me to

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:17.200
give a cheap shout out for the pokemon go podcast um i was a guest on their most recent episode this

02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:22.880

02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:49.520
friend that's a poo and a fork what nothing i'm looking at chat for something else but um i i'm

02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:53.920
interested in this game for sure i want to check it out i have to play the shit out of this weirdness

02:19:53.920 --> 02:20:00.960
yeah because i like to nobi nobi boy yeah anyway i hate to go back to the pokemon go thing but

02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:09.280
chatters chatters they get to say and matt found a statue that somebody put on their fucking lawn

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:16.480
just to try to get a pokestop and it is an ugly ass dog person and i i'm sorry guys i wish i could

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:20.480
put this on the twitch feed for you to see but you can see it in chat like matt just posted it there

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:25.280
it is this ugly ass dog thing that looks like i mean that thing looks like it's like eight feet

02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:30.720
tall where the fuck did he find this and they went and as that says that's a humongous waste

02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:36.000
of money i agree because here's the thing here's the problem and again i'm very sorry but i mean

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.280
for the podcast listeners anyway you're not going to have the visual so i'm going to explain this

02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:43.120
the best i can i'm going to explain this as a reviewer and i'm going to explain why i would

02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:49.200
ding this portal because here's the problem you can very clearly see there's a sidewalk

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:56.480
there right and then you see a bunch of like rocks that make that pronounce the sidewalk

02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:03.040
the problem is this statue is behind the rock and you know what that says to me this is on the

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:08.480
property because that makes up like what the property line is this statue is on the property

02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:14.080
therefore it is private property therefore it is denied and i think as that would be on the

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:18.320
same page with me well that's why is that would say that's a humongous waste of money now if that

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:23.760
thing was in a public park or if that thing existed on the other side of the sidewalk

02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:29.600
which i'm not telling this person to just move it there temporarily because the minute that thing is

02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:34.880
gone it should get reported as gone and it would be removed anyway but if that was the type of

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:40.480
thing that existed permanently on the other side of the sidewalk as long as there was 24 7 access

02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:45.360
safely to it it might it might be more because i don't know i'd have to weigh in a lot of different

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:51.600
factors into that but um yeah i mean one star reject private property like as that says and

02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:57.440
you can clearly see the sculpture is on the private property so it's also really i'm telling

02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:01.760
you what i mean i know a lot of the pokemon go players think us ingress reviewers are assholes

02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:08.640
and you're right but i'm a fan of both games i'm level 40 in pokemon go and i'm level 16 in ingress

02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:13.840
and let me tell you having a pokestop on your couch is not everything it's cracked up to be

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:19.040
you really have to think about what you are inviting to that because you're not just inviting

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:24.000
a pokestop for you to spin when you're pooping you're inviting a portal for people to battle on

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:30.960
you're inviting possibly a harry potter knowledge thing and in you're inviting all that shit onto

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:37.200
your lawn you know and who knows what other games niantic might release in the future so think

02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:43.200
before you do something like this so yeah and as that says i promise you do not want to couch stop

02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:49.280
yeah anyway all right thank you sj100 matt says he'll post a link to the picture in the podcast

02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:53.920
episode comments so you guys can see that over at vog network.com thank you thank you so much for

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:58.080
that i appreciate that okay let's move on sorry i know we got a little off topic but i'm sorry

02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:04.960
it's bizarre somebody bought an eight foot ugly ass dog person statue just to get a pokemon stop

02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:12.480
on their pooper like it's wow wow or they just i don't know i don't know if they bought it just

02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:17.680
for that but you know oh maybe they just thought it was a pretty maybe they're just like uh they

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:23.120
just you know you know i just like y'all that really desperately want these pokemon stops on

02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:29.120
your house humor me for a minute the point of these games is to walk

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:37.360
now or i guess you could drive but really walking's best or biking biking's great

02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:45.120
bike team best team right so the point of these games is to walk so maybe it's okay

02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:54.160
that you walk to your park and get this even rural towns have parks anyway okay i've had my piece

02:23:55.440 --> 02:24:00.720
tweet me if you don't like it mr rob roberts on twitter all right uh let's move on loki you have

02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:06.160
something else to talk about yes so uh the game awards will be streamed to participating

02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:14.000
cinemark theaters on december 12th and along with that apparently if you buy the 20 ticket you also

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:21.680
get treated to jumanji the next level that movie will be showing right before the game awards

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:31.600
okay i guess i guess if you're really interested in seeing that um so that's technically a day

02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:38.160
earlier you get a special treat to see that movie or suffer through it and watch the game awards um

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:46.640
so yeah so it starts at 445 central and then the game awards or it's starting at 7 30 p.m central

02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:53.920
god does i hope that movie is not that long um yeah i don't know i don't know if i'd i would

02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:59.280
not want to do this i certainly wouldn't go to the jumanji thing it's on thursday i really don't

02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:04.320
need to go i'll just i'll watch it on my phone like i do every year and when i watch i mean

02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:11.440
i may catch the trailers after it's done yeah i mean i think jeff's done a much better job

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.000
crafting a decent game award show who are they giving the lifetime award to this year do we know

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.920
i don't know that was the best part of it when they gave it to roberta williams that was the

02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.800
year i watched um but i didn't watch last year so anyway um but i'm curious who they're going

02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:29.440
to get lifetime thing too this year um i don't think i would go watch it trapped in a movie

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:33.280
theater i like watching it in the comfort of my home with fast forward but i was just thinking

02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:38.160
while you're kind of talking about this like oh we you know microsoft just had a big event where

02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:42.160
they showed all these trailers we don't have anything like that from sony or nintendo and

02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:50.480
then i'm thinking oh those guys tend to do stuff with game awards huh do you think maybe that's why

02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:55.040
microsoft said some stuff and not to say microsoft won't have anything but do you think that maybe

02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:00.640
like sony and nintendo especially are saving some things for the game awards i don't know we'll see

02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:07.440
maybe it'll be another death straining trailer interesting no death straining too all right

02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:14.960
all right uh anyway moving on to one more story here and i apologize i don't have video of this

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:20.480
i ran out of time but i did pull this from um our uh discord as well and apparently you know

02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:25.760
the sonic the hedgehog part three the soundtrack saga in that game where michael jackson kind of

02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:30.640
ghost wrote some of the uh songs or at least that they replaced a bunch of tracks for later releases

02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:35.920
yeah exactly well apparently some of the game archive folks out there namely the websites the

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:41.680
hidden palace and the cutting room floor um apparently have found prototypes of um sonic

02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:47.920
the hedgehog cd sonic chaos which was an 8-bit game and then prototypes of sonic the hedgehog 2

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:53.840
but the final release of the month of their sonic prototypes a pre-release version of sonic the

02:26:53.840 --> 02:27:00.240
hedgehog 3 it was a prototype dated november 3rd 1993 and the game is still in the early process

02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:05.760
of being uh in two parts so some of the parts that are with sonic and knuckles sonic and knuckles are

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:11.600
you know kind of not all done yet but anyway uh apparently some of the music in this game is

02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:16.000
different some of the experiments in the game uh there's different commands like a ring throwing

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:22.640
projectile attack uh an aerial spin dash uh buffer that kind of looks like sonic mania's drop dash

02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:31.120
and of course some of the uh musical changes as well um sega had announced michael jackson as a

02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:35.440
composer but then quickly pulled that announcement probably because of what was going on in

02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:42.400
courtrooms around the same time um and um yeah apparently in this uh version of it uh there's

02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:48.000
replacement tunes uh that were in fact the original tunes that were in by sega and swapped

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.360
out for jackson's stuff like carnival night zone ice cap zone launch based zone and knuckles theme

02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:59.520
the versus mode jingle and so forth those songs were originally composed tunes that michael

02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:08.240
jackson's tracks replaced so interesting so a lot of uh a lot of replacing changing last minute

02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:14.640
stuff going on with sonic 3 that this prototype is just adding along to the drama with so it does

02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:21.280
show where those replacement tracks came from so yeah no i i freaking love sonic stuff so yeah

02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:27.040
yeah um but i liked you know despite all the controversy around michael jackson you know the

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:33.200
music being the music um i thought some of the stuff that you know was there was really good so

02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:38.720
pretty cool anyway uh dr c says the alternate cuts are up on youtube of course everybody's gone to

02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:42.880
town on this you can check out those game archive websites as well if you want to see a little more

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:50.080
on the missing sonic 3 um sj100 matt is pointing out um i will say the church's song and death

02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:56.000
stranding is fantastic it really is the church's i i the death stranding full soundtrack should be

02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.840
out now huh i wonder if there's other good songs in it are there any other like yeah

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:05.040
um the whole thing's on apple music right now okay so that means spotify pandora all the places have

02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:08.640
it so i don't know about the others because i remembered there's being something about

02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.960
like a limited well spotify had the church's things i don't see why they wouldn't yeah yeah

02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:18.000
the whole the whole album is on apple music oh okay i want to check that out that's pretty cool

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.200
did it did you did you like the church's song did you like that because it's the ending credits

02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:26.240
song right um it actually there's a song that plays in the game too while it's there

02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:33.040
um the video i watched had to cut part of it out for for licensing oh interesting huh i'm gonna

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:38.480
go ahead and also go completely off the cuff here and say the mustang mock e is ugly as balls and

02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:42.320
doesn't look like a fucking that is completely off the cuffs that's all right i'm just saying i had i

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:47.360
was like i was getting mustang stuff for dan it's fine it's fine all right well we are about to the

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:52.880
part of the show where we're gonna uh open up our discord for some telephone calls so if you

02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:57.600
want to get in on the show tonight you can join our green room and we'll head over there or if

02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:05.440
you have general questions you want to ask us as well you can um you can uh ask those in chat as

02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:09.280
well do you have any last minute stories for us loki while we get set up there's a weird issue

02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:13.600
with pokemon sword and shield that apparently is crashing roku devices connected to the network

02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:18.400
that it's being played on something has to do with the packets that the game is sending back

02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:25.280
and forth um are crashing those devices connected to your network which is weird i also they also

02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:30.160
had another issue with your um sd cards getting corrupted too so the game's got all sorts of

02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:34.720
problems apparently the sd card thing is getting blown way out of proportion like somebody did

02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:38.480
a breakdown about that it's it's more of a bug than it is something that's like affecting like

02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:43.760
tons of people and you have to do a very specific thing for that to happen yeah so but social media

02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:48.080
kind of spread that like wildfire but anyway let's go to the phones because you're ready to

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:53.440
talk some pokemon because i see who's calling in right now so um hi shane are you there on the line

02:30:54.160 --> 02:31:01.520
yes hi how are you i am good i just beat pokemon shield actually while you guys were doing your

02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:09.040
show you beat pokemon shield yes i'm but you know oh go on sorry how many hours

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:17.360
i think it said like 38 okay um and in my little pokemon group i have uh i'm only like the

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:25.120
fourth or fifth one to beat it so i was pretty slow compared to other people and you've been

02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:31.360
you've been playing some long hours on this game right yes and no so for the first day i played

02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:38.000
10 hours straight i guess that first night i redid my sleep schedule it's been awful

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:45.600
um but then this weekend i've been doing like burst playing um because you know i was hanging

02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:51.760
out with dustin since the weekend and he's off work and he also got the new star wars games so

02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:59.600
we were watching him play that and stuff so yeah um all right into it i'm sure the people that have

02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:04.640
been listening to orange on radio for a long time and know what a fan of pokemon you are really want

02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:10.800
to know what's your take how does pokemon sword and shield measure up is it worthy of being

02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:21.760
generation eight uh or did game freak lie okay so it it's so hard to to say this because it's only

02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:27.520
been out for three days um and i'm still doing the post game stuff there's post game stuff of course

02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:39.280
and um i am very comfortable at least saying that it is really close to gen 5 in terms of my

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:48.080
favorite like pokemon game it has the potential actually to surpass it for me and this was a lot

02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:52.720
better experience than i could have possibly thought it was going to be that's a pretty heavy

02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:57.280
endorsement why do you think why do you think this game is winning for you in that regard like

02:32:57.280 --> 02:33:04.480
what is this bringing to the table for you so i think the main things for me that make this

02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:12.320
such an enjoyable experience um i feel like the story is pretty focused especially for a pokemon

02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:20.400
game um it's it's almost split into two parts but the main part the whole um gym challenges that you

02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:28.800
do for this you know basically sporting event style uh um pokemon league it's it's actually

02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:35.440
really good i thought it was probably the best direction they've ever taken with doing gyms and

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:43.760
all the badge stuff um and then the side story that's going on is is pretty entertaining um at

02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:48.560
least it's interesting i'm not sure entertaining is the right word but i didn't ever feel like

02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:57.280
there was a dull moment so all that is great um the gym is pretty great i don't know if you heard

02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:03.120
me say that earlier in the show it's so good yeah yeah it's pretty great actually the music as a

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:09.600
whole is really good in this game which which track did toby fox do do we know uh it definitely

02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:18.320
doesn't play during the main story so it's after you beat it um what else so i am okay with the

02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:26.160
culling of the decks i think it actually worked out to its advantage um even though my favorite's

02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:31.600
gone like i love oshawott it's my favorite pokemon in the world it's not in this game

02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:40.080
oh well like all i would have done is brought it in to breed it to make it shiny that's literally

02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:46.800
literally like the only thing i do with old pokemon that aren't in the decks um what else

02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:54.640
wants to know your favorite pokemon from this gen oh god okay so there are so many good ones

02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:04.560
i can give you a top three but i can't put them in an order so ice q which is a an adorable ice

02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:11.280
penguin i love him i thought he was stupid at first and he actually like really helped out my

02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:19.600
team toxtricity which is electric and poison type and like it has two forms and one's like

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:25.040
a bass guitar type uh player and the other is like someone straight up gives you one of those

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:33.600
right i think i just got yeah the the pre-evolution toxel so yeah um and then finally

02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:40.640
intellion uh which i'm sorry it's three days after the game and you've seen pictures by

02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:49.680
now it's the water starter final evo okay so those are my top three um what do you think of

02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:57.200
the wide open area the uh wild zone i actually like it but probably not for the reasons they

02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:04.240
really want us to like it um it chugs if you're online which kind of sucks the frame rate drops

02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:11.520
considerably when other people are in that same area as you and that's okay whatever um i you

02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:15.840
know it's cool to see all the pokemon walk around i actually prefer them on the routes rather than

02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:21.040
the wild area because i'm just trying to maneuver in the wild area to get to different places but

02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:28.560
the max raid battles are the best thing this game has done in a long long time doing four player

02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:36.160
co-op oh me and my little group of pokemon friends we did it for hours last night um it's just

02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:44.320
so much fun yeah i actually tapping on a screen like over and over i think those raids are are

02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:50.400
part of the strength of uh this this particular gen of pokemon as well and i it does i mean whether

02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:55.200
y'all agree with me or not it really feels kind of inspired by pokemon go in a way you know that

02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:00.560
idea of like teaming up to take on a big uh gigantic version of a pokemon that then scales

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:06.240
down to something you can catch like that does feel like it was inspired by pokemon go one

02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:13.040
bummer about it and i think this is just i'll blame gamefreak and nintendo is the lack of

02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:18.640
being able to communicate with the random players you're paired with or not paired with but if they

02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:27.200
join your um your lobby to fight the pokemon because for example last night i got into a raid

02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:33.920
for a pokemon that was the gigantamax form which is much more rare to find and they're really cool

02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:43.280
and so it was a fire bug type so three of us took you know great counters for it i took intellion

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:49.040
i think somebody else took intellion and somebody took something else the fourth person took

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:58.160
score bunny's final evolution and score bunny is fire type and the pokemon we fought was fire and

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:05.840
bug plus it had an ability that every time it would get hit by a fire move it would get uh like

02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:15.040
a attack increase and so this one player not only was using fire moves but they also dynamax their

02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:23.280
pokemon and only one person gets to do that and so like it was a waste of our entire collective time

02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:28.160
because of that one person vg realness and chat says it was probably a kid they probably didn't

02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:33.040
know but like yeah and you you would have liked a way to like wave a flag and say try something

02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:38.560
else like please yeah or like some appropriate counter yeah or some like preset chat options

02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:48.640
that say like hey uh let me dynamax or something so before that person did it they you know wouldn't

02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:54.880
dynamax or quit using fire the fire moves thing was what really actually made me mad because it

02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:01.520
literally says when you hit it with it like a thing pops up with its ability and it just

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.880
increases their attack or whatever and they kept doing it over and over yeah even whatever even

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:10.720
a canned message that says try a water type pokemon or something probably would have been

02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:20.000
better right yeah um but otherwise i think those are mostly implemented very well and it is kind

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.760
of a bummer that i feel like they will not be back in whatever comes after this i think this

02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:30.960
is going to stay kind of standard to just sword and shield no matter how much we all say it's

02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:38.400
amazing um let me ask you i want to ask you some other bits of the controversy well what's what's

02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:45.040
your whole take on the the wave against this game on twitter and what you know the the the fact that

02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:50.400
people are going so far as to attack ign for a good review when they attacked ign for a bad review

02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:56.960
uh and then uh are attacking sarahb.net of all places which blew my mind when those guys work

02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:06.320
for virtually nothing um i think they're just whiny idiots to put it like the nicest way possible

02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:14.880
uh there's really no need to do something like that i feel like if you have the time to

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:23.120
make death threats and write reviews to bomb metacritic with you know negative reviews

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.960
uh you could be doing something much more productive and it really shows how sad your life

02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:33.360
is yeah and if you if you don't like it which folks out there have every right to not like this

02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:37.920
game or not want this game don't buy it don't buy it exactly like that yeah the bottom line is

02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:43.360
nothing will send a stronger message than not buying the game but yeah the thing that blows my

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:46.720
the thing that blows my mind is everybody on there complaining and then they they buy it anyway

02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:55.680
yeah and like what you can be mad about certain things uh that they cut or that they change

02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:03.360
and that's cool be mad about it it's you're right but when you start like throwing a fit

02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:10.160
over positive reviews that i don't know do you not see how sad you are at that point

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:18.400
uh just it blows me away um so what else would i what else would i ask about this oh let me

02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:24.720
one other take on the um controversy out there would be the whole like the game was rushed do

02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:30.720
you think that maybe because even i'm kind of thinking like well i mean optimization wise

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:37.120
i could make a case for maybe this game maybe wasn't totally ready for the holiday but it was

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:42.720
kind of one of those it nintendo needed something for the holiday so they made it happen um and i

02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:46.320
you know again i think the game came out fine but i definitely like we're talking about the wild

02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:53.200
area kind of it kind of gets a little yucky and maybe needed a little more optimization um do you

02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:59.520
think the game was rushed do you think more time would have helped this game or what i think that's

02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:05.600
the case for every game that comes out um i think if they had more time they could have added more

02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:12.800
pokemon they could have done whatever but i don't think we're we've been given an inferior product

02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:20.880
i don't think that delaying it an extra you know month would have really made that big a difference

02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:29.040
um i think it's i i don't think gamefreak's a great developer to begin with just technically

02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:35.520
they do a lot of cool things but their games are always behind in some way and i didn't expect this

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:45.200
game to show me that they were like on the level of the developers uh nintendo's internal team for

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:52.960
like mario odyssey or anything like that but i wouldn't say this was rushed this feels complete

02:42:52.960 --> 02:43:00.400
and awesome and like i said earlier what we were given is dangerously pushing up against my

02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:06.640
favorite pokemon generation in terms of how much i like it now my last question for you and arguably

02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:13.920
the most important question for you shane how many shinies do you have so far zero i okay so

02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:21.840
no i no i agree um there's a couple things about that though like i have not really looked up

02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:27.920
how shiny hunting is in this game so i don't know much about it yet and i don't have my shiny charm

02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:34.800
which i i want i always like having that when it's available in the game so that's going to be an

02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:41.440
after i beat everything and i'm ready to you know just kind of chill with my pokemon game

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:49.360
now granted with the addition of all the multiplayer content i feel like shiny hunting

02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:54.880
while i love it a whole bunch i'm gonna get distracted like by oh look somebody is connecting

02:43:54.880 --> 02:44:00.080
to a raid i really want to do i better hop in that lobby and do it as well um and that's

02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:05.440
something i didn't touch on it took me eight hours to get to the first gym because i fell down this

02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:10.960
hole of just wanting to do max raid battles and just i kept going and going i was having so much

02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:18.320
fun yeah that that's how all my my friends that were playing passed me because i just i couldn't

02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:27.840
stop you get all that xp candy yes that's a hundred percent true and it helps it helps so

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:37.200
much especially like for example i picked up um ice cube towards the end and he was severely

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:43.680
under leveled compared to what i already had with me so i was like here have some candies and he

02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:49.120
shot up to uh like he actually surpassed he's my strongest pokemon now in terms of level at

02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:54.560
least or my highest level not strongest it's pretty weak i just yeah like it's great you

02:44:54.560 --> 02:45:00.880
know the terms better than i do but that little turtle that little blue turtle thing so i i don't

02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:08.320
know the name of it but it's like a water pokemon oh wait wait chudel or dreadnaw okay so i just

02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:15.920
put him in my party so because i just beat the water gym i took um i took something out of my

02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.640
party that was strong against water um it must have been a grass maybe it was gossip floor i

02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:27.680
think i yeah i think i had gospel in my party so i took gospel out and i put chudel in but

02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:33.040
chudel was like level 15 where the rest of my party was like level 21 so i fed wait you took

02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:38.720
you took chudel to the water gym to fight in the water no no no no no no chudel was in the box

02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:44.720
while gossip floor oh okay and then wait really quick before you continue that story that's

02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:50.480
another amazing thing that you can change your pokemon almost like 99 on the fly when you're not

02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:56.720
in a battle yeah but you can't when you do gyms you can't run out and heal up like you used to do

02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:01.920
in the old games and the game does let you heal up a lot like there's a lot of npc's they'll just

02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:05.840
be like i'm gonna heal your pokemon and some people were criticizing the game for that but

02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:10.960
i'm like you know what it's a quality of life thing because i run back almost all the time

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:15.760
and heal my pokemon before fighting another npc like it's just part of the game right so i like

02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:19.840
that they have more places to do that but when you do the gyms you don't get to do that anymore

02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:26.000
you have to fight everything in one go which is interesting um but like my fucking my grookey

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:30.720
which was thwacky or whatever his name is when he's evolved like dominated that water gym that

02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:36.800
was all i needed just tore everybody apart in that gym so um i i didn't even need the gossler

02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:41.680
but anyway i was gonna say about the chudel so like my chudel's level 15 the rest of my party's

02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:47.600
like anywhere between 21 and like 26 so i was like okay i'm gonna do like two dynamax raid

02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:53.360
and i fed chudel all the candy i got from the raids and the chudel evolved into whatever his

02:46:53.360 --> 02:47:00.400
water rock form is so now he's the perfect fire gym uh thing uh and uh got to like level this

02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:06.400
like my highest level pokemon now he's like level 27 or something yeah it those candies are such

02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:12.320
a good idea like that's something that i feel like partially came from pokemon let's go which

02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:18.960
was not a great game and they changed it to be an awesome addition instead of like oh whatever

02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:23.440
well and the nice nice thing about those candies too is that usually i'm hesitant to use items

02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.080
because it's like oh i might need those later but it's like no i know if i just go do more dynamax

02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:33.520
rates i'll get more candy so i don't feel bad using those you know what i mean yeah and i i

02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:41.280
feel you about the hesitant to use items and really don't feel too bad because that i'm not

02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:45.600
going to spoil because there's story stuff i don't want to spoil who cares about the pokemon at this

02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:53.440
point the eighth gym like tried to wreck me so hard i got down to one pokemon the eighth gym

02:47:53.440 --> 02:48:01.280
was so rough for my team and it was it was really fun because of that okay actually all right i'm

02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:05.840
curious about that so yeah i don't want to don't want to use up extra items i don't have to uh also

02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.240
you know if you just a tip for those that have the game that may may not have already figured it out

02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:16.880
if you did have let's go and you have the pokemon ball plus you can walk pokemon and you do get it

02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:20.800
doesn't level them like it did in let's go so your pokemon are not going to gain experience that way

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:26.480
but they you will get items and i think xp candy can be included but you do get an assortment of

02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:33.520
items for walking as well which is kind of neat i have not even used my extra pokeball plus yet

02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:37.920
to get mu or do anything with it you should check it out but you have that'll make you play pokemon

02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:42.080
go a little bit as well anyway shane i'm uh i'm gonna let you go because you've we've talked a

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:49.920
lot about uh pokemon but um are you doing a stream later tonight uh i wanted to do a max raid battle

02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:57.040
stream however i actually have to get to bed early tonight so i cannot all right but i will probably

02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:03.920
be doing a lot of max raid streams and anybody that has pokemon uh sword and shield that want

02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:10.560
to come do them like if i'm streaming just hit me up i will be more than happy to come join and

02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:17.040
blow things up with you and what's your uh twitch channel so people can follow uh i don't know what

02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:26.800
is it shane you need to learn a little bit about promotion oh oh it's shad underscore star zic

02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:32.560
maybe just type in the chat room hi it's shane and people will know that they can

02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:43.920
yeah all right i wasn't planning on promoting it i'm just like i'm so engrossed in pokemon right

02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:47.520
now it's fine all right thanks for calling and sharing your thoughts so i appreciate it

02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:53.440
yeah no problem all right take care my friend bye-bye all right well i don't see anybody

02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:58.240
else waiting to call in tonight uh do we have any other last minute stories to get into uh for

02:49:58.240 --> 02:50:07.280
tonight um they capcom announced uh street fighter 5 championship edition oh uh so that's coming out

02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:11.840
february 14th for 29.99 and let me guess it's the version that has like everything in it 40

02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:20.880
characters 200 costumes 34 stages 2v skills for each character uh it's also 24.99 upgrade if you

02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:26.880
have the original game um and they also announced gill as a playable character all right glad i

02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:33.840
waited uh i also had a curiosity loki because uh you know she already she showed off her copy

02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:37.920
of pokemon sword earlier you know i've been playing pokemon shield uh loki i know you've

02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:42.720
kind of held out but as all this talk possibly swayed you on the pokemon thing i might get it

02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:49.920
but i'm i i don't get very much access to the uh nintendo switch because while i was gone while we

02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:59.120
were out i had to buy the god awful ryan toy review racing game it's a a kart racing game

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:07.200
because my my youngest my youngest son fucking loves that shill of a child um but he has a kart

02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:14.000
racing game out and so i he needed to have that game so i bought him that game um but actually

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.600
ironically enough as i knew what would happen he'd get sick of that game super fast because uh

02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:25.120
we've been talking about like uh minecraft and so he's actually been playing more minecraft

02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:31.680
on the switch than anything so okay he plays minecraft on the switch a lot and then um i

02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:37.200
ironically have been watching more minecraft streams on the switch or on um youtube because

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:42.160
there's for some reason my recommended keeps like it's minecraft but we programmed it to do

02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:46.960
something different so watch it it's interesting like sounds up your alley you know yeah every

02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:53.040
block drop something that's different you know and whatever all right you know one thing i i

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:55.600
keep meaning to get more and more into since you're talking about like things that are

02:51:55.600 --> 02:52:00.000
different i keep down and i've i've been downloading and playing with them but randomizers

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:05.280
is a thing i'm like super fascinated with right now um like you know you can download uh especially

02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:11.200
the one that like mixes the game super or metroid in zelda m1 z1 i think it's called the one that

02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:16.000
mixes those and then there's actually one that mixes super metroid and link to the past together

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.760
yeah that's the one i was talking about what's the other one you're thinking there's an s1 m

02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:26.400
or excuse me m1 z1 that mixes the nes versions so it's yeah but i and i was going to set up doing

02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:29.840
those streams so i was having a problem using like the mapping thing but i think i got that all

02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:32.960
figured out long story short i kind of like sat down and taught myself to use some stuff

02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:36.160
so i might do some randomizer streams in the future because i just think that stuff is like

02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:40.640
fascinating in a way but i almost think i want to keep it simple and just do like instead of

02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:45.360
trying to mix zelda and metroid where i don't because there's certain logic that goes into

02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:49.840
the randomizer stuff that i obviously i'm just trying to like jump in and learn um but i think

02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:55.280
maybe i want to take on just just zelda first then we'll add metroid into it you know and all that

02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:59.760
but the randomizer thing i think is really fascinating and the particular mapping thing

02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:06.080
i downloaded has a bunch of randomizers that like it you know it doesn't you know you have to

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:10.160
put the roms on a website like it doesn't do it for you because it's trying to be legal about it

02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:14.720
you know wink wink non-judge and i realize these things are in a gray area of legality but

02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:20.400
y'all how many times have i bought the legend of zelda how many times i've bought the original

02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:25.280
metroid because i'm gonna tell you i bought it back in the day on the nes i bought it you know

02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:28.880
when they were on virtual console on the wii i bought it again on virtual console on the wii u

02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:33.280
i probably bought the gameboy version of at least or gameboy uh advanced version one of those games

02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:37.760
at some point so look pretty sure you have the gamecube version at one time i am allowed to take

02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:41.120
those roms and do whatever the fuck i want with them i bought that game like five times i'll have

02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:47.760
this snes classic so yeah so anyway all right anyway uh that's on that i'll talk more about

02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:51.920
that on a future week if i do fall down that rabbit hole but honestly i should probably stay

02:53:51.920 --> 02:53:58.400
focused on pokemon shield because like i think shane would like actually be speechless if i

02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:04.240
actually beat a pokemon game i think he for once would like not know what to say so i'm gonna really

02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:09.200
try to to stick it to the end of pokemon shield because i'm having a good time so far and then

02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:14.320
i need to do my not so much hate play of death stranding because i need to figure out what all

02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:20.400
this hubba baloo is about so i've got my one of the things i saw with death training that made

02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:25.120
no sense because the game doesn't really make any sense but like i guess it's slightly stealthy so

02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:30.160
that okay stop it um it does make a lot of sense when you okay but this part doesn't make sense

02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:34.720
so just stop interrupting me already listen it's like you're trying to be stealthy and hiding in

02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:39.200
like grass and stuff but yeah you have this like skyscraper of fucking packages sticking out of

02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:44.720
the sky it's like i thought i heard somebody there it's like what is that it's like you see this

02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:49.200
giant stack of boxes right there and like where the fuck did that come from and that's just a

02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:54.080
little odd it's all right it's fine like you gotta have a power suit to carry all that around anyway

02:54:54.880 --> 02:55:01.440
which he does but like it's just like we've given you a knee replacement and so does it explain the

02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:07.360
monster energy thing does it explain that because it seems just plain just like shilling for the

02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:12.800
fuck kinda all right i have to see for myself before some asshole spoils me all right anyway

02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:18.320
they do explain what causes the crater to appear you need to play since you have apple arcade what

02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:23.440
the gulf because what the gulf is free is part of apple it's great all right i'll get it i'll

02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:28.160
download it right now all right anyhow on that note uh we started with games and we're ending

02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:32.560
with games wow that's a first so we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:38.000
we will be back next week um the holidays even fall on kind of nice days for the show this year

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.760
because the holidays are like tuesday wednesdays so we should still be here throughout the holidays

tonight so i would just like to wish everybody a happy early bemoni day because that's right this

02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:33.600
week 19 and 20 november yeah unfortunately that holiday kind of falls in the middle too

02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:40.240
yeah you know and actually the funny thing is our 800th episode would have been right in this mix if

02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:45.840
you know i hadn't suddenly gotten or know that in the what was it the fucking internet cut out or

02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:52.640
whatever it was anyway yeah anyway so uh yeah happy bemoni day that's a great one uh my final

02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:58.960
thought is um i would like to not be sick for once in this past six weeks so i'm gonna cross

02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:04.560
my fingers on my toes that tomorrow i wake up and i'm all better because sinus congestion sucks

02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:09.760
last but not least dark soccer your final thought one of my that tweet that i said that i replied to

02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:15.360
kojima saying i wanted to be the bridge baby got liked by the guy who played die hard man

02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:22.400
uh tommy earl jenkins fun i just like when i get a random nod like hey that's cool isn't

02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:26.640
it weird when like random celebrities like like your tweet actually you want to i didn't talk

02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:30.400
about this on the show i'm gonna mention it here real fast and we'll wrap up the show i had a tweet

02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:35.360
go viral this week and it had nothing to do and it like that has not happened to me before i've

02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:40.720
never had i mean like maybe like a little bit viral like maybe hundreds of likes but not like

02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:45.600
an epidemic no i had one it's up to 2 000 plus likes at this point but here's the thing i had

02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:50.160
nothing to do with video games or any of that so okay what i did it was um on the day that

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:54.480
disney plus was released and i wrote it said um actually wait i'm gonna find it

02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:00.720
i'm gonna i'm just not gonna like it on purpose rob no it's fine it's one of those things where

02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:06.080
it's like i've just it's so random that of everything i've written this is the fucking tweet

02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:13.680
that people that people find and like okay disney plus hey look at us we're the cool kid new kids on

02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:20.400
the block netflix yeah well selena with the selena trailer attached that's it that's the

02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:27.840
tweet that's all i wrote 486 retweets 2086 lights it's a valid point no it is it's completely valid

02:58:27.840 --> 02:58:32.880
point like you know and then this turns into a whole conversation about how selena is literally

02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:39.760
perfect how selena would change the music industry if she were still with us how you know and just

02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:44.640
you know just selena stanning which is um something this world needs more of

02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:53.200
so everybody uh stream uh selena oh by the way i do have a very final thought okay free hong kong

02:58:53.840 --> 02:59:00.400
okay sounds good all right uh oh sj100 matt says didn't richard simmons like your tweet once rob

02:59:00.400 --> 02:59:08.640
oh i think he did he wrote no he replied i think he replied once i remember something like that

02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:12.640
i remember something like that too it was before it was before the because twitter has been around

02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:18.320
since like 2006 so it was before he went missing so like i go into random conversations though

02:59:18.320 --> 02:59:24.560
with lady bunny i mean seriously i know i've seen it yeah like on my facebook and on twitter it's

02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:30.080
the funniest thing because lady bunny is twitter getting us closer to and i'll tell you this if you

02:59:30.080 --> 02:59:35.440
want a really like a person who doesn't retweet bullshit for politics actually check out lady

02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:42.160
bunny because the stuff posted is pretty well researched and very eloquently spoken all right

02:59:42.160 --> 02:59:49.760
we're gonna wrap up okay just saying lady bunny we're ending up on a on a we're ending on a uh

02:59:49.760 --> 02:59:55.680
ranty tangenty no but it's really funny so anyway that's it we're done that's the tweet see you next
