14000	20000	This week Anthem is rumored to become All Realm Were Aborn because every publisher has to have their own open world MMO online experience.

31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 798 for this November 17th of 2019.
45000	51000	And we're back live. It's great to be back after a week off with a pre-recorded show.
51000	54000	Hope you guys all enjoyed that bonus episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
54000	61000	But we're back here live as we are every Sunday night usually when you know we're not sick or on vacation or something's going on.
61000	70000	I know it's been a weird past six weeks but it looks like we're on a nice path of being here every Sunday night over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
70000	72000	That's VOG Network for Voice of Geeks Network.
72000	76000	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
76000	78000	Who are we here at Orange Lounge Radio?
78000	82000	Well I am Rob Roberts and she off camera because she wants to be.
82000	83000	Yes I want to be.
83000	86000	Her way or the highway is Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.
86000	87000	Oh hi.
87000	88000	Hi how are you?
88000	89000	I'm okay.
89000	93000	Good and are you going to at least show the, because I went to New York City which is why I wasn't here last week.
93000	96000	Are you going to at least show the souvenir I brought you back from the Nintendo store?
96000	97000	There you go.
97000	101000	So for those on the podcast feed she's showing off a stuffed Kirby.
101000	102000	Pillow.
102000	105000	A Kirby pillow that's like an 8-bit kind of style with Kirby holding the star.
105000	106000	He's on a star.
106000	108000	Yeah so very cool.
108000	112000	I actually, so I went to the Nintendo store obviously.
112000	114000	You go to New York City and you're a nerd.
114000	116000	You have to go to the Nintendo store at some point.
116000	119000	And the upstairs portion is a lot of like Pokemon stuff.
119000	123000	Because I think when that place opened it was actually like a Pokemon center.
123000	125000	I think was the branding for those stores.
125000	127000	So upstairs is still majority Pokemon.
127000	132000	So I actually FaceTimed our resident Pokemon nerd here at the Voice of Geeks Network, Shane.
132000	135000	And I actually FaceTimed him to be like is there anything here you need?
135000	137000	Is there anything here that you need?
137000	140000	And lucky me he didn't need anything that was there.
140000	143000	Because I guess a lot of it you can get online if you know where to go.
143000	145000	But I did buy for the studio.
145000	148000	And for those of you watching on Twitch you may actually see here.
148000	153000	We had the brand new starters from Gen 8 to go with the Gen 7 starters that were here previously.
153000	158000	So the little stuffed animal couch here is growing a little bit with a Scobble, Scorbunny.
158000	159000	Excuse me, Scobble.
159000	160000	Sobble.
160000	161000	Scorbunny.
161000	163000	That's what happens when you run the names together.
163000	164000	And Grookey.
164000	165000	So they're on the couch.
165000	166000	So yeah.
166000	170000	I got that and I got the little stuffed pillow for Dark Sakura.
170000	172000	So because I think I sent you a picture.
172000	173000	I didn't FaceTime you but I sent you a picture.
173000	177000	I was like I will give you money for everything but I would go poor.
177000	178000	Yeah.
178000	179000	So you were like I want five of those pillows.
179000	182000	I was like choose one.
182000	183000	And I'll make it happen.
183000	187000	I would have I would have sent you money for the others but then Dan would have murdered me.
187000	188000	Yeah.
188000	189000	I understand.
189000	190000	Yeah.
190000	192000	I probably spent more money than I should have in New York.
192000	197000	But the good news is that most of it was bought in advance.
197000	200000	Like I was sitting on those tickets for Moulin Rouge on Broadway.
200000	203000	We bought those back in like probably like April.
203000	207000	So you know we bought them a long time ago and then we saw Jagged Little Pill on Broadway as well.
207000	208000	Yes.
208000	209000	Like the Alanis Morissette album.
209000	214000	It was the very very first weekend actually of that show being on Broadway.
214000	218000	So you know just like what like American Idiot or Mamma Mia.
218000	220000	They made a musical out of Alanis Morissette songs.
220000	224000	It doesn't have to do with Alanis Morissette like Mamma Mia isn't about ABBA right.
224000	225000	But it's just some catchy songs.
225000	228000	I and I loved both musicals for different reasons.
228000	230000	I thought they were both fantastic.
230000	234000	Moulin Rouge especially was just showy.
234000	236000	Like it was the presence of that show was amazing.
236000	246000	But anyway it's not a theater podcast but definitely I sometimes forget about what a theater fan I am until I like go to something like that.
246000	247000	And then I'm like oh I love this so much.
247000	249000	I wish I need to do this more often.
249000	257000	So now Alanis talking about going to see Dear Evan Hansen when it's touring here in Northern California later next year.
257000	261000	So I'm like yay the theater queens and both of us have been unleashed.
261000	265000	I don't know if he's a fan of the theater but I should introduce over there Techmaster Loki.
265000	266000	Hello.
266000	267000	Hi how are you?
267000	268000	I'm fine.
268000	269000	What's your favorite Broadway show?
269000	270000	I don't know.
270000	271000	Do you have one?
271000	274000	Out of all the ones I've seen.
274000	275000	I don't know.
275000	279000	I've seen family operas several times.
279000	280000	Wicked was pretty good.
280000	281000	Oh Wicked?
281000	282000	I haven't seen Wicked actually.
282000	283000	I've seen Phantom.
283000	284000	I think you have to see Phantom.
284000	285000	Yeah.
285000	287000	High schools go to see Phantom at some point but Wicked.
287000	288000	Wicked was pretty good.
288000	290000	I haven't seen Wicked believe it or not.
290000	292000	I mean I know I know enough about it but.
292000	294000	I've been to a few off Broadway but I've been to one Broadway play.
294000	296000	What is your what's your favorite play?
296000	297000	It doesn't have to have been on Broadway.
297000	300000	Well it was Broadway though and it was my favorite.
300000	302000	It was Cats at the Winter Garden Theater.
302000	306000	Oh are you how do you feel about that movie that's coming?
306000	307000	Intrigued.
307000	308000	Intrigued?
308000	309000	Okay.
309000	310000	Because I'm just gonna go sing with it.
310000	311000	Yeah.
311000	315000	Well wait for that wait for it to come to the Castro theater when they have the big sing-along.
315000	322400	We were doing like a sewing circle today with the sisters and of course Sister Ova is our
322400	329920	theater person so we were just going back and forth singing stuff from Cats and singing.
329920	334280	Also a few things from like Blazing Saddles and History of the World Part One.
334280	337120	See the nice thing about Jagged Little Pill I already knew all lyrics.
337120	341640	I mean they they changed minor lyrics to fit the narrative just like they do in Mamma Mia
341640	346320	they do the same thing there but like I knew all the songs pretty much so it was pretty
346320	347320	pretty cool.
347320	348320	I loved it.
348320	352240	Oh my god I loved it so much because they took these songs that were so important to
352240	358160	many of us in the 90s like if you're if you're in your late 30s early 40s Alanis Morissette
358160	363960	probably meant something to you in like the high school or early college era and so like
363960	370400	to see these songs reinvented with a very 2019 narrative to it because this this musical
370400	375360	touches on a lot of very current things going on like the Me Too movement and things like
375360	379680	the things that are very current it was really neat to see these songs that meant so much
379680	385660	in the 90s now have this impact on a 2019 narrative and all I'm gonna say they they
385660	390420	they put a little twist on You Oughta Know it's not what you might expect and it got
390420	394660	a standing ovation in the middle of the show something I understand happens very rarely
394660	398140	on Broadway but it was very very impressive.
398140	400580	You know what my introduction to Alanis' music was?
400580	401580	What?
401580	402580	Flea.
402580	403580	Flea?
403580	404580	Of Red Hot Chili Peppers.
404580	405580	Oh cause he played bass.
405580	406580	Yeah.
406580	410480	And that was what got me on the album because I heard that he played bass on it I was like
410480	412500	I like all things that Flea does.
412500	415600	Okay you want to hear my random Alanis Morissette trivia and then I promise we'll get to video
415600	420080	games okay here's the thing with Flea so on most versions go check your jagged little
420080	423760	pill album because there's two versions everybody bought that album right there's two versions
423760	429380	track two doesn't have Flea it's the last track track 13 has Flea and you can hear it
429380	433640	you can hear that bass in it but now I'll tie it to video games that's why that song
433640	438760	is so important in rock band two I think it was in because it does have the Flea version
438760	443160	remember it had the bass guitar in it so you're playing the Flea part yeah and so you're do
443160	449560	do do and you can really hear what the bass guitar style is pretty dynamic and pretty
449560	455000	much immediately recognizable yeah so all right anyway looking at our chat over at twitch
455000	460040	tv slash vog network metal mayhem says rob please tell us that you had pizza and a bagel
460040	464720	while in new york it's like an unsaid rule that you have to he went to his favorite italian
464720	471060	restaurant Sbarro's no believe it or not true story that was the first place I got pizza
471060	476940	when I was in new york because it was cheap but it was at times square believe it or not
476940	483620	there was no pizza and no bagels however we went to juniors with the world famous cheesecake
483620	488380	we went there twice we went there once for dessert and we went there again for dinner
488380	493940	and actually one of those nights we went there for dessert was with Ranma and Giovedea from
493940	500140	anime jam session and Victoria or Aria snark from shaking and crying so it was like a little
500220	505740	vog network kind of meetup and that was the first time Victoria and Ranma and Giovedea all met and
505740	511180	they they they're all like they all clicked like instant buds so that was kind of fun to see like
511180	516900	watch happen in real time so that was really cool so so no no new york pizza or bagel we did go to
516900	522220	an italian restaurant that's where we went with ssj100 matt so I had some nochi because I like I
522220	526940	like nochi and alan hates it so we don't really usually have it for dinner here gnocchi yeah
526940	536060	gnocchi you know whatever do I look Italian no but it's panoke okie it's like maraschino
536060	543020	whatever well that's what I had and it was good so whatever gnocchi is great um yeah I can make it
543020	552060	well good from scratch yeah why not sweet the holidays are coming up um all right anyway I've
552060	555940	had sweet potato gnocchi and that's pretty a bomb oh I haven't had that that sounds good all right
555940	560700	less food more video games we are here to talk about video games every Sunday night over the
560700	565380	next few hours I feel like it was like kind of a slower news week I don't know if that's yes
565380	570380	because of the big game releases we have this week I mean between last week's Death Stranding
570380	576300	and this week's Pokemon sword and shield and Star Wars Jedi fallen order right yeah you can tell
576300	582540	which one I haven't looked at yet but I know people who have so it's been a pretty freaking
582540	587620	big week in games so I think the news a little bit lighter because everybody's playing but I feel
587620	592580	like one company did put out a ton of news this week and it's the one that admittedly we don't
592580	596980	probably give enough of a spotlight to here on this show and I think a lot of our audience tends
596980	603300	to gravitate a little more for the Nintendo side of things and maybe the Sony side of things but
603300	608140	you have to at least even if you you know don't own an Xbox one yourself you have to at least be
608140	612780	taking a passing interest into this evolution I feel like this generation of gaming has been a
612780	617660	very like self-reflection type of stage for Microsoft you know and you know and I've said
617660	621860	this before on the show they're really setting up these chess pieces and you know under the leadership
621860	627260	of Phil Spencer they've come a long long way and they're doing some really exciting things and so
627260	633140	they had a big event this X 0 1 9 event where they announced a lot and this is just kind of a sign
633140	637260	for things to come and I think it's it's really exciting whether you follow Microsoft or not
637380	641780	they've got a lot of great stuff coming down the pipeline so I thought maybe Loki could run down
641780	647460	some of the big announcements that we heard at the X 0 1 9 event yeah so I did not get to watch this
647460	653500	either because I had just saw like after normally I would try to watch this stuff live but I was
653500	660380	working and then I saw oh it's over I'm like oh crap anyways so some of the things that were
660380	666780	announced they talked about a new game from obsidian called grounded which is gonna be
666820	673100	entering early access this spring it's a sandbox survival game he said literally you are a group
673100	678540	of kids who have been trucked down to a tiny size and have to survive in suburban backyard and not
678540	684060	get eaten by spiders so it's honey I shrunk the kids the game I love it yeah yes it has to be
684060	691220	better than that ride at Disneyland that was pretty terrible it was great wasn't that honey
691220	696220	I shrunk the audience yeah the 4d experience yeah it was like using the captain eo theater for
696220	701420	something else yeah you know it was used last time I went there mm-hmm it was you could go
701420	705540	watch a trailer for wreck-it Ralph too right I don't know yeah I don't know what they're using
705540	708940	that theater oh I think it's a Star Wars thing or it's been a Star Wars thing for a little bit
708940	715420	now no it's not news for anything right now really yeah captain eo back exactly oh wait now there's
715420	720700	all those recent things about Michael Jackson where it's you know you know but I you know what
720700	724740	I just I try not to let that like cloud what I remember in the 80s you know and captain eo was
725100	731380	awesome in the 80s so I don't know anyway all right at least they didn't try to bring back honey
731380	735540	I shrunk the audience I'm sorry it was so bad why did they have I'd like to cuz it had Eric
735540	739220	Idol in it I know Eric Idol is cool but like it was weird to me how like you would walk around
739220	743660	the outside you see like Robin Williams on a poster but he's like he's not in it this
743660	748940	false advertising like Robin Williams was like all one of the posters and it's like he's not

1030940	1035460	Windows 10 and they're gonna add more controller support including the DualShock 4 so that's kind
1035460	1041380	of cool that they'll allow third-party controllers in there as well and then last but not least more
1041380	1048580	trailers for fight simulator minecraft dungeons Age of Empires 4 crossfire acts art first artful
1048580	1052300	escape and then they had a trailer for Jedi Fallen Order even though that is technically out already
1052300	1057900	that's still that's a pretty impressive conference I mean you just spat out like probably 15 games in
1057900	1062140	that little segment there things that Microsoft showed off and that's all the stuff that's coming
1062140	1066100	out for Xbox I mean they haven't even announced the stuff that's coming out for the next system
1066100	1070060	which I'm sure lots of studios are working on stuff so you know what it kind of reminded me
1070060	1074860	of in a way is that you know PlayStation we forgot they used to do their PlayStation fan event in
1074860	1079300	November December this year yeah they haven't been doing it for a couple years I don't think
1079300	1083940	they did it last year I thought they did do it last year they did it like the year before I
1083940	1090980	think 2017 was last time they did it I could be wrong maybe somebody in chat over twitch TV slash
1090980	1094740	vog network will correct me but we're technically almost out of the games of all the ones that
1094740	1098540	they've shown they were been showing year after year so we've got desperate needs finally out now
1098540	1103180	yeah now Last of Us 2 is really kind of the last thing and then dreams I think well we also know
1103180	1107700	that like PlayStation 5 is happening right I understand that but I'm just saying for that
1107700	1111820	see we're running out of the stuff that we've already been shown it's been kind of delayed for
1111820	1116800	a while so now now it's finally coming out and then we'll have here's a bunch of new shit we
1116800	1120500	haven't shown you before which will be kind of fun but I would still you know I would still expect
1120540	1124780	the same thing to happen for Microsoft's side when they start to show off here's our next console
1124780	1129660	that we're doing so it's still pretty impressive that they had this press conference or I guess fan
1129660	1135100	event whatever you want to call it you know the media blast yeah of all these different games you
1135100	1140860	know here in November when you know we're looking at Sony and it's like oh this the engines running
1140860	1145540	out of steam but you definitely see that Microsoft's like no full steam ahead you know and they've got
1145540	1150340	even though some of it is playing catch-up a little bit you know the Final Fantasy the Kingdom
1150900	1156420	that's playing catch-up although certainly an added value to game pass I mean that's pretty
1156420	1161540	impressive to have all those Final Fantasy games on game pass right yeah so that's pretty I'm kind
1161540	1166540	of excited because now I don't have to worry about finding a because I'm probably gonna finally get
1166540	1172940	myself a 4k TV for Christmas so I don't have to worry about finding a disc version a Final Fantasy
1172940	1177900	13 to get those upgrades like it'll be on game pass you know remember how they did those like
1177940	1184460	upgrades for 4k for like Xbox one and all that so did they for 13 yeah they did so it was like
1184460	1191780	any hair or is it 15 I think they did it for 15 to but they did it they did 13 was 360 I know but
1191780	1197900	you know how they do those in hand yeah 360 things so they I mean I guess it would yeah yeah I mean
1197900	1201820	I'm not expecting the world to be different but it's still gonna look a little better and that's
1201900	1208540	nice that I can experience that through game pass yeah as a sorry guys I'm getting over a cold I
1208540	1213580	brought back disease from New York so if I may be intermittently coughing during the show I'm in the
1213580	1219300	same boat as you so they'll have to deal so sorry not sorry doing my best people get sick today's
1219300	1223540	the first day I've actually felt like thank gosh I felt much better today I don't have like that
1223540	1228900	intense pressure in my forehead like I've had the past few days so I'm okay to be doing the show but
1228900	1235140	Dan was in full man flu mode yeah yeah it's been it's been not fun but anyway so even if the Final
1235140	1239820	Fantasy stuff is old news I still think it's like oh but this is still like a cool little value and
1239820	1243260	like knowing that these have been slightly enhanced it's like if you haven't looked at
1243260	1248700	these games in a while which let's be real Final Fantasy 13 is probably almost 13 years old yeah
1248700	1254380	it's pretty old at this point it's a reason to go back and visit him again you know perhaps so I
1254380	1258140	think it's all pretty cool and then obviously some of these other big games like the rare game and
1258140	1262540	the you know honey I shrunk the kids game which what's the what's the real name of that game the
1262540	1267620	grounded grounded that I should be better to the developers than calling it what I'm calling it
1267620	1272460	but that grounded game you know that those sound like some cool new ideas then the life is strange
1272460	1277260	you know follow up from that studio and so forth these all are probably gonna be pretty big deal
1277260	1282780	sorts of games kind of neat for Microsoft to be associated with that you know so I don't know I
1282780	1288660	like grounded better when it's called earth defense force 2017 if I want to survive against
1288660	1293900	giant ants and spiders I've already got my game for that okay all right now Bobby Black Wolf is
1293900	1298420	explaining the Final Fantasy 13 thing a little bit saying Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox 360 was enhanced
1298420	1304060	for Xbox one they got the original 720p cutscenes and put them in the Xbox one version whereas the
1304060	1310980	original Xbox 360 version had 480p cutscenes so the cutscenes were re-rendered for Xbox basically
1310980	1317740	or the high-definition 720p exactly well hey better than what it was on Xbox 360 so I still
1317740	1322580	think that's pretty cool so neat so yeah sounds like a lot of good stuff out of Microsoft so you
1322580	1327740	know and I I gotta say I'm enjoying that game pass thing I mean not to get too far into our gaming
1327740	1335020	weeks that we're gonna get into next but I've been visiting blood-stained on the PC thanks to Xbox
1335020	1340860	game pass on PC and you know it's just a night even though I had bought it on sorry I had my
1340860	1346180	backer code on switch or whatever it's really nice to be able to explore that on PC on a version
1346180	1352020	that's not as buggy it's probably the switch version well I don't know I I'm not as picky
1352020	1355940	with some of those things but I did notice the switch version had some stutter and some issues
1355940	1360660	so you know and when I heard they were gonna do all the changes I was like I'm just gonna put this
1360660	1364100	on the shelf for a little bit and I'll come but what's another few months I'll go I'll go visit
1364100	1370620	it again in a few months so it's been a few months but my kind of catalyst for going to visit it
1370620	1375260	again was oh well now I can just get it on the PC for free because I'm already paying for it on the
1375260	1381340	Xbox game pass and it's it's nice just sit at the PC and play it there and you know so yeah yeah but
1381340	1385980	I'm I'm enjoying it I also thought there would be achievements but there's actually not but I mean
1385980	1390860	I try not to just play games for achievements but sometimes they're a fun little incentive right so
1390900	1394220	but they're actually there's no achievements on the PC version of blood stain that surprised me
1394220	1399180	but I'm still enjoying the game for what it's worth so all right well with that we'll get into
1399180	1403780	a little more about our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about the types of video games that we
1403780	1407860	have been playing this week actually real quick before we get into our gaming weeks I really
1407860	1412940	should ask you know when we did that taped episode we didn't have a lot of news in it because we had
1412940	1416700	taped that on Tuesday and not a lot of news has to happen I don't know if anyone wanted to touch
1416700	1421780	on anything that they kind of discovered you know kind of late last week that we didn't get to on the
1421780	1425460	on the pre tape showed our soccer I know you were talking about one thing yeah there's a more recent
1425460	1430620	something it actually did come up since last week but we didn't have it in a show role so I just
1430620	1434900	wanted to mention Animal Crossing pocket camp is coming out with a sub service they like get you
1434900	1441260	different perks like two different tiers so one of them will get have you a point in Apple an Apple
1441260	1446580	an animal as your camp caretaker and get more help around the campsite and the other one you'll
1446620	1451300	get fortune cookies and can store your furniture and clothing items and warehouses like I don't see
1451300	1456820	why that's important because you've got it pretty much indeterminate storage anyway but maybe it's
1456820	1462860	like more decorating ideas you know like you could have your storeroom on the console versions so
1462860	1471620	it's gonna come out on it looks like the 21st in North America this month it's gonna be called
1471620	1476140	pocket camp club they didn't say how much it is but if it's like the Mario Kart gold then maybe
1476220	1482540	five bucks so just thought I would mention the Animal Crossing communities I'm in are kind of
1482540	1492020	like and I'm like I'm an adult and I'm gonna pay for it it's an interesting thing they're adding
1492020	1496140	to I mean I I admit I've kind of left pocket camp behind a long time ago but I know you're still a
1496140	1499700	fan of it and obviously there's other people playing it you're not alone because people have
1499700	1506180	opinions it's mine but I'm fill in until I have to admit I'm a little surprised or launching it
1506180	1510940	now when we're what only like three months away from just hit the two-year anniversary for it I
1510940	1517580	think they're trying to find a way to keep it viable win and on top of that I'm gonna be
1517580	1522940	quitting idle pouring when my sub runs out it's like 17 bucks for three months for the SV IP
1522940	1527020	because I'm just not having fun with it anymore the only thing I'm having fun it's telling all
1527020	1533020	the people says join my guild join my guild just saying no like I've just turned into this cranky
1533020	1540220	little contrarian in chat and it's been kind of funny well see a Tiberian chat says every so
1540220	1545460	often I check my friends and I see Rob as being at level 7 I had to break it to you I uninstalled
1545460	1551820	Animal Crossing while world for my phone a long time ago now world I'm sorry Animal Crossing pocket
1552660	1558820	I uninstalled that for my phone a while ago now granted that was when I was still on my very small
1558820	1567220	what 32 gigabyte iPhone 10 179 yeah I ran out of space but now my new guy this iPhone 11 max
1567220	1574140	whatever whatever has I think a 128 in it so I have a lot more room again so maybe maybe I'll
1574140	1579780	reinstall it maybe I'll get to level eight just for you and then I'm level 179 Jesus
1580500	1585260	well they've got like all kinds of stuff since I think you played it last so there are they put
1585260	1590580	in a lot more minigames like you've got fishing tourney now and you get like items and things for
1590580	1595660	that you have like this flower thing where you catch bugs and then you can send the bugs to
1595660	1600220	other people and you get the rare flowers that way and then you get stuff for doing that like
1600220	1605020	special items and you get all kinds of like challenge tiers that you can do and then like
1605340	1609860	the scavenger hunt like every couple of months and it's actually kind of fun I mean it's just
1609860	1615940	been a little way and you can skip the freaking cut scenes like where you give people stuff and
1615940	1620140	you can actually have who's the pelican guy you can have him deliver all the shit that people
1620140	1626260	want to them so they've taken out a lot of the really annoying stuff and you get like a cabin
1626260	1630260	now that you can decorate as well so it's probably why I'd get the storeroom if it's more chance to
1630260	1636300	decorate hmm I do get the fortune cookies though because some of that shit's pretty well it's
1636300	1640900	interesting to hear about the subscription thing especially this quote-unquote late in the game
1640900	1646580	thank you see it very so all right anything else we want to touch on that may not be addressed the
1646580	1650860	show roll coming up okay if not let's move into our gaming weeks let's talk about how was your
1650860	1654860	gaming week and the types of video games that we've been playing this week our soccer oh obviously
1654860	1661820	Animal Crossing but what else um I have been a little bit of idle pouring but like if I don't
1661820	1668220	if I don't get the the rebirth because you have to like fight Osiris and I can't beat him yet I'm
1668220	1673980	just like ready to give up on that damn game but I have been doing some Apple arcade stuff I'm kind
1673980	1679980	of getting really back into pinball wizard it's like this little game where you play a guy and you
1679980	1684780	have to propel him pinball style through these levels and hit enemies they can also turn red
1684780	1690780	and attack you back and you hit barrels for like energy and treasure and life I'm reminded of like
1690780	1695620	pinball quest on the NES where it's like it's pinball but there's a purpose to it type of thing
1695620	1699900	well and your goal is to get the key that unlocks the door and sometimes you have to take the bars
1699900	1704340	off the door but you can still unlock the door when the door opens you have a countdown until
1704340	1708820	it lets you go through it and usually for me that's like more treasure more treasure because
1708820	1714540	your treasure goes back into your overall score that gives you your level and you can also go in
1714820	1718900	as you progress along with different levels you get different abilities unlocked but you can pay
1718900	1726380	for those abilities to go up like my favorite one right now because I hate when I when I drain like
1726380	1731060	I have a post that comes up that like stays up for like I have it now for like ten cycles or
1731060	1738660	something but I like the one that like when you drain it takes less energy off of you and like
1738660	1743380	there's these annoying bat creatures that you have to like hit their bombs it kicks the bombs into
1743420	1747780	them and blows them up and then you have spiders that throw webs on your on your flippers and
1747780	1752740	things like that it's kind of fun and then I've actually been playing legit pinball so we just
1752740	1760580	got Doctor Who working again today and I played some black rose the other day and I played theater
1760580	1764820	magic because that one was mine and Dan's anniversary machine and I just felt like a
1764820	1769900	little bit of the it needed some love although it's hard to play anything in the garage right
1769900	1775420	now because Dan's in the middle of rebuilding at 69 Mustang it was his first car he bought
1775420	1781500	it off the street for 1200 bucks cash and he's getting it running so that's really oh and I
1781500	1788780	picked up a thing today and I want people to guess what that thing is it could be a lot of things
1788780	1794980	star soccer you got to give us some it's a game is it bigger than a bread box no okay let's see
1795020	1803940	is it oh it's a game okay is it a Nintendo switch game it is okay oh it's in a GameStop bag okay
1803940	1811580	you know what it is it's in a non GameStop bag gifted all right there it is so she's holding up
1811580	1818060	on the stream her copy of Pokemon sword finally there you go so yeah all because of one Pokemon
1818060	1824260	really sir fetch one Pokemon sold it for you sir fetched okay should we not be giving wild animals
1824260	1830500	weapons now I mean I feel that this is a bad leak that didn't look like a leak in his mouth that
1830500	1836340	looked like he's holding a sword he's holding the leak as a sword yes I get sir fetches holding a
1836340	1843540	leak that little grooky gun meme that's a little tiny gun for those would be sword the bunny no I
1843540	1848300	don't and I'm in actually I think that you know the fact start off with whatever that fire bunny
1848300	1853100	is they score buddy yeah holding a leak is even kind of more frightening because that means he's
1853140	1858940	fashioning a shank and they'll know they're they're gonna murder you and you're I'm just glad dark
1858940	1863780	soccer has Pokemon sword because I have Pokemon shield and I feel like a lot more people like
1863780	1868020	judging my friends list like I would say like two-thirds are on shield it's it's interesting
1868020	1873300	how that seems to be the more popular I've already had a handful of people say oh get me a sir fetch
1873300	1879020	and like and change just like they're a bitch to evolve good luck because everyone wants the fancy
1879020	1885980	ponytail is what it is oh yeah ponytas only in she's gonna get me one oh oh oh oh is he if I'm
1885980	1891740	gonna get you a sir fetched fine that'll be the deal is that when we get the hardcore pokey man's
1891740	1898300	all right anything else for your gaming week um you should talk about I know you haven't been
1898300	1903660	playing it but I know you've been watching yeah okay so my whole reason for because we I knew I
1903660	1907100	was gonna eventually be picking up a game but I didn't know if I was gonna get Death Stranding or
1907100	1911780	not so it ended up just being completely impatient getting sick of people trying to
1911780	1917260	spoil shit because if someone wants to put spoil shit I'll spoil it for myself first so I watched
1917260	1921060	an entire playthrough of Death Stranding so I could skip through the walking simulator which
1921060	1926340	thank God I didn't buy it because the walking simulator part would be boring as fuck to me I'm
1926340	1931860	just I'm sorry that is I like exploring I don't like exploring when you have to fight shit like
1932340	1937460	the way that that has to happen and just the scenery was pretty but it was a little too
1937460	1943260	natural to be fun if that makes sense it's really well rendered though but I did watch the whole
1943260	1948100	thing cuz I was like what the fuck Kojima I've decided my favorite character is the bridge baby
1948100	1954180	because I want to be a bridge baby and do watch this I know you know but I do still plan to play
1954180	1959500	this like my New York trip through kind of this off and now I'm all about Pokemon shield which
1959500	1964820	I'll come back to in a little bit so I won't pick up Death Stranding until I'm secretly hoping
1964820	1968980	there'll be a Black Friday sale even though it's a black brand new game I feel like games that have
1968980	1973460	come out I've still gotten reduced and like I said I'm on I would think there's gonna be a Black
1973460	1980380	Friday sale and I'll pick up like to me it has a lot that makes me think of end of Evangelion
1980380	1986300	especially the ending which of course I'm not gonna spoil for anybody but I really did get like
1986300	1991980	a hardcore end of Evangelion vibe which I don't know the story of that so that's fine and I also
1991980	2000340	no one does no one that's watching it's more or less like the one of the overrunning themes in
2000340	2006180	the Evangelion series is how people relate to each other and contact with other people and that was a
2006180	2012260	big thing in this is the the thought of of contact with people and it's not much of a spoiler because
2012380	2019700	you find out right at the beginning but Sam the main character has almost allergic reaction when
2019700	2025900	people touch him he has a big fear of touch and one of the ongoing things in the game is how people
2025900	2031940	feel about their contact with other people you've got these different you know disparate groups all
2031940	2038100	over the the country that you're trying to unite and a lot of them don't want to unite because they
2038100	2043740	think they're safer by themselves and it's you know and keep in mind this is coming from a
2043740	2048540	Japanese writer and a big thing in Japanese society right now is that disconnection of
2048540	2055380	personal relationships and you know that goes to something we were discussing well I was gonna ask
2055380	2058380	you if I could kind of bring this up I was gonna say it's kind of a difficult question but I know
2058380	2061860	we were talking a little bit about it before the show but I was wondering if I could bring up on
2061860	2067980	the show there was a controversy on Twitter and social media going around about you know
2068500	2074660	is is there an anti asexual narrative in the game well I was and I wanted you're a pit year you're
2074660	2079500	an out asexual woman you've mentioned that on the show before I wanted to know your take you know
2079500	2082780	even though you haven't played the game you certainly familiarized yourself with the story
2082780	2087460	start to finish at this point so what's your I dug deep what what's your well what's your take
2087460	2091100	on the ace because I when I read it I was like oh shit is this gonna ruin the game for Dark Sakura
2091100	2097340	what's your take on the asexuality my narrative my thing is that first of all that it's supposed
2097340	2103700	to be one observation of a character in it who probably doesn't identify as asexual we
2103700	2108620	are kind of mythical to some people they don't really understand because a lot of people meaning
2108620	2113860	asexual people yes because a lot most people I mean we are what one to two percent of the
2113860	2118420	population we may be as much as ten percent but that hasn't been proven yet but the majority of
2118420	2123380	people have a sex drive we are really hard to understand I was gonna quickly say I bet when
2123380	2126500	you consider that it's probably more of like a spectrum and you have what do you call that
2126540	2131260	the demisexuality that's kind of like your gray ace where it's like a little bit that probably is
2131260	2138100	kind of where it comes demisexual is when you can only have an attraction to somebody when you form
2138100	2143100	an emotional connection to them okay anyway not to not to not even going into romantic spectrum
2143100	2150380	not to digress but edumacation but but you know they're saying oh we're throwing all the and I
2150380	2155500	should probably find the comment or the the thing but they're you know but a lot of people like oh
2155500	2160260	well they're you know using this as weapon against us and saying all this that we're degrading
2160260	2165580	society and all that like no no no no and keep in mind the writing of this is coming from a
2165580	2172060	Japanese writer and right now in Japanese society in America starting to have some of this go on to
2172060	2180060	you is that they are first of all having fewer dedicated relationships and a much lower birth
2180060	2187580	rate because people in general are not having sex I mean I'll just put it that way it's really low
2187580	2196260	on the societal priority level a lot more is being brought into career and education and things like
2196260	2200980	that so I just did a quick search on Twitter and I don't think this is the original tweet but
2200980	2206900	somebody on Twitter has wrote content warning ace phobia oof warning for asexual folks and anyone
2206900	2213020	really death stranding has some fucked up trash of a codex entry and it's it has a screenshot and
2213020	2218140	I'm not gonna read the whole thing but it's called an asexual world record suggests that the
2218140	2222540	widespread aversion towards physical contact and intimacy was a phenomenon that had been observed
2222540	2226780	even before the death stranding one contemporary report for example details the increasing
2226780	2231220	popularity of the sexless lifestyle among young people a growing percentage of the younger cohort
2231220	2236060	were self-identifying as asexual claiming to be incapable of feeling desire or attraction and it
2236060	2242820	goes on that's from the in-game yeah and see the thing is though is that I mean I look at it along
2242820	2248980	as like how autism is going that oh people weren't done autism before that's like well you know this
2248980	2253460	because they're finding more of us and we feel a lot more comfortable being public about those
2253460	2258500	things about ourselves you know or like oh what's all this trans business we didn't have this well
2258500	2265180	now people have a name to put on their identity it's the same thing and I think that yes it came
2265180	2273780	from a rather tone-deaf point of view and you know they also go in to talk about the quote a
2273780	2279460	measurable decrease in human fertility blah blah blah but I think it's also if you look in the
2279460	2286140	context of the universe they're living in when if you get caught in the rain you're going to age so
2286140	2292700	much that you die you know or if they're creatures out there that if they kill a living person it's
2292700	2299940	going to create a crater the size of a city block who's gonna want to breed during that kind of you
2299940	2304220	know thing people are going to be afraid they're not gonna want to bring children into a world like
2304220	2310420	that so if I'm hearing correctly like maybe if somebody just takes this screenshot and if this
2310420	2316140	shit happens a lot in our online society we live in we know this that here here in the air bar to
2316140	2322780	the chat you know 2019 but if you took that screenshot and only that screenshot in no context
2322780	2326820	you might be able to see why oh this might this seems like a little bit like it's blaming
2326820	2334220	asexuals for the game but if you consider it that like you said this is one fictional person's
2334220	2338940	observation on a greater picture and you have to understand that the greater picture is based on
2338940	2346100	a society where yes sexuality has declined for all of these other reasons as well and you know
2346100	2350060	again this game doesn't necessarily always come from an American perspective as much as just
2350060	2355700	Japanese perspective where the view on sex is very different and right now this is where Japanese
2355700	2362820	society is in general you know that there's just so I mean yeah you do still have like compensated
2362820	2368980	dating and things like that but for the most part the average person isn't going to put as much a
2368980	2375260	priority on that in favor of living sometimes a more isolated life I mean you've got the hikikomori
2375260	2380180	issue right now where people are so stressed out by the outside world and other people that they
2380180	2386580	will live in in their own homes and not emerge from it and which is actually now again starting
2386580	2393980	to happen more in America we're getting a lot more of that now I think that it's really I think that
2393980	2400340	maybe this is more of an allegory for that particular societal event that and in some
2400340	2406020	cases for people who maybe are afraid I've talked to people who are just like I'm afraid of it I'm
2406020	2410420	not ready for it so I tell people I'm ace I'm like wait you're not ace if you are clearly if
2410420	2416380	you have a drive you know that does us harm but from a person who doesn't understand a sexuality
2416380	2421940	this really isn't surprising to me and I'm not insulted okay well I'm glad I asked and thank you
2421940	2426380	for helping bring some insight to that big controversy on Twitter right now and also keep
2426380	2431140	in mind a lot of people complaining about it I'll just throw it out there they're neurotypical
2431140	2436580	and I don't take that much of an emotional look toward it for me it's a little bit more on the
2436580	2442340	base of logic so I don't have an emotional attachment to those things I just know that
2442340	2447740	those people aren't thinking clearly well my perception of what's going on I mean isn't
2447740	2452460	everything perception my perception of it all is that we are we're not considering the context of
2452460	2457580	what we're looking at in a lot of these Twitter screenshots and isn't that the way things seem
2457580	2463860	to be way too often here in this year in in this generation in fact is that there's so much that
2463860	2470420	gets posted on Facebook and it's a headline that was written to be too sensational that doesn't
2470420	2475860	really consider the context of what was going on I don't believe any story I look at unless I have
2475860	2481380	opened it up read it and add my own fucking disclaimer to it and I've posted earlier on my
2481380	2489420	Facebook today I'm like X X files the truth is out there and I believe nothing so everyone I'm
2489420	2494020	gonna tell you this right now check two things when people post shit check the site it comes
2494020	2501700	from like if it's realhealthnews.com it's about detoxing it's probably fake as fuck check the
2501700	2509300	dates on your articles to check if they're cited check their sources be you have to do your due
2509300	2515260	diligence when you read any of this I really wish Facebook would integrate the date of the article
2515260	2521580	I'm getting off of Facebook anyway one way or another diversion but so back to Death Stranding
2521580	2528060	so my consensus my feeling of what you're saying about it is the game part of it but the story part
2528060	2533300	of it pretty interesting well and the other thing too is that as these people become more connected
2533300	2538060	it brings its own danger with it so and I'm not starting out getting into the spoilers on that
2538060	2543980	but that is also showing you that there are pluses and minuses to everything the fears that people
2543980	2550620	have and I really do think that it's just a really good corollary for a lot of things happening in
2550620	2554660	the world right now and the nature of interpersonal relationships and how we deal with our communities
2554660	2560900	it really is a great commentary I fucking love the story and I wanted to punch a few people in
2560900	2568020	the face and Conan O'Brien one of them his character is so fucking stupid and I hate Conan
2568020	2572860	O'Brien okay I don't think he's funny and his character was even less funny except I totally
2572860	2580380	won an otter hat so someone was to get me an otter hat you can get one I'll give you my address but
2580380	2589260	but it really was a great just correlation to a lot of things the world are in and from someone
2589260	2595500	who had I started off I did take a lot of psychology classes deciding if I wanted to be
2595500	2600620	a major or not and it really did just spike a lot of the stuff I remember from school well and I'm
2600620	2605420	very fascinated your your review has piqued my interest even more like I thought originally it
2605420	2611620	would be a hate play of Kojima's you know art fuck project but I will tell you that the true ending
2611620	2616760	though it's long it's metal it's metal gear solid for long is it true it's a two-hour cutscene at
2616760	2623240	the end fuck something like that but it was one of the scenes where I wanted to punch somebody
2623240	2628440	huh and the one thing I like about the true ending is that all of these little flashbacks you get
2628440	2633240	through the game it puts them into context yeah one thing I've been hearing pretty consistently
2633240	2640880	about the game is that once you beat it it makes sense that it's not like it's not that vague or
2640880	2646080	whatever like like the build-up to the game has been it's really good at the foreshadowing and
2646080	2651860	redirection I'm not gonna say necessarily misdirection because it's kind of guiding you
2651860	2657880	in the right way but it shifts gears to where you thought it was heading one way a little bit of
2657880	2662120	miss and redirection all right all right well let's stop there before we even and that's my
2662120	2667760	non-spoiler spoilery psychiatric review of Death Stranding well now I have to make a game called
2667760	2675520	hate play art fuck project that's just a great name can we put that on the YY our request no
2676160	2682200	Loki's gonna do it I just have to get something really artsy and out there I just my head isn't
2682200	2686560	up my own ass enough to be able to like put something out like that yes just just pick
2686560	2690880	like an art period like distill or the Bauhaus movement and you've got something to go from
2690880	2696960	because sometimes distill and Bauhaus we're kind of up there and asked you all right art found up
2696960	2704640	my own ass by Loki all right Loki how is your gaming week I played a lot of minecraft dirt
2704640	2710480	because that launched this week so it's the new AR game yay okay great you can tell me what the
2710480	2714960	fuck it is because I've tried playing it and but to be fair I've been sick all week so I haven't
2714960	2718800	really left the house a lot you know some for work for a couple days so I've been able to do is tap
2718800	2724320	stuff on the house I'm like yay I got bricks yay so what what's the game so basically there's not
2724320	2730320	much of a game there yet so it's just like Pokemon there's not a whole lot of but there's very much
2730320	2738640	a game in Pokemon Pokemon go not so much but collecting them all yeah so you just you go around
2738640	2744640	which is kind of nice they have like they don't have so you play the game what you have is
2744640	2749840	tappable so they're when you pull it up there's like your map which you see your streets around
2749840	2753760	you and everything and there's stuff that you can tap on the map to get things so they have like
2753760	2761760	rock or you know it's like stone grass trees there's cows pigs and sheep and so you can tap
2761760	2766960	on those and you get them and it adds it to your inventory and then you build up your inventory
2766960	2772080	and then they have these base plates you can use to actually go kind of build something it's sort
2772080	2777600	of like creative mode and you build it and then using the AR thing so you actually like kind of
2777600	2783600	project it onto the floor when it works because I was trying to do it here in the studio and mine
2783600	2789840	kept sinking into the floor so you project it and you build it on it and stuff and then you can go
2789840	2794880	into like a play mode and actually like actually play with legit Minecraft but it's really small
2794880	2800320	it's like 16 by or at the most 16 by 16 the ones you start off with are eight by eight and so most
2800320	2805040	of the stuff that you're doing in the game it feels like you're kind of looking into a hole
2805040	2809440	because that's kind of what it is so like they have these adventures that you go on
2809440	2816320	so you'll see these lights that are in parks and it's not like pokemon go where they have specific
2816320	2821920	points that they spawn in it's basically an area of the map that it's the deemed there's a park
2821920	2826160	and they'll spawn randomly in there and they'll shuffle around every once in a while and move
2826160	2831200	to different parts of the park and so like the park near me I have like three of them that just
2831200	2838160	shuffle around um over by the river there's like a fucking ton of them just like crazy amounts of
2838160	2844240	those things but they're not all that diverse so each one you when you go on an adventure that's
2844240	2851360	such an elaborate way to put it it's basically just a small section of Minecraft so you can go
2851360	2856320	in there you actually have to have a pickaxe and sword and stuff and you dig out blocks and the
2856320	2861680	blocks that are in there are sometimes different than what you can find normally in your tappables
2861680	2868560	like for example that's the only way you can get coal which is kind of annoying um so you go there
2868560	2873680	and then you can fight mobs sometimes and really like for the adventures for me it's collect as many
2873680	2879600	um blocks as I can before I get bum rushed by skeletons for no fucking reason is what it is
2879600	2884320	because you'll be like digging into the ground and really all it is is it's a hole so you're digging
2884320	2889600	down and you've got your eight by eight section and then for no reason there's skeletons coming
2889600	2894000	to me at the side even though it's daylight out and they should be burning in the sun Minecraft
2894000	2900560	rules um but I'm getting bum rushed by them so then I have to kill them and do all that if you die
2900560	2907120	in adventure mode you lose all your blocks that you had yikes well just in your like so you start
2907120	2913680	off you have like a one line you're like in Minecraft you have like a row of items that you
2913680	2918880	normally have without going into like your inventory so that row of items you lose that
2918880	2923520	and then any blocks you picked up in the adventure mode you lose that so what I tend to do is like if
2923520	2927840	I see myself getting low on health exit out you take everything with you then you can go back in
2927840	2931280	there if you want and if you dive and who cares so now but you you were saying something about
2931280	2936800	the creations don't really save where other people yeah so like I can't draw a big dick in somebody
2936800	2942800	that not that I've found so like right now like you can build your base plates and stuff and you
2942800	2948640	can you can put them down and then I think there's a way that you can sync it so that other people
2948640	2954000	can actually see it as well but you have to like scan something on their phone in order to do that
2954000	2959440	it's not like I can just go to your park or go to a park and build something and it's there for
2959440	2963600	anybody to see as far as I'm aware because I could see where people would be complete
2963600	2967760	douche bags about like building you know bags of dicks and things on people's houses
2968320	2973120	so yeah so you have to like willingly share that and receive that from somebody in order to be
2973120	2977840	able to see right so they've got yeah because they have like a join a friend mode and you have to
2977840	2983040	like you have like a space or whatever that you can scan a qr code it looks like and then they've
2983040	2988560	got um you can do crafting in the game because it is minecraft so you have a crafting table and a
2988560	2993520	smelter and you can you don't really eat so here's the weird thing so like I can in the adventure
2993520	2998320	mode I can kill sheep and uh cows like you would expect and you get meat from them but normally
2998320	3003920	you would cook the meat and eat it and use it for like regain your health you can't do anything with
3003920	3011200	it like I have meat I can't put it in the smelter uh which is your oven I can't use it to cook it
3011200	3015200	I can't eat it to regain my health in like adventure modes I don't know what the point
3015200	3018880	of the game is like really rough around the edge it is really rough around the edges it's but it
3018880	3025920	is early access it yeah say the tutorial kind of stinks the tutorial stinks um uh you basically
3025920	3029840	most of the leveling up of the game is just tapables just tap stuff and you'll go up I'm
3029840	3035040	already level 12 and the adventure mode doesn't really give you that much in the way of um
3035040	3040240	experience it's more of just here's a way to get like blocks I can get steel from there um
3042000	3047120	and I don't know it's it's all right so one thing you know there's several things that are wrong
3047120	3052560	with it right now one it has a really hard time tracking where you are like it that GPS tracking
3052560	3057200	it especially when I get near the river and I don't know why it's just that corridor between
3057200	3063120	highway 50 and in the American river there it's just jumping like a mile away and back just going
3063120	3068480	like all of our coverage is not great with all the wildlife out there I just don't know it just
3068480	3073600	it cannot track me or like if I'm at my work it's jumping across the street and coming back it's
3073600	3078080	just don't you work in a tall building I'm talking about outside in the parking lot like where the
3078080	3084400	like it should be able to read my GPS in the middle of you know open space at my work like
3084400	3089360	even though I work on the first floor of a three-story building like my GPS always puts me
3089360	3093840	but I mean it puts me right on top of a pokey stop but it's the pokey stop that's like across
3093840	3098640	the parking lot at the little stand where you can get sandwiches like clear across the lot even
3098640	3103600	though that's nowhere near where my desk actually is so um yeah so I mean basically you get like
3103600	3109680	tappables and then um they have like daily challenges that you can do and you get experience
3109680	3113600	that way which is another good way to do it um you get experience I see you're tapping shit on
3113600	3117280	my house right now yeah so it's just like cobblestone like I have so much cobblestone
3117280	3121920	and everything like I have there's no limit to what you can carry no that's nice there's no good
3121920	3126080	limit on the inventory about Harry Potter so like of course you want to know like it's a free to
3126080	3132240	play game so where the microtransactions um not very many actually so what they've got is you can
3132240	3137920	you earn um rubies as you're playing the game and the rubies can be used for a couple things
3137920	3142880	you can use them to buy additional base plates so you can have more base plates and the base plates
3142880	3146880	come with things on them already like it's already like a pre-designed thing so what I tend to do
3146880	3151680	with the base plates is just clear them out and take all the things from them um you can see you
3151680	3157440	can buy new base plates you can use it to speed up the time it takes to craft things because it
3157440	3161680	does take time to craft stuff in here so if like I want to make a pickaxe it's gonna take like
3161680	3165680	five minutes to do that so if I were a typical mobile game trope right so if I want to speed
3165680	3171520	it up I can just you know tap it in it it's one rupee per minute um but you earn them so often
3171520	3176560	like I have over a hundred of them right now and I haven't bought anything so you have that and then
3176560	3182640	they also have like um with the s2100 mats like this discussion killed chat apparently chat does
3182640	3187360	not give a shit about minecraft earth I don't know I think it's interesting um see minecraft's only
3187360	3191760	like the biggest game to come out in the last 15 years so you can create your own skins and stuff
3191760	3195040	in there and then they have like you can do customization with the skins like they have
3195040	3200000	outfits that you can buy you can spend money on whatever they're like gold or whatever but the
3200000	3204000	outfits kind of suck I don't know but it's really access you're gonna spend money on it yeah exactly
3204000	3209440	so it's that's kind of what they have so far let me let me ask this to sum it up is there potential
3209440	3214000	here yes absolutely I think so like I want to see how like because before they made it sound like
3214000	3218960	oh you can go to the park and you can see you know someone's creation stuff and it's actually
3218960	3223360	kind of cool like actually when it is bright and you're out like a park or something like that it
3223360	3229200	does track pretty well like you can I was playing it earlier today and I'm sure it looks stupid but
3229200	3233840	like it works like you can walk around and like have strangers coming up to you going are you
3233840	3238000	playing the poke no no no one came up to me because they they because they do that to me
3238000	3242960	when I'm playing Ingress are you no but like I like so for me like I had because I'm looking
3242960	3246800	up and down so I have my phone like this or I'm like looking down at the ground and stuff like
3246800	3252480	that and like I'm like dodging stuff so it looks a little weird but it's it's fun it's the only
3253040	3258160	and because it is early access it eats your battery like nothing and it makes your phone
3258160	3264080	super hot so that's the only uh downside is it will eat your battery it gets all toasty like
3264080	3269520	early AR games will do yes as as early AR games do so um yeah definitely we're checking out if
3269520	3275360	you haven't yet and it's it's fun so it is one of those games you can actually probably play it on
3275360	3280240	your house just without going anywhere because stuff keeps respawning there and you can tap away
3280240	3286400	and get all sorts of stuff um so aside from Minecraft Earth I played a little bit of Pokemon
3286400	3293680	Go and I played more What the Golf so I've been going through that and what else working on my
3293680	3300880	game and that's about it all right uh my gaming week so I guess I've also been AR gaming and
3300880	3304640	the good old Ingress has double AP right now so I've been trying to play that but it's
3304640	3309200	it's hard because I've been getting over this cold um but I still I still did some walking
3309200	3313760	around to the local park just you know smashing what the opponents did and building my own thing
3313760	3318240	and pretty much it's pretty much sanctioned when trading at this point but whatever I'm getting the
3318240	3324720	double AP uh so that's nice and then I've been playing Pokemon Go I did community day uh I caught
3324720	3330800	three shiny Chimchars more importantly I caught two of the bong weasings uh which are uh the Galar
3330800	3336080	region one they look like big bongs so that was fun big bongs they did what will you trade me
3336080	3341920	uh I can try I don't know if those are tradable they should be I can trade one yeah um so I caught
3342000	3347840	those and then um yeah that was fun um and then uh Harry Potter I played a little bit today because
3347840	3351680	there's a community day in Harry Potter but all I did was I walked to the park that's like right
3351680	3355280	here because it was all fortress battle stuff so I just did like four battles in the fortress I was
3355280	3360000	like okay I'm done bye and that was that was my Harry Potter community day um so still still
3360000	3364080	staying on the up and up on the AR games so there is that um but I'm playing of course lots of
3364080	3368720	traditional games as well I mentioned Bloodstained earlier in the show um still making my way slowly
3368720	3372720	through that I just beat what I think is the third boss um so just making my way through
3372720	3379440	that game still it's it's good times um and still been playing Final Fantasy 14 my machinist finally
3379440	3385120	hit level 80 so I now have a healer a tank and a dps all at level 80 so I can do whatever I want
3385120	3393760	in the different uh end game content and I've been playing a lot this weekend of Pokemon Shield
3394000	3399600	I got the digital copy that unlocked on Thursday night and I started playing I think my playtime
3399600	3404560	count says it's like at eight or nine hours that seems like a lot when you consider I only have two
3404560	3411280	badges but it does take a long time to get to the first gym um so I'm I'm enjoying the game so far
3411280	3418000	uh it's interesting how it throws you into that wild zone pretty early on so the wild zone is
3418000	3423520	like a very large open map like a very probably the largest map that's been in a Pokemon thing
3423520	3427600	and because it's on the switch on a newer system you can kind of see clear across this map you know
3427600	3432080	when you're standing on one side of it so you can see where all the tall grass is and you know you
3432080	3436000	can see Pokemon on the map now so you kind of have an idea what you're going to run into and catch
3436000	3440400	although there will sometimes still just be little rustles that exclamation points and you won't know
3440400	3444640	what that is until you run into them so of course some of the really good stuff is hidden so you
3444640	3448880	have to kind of you know take your chances and so forth um but I thought it was very interesting
3448880	3455040	that it's so open before you get to the first gym I mean you can amass easily a Pokédex of
3455040	3459040	probably if I'd really spent time on it and like done more of the Dynamax raids and stuff which
3459040	3462640	I'll get into in a minute I probably could have had a Pokédex of 50 or 60 if not more
3462640	3467040	like before I even took on the first gym um whereas you know in the early games it's like
3467040	3474240	what okay I caught a Pidgey a Rattata and a Nido Nido male and a Nido female and now I got to go
3474640	3479920	and a Caterpie and I gotta go take on uh you know Brock you know that your choices are pretty
3479920	3484240	limited from the early routes so it's kind of interesting it's interesting especially when a
3484240	3489200	lot of the dialogue about this game has been about the removal of Pokémon and stuff it is interesting
3489200	3495360	how plentiful the Pokémon seem in these early stages of the game and you know to address that
3495360	3500000	controversy a little bit like you know sure I was a little bit sad to hear that some of the
3500000	3504160	starters including you know Litten from the last generation stuff some ones I really like
3504160	3508880	aren't in it but at the same time you know there are like 400 Pokémon that are in it
3508880	3513600	and I'm still having enough of a like discovery mode thing where I run into these Pokémon and go
3513600	3520480	oh this guy and I'm not the hardcore Pokémon fan that some of you are you know or Shane is or
3520480	3525040	something like that but I do play quite a bit of Pokémon Go so there's a lot of Pokémon that I'll
3525040	3529600	go like oh it's one of those guys it's the little shell guy from Pokémon Go or oh it's a Hoothoot
3530240	3536960	those are trash in Pokémon Go you know like I'll recognize I'll recognize excuse me I'll recognize
3536960	3541680	stuff from Pokémon Go and I think that's kind of fun so you know even though there's a lot of stuff
3541680	3546000	missing sure there's a lot of stuff that's still there and it's enough to make me go oh it's that
3546000	3551040	guy oh it's this guy oh fun oh I think what's really interesting about this game though are
3551040	3556560	the Dynamax raids so you can actually so in the wild area you'll see these big beams of light
3556560	3562560	and if you walk up to them you can initiate a raid so it's kind of like Pokémon Go in a way
3562560	3566480	but more the more strategic it's not just tapping as fast as you can it's like an actual Pokémon
3566480	3573040	battle that's four versus one um so you and three friends take on a Pokémon or if you're like
3573040	3577840	fuck friends I don't want to play games with other people you can just take three NPCs in with you
3577840	3581920	and do it or you can do a combination you have one friend they need to have two NPCs whatever
3581920	3587120	and you can do these raids and um when you're connected to the internet playing the game
3587120	3591520	you can see when other people are about to start raids and join their raid which I think is really
3591520	3597200	cool so like the first time so like the other raids the Pokémon are larger than normal oh
3597200	3602640	yeah they're gigantic and then you beat it and then you have a chance to catch it so like I've
3602640	3606720	done a bunch of one star raids I've done a couple of the two stars I've usually had no problem
3606720	3612400	catching and I did a three star raid today for the first time and we beat it it was fine but I
3612400	3615840	didn't catch it I threw a great ball at it and I still didn't catch it so catching it's not
3615840	3621520	guaranteed you get like one shot and that's it so um and it's just it's luck it's big stupid luck
3621520	3625760	like these games usually are it's that little I can't remember the name of this Pokémon it's that
3625760	3633280	water Pokémon that has a butthole for a mouth that's what it is that's what it's there's little
3633280	3637360	water Pokémon with a little butthole for a mouth that's what it is and I didn't catch it
3637360	3643520	it ran away for whatever reason so oh yes reverse bidet that's right yes reverse bidet
3645600	3649920	ran away damn it reversed bidet ran away
3652320	3658000	so yeah but um so I'm through the second gym right now and um yeah on my way to the third
3658000	3662320	gym and I'm enjoying the game it's you know I don't usually beat Pokémon games because
3662320	3666720	I'll go oh shiny and something else takes my interest or I'm like this takes too long to get
3666720	3671440	from here to here but um I'm enjoying this one well enough and yeah I like that I think the
3671440	3676560	other thing that I like too is that when I do the raids you get experience candy so that helps you
3676560	3680880	level your Pokémon so it's like you don't have to sit there and just grind regular Pokémon battles
3680880	3685920	as someone who hasn't played the mainline Pokémon games does this have enough of a tutorial in it
3685920	3690000	where like I'm gonna know what I'm doing or is it more of like you probably should have played some
3690000	3694640	Pokémon games it's kind of the same tutorial all the other games have where it's like it walks you
3694640	3700480	through oh you here I'll help you catch a Pokémon so first you want to weaken it then you throw a
3700480	3706480	ball at it kind of walks you through those types of things I mean it is for kids so it's Nintendo
3706480	3712160	kids could probably understand it Loki I don't know if you can but I think I think yeah probably
3712160	3717520	be into it it's fun maybe yeah so um yeah I'm enjoying it enough uh the only thing I could
3717520	3721280	really read it on uh if I had to go into like the negative actually wait no there's one more
3721280	3725440	positive I actually want to say um it's not a thing that usually gets committed in games but
3725440	3730000	I think the music in particular is worth calling out like especially when you're doing the gym
3730000	3735680	battles like the big like battle like when you fight like Milo the the grass gym leader the the
3735680	3739600	water gym leader when you're Nessa I think her name is when you're fighting them like the gym
3739600	3745120	battle music's like really good so like a lot of the music in the game is really good okay so I
3745120	3749280	guess I should say something negative it's not a perfect game uh the one thing I could probably
3749280	3754320	read it on is that it it kind of has some performance issues uh when you're in the wild
3754320	3760000	area and I think just because it is a Nintendo switch um a Nintendo switch can't do you know the
3760000	3765360	same type of power that the other consoles can do and when you are connected and online like what
3765360	3770400	happens is that your wild area will get populated with other players will show up and like give you
3770400	3775920	gifts and things like that but like they just like pop in on top of you right next to you like
3775920	3782480	halfway running and it's kind of jank like it's not very flattering to the get like it's almost
3782480	3787120	better to just take it offline and then the performance issues aren't nearly as bad so
3787120	3791120	that's the one thing I could probably read it on is that performance issues when you're connected
3791120	3795680	in the wild although I do love the idea of the Ycom and being able to join in raids and stuff
3795680	3801520	like it does it it kind of chokes when you're in the wild area um but I guess it's an optional
3801520	3808400	thing or what have you so all right oh Shane says you can skip those tutorials if you want
3808400	3812640	he's in the chat saying that you can skip those tutorials that's true I do remember you get
3812640	3818400	dialogue choices and it'll say like tell me more or I know you know so you can kind of choose if
3818400	3825040	the game's gonna hand hold you a little bit or or not so all right um that's it for my gaming week
3825040	3830000	I think I've said said plenty so let's move on we're gonna get into some news here and talk about
3830000	3835120	what's going on in the gaming world and we'll start off with uh Loki let's talk about Google
3835120	3845760	Stadia so Google Stadia is uh launching pretty soon actually this week so uh November 19th
3845760	3850800	it's gonna be launching but it's gonna be missing some of the features that they talked about
3850800	3857440	originally at um when they were announcing it so some of the things that are missing stream connect
3857440	3864000	uh state share and crowd play uh the features that allow you to join in other people's games
3864000	3870080	um or I believe that you can connect to games through like YouTube when they were gonna have
3870080	3877600	that link or whatever um that is not coming it's supposed to be out um they said expect the first
3877600	3882560	game of streaming connect to launch by the end of the year now this may change too because we
3882560	3886880	just had a late breaking announcement with uh Stadia as well so I'll get into that just say
3887520	3892960	um their achievement system not going to be coming right away uh the ability to use the
3892960	3902240	chromecast ultras uh to play games not launching with that um apparently family sharing is not
3902240	3907600	going to happen if you want to play if you're uh you're if you're a parent and your kids have
3907600	3913520	access to different accounts you're gonna buy the game separately for them um right now so
3913520	3919680	Google Stadia is about as finished as Minecraft Earth yes actually Minecraft is probably further
3919680	3923680	along uh the buddy passes that you apparently agree with the founders edition so if you bought
3923680	3929040	the founders edition you get like a three month pass um those will be coming out later um you're
3929040	3934800	gonna get emailed those later uh the stadia controller uh apparently even though people
3934800	3939920	have pre-ordered the stadia will get their codes assigned to the service um starting November 19th
3940480	3946000	will be able to play on their phones and chrome browsers apparently uh some of the packages
3946000	3951040	contain the controllers and chromecast have staggered shipping and those may not make launch
3952000	3962000	whoops so uh what are the games gonna be at launch originally there was um gonna be just
3962560	3967600	a total of 12 games at launch and that kind of sucked oh is this our late like breaking news
3967600	3973200	this is our late breaking news okay is not 12 anymore is now gonna be 22 games oh they added
3973200	3980640	10 more games so the day one games now that are gonna or i'm sorry it's yeah that's only 15
3980640	3986240	though that i see okay well let's see if i can put together the list here so originally uh the
3986240	3993920	games that would be coming so assassin's creed odyssey attack on titan 2 final battle uh they
3993920	4002720	said a ghost recon breakpoint uh let's see here their destiny 2 was gonna be one of the ones that
4002720	4007680	had with stadia pro that was gonna be uh launching there some of the other games that are gonna be
4007680	4011360	coming because destiny 2 is the only one you get on the house like yeah that's people have
4011360	4017680	to remember this is not xbox game pass yeah this is a virtual console meaning you're still buying
4017680	4022800	games for said virtual console yeah some of the other games um coming farming simulator 2019
4022800	4031200	final fantasy 15 football manager 2020 grid 2019 uh guilt just dance 2020 kine metro exodus mortal
4031280	4039120	combat 11 nba 2k 20 rage 2 rise of the tomb raider um i believe there's more the two more
4039120	4044160	tomb raider games that were in there as well there's more stuff on this shadow tomb raider um
4044880	4049040	it just dance wasn't on the original list yeah that was it was on the list but it was one of
4049040	4053600	the games that was coming later this year or possibly early next year it wasn't one that was
4053600	4061200	necessarily um at launch um let's see what else was there here i hate how we do this so yeah
4061200	4066400	destiny 2 um guilt was going to be a game that's going to be exclusive to them i think just dance
4066400	4074240	2020 was actually on the original list kine uh red dead redemption 2 oh uh was one a thumper
4075280	4079840	and then of course tomb raider definitive edition rise of the tomb raider and shadow of the tomb
4079840	4086400	raider definitive edition and samurai showdown i think that's about all of them but well i can't
4086400	4092400	wait to hear what other people think about stadia i just it's a lot of games that are already out
4093200	4099680	on other systems but i don't know so i think it's going to be more interesting when like
4100320	4106000	anybody can just fire up a chrome browser and try it like i think that's going to be make a
4106000	4110000	more compelling case for it because right now it just seems like everything's really like
4110000	4115280	bare bones like like they might have rushed it a little bit you know it's funny because there's
4115280	4119440	a lot of talk in chat and i've heard the same stuff online about are the new pokemon games
4120000	4124480	rushed and i don't know but this stadia thing i mean like you want to talk about something
4124480	4128800	that really feels like it's rushed this stadia launch is like especially when you hear everything
4128800	4133760	that's not really going to be there and games are being added and you know changed as we're coming
4133760	4138720	up on the day like it seems like it's really rushed what's going on over here so it doesn't
4138720	4144960	sound like a really interesting prospect at all because it's like i i it's not like i i get it
4144960	4149600	like if if i didn't have a game console or something i might be interested in it but like
4150800	4157440	like at this point like even like say let's say for example i get i i wanted to buy the stadia
4157440	4161760	thing in you know with the controller which is like 100 some dollars like if you want to buy that
4162720	4168080	founders edition or whatever i mean you could buy a used console nowadays like and i'm sure
4168080	4174640	you can get xbox one um or even xbox one x for relatively cheap probably like two or three hundred
4174640	4180560	dollars and you know you get games passed and then you have access to probably all these games
4180560	4186080	and more like for probably cheaper plus than you downloading stuff instead of actually having this
4186080	4191280	streaming all the time which is eating up your bandwidth caps because like i you know what
4191360	4196000	their solution was and they had a comment their solution for the bandwidth caps well you see
4196560	4201440	the isps are going to see that these that this streaming service is popular and they're just
4201440	4205440	going to be generous and raise those bandwidth caps because people are using the service more
4205440	4210240	i'm like what fucking universe are you on because this is not how anything works well
4210240	4214560	actually i'm going to give that guy the benefit of the doubt i don't think he i don't think that's
4214560	4220800	the right way to phrase it but i think it's if the consumer demand is there enough especially
4220880	4226560	in places where markets can be competitive the unfortunate thing is most of us live in places
4226560	4231120	where there's only one option but especially in those competitive markets you know if that's going
4231120	4235440	to sway people's decision as to what internet service provider they have and the demand is
4235440	4241040	there for it eventually it will raise and here's here's the thing so one thing we haven't talked
4241040	4245040	about tonight because it's technically not gaming but i'm sure a lot of people have it on their mind
4245040	4250000	that disney plunge plus launched this week right yeah and so disney plus is relatively cheap because
4250720	4254720	you all know what they're doing right there it's a cheap price get you hooked for the first
4254720	4258960	what is it three years right that they're giving it and then they're going to jack that price up
4258960	4264000	after three years watch uh once everybody's hooked on it and they've they've beaten the crap out of
4264000	4269360	their competitors and so forth but anyway i digress my point is you can watch the star wars
4269360	4276240	movies in 4k for 6.99 a month now most people don't have that 4k streaming because you have
4276240	4280720	to pay extra for it on netflix and i don't know what the other guys are doing but let's be real
4280720	4284720	like the king of streaming right now has been historically netflix it's going to be interesting
4284720	4288480	to see what disney plus does to that equation but there's going to be a shit ton of people that are
4288480	4292400	streaming 4k movies this month because there's going to be people with that disney plus because
4292400	4297200	it's dirt fucking cheap how many families do you think are going to have a star wars marathon in
4297200	4302480	4k after thanksgiving think about it after thanksgiving after thanks already started yeah
4302480	4307520	see so there's gonna be families that are like we're gonna watch all seven movies i finally got
4307520	4314800	my kids to watch star wars movies so but are you watching it in 4k probably so it's an hdr what do
4314800	4321840	you think that's doing your bandwidth so my my point is people like this between disney plus
4321840	4327840	and stadia and all this shit like this conversation with isps and bandwidth is going to happen sooner
4327840	4332880	rather than later i'm going to point out that i can watch the unedited beautiful original versions
4332880	4338320	that only have the touch-ups um on my laserdisc player just saying you know what i have to say
4338320	4345840	about that mclunky but i don't have to deal with what's-his-face as anakin i'm just gonna say
4345840	4352320	though like fucking like i don't want to turn this into the disney plus podcast but watching tron from
4352320	4359760	1982 in fucking high definition 60 frames a second was fucking sexy like and i know you did
4359760	4364240	this too dar sakra but tron was the first thing i watched tron was the first thing i watched you
4364240	4369920	know what the second thing i watched was tron legacy no sister act that's what that's what my
4369920	4374160	wife's making us watch next week i will point out the first thing we actually watched was the
4374160	4378800	mandalorian but the next thing i watched after that was tron and then tron legacy and then dan
4378880	4382320	wanted to watch the love bug you know what i'm gonna go on record you can quote me on this
4382320	4387120	fuck the mandalorian you know why because apparently disney plus is getting sister act three
4387120	4394080	that mandalorian what seriously this is this is huge news apparently script writers have been
4394080	4398960	hired and uh there's this whole thing going on whoopi goldberg she's playing uh deloris uh i
4398960	4406000	almost said deloris clayborn no deloris van cottier she's playing that on the west end
4406080	4410720	production with jennifer Saunders from absolutely fabulous playing mother superior which i would
4410720	4414960	i would die to see that production i really would but anyway um and apparently all this
4414960	4419280	is bringing awareness back to sister act so that disney will go forward with sister act three
4419280	4422800	which is supposed to be a disney plus thing oh that'll be amazing i know anyway sorry
4422800	4426240	where were we i was just we were just talking about the last night why isn't there a third one
4426240	4433200	yet well well wait disney plus is gonna make all our dreams come true hopefully i would be here
4433200	4436720	you know what when i was watching sister act all i could think was like
4437280	4441440	there really needs to be a remake of this movie starring bob the drag queen
4441440	4448640	am i right dark sakura like yeah like bob the drag queen as deloris van cartier would be or even
4448640	4456320	even if it was like like like the the you have to be bob or monae oh i think i think it's i think
4456320	4460560	bob would be i think bob the drag queen is the superior pick over any rupaul striker screen but
4460560	4465920	maybe that would be the gag is that instead of a nightclub singer it is a drag performer and bob
4465920	4471760	plays you know both you know male bob and female bob so i i would love that i'd watch that would
4471760	4481520	you yeah okay hello disney hey disney hello hello hello straight guy said he would watch sister act
4481520	4487520	with bob the drag queen do you do you understand what's happening here on this day make it happen
4488400	4492800	do the thing do the thing anyway that's the only remake in history i would support
4493360	4498960	anyway where were we oh yeah google stadia yeah well anyway yeah everything goes to drag queens
4498960	4505040	rob how long how long before that crashes and burns i mean really um because i think if anything
4505040	4510080	like microsoft their offerings that they have with x cloud is far superior than what you're gonna get
4510080	4513600	with stadia because eventually with the x cloud stuff we're talking like games pass is going to
4513600	4518080	be supported on that then who the fuck cares about stadia at that point i don't think this
4518080	4524320	year is going to matter for stadia it's going to matter most when google flips that switch where
4524320	4529520	they say anybody with a chrome browser whether that be your shitty little chrome book whether
4529520	4536400	that be a phone now google stadia is something for you to try and we have this limited destiny
4536400	4541680	2 experience for free for everybody to try to see what this is all about that's the moment that's
4541680	4548160	going to break google stadia this year i kind of think is a giant beta test that's what it feels
4548160	4553520	like to me anyway so anyhow but we'll see bobby blackwolf's actually getting one he's hoping he
4553520	4557520	has one before his next show so we can talk about it a little more on the show so and i know there's
4557520	4562000	some google stadia centered podcast out there so i'm curious to hear what what folks have to say
4562000	4567760	about it but i'm just i've got other games to play right now i'll let y'all beta test it and tell me
4567760	4572320	how it is and then i'm gonna wait for them to unleash it for you know where i don't have to
4572320	4577040	drop drop 100 bucks or whatever it is up front i can just because i do have a shitty little chrome
4577040	4581840	book and if the stadia thing works well and i do more business traveling maybe it would give me
4581840	4585440	incentive to take my chrome book with me when i travel if i could actually play decent video games
4585440	4591440	when i travel so i'm i'm open to it let's let's see it all right moving on let's get to our next
4591440	4596400	story which has to do oh so we're kind of back on pokemon a little bit because there's been a lot of
4596400	4602320	twitter outrage you don't say there was this hashtag going around all of twitter that was
4602320	4608880	hashtag game freak lied and uh of course in response there's a hashtag thank you game freak
4608880	4615840	as well but why were people angry about pokemon and game freak lied well because apparently um
4616480	4622720	one of the examples given was that there was a wireframe bulbasaur from sword and shield which
4622720	4626960	is weird to me because fucking bulbasaur isn't in sword and shield bulbasaur is one of the pokemon
4626960	4631440	that was cut so i don't know if they dug it out of the files or what but anyway there's a wireframe
4631440	4635760	from bulbasaur from sword and shield and apparently it's the same wireframe from sun and moon
4635760	4642160	gasp but then this 3d artist on twitter actually starts to disseminate why it doesn't fucking
4642160	4646240	matter what it because it does there are differences and she kind of breaks down like
4646240	4650320	what's going on and that you could actually take the wireframe from pokemon quest for mobile phone
4650320	4657360	games it would be the same as what you see in any of the other pokemon uh games um it's not the
4657360	4662960	wire for it's on the model that they're changing its textures on top of it so so fans i'm using
4662960	4667120	that loosely because i think if you're if you're going so far as to send death threats to the
4667120	4672960	developer which please just stop doing that when is ever a death threat against a developer gotten
4672960	4677600	something positive from me i would hope the listeners of this show aren't the ones participating
4677600	4682640	in that i'd like to think they are so i don't think we need to lecture you guys on that but uh
4682640	4687520	you know the those folks apparently are mad because they were told that assets would not
4687520	4692880	be reused and then they were reused if you want to see a lot of like the complaining go to the
4692880	4700080	pokemon reddit there's a dude on the pokemon reddit who every day is doing one family of
4700080	4706240	pokemon that was put down or that was will no longer be seen it's so fucking dramatic and like
4706240	4711760	pokemon sword and shield and i'm just kind of like okay look i understand where people were
4711760	4717360	frustrated with the dex cuts even at first i was very much like well i mean pokemon does say gotta
4717360	4721280	catch them all and you're not gonna really be able to catch them all in this game but you know now
4721280	4727440	that i've like actually played the game i'm kind of like there's enough to see and do you know it's
4727440	4732720	it's gonna be fine maybe they'll just add them in later on i i don't think they will i mean they're
4732720	4737440	i think at this point because of all the the belly aching and stuff going on i think in the
4737440	4742560	next pokemon game gen 9 or whatever i think they're gonna go back but i mean pokemon gen
4742560	4746160	9 is probably not gonna happen till like 2026 at this point because it's gonna take them so
4746160	4753040	long to put in all those other pokemon i don't i don't know anyway so there's this big hashtag that
4753040	4757840	was going around on it and a lot of it had to do with the model remake and that whole thing but
4758640	4765440	again but dex it as they're calling it was a big part of that as well i just i don't know like
4765440	4771280	now that i've played the game i'm like whatever it's fine like it's not the end of the world in
4771280	4777040	fact it's a pretty decent pokemon game and if you think about it like when you played pokemon gen 2
4777040	4782400	you didn't unlock the gen 1 pokemon until after you beat the game and there's a lot of pokemon
4782400	4786640	games that have had more like limited things where all the pokemon are kind of like post game and
4786640	4792160	stuff so i think i think people are just i mean it was 800 pokemon it would have been almost like
4792160	4798080	too many to wrap your head around so like i think i think it's okay it's gonna be okay people the
4798080	4804800	game came out fine so it kind of reminds me of ddr actually that you mentioned oh god because
4804800	4808800	you can't put all the old songs back in there you know as much as you want that's music licensing
4808800	4813600	you know you know i could understand especially like they should have just always been like we're
4813600	4817280	just going to cut the legendaries because it's going to throw off the bat you know i can
4817280	4823440	understand where maybe they're trying to make a shift in the competitive space for pokemon by
4823440	4828640	cutting all those legendaries and the pokemon that people always use like in in a way it's actually
4828640	4833120	kind of interesting because now that they've reshuffled everything with with sword and shield
4833120	4837120	it's like it's going to cause the competitive scene to kind of be rebooted and different
4837120	4841520	combinations will be looked at and re-evaluated so i kind of think it's interesting in that regard
4842080	4847040	for what it's worth so yeah and then we have this really disgusting stuff thing where it's like
4847040	4852240	some people were upset with reviewers for scoring the game so high yeah the same people that were
4852240	4857680	pissed off when they said too much water 7.3 or whatever it was like it's the same fucking people
4857680	4861920	they're just mad about something uh and then sj100 matt talking about how sarah b net is
4861920	4869280	getting threats for posting the news like gross like their fans just people need to calm down
4871600	4877520	you need to calm down the game's fine go play the game and then tell me what you think i mean is it
4877520	4886960	perfect no but is it good enough i think so anyway moving on dark sakura you have more pokemon news
4886960	4897680	right i do for folks who had let's go pikachu or let's go eevee um well you can uh obtain them in
4898080	4903040	sword and shield if you have a save file from one of those games which means i need to borrow
4903040	4909600	one of your copies of of whichever one of the let's go's you have so i can get a save file
4909600	4914400	and then give it right back to you yeah i have let's go pikachu and i'll give you so here's a
4914400	4920720	tip you can't evolve the eevee you get for free with this however well you don't get an eevee
4920720	4927200	anyway with let's go pikachu but on on and this isn't a spoiler i think to say if you need an eevee
4927200	4932480	go to route four eevee's there but just may take a little bit before you see because i caught an
4932480	4939680	eevee on route four however he's a little fucker like i had to use like i tried like three regular
4939680	4945840	pokeballs two great balls and i think two premier balls i think finally the fucker and like he was
4945840	4951200	down to one hit point i vault swiped him down to one hit point and paralyzed him with my little
4951200	4955360	yamper those things are so fucking cute have you seen the yamper's they're little corgis with
4955360	4960080	yellow hearts on their butt they're so cute anyway yes i have actually yeah right so anyway
4960080	4965120	plus corgi mine yeah so i uh paralyzed him with corgi mon and fault swiped him down to one hit
4965120	4970240	point and the little fucker would not get in the ball for like seven balls get in the ball shinji
4970240	4975280	finally finally you should have named him shinji i know finally i caught that fucking eevee so
4975920	4980960	that one will evolve because i caught him on route four well at any rate as rob just said you you get
4980960	4987040	a freebie of of one of them depending on the version i was also looking at the gigantamax
4987040	4993280	forms and you get fat pikachu you also get long cat meowth you do you just go into your mystery
4993280	4998000	gifts and connect to the internet right now and you will get a long cat meowth long cat meowth is
4998000	5005600	the best like but at any rate um the other gigantamax forms are charizard uh meowth and
5005600	5015200	butterfree and and it's old school meowth by the way it's not not new fuzzy one so yay yeah there's
5015200	5020400	a galarian uh meowth that looks like a hobo kind of met with a viking it's kind of interesting
5020400	5026240	interesting yeah i'm looking forward to seeing this so but at any rate yeah you can you can get
5026240	5032080	to freebies if you have the old versions cool so a little benefit for those of you that played um
5032080	5037040	let's go pikachu just long enough to get to pokemon go park and then stop playing like me
5037040	5042800	yeah all right moving on what else is going on in nintendo's world lucky apparently nintendo
5042800	5048480	published a brand new game on the e-shop called the stretchers and the stretchers is out on nintendo
5048480	5056640	switch and it's a game where i guess you play like an ambulance crew but um i know the gameplay that
5056640	5060480	i watched didn't necessarily just have like ambulance stuff like they were mowing down
5060480	5067600	things with a lawn mower but it is a co-op game and it's very strange so yeah they said
5067600	5072160	residents of a town are suddenly struck by dizziness and you need to help getting them
5072160	5077840	to the hospital you have to avoid obstacles and stuff pixel pakas in our chat over twitch tv slash
5077840	5082640	vog network says the stretchers gives me big crazy taxi vibes well that's an endorsement to me
5082640	5090640	yeah it looked weird from like the the screen the video that i saw but i mean um it's it
5091440	5094720	art style reminds me a lot of actually fortnite which is kind of weird
5094720	5102320	uh just because it's so colorful and cartoony but yeah it is um it looks fun and um definitely
5102320	5106880	different than the other nintendo stuff but yeah i do see like nitro ambulances and stuff so this
5106880	5113360	is an actual nintendo game not some indie release on i mean not that i make it sound like i'm
5113360	5116720	poo-pooing those indie releases but you know there's a lot of them on the switch this is
5116720	5120800	an actual nintendo game that's kind of in there right yeah and so what's kind of cool though is
5120800	5124160	a lot of the stuff because it is a co-op game a lot of like the things that you're doing you're
5124160	5128560	kind of coordinating with other people like they had like i just saw a screenshot where they're
5128560	5132800	doing uh moving a bomb together so one person's controlling one end of the stretcher the other
5132800	5136000	person is trolling the other end of the stretcher and that's a lot of things they're in there like
5136000	5140480	they'll have a sawing down a tree or like um you know pushing a lawnmower or something like that
5140480	5145520	but because you have to kind of work together controlling stuff is where it gets kind of crazy
5145520	5150960	that sounds kind of silly but fun yep all right cool all right well uh let's talk about uh this
5150960	5156080	story which was actually posted to our discord server over at vog network.com discord you can
5156080	5160960	join our discord server and uh people leave little stories uh ideas for us there in channel
5160960	5166720	orange lounge radio and uh sometimes especially on a week like this uh i really turn to what you
5166720	5169760	guys are posting to be like well what are they if i don't know what to talk about what are what
5169760	5173120	do the listeners want us to talk about and i thought this was a really good one because even
5173120	5177600	though it's it's that rumor status it's one of those things where i'm like okay i could see this
5177600	5182560	happening because this is what's going on in our game industry these days but apparently um bio
5182560	5188800	ware is actually working on an overhaul of anthem uh which some are referring to as anthem 2.0 or
5188800	5194880	anthem next so there's a kotaku report out there that says that uh bio ware developers in edmonton
5194880	5200640	and austin are actually doing an overhaul of the game enough for it to be anthem 2.0 or anthem next
5200640	5207120	unknown at this time if it will be updates an all-at-once expansion or an entirely new game
5207120	5211760	but it's going to change the main systems the mission structure the loot and the game world
5211760	5217440	drastically uh splitting the current game world into segments meaning developers could work on
5217440	5222640	certain areas without worrying about bugs attacking other areas uh because right now it's
5222640	5228400	all one big world and that can happen um i'm just i'm kind of giggling because i see on the side all
5228400	5234720	these sales of like anthem for ten dollars right now i'm like yikes but you know this is the day
5234720	5241120	and age of gaming now in the year 2019 is that it is possible to reboot relaunch your game and be
5241120	5248400	successful hello diablo 3 final fantasy 14 no man's sky it shouldn't it's this shouldn't be the
5248400	5255360	norm it it shouldn't and i it well yes and no like i can kind of applaud a developer who recognizes
5255360	5262080	that their game sucked and they go back and redo it like i just never expected ea to be the one to
5262080	5266640	do it because ea you would think is typically the one that's oh we're just gonna yank pull the plug
5266720	5270560	be done with it write it off we're gonna and he still might because it could be a rumor we're
5270560	5275440	gonna close bio air you know which i i hope doesn't happen i mean please don't misunderstand me
5275440	5280160	but that's just what you kind of come to expect from ea so if they really are going back and
5280160	5286320	giving this a second shot then maybe it's a sign that ea is trying to do better and not be so evil
5286320	5291680	anymore and that would be quite something going into the next decade but we'll see um but they
5291680	5296400	do say as well uh that you know they're not giving up on anthem this is something that's being worked
5296400	5303600	on more i could i could see maybe a relaunch for playstation 5 in the next xbox there might be a
5303600	5310320	narrative there for an anthem redo for those systems but i i would seriously hold on give a
5310320	5315680	shit i i they're gonna have to come a long way to win me over however any more mass effect well
5316320	5321920	funny you should mention that because this same rumor slash report says bio we're still working
5321920	5329440	on dragon age 4 and a new mass effect game is in very early development mike gamble is the one
5329440	5336400	directing it who worked previously on mass effect 2 3 and anthem well as long as it isn't you know
5336400	5342080	the half-assed thing that andromeda was that had so many missteps in it i mean i had fun with
5342080	5347600	andromeda don't get me wrong but no more dead eyes please i'm just and no more dead naming i'm so
5347600	5352640	curious about are they going to attempt to do something in shepherd's timeline
5353200	5359760	or what i i i could see them doing a parallel story to shepherd i think that's something they
5359760	5368160	you know what i want huh the aftermath based on your your ending yeah i mean that would though
5368160	5375120	be really weirdly dynamic you know like if you did like the the space magic version or the shepherd
5375120	5381040	lives version or whatever i personally want a shepherd lives version well we'll see i mean
5381040	5385840	obviously that is a huge rumor we don't know a damn thing about it um i mean i wouldn't be
5385840	5390880	surprised to find that ea is not going to walk away from mass effect and thank god but you know
5391600	5397840	just maybe rebuild your store so i can get another n7 hoodie just remaster the fucking original
5397840	5404720	trilogy already just you know playstation 5 and next xbox are coming out remaster the original
5404720	5408720	trilogy for them i think it would make a lot of people happy and it would buy you a lot of fucking
5408720	5414560	time to make a good mass effect follow-up that's and i'm gonna leave it at that throw andromeda in
5414560	5421440	there too if you want all right moving on uh dar sakra from from newer games to retro games right
5421440	5428080	yes one of my favorite series is fantasy zone because i love the opa opa so they are doing
5428080	5434960	another sega ages fantasy zone and it's going to have some neat stuff in it uh this information
5434960	5441440	comes from uh gematsu um there's actually screenshots it looks pretty good but it's going
5441440	5449760	to have a coin stock system where uh basically you can uh save these coins that you collect
5449760	5455360	and then you can use them to increase like your time limit for your shots or the amount of coins
5455360	5460880	enemies will drop and things like that um extra bosses which includes um some of the sega mark 3
5460880	5470400	bosses that appeared um you also can have the arcade uh extra boss battles and um and then uh
5470400	5476320	you can configure your settings it has upa upa mode which stars opa opa's little brother and so
5476320	5480880	it has no shot bubbles um you can start playing by withdrawing your savings from the coin stock
5481520	5485680	as long as you have a budget all weapons can be used at any time and it's slightly different
5485680	5492160	ending you also have a time attack mode with infinite lives and you just have to it looks
5492160	5499360	like there's a boss run in there and then other features for sega ages is the original um shipped
5499360	5505760	arcade version and the new arcade version um like uh it says that there are unique elements
5505760	5513360	such as the base marker b a s e that indicates the position of your base off screen and um lead
5513360	5521120	online leaderboards replays in hd rumble so it's looking it's looking pretty good and it's got like
5521120	5526560	some screen overlays it's very interesting but i freaking love fantasy zone well in these you know
5526560	5530080	and i agree with dark tetsuya in our chat who says i've been following these sega ages titles
5530080	5535680	they really go the extra mile and they like these sega you know retro revival games in the sega ages
5535680	5542560	series they really bring it like it's not just the freaking rom running in high resolution like it's
5542560	5547360	you know they really go back and add a lot of value to it so i'm really uh hyped to see this
5547360	5551520	um now interesting also a dark to see it says the one i really want is shinobi when it comes out
5551520	5556320	oh yeah that would be cool too so uh yyr says these features basically sound like what they
5556320	5561520	put into the 3ds versions of fantasy zone and fantasy zone 2 it sounds identical so
5561520	5568080	season 2 is great as well yeah the tears of opa opa so will you be checking this out when it
5568080	5573680	releases uh i know i know you're a big fantasy zone fan so i came really close to buying a uh
5573680	5578480	sega genesis sega ages fantasy zone and then i found out it was a repro so i didn't
5578480	5585520	don't but man i would love to have though the sega saturn ages version yeah keep an eye out
5585520	5589680	you never know what you might find that'd be rad all right well moving on all right tiger claw
5589680	5594560	listen up because i know you're excited to talk about this and actually a lot of the internet's
5594560	5602160	been talking about this this week uh and that is that redo of uh sonic uh the new trailer actually
5602160	5608240	hit the internet this week and uh i think he looks a lot better it looks way better
5609360	5614720	wow better here we and you said you couldn't reboot a game how about that they did they went
5614720	5618800	back and they they really i mean and that's pretty impressive for just what a few months
5618800	5623680	that they've been working on it but now instead of looking like this like disgusting like
5624320	5630960	the hybrid of human and hedgehog song that the hedgehog looks like sonic the hedgehog
5630960	5636960	i mean maybe a little bit like long in the legs and still humanish body but like the face is so
5636960	5643680	much better i think it looks just fine yeah i mean it looks really great yeah and even the trailer
5643680	5648080	itself like and that yelling like that same yelling sequence which i've seen the side by
5648080	5652320	sides and we go back and look at the old one like oh my god it looks so terrible it looks like a
5652320	5657200	parody at this point but even the new trailer like they use they don't use gangsta's paradise
5657200	5662080	they use a different song like even the trailer was just cut better and it it goes and jim carrey
5662080	5665840	looks pretty fucking funny i gotta say i know you're a big fan of jim carrey of course yeah so
5666720	5672800	yeah i i really can't wait to see the movie it looks pretty great now and uh i'm glad that they
5672800	5678720	went back and fixed it and so yeah along with that of course uh a lot of people really liking
5678720	5686240	the redesign and one of the best parts about it so apparently um the you can thank the artist from
5686240	5695520	sonic mania who helped work at that out with uh paramount so um tyson hese they said i'm honored
5695520	5702160	to have been brought in to lead the design on the new movie sonic working with jeff and the modelers
5702160	5707840	rigorous texture for artists and animators in la london and vancouver was a thrill i'll never forget
5708480	5715680	and yeah i mean looks looks great so coming out in valentine's day and i'll check it out
5715680	5721360	that's so interesting that like how the video game series has kind of ended up impacting the
5721360	5727360	movie and especially this particular one that was like a fan kind of really fan driven type of game
5727360	5732000	has now had such a positive impact on the movie like fans have saved the franchise i think i mean
5732000	5738320	definitely this has a way better chance of being successful now than it was before i i think that's
5738320	5743040	for sure i think there's so many more people now on social media that are like oh yeah i'm gonna
5743040	5750000	i'll see this now and even like you should support and it it goes so far as to make people think the
5750000	5755040	whole thing has been a hoax this whole time that we've been we've been hoaxed this entire time
5755040	5760560	and that this is all planned so that the internet would rally behind this redesign and that we would
5760560	5766000	all go to the theater and support it and it's the conspiracy theories haven't been astounding
5766000	5769520	me online this you know what though like if that's their plan and that's what they pulled
5769520	5775280	off then prop great fucking plan good job it was a risky plan but you know what people could just
5775280	5781840	said they don't give a shit about it and that's it but yeah yeah i mean vg realness says i just
5781840	5787440	really question why they thought the first trailer and vision they had was okay well i mean it's not
5787440	5794560	like we haven't seen hollywood fuck up video game movies several times before mario who greenlit
5794560	5800480	that mario brothers movie seriously you know i think miyamoto was like angry i think miyamoto's
5800480	5805680	eyes actually did that whole like you know like uh anger face type of thing like rawr and like
5805680	5811840	st anger emoji uh did you ever watch the documentary about it i think i did watch part of it there was
5811840	5817840	actually a pretty good documentary about making that movie and about uh like what it originally
5817840	5823200	was going to be and it was actually supposed to be a far better movie but they rewrote the movie
5823200	5831440	while it was being filmed yeah yikes so um but hey there's a new mario movie coming what in a
5831440	5834960	few years so yeah that's an all animated one to kind of go with the theme park have you ever
5834960	5840240	watched though the original animated one it's weird it's really freaking weird i don't think
5840240	5845200	i ever have it's the whole thing's on youtube uh fansubbed yeah it's just really freaking weird
5845200	5850800	and then also obviously the street fighter movie was was pure camp i mean people find things to
5850880	5856240	like about the street fighter movie like you know rawr julia owned it like you know he was
5856240	5860560	definitely like gina gershon his last role though he knew i know he knew exactly what movie that
5860560	5865840	was and he he lived it up you know what was it you know for me it was just tuesday it's just
5866800	5874560	you know and kylie minnow is as cami you know all the little you know yay yes um and uh yeah i mean
5874560	5878720	that movie was not yeah but like here's here's the weird part about that the street fighter
5878720	5882400	the movie or whatever then they have the chunk now i know you've forgotten but they had the chung
5882400	5887200	lee movie that came out oh you know i didn't forget about that i just wasn't that worse than
5887200	5894240	the street fighter movie like did it get worse it's like oh we're rebooting stream oh but how
5894240	5900320	did you make it worse but it is interesting how the internet and that whole campaign had this
5900320	5904640	impact and for and usually i don't support the internet anger campaigns right i just made fun
5904640	5910960	of the pokemon one right but like the one for sonic is the first time i can go wow that internet
5910960	5917680	hate campaign did some good like but that was accomplished with people saying you know not
5917680	5922720	sending death threats it was just like we don't support this we're not going to go see it because
5922720	5928000	it looks terrible not i want to kill you because you didn't do the thing i wanted you to do
5928560	5934160	that's the difference yes uh oh metal okay metal mayhem does have the okay here's the
5934160	5938240	bad video game movie ready male mayhem says the double dragon movie was a hundred percent pure
5938240	5948400	usd grade a ass yes it was pretty bad who's wow anyway all right i got the i got to see that as
5948400	5953120	a screener that was a long time ago and i was like oh i'm super excited then he watched it like not
5953120	5958240	set not excited anymore all right all right well there you go so there's our sonic movie discussion
5958240	5964160	now tiger claw stay tuned because sonic comes up again later in the show all right don't tune out
5964160	5968960	all right here we go but for now i want to move on to uh this announcement which um i think is
5968960	5975440	interesting uh on our last live episode two weeks ago we were talking about Blizzcon and Diablo 4
5975440	5980080	was one of the big announcements that came out of Blizzcon right well you remember when Diablo 3
5980960	5986720	first came out and it was kind of like not great i think people were turning to alternatives like
5986720	5992960	torchlight and another game that was free to play called path of exile and a path of exile
5992960	5998080	still going after all these years and you know has had several expansions and once again thanks
5998080	6003680	to discord this week it was brought to my attention that a path of exile 2 was announced
6003680	6009440	this week how convenient right on the heels of Diablo 4 being announced but what's interesting
6009440	6013360	so i didn't even know there was an exile con but apparently there is but they showed this launch
6013360	6016960	trailer for path of exile 2 which we're showing you a little bit of that on twitch here so you
6016960	6020800	can see some of the gameplay here after some of these cut scenes um but what's interesting about
6020800	6027040	it is a brand new seven act story uh that's 20 years after the events of the first game and i
6027040	6032000	have to admit when i was watching this uh trailer for the first time i was like well this looks an
6032000	6036240	awful lot like the original i mean not that it's a bad thing the original i've played path of exile
6036240	6041600	so it's a especially when you consider it's a fucking free game it's really good you know um
6042560	6046880	so i was like gosh this looks just like the original well here's the reason because path
6046880	6055200	of exile 2 it's not a new game it is essentially a expansion for the first game uh so when path
6055200	6060240	of exile 2 launches it's going to be the first game and the second game side by side uh that
6060240	6068480	then this new story will be seven acts long so yeah it's um it's not a new standalone title
6068480	6075600	and i think this is also interesting because i was kind of poking fun at overwatch 2 on our last show
6075600	6083600	going i'm not so sure overwatch 2 is a sequel as much as it is an expansion but okay you know okay
6083600	6086560	it still looks like it still looks like it'll be good enough and i think a lot of people will be
6086560	6093440	into it and now here we have path of exile 2 and they're just up front saying it's it's it's kind of
6094080	6100400	seven acts for the first game we're just branding it as path of exile 2 so i i mean but again this
6100400	6105680	whole series is free they make their money off of cosmetics and these expansions kind of like you
6105680	6113360	know uh you could say the same as uh fortnite chapter two sure yeah it's a new game but no
6113360	6118480	okay yeah really that's a great way to put it absolutely so um yeah so i'll check it out i
6118480	6122880	mean the price is certainly right i think i've dropped like a little bit of money on path of
6122880	6128480	exile just to kind of show my support but um path of exile is on what pc it's on playstation 4 and
6128480	6133360	xbox one i don't think it's on switch but um who knows maybe just a matter of time before it's there
6133360	6139600	so there you go path of exile 2 it's coming anyway uh moving on to a somewhat somber topic
6139840	6148080	dark sakura yeah i was very sad when i find out found out thanks rob well i thank our discord
6148080	6151840	once again because this was brought to my attention on discord and i was like oh that's sad
6151840	6159760	so onogi uh nobuki who was a namco composer and considered the father of video game music died
6160320	6168080	very recently at age 63 which i mean still pretty young that's pretty young he was born in 1956 in
6168080	6177040	chizuoka um and he was an engineering major from chiba university and he applied to namco in 1980
6177600	6184960	and he was just doing general programming stuff and they liked the end music he made for rally x
6184960	6191280	the high score music and they're like hey we want you to be our sound uh designer and he's like okay
6192000	6199680	and so thanks to him we had the soundtrack for mappy and he did um a lot of other work um
6200640	6207440	mostly though uh effects and programming work for the music but still the composition those
6207440	6214560	sounds in those early 80s namco games are iconic you know like you you hear those distinctive
6214560	6220560	sounds and you know like oh this is a product of the 80s but mappy was his first full uh
6221200	6229520	composition um he also did uh other games one called liberal rabble one called warp man and
6229520	6235760	metro cross um those were the ones that he did uh music composition in but other games that he
6235760	6242560	worked on start with warp warp rally new rally x galaga bosconian pole position pole position two
6243120	6252160	xevious uh the tower of druaga um mobile suit zeta gundam hot scramble uh wizardry um the quest of
6252160	6258480	key looking some others on here uh family circuit another wizardry game a couple wizardry games
6258480	6264720	the last one he did was family circuit 91 in 1991 so there you go um so
6265280	6268640	may his memory be a blessing and thank you for all of the good music
6268640	6277040	i'm trying to see what he actually died of have they just not said out of respect or what have
6277040	6285840	you yeah that is a very young age to pass so yeah i didn't say what exactly um but yeah okay well i
6285840	6291200	think um along that note let's move right into our classic game of the week because i think you're
6291200	6295760	going to tie it together a little bit tonight uh as uh usual dark soccer likes to jump into the
6295760	6300240	gaming vault uh every week and find a game that she thinks hey you guys should check this game
6300240	6304480	out this week and obviously it's no secret that this week's selection will be pretty timely with
6304480	6308160	this in mind also while we're in the classic game of the week segment for those of you that are
6308160	6312480	watching live on our twitch broadcast on sunday night we are going to open up the community gift
6312480	6318800	chest so if you would like to uh give if you are a twitch prime person and you want to put in some
6318800	6324160	gifts uh i believe tonight the giveaway is for league of legends team fight tactics it's a twin
6324160	6329120	egg and skin shard you can contribute to the pot there and uh when the segment is done we will
6329120	6334880	give those away to random viewers there so i think i've enabled it but if i haven't bobby blackwolf
6334880	6338960	will hopefully help me save the day here and turn that on for us here so we can donate to the
6338960	6344560	community chest while dark soccer takes a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the
6344560	6350240	week so dark soccer what did you pick for tonight's classic game of the week i picked a game that um
6350240	6354080	he was actually uncredited on for the soundtrack but it was little rabble
6354640	6360880	which um i mentioned earlier during the last story so it came out in 1983 it was a puzzler
6360880	6366800	that was put out in japan by namco and you basically take um two colored arrows one called
6366800	6373440	liberal the other rabble to wrap around pegs and surround small creatures called mushlins and you
6373440	6378000	have to harvest them by tying the ropes around them like you're cordoning them off it almost
6378000	6386080	gives me a slight little bit of a kicks vibe in some respects you know um but you also uncover
6386080	6389840	treasure as you go along so you can search through them and then you once you get the
6389840	6397440	right treasures you get a bonus stage and it had its own um software actually ran on i'm sorry
6397440	6406240	hardware it was called the namco liberal rabble uh hardware and i think it was like one of two
6406240	6415120	games that ran on it um but it was uh it was also called the namco system 16 universal which was an
6415120	6423120	8-bit arcade system um and it actually uh predated the sega 16 version so the name wasn't a rip or
6423120	6427840	anything and the only get yeah the only other game that ran on it was a game called toy pop
6428960	6432560	so uh and which is uh actually a multi-directional shooter game
6433360	6439760	so going back though um it did have a north american release planned but it got cancelled
6439760	6445680	its original incarnation was a game called potato and it was created by the pac-man creator
6445680	6455520	iwatani toru um and of course the music done by onogi um uh iwatani became a little bit too
6455520	6461120	overwhelmed with other projects that you know were going on at the time so it was passed on
6461120	6468640	to sato makoto um and who brought in the treasure chest concept and you know everything you know
6468640	6472160	other things that are built into the game like bonus stages and whatnot because it's considered
6472160	6476880	a little too simplistic can i just say i've never heard of this game before you selected it for the
6476880	6481600	game of the week and i'm getting kind of a kicks vibe from it yeah but like with like that strange
6481600	6487520	like kind of two-player element like there's one player oh really i believe it is that's what it
6487520	6490800	looks it looks like it's almost so that's really interesting this so it's one person kind of
6490800	6494160	controlling both little arrows i think so interesting i guess you could easily make it
6494160	6498400	two-player then but very interesting sorry i didn't mean to interrupt but i was just like
6498400	6503200	especially for those that you can't see the video i bet a lot of you probably haven't
6503200	6509680	heard of this game either and it's it's got this strange kicks meets gluclu land yeah because of
6509680	6514400	the pegs did you have to yeah because you're wrapping things around the pegs yeah and capturing
6514400	6523120	what's inside um well it's liberal l-i-b-b-l-e rabble r-a-b-b-l-e so some you know if you're
6523120	6529360	gonna look it up um at any rate though it was really praised for how unique the gameplay was
6529360	6533760	i haven't seen any other games exactly like this and it's considered a cult classic
6534320	6539600	it's bizarre but very addictive some people have said and one of the most unappreciated
6539600	6544880	namco games out there um there was a super famicom version that came out in 1994
6545760	6551680	and also home ports for the fm towns marty and the cherub x68000 both systems i've done
6551680	6558480	as classic systems um and the super famicom version had a cover for the d-pad so you could
6558480	6562720	yeah so you could use the twin stick gameplay also an early twin stick game i should add
6563280	6568320	um it was digitally re-released for the weaver's uh virtual console in 2009
6568960	6574480	um and yeah even um one of the sources that i looked up for research on this did a big
6574480	6579760	comparison with kicks um but at any rate you also have different enemies that try to
6580480	6587440	to stop you and of course you know they can put an end to your you know wrapping shenanigans
6588320	6592160	um but the whole point in the end is a is basically a corralling game
6593360	6598880	yyr is curious how you lose because um in this playthrough we're looking at they're doing very
6598880	6603680	well i think when your arrows i think it's your arrows getting hit hold on let me see
6603680	6608960	the player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or
6608960	6615040	she runs out of time so the border is your timer and you can boost that time by looping more
6615040	6619600	mushrooms and plants you gain an extra life of forty thousand one hundred and twenty thousand
6619600	6623680	two hundred thousand four hundred thousand six hundred thousand and one million points by default
6624240	6630560	after the tenth season your counter will stop at nine your season counter will stop at 99
6630560	6635440	similar to how oh there he just lost a life because he ran into the yeah and king and balloons
6635440	6643760	will work the same way um so it was i mean like i said it was started the concept was started off
6643760	6649920	by the creator of pac-man um and he said that he conceptualized the game based on an experience he
6649920	6656080	added a crowded disco in the night in the 80s he said he envisioned himself using ropes to tie
6656080	6662160	people up and throwing them out of the way and you know it also had to do with some games he played
6662160	6668800	in his childhood and so they initially called it potato because namco was considering a tie-in
6669360	6675680	with a japanese potato chip manufacturer but that fell through and so um they actually had
6675680	6684240	to create new software for the game because it was had new graphical effects it was a pretty
6684240	6689840	big game for its time so they needed that dedicated hardware for it and like i said this
6689840	6697200	was passed on to satomakoto um and then after looking at the prototype sato said hey this is
6697200	6703360	too simple and so got the idea for using treasure chest and uncovering them by the apple 2 version
6703360	6711040	of wizardry so there you go and of course the music was done by orogi looks like a dragon in
6711040	6716640	that one this is this is a neat pick just because like this game it's kind of been erased from a lot
6716640	6721200	of people's memories and um i don't think it's been in any namco collection that i can think of
6721200	6727360	so we didn't get it in the us at all in any in any way although the soundtrack did get released
6727360	6733360	for itunes in 2011 oh i don't know about us um and i just quickly want to say some folks in
6733360	6736960	chat pointing out because you know we have a lot of music game fans in chat and namco's done a few
6736960	6741200	music games over the years like technic beat um orange right points out some people know this game
6741200	6747200	from the remix in that rhythm game of technic beat so you may have you know heard the song before
6747200	6751840	well and then the versions of it that came out at home the only one anyone in the us would have
6751840	6756080	a relatively easy chance of playing would have been the super famicom version yeah um because
6756080	6762720	the other systems that came out on were the fm towns marty and the x68000 which were both i mean
6763760	6770400	right now crazy expensive to to get i mean fuck i love one of either of those but um
6771360	6778960	but you know it's not on systems that were easy for an american to get a hold of so well i i i
6778960	6783600	doubt anyone from namco listens to this show but on the off chance maybe somebody does i think it
6783600	6789440	would be great um you know especially when you consider that you know you know nobody just passed
6789440	6794160	that maybe we could get some of these games on a modern maybe like ant stream is something that
6794160	6797440	would be like perfect for something like this where we could kind of revisit some of these
6797440	6801840	old games and you know learn a little more about them experience the soundtrack you know what else
6801840	6807520	this makes me think of and you're gonna probably laugh about it what's that the uh lasso tool in
6807520	6813920	photoshop a little bit because you know how you can click it around and the corral doesn't close
6813920	6819280	up until you join the lines yeah that's how the freaking lasso tool works except you have to hit
6819280	6824080	the anchor point but still all right great pick for the classic game of the week so uh for those
6824080	6827440	listening live we're going to give about 30 more seconds if anyone wants to make any last
6827440	6833760	contributions there to the gift box and then i'm going to ask bobby to um uh end that and uh divvy
6833760	6839440	out the gifts it's like an early christmas after all um you know the christmas decorations are
6839440	6845280	already going up even though thanksgiving is already music i'm already sick please tell me
6845280	6851600	i'm not the only one that's heard okay so there's this meme going around and last week it was toad
6851600	6856080	singing sia's chandelier and it's just that really like high-pitched screech that
6857920	6862560	like it's just really like annoying but today i saw one that was mariah carrey's all i want
6862560	6867520	for christmas done by toad which i refuse to listen to you need to because the toad version
6867520	6872560	because i like cried from laughing so hard it was i am avoiding the mariah apocalypse
6873520	6880480	i have not heard the song in two years because oh are you are you playing the um what is it the
6880960	6886480	wam apocalypse where like you have to avoid last uh george michaels the wamageddon the wamageddon
6886480	6895280	that's it i don't mind the wam song i fucking hate i actually can't stand mariah carrey because all
6895280	6900000	of her fucking songs are like i need a man to be happy bitch you don't you're rich you don't need
6900000	6903440	a man to be happy what about like obsessed she sings about a man who needs to leave the fuck
6903440	6911200	alone no it's still about a man just be happy you should mariah needs to go i will have respect
6911200	6917040	for mariah if she goes out a song that says bitch i'm rich i don't fucking need you i kind of
6917040	6922480	figured that was gratitude anyway i just i want her to do a song called bitch i'm rich all right
6923440	6928720	anyhow uh let's move on and get into some rapid fire news we're gonna travel quickly around the
6928720	6935040	industry and check out some other headlines from uh this week loki so there's this pretty awesome
6935040	6944480	game that was made within dreams um so the the game is um it's very much like wipeout they called
6944480	6951760	it i'm trying to remember what it was called in here it wasn't wipeout it was like um slide out
6951760	6957920	3019 but it's very much like a wipeout game and it's fully playable in dreams i didn't realize
6957920	6964320	apparently dreams early access is a thing that you can purchase right now for 2099 or 29.99 and
6964320	6969520	you can actually play these games and make stuff i might get in on that actually because i i know
6969520	6973840	the full game's not out yet but i didn't realize that they had i know i thought it was like a beta
6973840	6978320	thing that you had to get into but apparently it is something they have been selling since april
6978320	6984960	so i see so i i may have to check that out but um yeah if you have dreams definitely check that out
6984960	6990000	because it looks pretty awesome and it's just impressive the amount of things that you can make
6990000	6997040	in dreams and the quality of just the gameplay the graphics the sound everything is just crazy um
6998160	7006960	and then they go along with that is a brand new mod for super mario 64 called super mario 64 land
7006960	7016240	it is a brand new uh fan-made game that's already on adds uh new levels new bosses and new power-ups
7016240	7022480	and new music and you can check it out uh they have it available um i believe it's linked in
7022480	7028640	the guy the developer's video well as as no it's been taken down of course nintendo lawyers shut
7028640	7033520	that shit down they got cnd a week ago of course really because i thought i just downloaded okay
7033520	7038000	well maybe not all right i might be thinking of another one but i think i saw this like a couple
7038000	7042960	weeks ago and it already got cnd no it's not it's out there still it may be like one link versus
7042960	7049040	another link but anyway well once on the internet always on the internet right so yeah so uh kazi
7049040	7055440	um amanor uh on youtube they have a video it's linked in the description there so it is still
7055440	7062160	out there i just checked uh but you can patch your original nintendo 64 rom to play the game
7062160	7067920	it looks pretty awesome it has all the different powers from super mario uh 3d land so so pretty
7067920	7073840	sweet that's it all right well moving on to talk about tetris effect a game that i hope a lot of
7073840	7078960	you checked out on playstation 4 because it's great but there's actually a playstation 4 dynamic
7078960	7085600	theme that is actually up on the store that you can check out it's actually based off metamorphosis
7085600	7090800	in tetris effect so you can actually get this theme for your playstation 4 if you want to go
7090800	7096240	like full in on tetris effect yes and so it's i mean and obviously what a tetris effect strong
7096240	7099920	point is those very immersive themes didn't come with a theme when you bought the game because i
7099920	7104880	swear i have a tetris effect theme right now on mine i think it might have but this one is now
7104880	7110640	free so if it if it's not there if it is this one then this is now free for everybody but i think
7110640	7115920	it's a different one it may be a different one anyhow um i know some folks are looking forward
7115920	7119760	to the witcher series it's coming out on netflix i don't know how many guys i know everybody's
7119760	7123040	talking about disney plus he looks he looks like the character now there's still some things to get
7123040	7127280	excited about on netflix i think the witcher is one of them uh again it's based on the books not
7127280	7131360	on the game because the game was based on the books too but obviously there will still be some
7131360	7136400	similarities and uh if you are um you know kind of wondering like you know is this just going to be
7136400	7141920	a one and done type of thing the answer is no uh it was already unveiled that there is going to be
7141920	7147360	a season two of witcher on the way to netflix so not very often that shows get greenlit for a
7147360	7152800	second season before the first is already debuted but the buzz for this must be really really good
7152800	7156720	speaking of games based on book series i wonder if they're ever going to adapt
7156720	7163120	uh metro into um a show because i know those games are pretty awesome based on
7163760	7167600	that book series as well so well there's what seven or eight different subscription
7167600	7171760	television services now so there's plenty of places somebody's looking for something yeah right
7171760	7179520	yeah anyhow let's move on to dark sakura wheel um shovel knight there's new shovel knight stuff
7179520	7185840	happening um the uh developer yacht club uh said that shovel knight king of cards and shovel knight
7185840	7192080	showdown will both come out on december 10th um the first is a bonus campaign for the original
7192080	7196560	and the second is a multiplayer fighting game spin-off it was supposed to come out last april
7196560	7202560	but it is coming out in december so yay i didn't mean for that to sound as squeaky as it did i'm
7202560	7209520	losing my voice and so konami has applied for a new trademark for goemon as in the mystical ninja
7210320	7216080	um and it says game program and game software which the last one that came out was uh goemon
7216080	7222080	uh took idochu um which came out in 2005 for the nintendo ds i can't wait for that going on
7222080	7227520	pachi slot machines gonna be awesome this is game program and software which i think if they
7227520	7235840	if they're putting a trademark for pachi slot it has to be labeled as such so if i remember
7235840	7240320	correctly well i mean you know we had a castlevania collection that did pretty well not to say it
7240320	7244400	would necessarily be just a goemon collection because we also had a new bomber man game that
7244400	7254960	did pretty well so anything's possible i suppose yes all right and um like yeah those were all
7254960	7259440	right did i think i closed my other one no that was it okay shovel knight in the goemon so i just
7259440	7264880	like i completely i guess went over my brain doing shovel knight all good we are going to move on to
7264880	7268160	release dates we're going to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out to
7268160	7273760	a store or shelf near you soon uh or what's like i don't know if there's not much we've kind of
7273760	7280720	the fourth quarter rush is kind of over um so this week we only have a few things although
7280720	7286400	there are some notable stuff so football manager 2020 we've got that coming out on pc ios and
7286400	7294400	android not fake football but real football right um and then we have shinmu 3 coming out on pc and
7294400	7302080	playstation 4 it's kind of a big deal that is and oh finally yes and last but not least sniper ghost
7302080	7306800	warrior contracts on pc playstation 4 and xbox one are you going to check out shinmu 3 dark
7306800	7312480	sakura we didn't even finish shinmu 2 well i mean i would assume it's been so long that you probably
7312480	7316800	don't have to have finished the first two games we'll see yeah i'm i have a lot of curiosity about
7316800	7321760	it that's for sure anyway shinmu 3 also coming out in japan same date as the rest of the world
7321760	7327200	uh as far as other releases this week in japan on the 21st we have demo reborn is coming out
7327200	7331360	um as well as sonic force is getting a price reduction i think the same thing is happening
7331360	7336800	with blaze blue uh cross tag battle so we're seeing some price reductions over in japan just
7336800	7341920	in time for the holidays even though the holidays are a little bit different over there um but we
7341920	7347280	also have on the nintendo switch we have that same blaze blue cross tag battle but we also get the
7347280	7353760	localized version of lego jurassic world comes out in japan this week woohoo and diablo leak lovers
7353760	7359520	grand edition for a nintendo switch both in a regular and limited edition package um there's
7359520	7366000	also a deluxe edition version of mutant year zero road to eden coming out and uh there's actually
7366000	7371440	gosh uh one more game actually because everything else here is for a different region but bukura no
7371440	7380320	keshigomu otoshi plus sports shed shed set excuse me is coming out as well which looks to be actually
7380320	7385520	funny enough i was just kind of like boohooing about no clubhouse games type of thing on the
7385520	7390160	switch from nintendo this actually kind of looks to be kind of like it's like tabletop type of
7390160	7395040	games um but it looks like you're like building cars and building like little soccer things so
7395040	7401200	it's like you like build these little creations and then play like ping pong type of games and
7401200	7405920	racing games and things with them so it kind of looks kind of interesting like a build it and
7405920	7410720	play it type of game so it looks kind of neat so i wonder if we have a localized version of that
7410720	7414960	here i don't think we do it doesn't look familiar to me how about uh europe dark soccer quite a few
7414960	7422960	things actually we have football manager 2020 vr ping pong pro shen mu 3 um those are all on the
7422960	7431120	18th um on the 20th we have a sniper ghost warrior uh contracts asterix and obelix we have blaze blue
7431120	7441200	cross tag battle special edition on the 21st civ 6 on the 21st for playstation and xbox um new
7441280	7447120	super lucky's tale on the 21st ghost parade uh train sim world collectors edition
7447920	7453120	zumba burn it up and uh children of morta all of the 21st
7455360	7461360	all right das yet great well we're gonna move on and check the email i don't know why the chatters
7461360	7466400	the chatters are hearing thumping was somebody thumping the mic just be careful no but i was
7466640	7471600	something the bass all right anyway well i mean thank that part that party shut up right when our
7471600	7475440	show started yeah good and it wasn't it wasn't the same neighbors apparently i have two neighbors that
7475440	7479280	like to party i was about to go in your backyard and just scream i know i know you were anyway
7479280	7484240	i'd do it too well i'm glad the thumbing's gone sorry guys uh but moving on let's get into our
7484240	7489440	email bag so every week you guys uh email us participate at orangelandtrader.com and we read
7489440	7496160	our favorite emails here on the show so apparently we have one uno one uno mail um do you believe the
7496160	7502080	success of nintendo switch will push back against the trend of 60 gigabyte online required games
7502080	7504400	also bought super multitasking robert m
7507440	7513760	no i do not believe it will do that first off why are your us a quarter just kidding no that's
7513760	7518320	great i'm glad i'm glad uh why we are his appearance on the last show got some uh coverage
7518320	7525440	for super multitasking that's great um the 60 gig trend is the success of the nintendo switch gonna
7525440	7530080	reverse that uh i'm gonna give a nice big hearty note of that they're gonna get bigger but
7530080	7535760	nintendo's gonna keep doing nintendo's thing uh i'm kind of with you i actually also would say
7535760	7540960	nintendo is kind of not immune to these gigantic downloads i mean they are smaller because the
7540960	7545920	system doesn't necessarily handle full 1080p or what have you or have the onboard storage as a
7545920	7552960	store 16 gigs correct but well i was gonna say wasn't like xenoblade chronicles 2 like a pretty
7552960	7559520	gigantic gals at least 20 if not 30 gigs so i don't i don't i wouldn't say just because the
7559520	7564240	nintendo switch is smaller doesn't mean that they don't have gigantic games that exist on it so uh
7564240	7568000	and the witcher like didn't the witcher have to download that was a huge download as well
7568000	7574480	on switch so i and overwatch has to do that i don't see nba 2k also had like a thing yeah i
7574480	7579760	don't think uh i don't think the nintendo switch is really immune to this and it's it's not i i
7580160	7586240	no it's not gonna change there's always going to be the small indie hits such as super multitasking
7586240	7592000	is a great example there you know that's a much smaller game not even one gig uh for that game
7592000	7597440	you know sometimes good things can come in smaller sizes um but i think you know as we get into the
7597440	7602640	next generation of games when we talk about playstation 5 and we talk about the next xbox
7603280	7610480	you know it's going to be about bigger better graphics 4k more bigger more frames a second
7610480	7618400	virtual reality games are only going to get bigger yo unless streaming and the cloud can make up for
7618400	7622480	some of that which i think is especially going to happen on the xbox side of things we have yet to
7622480	7627360	see what might happen on sony side of things so um to be determined when we know more about the
7627360	7633600	system on how the data will work there uh but i i just think the games are going to get bigger
7633600	7638240	um if not incorporating more streaming or something like that well one of the things
7638240	7643040	we didn't talk about uh which was the story that happened last week as well was that patent that
7643040	7651760	they had for sony about a cartridge for possibly a playstation oh interesting because we do know
7651760	7657680	that solid state drive is where it's going to so could could they just be selling games that
7657680	7663040	are on little hard drives yeah like uh it could be i mean like it could be solid state drives or like
7663040	7668480	you know nvms or something like that just inside some sort of cartridge shell huh it's like the
7668480	7675840	modern day zip disk except much faster yes yes much faster those are actual discs still it's true
7675840	7680720	it's true so interesting i'll be i'll be very curious to see where that goes again we don't
7680720	7685120	know until sony you know pulls back the curtain completely and shows us what the but wouldn't that
7685120	7690080	be something if the sony the company that was kind of responsible in many ways for shifting the
7690080	7694480	industry to cd-based stuff you know and then dv and it still could be both could yeah it's true
7694480	7699200	it could be both and it may pull us back towards cartridge well the switch i guess is going to a
7699200	7705680	cartridge format but but still it'll be it'll be very interesting to see um how that goes yeah so
7705680	7710480	all right well um moving on then if that was it for our email bag we encourage you to email us
7710480	7716320	in a future week participate at orange lounge radio.com in the meantime loki what do we have
7716320	7722880	in gaming news so there is a brand new feature that's being added to the xbox one it's basically
7722880	7730720	like a shuffle button or a new surprise me button is added to the xbox one uh game library i don't
7730720	7736720	know what i want to play pick for me pretty much that's exactly what it is uh it says the button
7736720	7745920	doesn't automatically launch a game but um it will basically do like a roulette and pick a game
7745920	7754000	for you misfortune turn turn turn show us a lesson that we should learn so it's like you know neat
7754000	7759280	i guess but yeah it'll just kind of at random um pick something out for you that would be if i
7759280	7762880	think that's going to be fun for streamers okay well it doesn't actually do like a roulette thing
7762880	7767040	but it'll actually pick up okay here's a game you know and you pick the option and you're like
7767040	7770560	oh i don't want that and then you can do something else yeah but that's that's still going to be a fun
7770560	7775120	thing for streamers i think or it's like you know i'm i need that for steam microsoft pit you need
7775120	7779760	that for steam yeah yeah i'm kind of surprised there's got to be like a plug-in or a mod or
7779760	7783840	something that somebody well they're supposed to with the the redesign of their uh ui they're
7783840	7789600	supposed to be doing some sort of um thing where it's supposed to show you games you haven't
7789600	7794960	they're in your backlog they haven't played in a little while or ever which is most of mine yeah
7794960	7798800	i think i think this is a fun idea especially when you're like i don't know what i want to play
7798800	7803120	pick for me or like for games pass or something yeah especially if it's especially if it's like
7803120	7807520	stuff that's already installed on my end i don't have to i don't have to wait it's like press the
7807520	7812160	button it's like hey did you remember that you purchased uh kingdom hearts 3 a while ago but
7812160	7817920	you had never played it no i completely forgot about that i purchased kingdom hearts 3 and would
7817920	7820560	you like to see the value of your sixty dollar video no
7823360	7826160	is that what you've wasted i'm purchasing games you'll never play
7827520	7832320	remember all those deals that you thought that you just couldn't pass up that ten dollar ea game well
7832320	7837360	you played none of them i would like to see you know a nintendo use this on their uh classics
7837360	7842160	library you know hopefully it gets bigger although come to think of it nintendo hasn't
7842160	7848960	expanded than i was just gonna say that the so have we gotten any new snes or nes classics
7848960	7855440	nope nope nope it's been a couple months but nope nothing yet so wait for that next direct i guess
7856560	7861440	i'm just not holding my breath anymore for them i that's probably a good call i would think there's
7861440	7866240	still plenty of room to expand on the super nintendo side but we'll see we'll see anyway
7866240	7871360	uh moving on let's talk about pokemon go uh related uh news and this is actually a really
7871360	7878080	big deal so niantic wayfarer actually opened up this week uh this used to be operation portal
7878080	7883760	recon which was niantic's version of uh adding new portals or places of interest for the ingress
7883760	7888240	player base what's very notable about this is that you don't have to play ingress anymore if you want
7888240	7894320	access to this so now if you have a pokemon go account that's level 40 i was about to say level
7894320	7899280	40 or higher but level 40 is as high as you can go so if you have a level 40 pokemon go account you
7899280	7904800	now have access to niantic wayfarer and you can submit places of interest uh you can submit i
7904800	7910720	think seven in a rolling two-week period or you can also review other submissions that people
7910720	7918800	have submitted and mine is still pending from may wow well give it and i did even did that upgrade
7918800	7923120	next whatever the hell that did nothing well give it a few more days because now the pokemon go
7923120	7926960	players are they're reviewing things and i'm seeing more stuff get processed pretty quickly
7926960	7933440	i've had two new things added just in the past week um so we'll see so i got a brand new pokey
7933440	7939840	stop by work and i got a brand new pokey stop um where i guess i can say it where the mongolian
7939840	7943680	barbecue place is here there's now a pokey stop there because there's a church a strip mall church
7943680	7948640	right next door to it ah convenient mongolian barbecue sounds good i know it's it's that place
7948640	7955200	that looks like it hasn't changed since the 1970s yeah yeah so anyway uh but yeah now folks can
7955200	7959680	submit their own stops and i i think people are pretty excited about that granted as an ingress
7959680	7968000	player because ingress is very pvp heavy i've had my reservations about this but i also realized
7968000	7973040	that there's a big backlog of submissions on the ingress side of things because unfortunately
7973040	7979360	clearly there is faction bias coming into play absolutely uh which is stupid and uh something
7979360	7984000	needs to be done about it so if pokemon go players can come in and help break the tie
7984000	7988480	faction bias like do they see which faction you are if you're voting on it i will tell you i have
7988480	7995520	submitted things in this area where i live and i know that the opposing team sees that it's in
7995520	8004400	this area knows that it's near me and denies it based on that so i i've seen i've seen and i've
8004400	8010400	seen people on our side do it too i've seen the criteria applied a little stricter when a portal
8010400	8016480	pops up on burnin and riverside over in roseville than maybe when it does well not so much anymore
8016480	8021920	but maybe a couple years ago like you know i would just not to say they just the criteria will be a
8021920	8026800	little more stringent so i think there is sometimes a little more affection bias that comes into play
8026800	8032240	um and i think uh the pokemon go players are going to help break that tie a little bit my hope though
8032240	8039520	is that because ingress is very player versus player those little libraries on people's lawns
8039520	8044400	better not fucking become places of interest everywhere you know it's fine if it's in a park
8044400	8051360	or in a church parking lot because those are public accessible things but you know like private places
8051360	8056240	need to not become portals and stuff and they really shouldn't be pokey stops or jimmies
8056240	8062160	gyms either just because you want one on your couch um so hopefully it's going to take a
8062160	8068640	consensus of the players from both games to get things added and i think at the end of the day
8068640	8074800	that'll be a good thing if that's the case so anyway i just have a news flash by the way what's
8074800	8079760	that you know how i've been waiting for detroit to become human to be out on uh pc oh is it now
8079760	8084880	release date december 31st oh oh the new year's new year's eve present to yourself how about that
8084880	8090320	yeah i just thought i would make a mention yeah so anyway uh yeah so sj100 matt says pokemon go
8090320	8095280	players on my discord from my local area have been buying large sculptures for their front lawns
8095280	8101120	to make it into pokey stops they should save their fucking money because any ingress player
8101120	8106880	especially is that who has is in our chat and i know has reviewed at least 10 000 portal
8106880	8113120	submissions how many is that are you at right now um the minute you see that that's on private
8113120	8118560	property deny and i do the same thing if it's if it's in a residential neighborhood and on private
8118560	8122320	property i mean if it's a park in a residential neighborhood obviously that's okay if it's a
8122320	8126560	mural for a church that's like interest i mean as long as you know i'll look at google maps to make
8126560	8130640	sure it's denoted as a church and things like that but for the most part if it's in a residential
8130640	8136000	neighborhood we're fucking denying it like because that's not a valid place and i'm not creeping in
8136000	8141120	my car at 2 a.m to throw a blocker for somebody's front lawn and whoever you know you might think
8141120	8146400	that's a good idea until that ex raid shows up at your house and then you know everybody's there
8146400	8151360	that's gonna be a bad idea so if you think buying a sculpture for your front lawn is a good idea
8151360	8157760	don't what is a good idea let's say you live in a really underrepresented part of the nation like
8157760	8162080	a rural part of the country or you live in a country that you know is really poorly
8162080	8167360	represented with stops like mexico or you know most of central america and south america for
8167360	8174640	heaven's sake then the park your public park nearby the sign should be a portal the playground
8174640	8178720	structure should be a portal if there's like a community garden that should be a portal
8178720	8183680	uh you know all that stuff submit them submit them all because they're all valid um basketball
8183680	8189280	courts horseshoe places all that stuff should be fine but they should be at public places of
8189280	8198240	interest not your fucking toilet so no pooping stops unless it is a park restroom all right
8198240	8209200	anyhow uh azet by the way in our chat room has reviewed 17 835 so we we she's she's pretty
8209200	8217280	infamous can you review my place it's been there since may you might need to send a support to
8217280	8220560	especially if you've had it upgraded you should send a support ticket going there's still no
8220560	8226240	resolution i upgraded that months ago that's that's weird that it's still in the system so
8226240	8230640	all right anyway i'll be curious to see how this plays out by the way this is a chance for me to
8230640	8237200	give a cheap shout out for the pokemon go podcast um i was a guest on their most recent episode this
8237200	8242880	week which i think should have hit their podcast feed today if it didn't hit the feed today then
8242880	8247600	it will probably go up tomorrow and i'm actually very much professionally pulling up because it
8247600	8252000	was live on thursday but i think it's a few days days late oh yes there it is it went up today
8252000	8258880	so episode 173 of the pokemon go podcast i'm actually on it so i urge you all to check it out
8258880	8263680	and listen to it um and i talk about like ingress and all that stuff as well so check that out
8263680	8269360	so all right uh thank you to the pokemon go podcast and to uh joe over there for having me
8269360	8273440	on this week charles had the week off so it was just joe and i um on the show but we had a good
8273440	8279280	time so all right uh pod culture says what if you can hit a pokey stop from your shitter um if you
8279280	8285760	are if you happen to live like i think in your case i can't at work yeah in your case brad you
8285760	8290640	live across the street from a park you've said this so you're just in range then that's fine
8290640	8296000	you you luck the fuck out congratulations um and i know somebody else who lives in an apartment
8296000	8301440	complex where there's like a community building and the community building is a thing and they
8301440	8308400	can reach it from a certain part of their apartment so yeah so it happens you know you could
8308400	8313520	just consider yourself lucky you happen to live by a major point of interest good job all right
8314400	8320160	moving on uh let's get into uh dark sakura one of your favorite devs has something going on and
8320160	8327680	i'm trying to buy it except sites being stupid with my card number so anyway um so a game that
8327680	8336720	i have been pretty excited about coming out is whatom as in what um um it is by the creator of
8336720	8345280	katamari damashi um takashi kata and um it's got a release date december 17th and right now um on
8345280	8354400	the epic game store it is about 17 bucks so super discounted um but it's going to be on ps4 and pc
8354400	8359280	there's going to be a steam release at an unannounced date but basically you're a cube
8359280	8365600	shaped mayor person trying to get your weird townsfolk to get over their weird shit and help
8365600	8372160	each other out like including getting a balloon to get over its sphere of heights so um yeah play
8372160	8381360	a nice game that makes people play nice together be the weird cube mayor with a bowler hat have a
8381360	8389520	friend that's a poo and a fork what nothing i'm looking at chat for something else but um i i'm
8389520	8393920	interested in this game for sure i want to check it out i have to play the shit out of this weirdness
8393920	8400960	yeah because i like to nobi nobi boy yeah anyway i hate to go back to the pokemon go thing but
8400960	8409280	chatters chatters they get to say and matt found a statue that somebody put on their fucking lawn
8409280	8416480	just to try to get a pokestop and it is an ugly ass dog person and i i'm sorry guys i wish i could
8416480	8420480	put this on the twitch feed for you to see but you can see it in chat like matt just posted it there
8420480	8425280	it is this ugly ass dog thing that looks like i mean that thing looks like it's like eight feet
8425280	8430720	tall where the fuck did he find this and they went and as that says that's a humongous waste
8430720	8436000	of money i agree because here's the thing here's the problem and again i'm very sorry but i mean
8436000	8439280	for the podcast listeners anyway you're not going to have the visual so i'm going to explain this
8439280	8443120	the best i can i'm going to explain this as a reviewer and i'm going to explain why i would
8443120	8449200	ding this portal because here's the problem you can very clearly see there's a sidewalk
8449200	8456480	there right and then you see a bunch of like rocks that make that pronounce the sidewalk
8456480	8463040	the problem is this statue is behind the rock and you know what that says to me this is on the
8463040	8468480	property because that makes up like what the property line is this statue is on the property
8468480	8474080	therefore it is private property therefore it is denied and i think as that would be on the
8474080	8478320	same page with me well that's why is that would say that's a humongous waste of money now if that
8478320	8483760	thing was in a public park or if that thing existed on the other side of the sidewalk
8484560	8489600	which i'm not telling this person to just move it there temporarily because the minute that thing is
8489600	8494880	gone it should get reported as gone and it would be removed anyway but if that was the type of
8494880	8500480	thing that existed permanently on the other side of the sidewalk as long as there was 24 7 access
8500480	8505360	safely to it it might it might be more because i don't know i'd have to weigh in a lot of different
8505360	8511600	factors into that but um yeah i mean one star reject private property like as that says and
8511600	8517440	you can clearly see the sculpture is on the private property so it's also really i'm telling
8517440	8521760	you what i mean i know a lot of the pokemon go players think us ingress reviewers are assholes
8521760	8528640	and you're right but i'm a fan of both games i'm level 40 in pokemon go and i'm level 16 in ingress
8528640	8533840	and let me tell you having a pokestop on your couch is not everything it's cracked up to be
8533840	8539040	you really have to think about what you are inviting to that because you're not just inviting
8539040	8544000	a pokestop for you to spin when you're pooping you're inviting a portal for people to battle on
8544000	8550960	you're inviting possibly a harry potter knowledge thing and in you're inviting all that shit onto
8550960	8557200	your lawn you know and who knows what other games niantic might release in the future so think
8557200	8563200	before you do something like this so yeah and as that says i promise you do not want to couch stop
8563200	8569280	yeah anyway all right thank you sj100 matt says he'll post a link to the picture in the podcast
8569280	8573920	episode comments so you guys can see that over at vog network.com thank you thank you so much for
8573920	8578080	that i appreciate that okay let's move on sorry i know we got a little off topic but i'm sorry
8578080	8584960	it's bizarre somebody bought an eight foot ugly ass dog person statue just to get a pokemon stop
8584960	8592480	on their pooper like it's wow wow or they just i don't know i don't know if they bought it just
8592480	8597680	for that but you know oh maybe they just thought it was a pretty maybe they're just like uh they
8597680	8603120	just you know you know i just like y'all that really desperately want these pokemon stops on
8603120	8609120	your house humor me for a minute the point of these games is to walk
8611680	8617360	now or i guess you could drive but really walking's best or biking biking's great
8617360	8625120	bike team best team right so the point of these games is to walk so maybe it's okay
8625120	8634160	that you walk to your park and get this even rural towns have parks anyway okay i've had my piece
8635440	8640720	tweet me if you don't like it mr rob roberts on twitter all right uh let's move on loki you have
8640720	8646160	something else to talk about yes so uh the game awards will be streamed to participating
8646240	8654000	cinemark theaters on december 12th and along with that apparently if you buy the 20 ticket you also
8654000	8661680	get treated to jumanji the next level that movie will be showing right before the game awards
8663200	8671600	okay i guess i guess if you're really interested in seeing that um so that's technically a day
8671600	8678160	earlier you get a special treat to see that movie or suffer through it and watch the game awards um
8679760	8686640	so yeah so it starts at 445 central and then the game awards or it's starting at 7 30 p.m central
8686640	8693920	god does i hope that movie is not that long um yeah i don't know i don't know if i'd i would
8693920	8699280	not want to do this i certainly wouldn't go to the jumanji thing it's on thursday i really don't
8699280	8704320	need to go i'll just i'll watch it on my phone like i do every year and when i watch i mean
8705280	8711440	i may catch the trailers after it's done yeah i mean i think jeff's done a much better job
8711440	8716000	crafting a decent game award show who are they giving the lifetime award to this year do we know
8716000	8719920	i don't know that was the best part of it when they gave it to roberta williams that was the
8719920	8724800	year i watched um but i didn't watch last year so anyway um but i'm curious who they're going
8724800	8729440	to get lifetime thing too this year um i don't think i would go watch it trapped in a movie
8729440	8733280	theater i like watching it in the comfort of my home with fast forward but i was just thinking
8733280	8738160	while you're kind of talking about this like oh we you know microsoft just had a big event where
8738160	8742160	they showed all these trailers we don't have anything like that from sony or nintendo and
8742160	8750480	then i'm thinking oh those guys tend to do stuff with game awards huh do you think maybe that's why
8750480	8755040	microsoft said some stuff and not to say microsoft won't have anything but do you think that maybe
8755040	8760640	like sony and nintendo especially are saving some things for the game awards i don't know we'll see
8760640	8767440	maybe it'll be another death straining trailer interesting no death straining too all right
8769200	8774960	all right uh anyway moving on to one more story here and i apologize i don't have video of this
8774960	8780480	i ran out of time but i did pull this from um our uh discord as well and apparently you know
8780480	8785760	the sonic the hedgehog part three the soundtrack saga in that game where michael jackson kind of
8785760	8790640	ghost wrote some of the uh songs or at least that they replaced a bunch of tracks for later releases
8790640	8795920	yeah exactly well apparently some of the game archive folks out there namely the websites the
8795920	8801680	hidden palace and the cutting room floor um apparently have found prototypes of um sonic
8801680	8807920	the hedgehog cd sonic chaos which was an 8-bit game and then prototypes of sonic the hedgehog 2
8807920	8813840	but the final release of the month of their sonic prototypes a pre-release version of sonic the
8813840	8820240	hedgehog 3 it was a prototype dated november 3rd 1993 and the game is still in the early process
8820240	8825760	of being uh in two parts so some of the parts that are with sonic and knuckles sonic and knuckles are
8825760	8831600	you know kind of not all done yet but anyway uh apparently some of the music in this game is
8831600	8836000	different some of the experiments in the game uh there's different commands like a ring throwing
8836000	8842640	projectile attack uh an aerial spin dash uh buffer that kind of looks like sonic mania's drop dash
8842640	8851120	and of course some of the uh musical changes as well um sega had announced michael jackson as a
8851120	8855440	composer but then quickly pulled that announcement probably because of what was going on in
8855440	8862400	courtrooms around the same time um and um yeah apparently in this uh version of it uh there's
8862400	8868000	replacement tunes uh that were in fact the original tunes that were in by sega and swapped
8868000	8873360	out for jackson's stuff like carnival night zone ice cap zone launch based zone and knuckles theme
8873360	8879520	the versus mode jingle and so forth those songs were originally composed tunes that michael
8879520	8888240	jackson's tracks replaced so interesting so a lot of uh a lot of replacing changing last minute
8888240	8894640	stuff going on with sonic 3 that this prototype is just adding along to the drama with so it does
8894640	8901280	show where those replacement tracks came from so yeah no i i freaking love sonic stuff so yeah
8901840	8907040	yeah um but i liked you know despite all the controversy around michael jackson you know the
8907040	8913200	music being the music um i thought some of the stuff that you know was there was really good so
8913200	8918720	pretty cool anyway uh dr c says the alternate cuts are up on youtube of course everybody's gone to
8918720	8922880	town on this you can check out those game archive websites as well if you want to see a little more
8922880	8930080	on the missing sonic 3 um sj100 matt is pointing out um i will say the church's song and death
8930080	8936000	stranding is fantastic it really is the church's i i the death stranding full soundtrack should be

8945040	8948640	it so i don't know about the others because i remembered there's being something about
8948640	8952960	like a limited well spotify had the church's things i don't see why they wouldn't yeah yeah
8952960	8958000	the whole the whole album is on apple music oh okay i want to check that out that's pretty cool
8958000	8961200	did it did you did you like the church's song did you like that because it's the ending credits
8961200	8966240	song right um it actually there's a song that plays in the game too while it's there
8966240	8973040	um the video i watched had to cut part of it out for for licensing oh interesting huh i'm gonna
8973040	8978480	go ahead and also go completely off the cuff here and say the mustang mock e is ugly as balls and
8978480	8982320	doesn't look like a fucking that is completely off the cuffs that's all right i'm just saying i had i
8982320	8987360	was like i was getting mustang stuff for dan it's fine it's fine all right well we are about to the
8987360	8992880	part of the show where we're gonna uh open up our discord for some telephone calls so if you
8992880	8997600	want to get in on the show tonight you can join our green room and we'll head over there or if
8997600	9005440	you have general questions you want to ask us as well you can um you can uh ask those in chat as
9005440	9009280	well do you have any last minute stories for us loki while we get set up there's a weird issue
9009280	9013600	with pokemon sword and shield that apparently is crashing roku devices connected to the network
9013600	9018400	that it's being played on something has to do with the packets that the game is sending back
9018400	9025280	and forth um are crashing those devices connected to your network which is weird i also they also
9025280	9030160	had another issue with your um sd cards getting corrupted too so the game's got all sorts of
9030160	9034720	problems apparently the sd card thing is getting blown way out of proportion like somebody did
9034720	9038480	a breakdown about that it's it's more of a bug than it is something that's like affecting like
9038480	9043760	tons of people and you have to do a very specific thing for that to happen yeah so but social media
9043760	9048080	kind of spread that like wildfire but anyway let's go to the phones because you're ready to
9048080	9053440	talk some pokemon because i see who's calling in right now so um hi shane are you there on the line
9054160	9061520	yes hi how are you i am good i just beat pokemon shield actually while you guys were doing your
9061600	9069040	show you beat pokemon shield yes i'm but you know oh go on sorry how many hours
9070000	9077360	i think it said like 38 okay um and in my little pokemon group i have uh i'm only like the
9078000	9085120	fourth or fifth one to beat it so i was pretty slow compared to other people and you've been
9085120	9091360	you've been playing some long hours on this game right yes and no so for the first day i played
9092160	9098000	10 hours straight i guess that first night i redid my sleep schedule it's been awful
9098560	9105600	um but then this weekend i've been doing like burst playing um because you know i was hanging
9105600	9111760	out with dustin since the weekend and he's off work and he also got the new star wars games so
9111760	9119600	we were watching him play that and stuff so yeah um all right into it i'm sure the people that have
9119600	9124640	been listening to orange on radio for a long time and know what a fan of pokemon you are really want
9124640	9130800	to know what's your take how does pokemon sword and shield measure up is it worthy of being
9130800	9141760	generation eight uh or did game freak lie okay so it it's so hard to to say this because it's only
9141760	9147520	been out for three days um and i'm still doing the post game stuff there's post game stuff of course
9147520	9159280	and um i am very comfortable at least saying that it is really close to gen 5 in terms of my
9159280	9168080	favorite like pokemon game it has the potential actually to surpass it for me and this was a lot
9168080	9172720	better experience than i could have possibly thought it was going to be that's a pretty heavy
9172720	9177280	endorsement why do you think why do you think this game is winning for you in that regard like
9177280	9184480	what is this bringing to the table for you so i think the main things for me that make this
9184480	9192320	such an enjoyable experience um i feel like the story is pretty focused especially for a pokemon
9192320	9200400	game um it's it's almost split into two parts but the main part the whole um gym challenges that you
9200400	9208800	do for this you know basically sporting event style uh um pokemon league it's it's actually
9208800	9215440	really good i thought it was probably the best direction they've ever taken with doing gyms and
9215440	9223760	all the badge stuff um and then the side story that's going on is is pretty entertaining um at
9223760	9228560	least it's interesting i'm not sure entertaining is the right word but i didn't ever feel like
9228560	9237280	there was a dull moment so all that is great um the gym is pretty great i don't know if you heard
9237280	9243120	me say that earlier in the show it's so good yeah yeah it's pretty great actually the music as a
9243120	9249600	whole is really good in this game which which track did toby fox do do we know uh it definitely
9249600	9258320	doesn't play during the main story so it's after you beat it um what else so i am okay with the
9258320	9266160	culling of the decks i think it actually worked out to its advantage um even though my favorite's
9266160	9271600	gone like i love oshawott it's my favorite pokemon in the world it's not in this game
9272400	9280080	oh well like all i would have done is brought it in to breed it to make it shiny that's literally
9280080	9286800	literally like the only thing i do with old pokemon that aren't in the decks um what else
9287680	9294640	wants to know your favorite pokemon from this gen oh god okay so there are so many good ones
9294640	9304560	i can give you a top three but i can't put them in an order so ice q which is a an adorable ice
9304560	9311280	penguin i love him i thought he was stupid at first and he actually like really helped out my
9311280	9319600	team toxtricity which is electric and poison type and like it has two forms and one's like
9319600	9325040	a bass guitar type uh player and the other is like someone straight up gives you one of those
9325040	9333600	right i think i just got yeah the the pre-evolution toxel so yeah um and then finally
9333600	9340640	intellion uh which i'm sorry it's three days after the game and you've seen pictures by
9340640	9349680	now it's the water starter final evo okay so those are my top three um what do you think of
9349680	9357200	the wide open area the uh wild zone i actually like it but probably not for the reasons they
9357200	9364240	really want us to like it um it chugs if you're online which kind of sucks the frame rate drops
9364240	9371520	considerably when other people are in that same area as you and that's okay whatever um i you
9371520	9375840	know it's cool to see all the pokemon walk around i actually prefer them on the routes rather than
9375840	9381040	the wild area because i'm just trying to maneuver in the wild area to get to different places but
9381040	9388560	the max raid battles are the best thing this game has done in a long long time doing four player
9388560	9396160	co-op oh me and my little group of pokemon friends we did it for hours last night um it's just
9396800	9404320	so much fun yeah i actually tapping on a screen like over and over i think those raids are are
9404320	9410400	part of the strength of uh this this particular gen of pokemon as well and i it does i mean whether
9410400	9415200	y'all agree with me or not it really feels kind of inspired by pokemon go in a way you know that
9415200	9420560	idea of like teaming up to take on a big uh gigantic version of a pokemon that then scales
9420560	9426240	down to something you can catch like that does feel like it was inspired by pokemon go one
9426240	9433040	bummer about it and i think this is just i'll blame gamefreak and nintendo is the lack of
9433040	9438640	being able to communicate with the random players you're paired with or not paired with but if they
9438640	9447200	join your um your lobby to fight the pokemon because for example last night i got into a raid
9447200	9453920	for a pokemon that was the gigantamax form which is much more rare to find and they're really cool
9454880	9463280	and so it was a fire bug type so three of us took you know great counters for it i took intellion
9463280	9469040	i think somebody else took intellion and somebody took something else the fourth person took
9470000	9478160	score bunny's final evolution and score bunny is fire type and the pokemon we fought was fire and
9478160	9485840	bug plus it had an ability that every time it would get hit by a fire move it would get uh like
9485840	9495040	a attack increase and so this one player not only was using fire moves but they also dynamax their
9495040	9503280	pokemon and only one person gets to do that and so like it was a waste of our entire collective time
9503280	9508160	because of that one person vg realness and chat says it was probably a kid they probably didn't
9508160	9513040	know but like yeah and you you would have liked a way to like wave a flag and say try something
9513040	9518560	else like please yeah or like some appropriate counter yeah or some like preset chat options
9518560	9528640	that say like hey uh let me dynamax or something so before that person did it they you know wouldn't
9528640	9534880	dynamax or quit using fire the fire moves thing was what really actually made me mad because it
9534880	9541520	literally says when you hit it with it like a thing pops up with its ability and it just
9541520	9546880	increases their attack or whatever and they kept doing it over and over yeah even whatever even
9546880	9550720	a canned message that says try a water type pokemon or something probably would have been
9550720	9560000	better right yeah um but otherwise i think those are mostly implemented very well and it is kind
9560000	9565760	of a bummer that i feel like they will not be back in whatever comes after this i think this
9565760	9570960	is going to stay kind of standard to just sword and shield no matter how much we all say it's
9570960	9578400	amazing um let me ask you i want to ask you some other bits of the controversy well what's what's
9578400	9585040	your whole take on the the wave against this game on twitter and what you know the the the fact that
9585040	9590400	people are going so far as to attack ign for a good review when they attacked ign for a bad review
9590800	9596960	uh and then uh are attacking sarahb.net of all places which blew my mind when those guys work
9596960	9606320	for virtually nothing um i think they're just whiny idiots to put it like the nicest way possible
9607040	9614880	uh there's really no need to do something like that i feel like if you have the time to
9615280	9623120	make death threats and write reviews to bomb metacritic with you know negative reviews
9624000	9628960	uh you could be doing something much more productive and it really shows how sad your life
9628960	9633360	is yeah and if you if you don't like it which folks out there have every right to not like this
9633360	9637920	game or not want this game don't buy it don't buy it exactly like that yeah the bottom line is
9637920	9643360	nothing will send a stronger message than not buying the game but yeah the thing that blows my
9643360	9646720	the thing that blows my mind is everybody on there complaining and then they they buy it anyway
9647920	9655680	yeah and like what you can be mad about certain things uh that they cut or that they change
9656240	9663360	and that's cool be mad about it it's you're right but when you start like throwing a fit
9663360	9670160	over positive reviews that i don't know do you not see how sad you are at that point
9670160	9678400	uh just it blows me away um so what else would i what else would i ask about this oh let me
9678400	9684720	one other take on the um controversy out there would be the whole like the game was rushed do
9684720	9690720	you think that maybe because even i'm kind of thinking like well i mean optimization wise
9691280	9697120	i could make a case for maybe this game maybe wasn't totally ready for the holiday but it was
9697120	9702720	kind of one of those it nintendo needed something for the holiday so they made it happen um and i
9702720	9706320	you know again i think the game came out fine but i definitely like we're talking about the wild
9706320	9713200	area kind of it kind of gets a little yucky and maybe needed a little more optimization um do you
9713200	9719520	think the game was rushed do you think more time would have helped this game or what i think that's
9719520	9725600	the case for every game that comes out um i think if they had more time they could have added more
9725600	9732800	pokemon they could have done whatever but i don't think we're we've been given an inferior product
9733520	9740880	i don't think that delaying it an extra you know month would have really made that big a difference
9741520	9749040	um i think it's i i don't think gamefreak's a great developer to begin with just technically
9749040	9755520	they do a lot of cool things but their games are always behind in some way and i didn't expect this
9755520	9765200	game to show me that they were like on the level of the developers uh nintendo's internal team for
9765200	9772960	like mario odyssey or anything like that but i wouldn't say this was rushed this feels complete
9772960	9780400	and awesome and like i said earlier what we were given is dangerously pushing up against my
9780480	9786640	favorite pokemon generation in terms of how much i like it now my last question for you and arguably
9786640	9793920	the most important question for you shane how many shinies do you have so far zero i okay so
9795600	9801840	no i no i agree um there's a couple things about that though like i have not really looked up
9801840	9807920	how shiny hunting is in this game so i don't know much about it yet and i don't have my shiny charm
9807920	9814800	which i i want i always like having that when it's available in the game so that's going to be an
9814800	9821440	after i beat everything and i'm ready to you know just kind of chill with my pokemon game
9821440	9829360	now granted with the addition of all the multiplayer content i feel like shiny hunting
9829360	9834880	while i love it a whole bunch i'm gonna get distracted like by oh look somebody is connecting
9834880	9840080	to a raid i really want to do i better hop in that lobby and do it as well um and that's
9840080	9845440	something i didn't touch on it took me eight hours to get to the first gym because i fell down this
9845440	9850960	hole of just wanting to do max raid battles and just i kept going and going i was having so much
9850960	9858320	fun yeah that that's how all my my friends that were playing passed me because i just i couldn't
9858320	9867840	stop you get all that xp candy yes that's a hundred percent true and it helps it helps so
9867840	9877200	much especially like for example i picked up um ice cube towards the end and he was severely
9877200	9883680	under leveled compared to what i already had with me so i was like here have some candies and he
9883680	9889120	shot up to uh like he actually surpassed he's my strongest pokemon now in terms of level at
9889120	9894560	least or my highest level not strongest it's pretty weak i just yeah like it's great you
9894560	9900880	know the terms better than i do but that little turtle that little blue turtle thing so i i don't
9900880	9908320	know the name of it but it's like a water pokemon oh wait wait chudel or dreadnaw okay so i just
9908400	9915920	put him in my party so because i just beat the water gym i took um i took something out of my
9915920	9922640	party that was strong against water um it must have been a grass maybe it was gossip floor i
9922640	9927680	think i yeah i think i had gospel in my party so i took gospel out and i put chudel in but
9927680	9933040	chudel was like level 15 where the rest of my party was like level 21 so i fed wait you took
9933040	9938720	you took chudel to the water gym to fight in the water no no no no no no chudel was in the box
9938720	9944720	while gossip floor oh okay and then wait really quick before you continue that story that's
9944720	9950480	another amazing thing that you can change your pokemon almost like 99 on the fly when you're not
9950480	9956720	in a battle yeah but you can't when you do gyms you can't run out and heal up like you used to do
9956720	9961920	in the old games and the game does let you heal up a lot like there's a lot of npc's they'll just
9961920	9965840	be like i'm gonna heal your pokemon and some people were criticizing the game for that but
9965840	9970960	i'm like you know what it's a quality of life thing because i run back almost all the time
9970960	9975760	and heal my pokemon before fighting another npc like it's just part of the game right so i like
9975760	9979840	that they have more places to do that but when you do the gyms you don't get to do that anymore
9979840	9986000	you have to fight everything in one go which is interesting um but like my fucking my grookey
9986000	9990720	which was thwacky or whatever his name is when he's evolved like dominated that water gym that
9990720	9996800	was all i needed just tore everybody apart in that gym so um i i didn't even need the gossler
9996800	10001680	but anyway i was gonna say about the chudel so like my chudel's level 15 the rest of my party's
10001680	10007600	like anywhere between 21 and like 26 so i was like okay i'm gonna do like two dynamax raid
10007600	10013360	and i fed chudel all the candy i got from the raids and the chudel evolved into whatever his
10013360	10020400	water rock form is so now he's the perfect fire gym uh thing uh and uh got to like level this
10020400	10026400	like my highest level pokemon now he's like level 27 or something yeah it those candies are such
10026400	10032320	a good idea like that's something that i feel like partially came from pokemon let's go which
10032320	10038960	was not a great game and they changed it to be an awesome addition instead of like oh whatever
10038960	10043440	well and the nice nice thing about those candies too is that usually i'm hesitant to use items
10043440	10048080	because it's like oh i might need those later but it's like no i know if i just go do more dynamax
10048080	10053520	rates i'll get more candy so i don't feel bad using those you know what i mean yeah and i i
10053520	10061280	feel you about the hesitant to use items and really don't feel too bad because that i'm not
10061280	10065600	going to spoil because there's story stuff i don't want to spoil who cares about the pokemon at this
10065600	10073440	point the eighth gym like tried to wreck me so hard i got down to one pokemon the eighth gym
10073440	10081280	was so rough for my team and it was it was really fun because of that okay actually all right i'm
10081280	10085840	curious about that so yeah i don't want to don't want to use up extra items i don't have to uh also
10085840	10090240	you know if you just a tip for those that have the game that may may not have already figured it out
10090240	10096880	if you did have let's go and you have the pokemon ball plus you can walk pokemon and you do get it
10096880	10100800	doesn't level them like it did in let's go so your pokemon are not going to gain experience that way
10100800	10106480	but they you will get items and i think xp candy can be included but you do get an assortment of
10106480	10113520	items for walking as well which is kind of neat i have not even used my extra pokeball plus yet
10113520	10117920	to get mu or do anything with it you should check it out but you have that'll make you play pokemon
10117920	10122080	go a little bit as well anyway shane i'm uh i'm gonna let you go because you've we've talked a
10122080	10129920	lot about uh pokemon but um are you doing a stream later tonight uh i wanted to do a max raid battle
10129920	10137040	stream however i actually have to get to bed early tonight so i cannot all right but i will probably
10137040	10143920	be doing a lot of max raid streams and anybody that has pokemon uh sword and shield that want
10143920	10150560	to come do them like if i'm streaming just hit me up i will be more than happy to come join and
10150560	10157040	blow things up with you and what's your uh twitch channel so people can follow uh i don't know what
10157040	10166800	is it shane you need to learn a little bit about promotion oh oh it's shad underscore star zic
10168960	10172560	maybe just type in the chat room hi it's shane and people will know that they can
10174160	10183920	yeah all right i wasn't planning on promoting it i'm just like i'm so engrossed in pokemon right
10183920	10187520	now it's fine all right thanks for calling and sharing your thoughts so i appreciate it
10188160	10193440	yeah no problem all right take care my friend bye-bye all right well i don't see anybody
10193440	10198240	else waiting to call in tonight uh do we have any other last minute stories to get into uh for
10198240	10207280	tonight um they capcom announced uh street fighter 5 championship edition oh uh so that's coming out
10207280	10211840	february 14th for 29.99 and let me guess it's the version that has like everything in it 40
10211840	10220880	characters 200 costumes 34 stages 2v skills for each character uh it's also 24.99 upgrade if you
10220880	10226880	have the original game um and they also announced gill as a playable character all right glad i
10226880	10233840	waited uh i also had a curiosity loki because uh you know she already she showed off her copy
10233840	10237920	of pokemon sword earlier you know i've been playing pokemon shield uh loki i know you've
10237920	10242720	kind of held out but as all this talk possibly swayed you on the pokemon thing i might get it
10242720	10249920	but i'm i i don't get very much access to the uh nintendo switch because while i was gone while we
10249920	10259120	were out i had to buy the god awful ryan toy review racing game it's a a kart racing game
10259120	10267200	because my my youngest my youngest son fucking loves that shill of a child um but he has a kart
10267200	10274000	racing game out and so i he needed to have that game so i bought him that game um but actually
10274000	10279600	ironically enough as i knew what would happen he'd get sick of that game super fast because uh
10280640	10285120	we've been talking about like uh minecraft and so he's actually been playing more minecraft
10285120	10291680	on the switch than anything so okay he plays minecraft on the switch a lot and then um i
10291680	10297200	ironically have been watching more minecraft streams on the switch or on um youtube because
10297200	10302160	there's for some reason my recommended keeps like it's minecraft but we programmed it to do
10302160	10306960	something different so watch it it's interesting like sounds up your alley you know yeah every
10306960	10313040	block drop something that's different you know and whatever all right you know one thing i i
10313040	10315600	keep meaning to get more and more into since you're talking about like things that are
10315600	10320000	different i keep down and i've i've been downloading and playing with them but randomizers
10320000	10325280	is a thing i'm like super fascinated with right now um like you know you can download uh especially
10325280	10331200	the one that like mixes the game super or metroid in zelda m1 z1 i think it's called the one that
10331200	10336000	mixes those and then there's actually one that mixes super metroid and link to the past together
10336000	10339760	yeah that's the one i was talking about what's the other one you're thinking there's an s1 m
10339760	10346400	or excuse me m1 z1 that mixes the nes versions so it's yeah but i and i was going to set up doing
10346400	10349840	those streams so i was having a problem using like the mapping thing but i think i got that all
10349840	10352960	figured out long story short i kind of like sat down and taught myself to use some stuff
10352960	10356160	so i might do some randomizer streams in the future because i just think that stuff is like
10356160	10360640	fascinating in a way but i almost think i want to keep it simple and just do like instead of
10360640	10365360	trying to mix zelda and metroid where i don't because there's certain logic that goes into
10365360	10369840	the randomizer stuff that i obviously i'm just trying to like jump in and learn um but i think
10369840	10375280	maybe i want to take on just just zelda first then we'll add metroid into it you know and all that
10375280	10379760	but the randomizer thing i think is really fascinating and the particular mapping thing
10379760	10386080	i downloaded has a bunch of randomizers that like it you know it doesn't you know you have to
10386080	10390160	put the roms on a website like it doesn't do it for you because it's trying to be legal about it
10390160	10394720	you know wink wink non-judge and i realize these things are in a gray area of legality but
10395360	10400400	y'all how many times have i bought the legend of zelda how many times i've bought the original
10400400	10405280	metroid because i'm gonna tell you i bought it back in the day on the nes i bought it you know
10405280	10408880	when they were on virtual console on the wii i bought it again on virtual console on the wii u
10408880	10413280	i probably bought the gameboy version of at least or gameboy uh advanced version one of those games
10413280	10417760	at some point so look pretty sure you have the gamecube version at one time i am allowed to take
10417760	10421120	those roms and do whatever the fuck i want with them i bought that game like five times i'll have
10421120	10427760	this snes classic so yeah so anyway all right anyway uh that's on that i'll talk more about
10427760	10431920	that on a future week if i do fall down that rabbit hole but honestly i should probably stay
10431920	10438400	focused on pokemon shield because like i think shane would like actually be speechless if i
10438400	10444240	actually beat a pokemon game i think he for once would like not know what to say so i'm gonna really
10444240	10449200	try to to stick it to the end of pokemon shield because i'm having a good time so far and then
10449280	10454320	i need to do my not so much hate play of death stranding because i need to figure out what all
10454320	10460400	this hubba baloo is about so i've got my one of the things i saw with death training that made
10460400	10465120	no sense because the game doesn't really make any sense but like i guess it's slightly stealthy so
10465120	10470160	that okay stop it um it does make a lot of sense when you okay but this part doesn't make sense
10470160	10474720	so just stop interrupting me already listen it's like you're trying to be stealthy and hiding in
10474800	10479200	like grass and stuff but yeah you have this like skyscraper of fucking packages sticking out of
10479200	10484720	the sky it's like i thought i heard somebody there it's like what is that it's like you see this
10484720	10489200	giant stack of boxes right there and like where the fuck did that come from and that's just a
10489200	10494080	little odd it's all right it's fine like you gotta have a power suit to carry all that around anyway
10494880	10501440	which he does but like it's just like we've given you a knee replacement and so does it explain the
10501440	10507360	monster energy thing does it explain that because it seems just plain just like shilling for the
10507360	10512800	fuck kinda all right i have to see for myself before some asshole spoils me all right anyway
10513440	10518320	they do explain what causes the crater to appear you need to play since you have apple arcade what
10518320	10523440	the gulf because what the gulf is free is part of apple it's great all right i'll get it i'll
10523440	10528160	download it right now all right anyhow on that note uh we started with games and we're ending
10528240	10532560	with games wow that's a first so we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts
10532560	10538000	we will be back next week um the holidays even fall on kind of nice days for the show this year
10538000	10541760	because the holidays are like tuesday wednesdays so we should still be here throughout the holidays
10541760	10546560	i'm not foreseeing that we're going to take any shows off so uh we hope to see you lots of sunday

10593600	10600240	yeah you know and actually the funny thing is our 800th episode would have been right in this mix if
10600240	10605840	you know i hadn't suddenly gotten or know that in the what was it the fucking internet cut out or
10605840	10612640	whatever it was anyway yeah anyway so uh yeah happy bemoni day that's a great one uh my final
10612640	10618960	thought is um i would like to not be sick for once in this past six weeks so i'm gonna cross
10618960	10624560	my fingers on my toes that tomorrow i wake up and i'm all better because sinus congestion sucks
10625360	10629760	last but not least dark soccer your final thought one of my that tweet that i said that i replied to
10629760	10635360	kojima saying i wanted to be the bridge baby got liked by the guy who played die hard man
10636400	10642400	uh tommy earl jenkins fun i just like when i get a random nod like hey that's cool isn't
10642400	10646640	it weird when like random celebrities like like your tweet actually you want to i didn't talk
10646640	10650400	about this on the show i'm gonna mention it here real fast and we'll wrap up the show i had a tweet
10650400	10655360	go viral this week and it had nothing to do and it like that has not happened to me before i've
10655360	10660720	never had i mean like maybe like a little bit viral like maybe hundreds of likes but not like
10660720	10665600	an epidemic no i had one it's up to 2 000 plus likes at this point but here's the thing i had
10665600	10670160	nothing to do with video games or any of that so okay what i did it was um on the day that
10670160	10674480	disney plus was released and i wrote it said um actually wait i'm gonna find it
10675920	10680720	i'm gonna i'm just not gonna like it on purpose rob no it's fine it's one of those things where
10680720	10686080	it's like i've just it's so random that of everything i've written this is the fucking tweet
10686080	10693680	that people that people find and like okay disney plus hey look at us we're the cool kid new kids on
10693680	10700400	the block netflix yeah well selena with the selena trailer attached that's it that's the
10700400	10707840	tweet that's all i wrote 486 retweets 2086 lights it's a valid point no it is it's completely valid
10707840	10712880	point like you know and then this turns into a whole conversation about how selena is literally
10712880	10719760	perfect how selena would change the music industry if she were still with us how you know and just
10719760	10724640	you know just selena stanning which is um something this world needs more of
10724640	10733200	so everybody uh stream uh selena oh by the way i do have a very final thought okay free hong kong
10733840	10740400	okay sounds good all right uh oh sj100 matt says didn't richard simmons like your tweet once rob
10740400	10748640	oh i think he did he wrote no he replied i think he replied once i remember something like that
10748640	10752640	i remember something like that too it was before it was before the because twitter has been around
10752640	10758320	since like 2006 so it was before he went missing so like i go into random conversations though
10758320	10764560	with lady bunny i mean seriously i know i've seen it yeah like on my facebook and on twitter it's
10764560	10770080	the funniest thing because lady bunny is twitter getting us closer to and i'll tell you this if you
10770080	10775440	want a really like a person who doesn't retweet bullshit for politics actually check out lady
10775440	10782160	bunny because the stuff posted is pretty well researched and very eloquently spoken all right
