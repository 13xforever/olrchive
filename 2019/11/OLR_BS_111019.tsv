0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	27000	There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
58000	61000	And how are you feeling?
61000	64000	I'm not drugged out of my brain anymore
64000	66000	Did you go back and listen to all the crazy things you said last week?
66000	67000	No
67000	68000	No, I'm just kidding
68000	70000	I don't listen to myself
70000	77000	Anyway, well hopefully the time off work and so forth while you're recuperating
77000	80000	Great time to watch a lot of random YouTubes and play some games
80000	84000	Actually it's time to build a website, rebuild a website
84000	88000	And yell at my computer while I'm playing The Sims
88000	90000	Fair enough
90000	92000	Also say hello to TechMasterLoki
92000	93000	Hello
93000	94000	Hi, how are you?
94000	95000	I'm fine
95000	97000	You and I are both dressed up in button up shirts today
97000	98000	We just got off work
98000	99000	It's very formal
99000	102000	It's a formal, it's a black tie
102000	104000	And DarkSakura is dressed up too
104000	105000	This is what I wear to work
105000	107000	You should see this wig she's got on
107000	109000	It's amazing and she's got makeup
109000	110000	I'm just kidding
110000	113000	Which is actually funny because I'm not wearing hardly any makeup
113000	118000	And I'm wearing a black flannel, a Captain Marvel t-shirt and leggings
118000	123000	I'm about as unformal, I look like the 90s, really
123000	125000	Revenge of the 90s
125000	126000	Except I have better eyebrows
126000	128000	I like the Captain Marvel shirt though, it's cute
128000	130000	Yeah, I paid four bucks for it at Target
130000	132000	A whole four dollars? No, that's a good deal
132000	136000	I've been all about the clearance racks and thrifting lately
137000	139000	Treasure hunting
139000	140000	We're not live tonight
140000	143000	This is kind of an extra episode that we're doing
143000	147000	We're taping, as I mentioned, Tuesday during the week
147000	149000	In advance of our usual Sunday night slot
149000	152000	Because as I've mentioned on a previous episode of the show
152000	155000	I'm going to be out of town this weekend
155000	157000	On a trip I planned like six months ago
157000	160000	Before all the other stuff that knocked us off the air
160000	163000	For a couple weeks previously came up
163000	167000	So we just wanted to make sure we at least kind of recorded something for you guys
167000	169000	That make it a habit to show up on Sunday nights live
169000	173000	And of course download us as part of your podcast rotation and all that
173000	176000	So we're doing a little bit of a special bonus episode tonight
176000	181000	Very free form, very unlike some of our usual episodes of Orange On Radio
181000	183000	So if it's your first episode of Orange On Radio
183000	186000	This may not be the best one to represent
186000	187000	It's just your appetizer
187000	189000	Yeah, that's a good way to put it
189000	190000	It's kind of like the appetizer
190000	194000	It's just a little bit of the three hour plus show
194000	199000	This last show we just did two days ago was three hours plus
199000	201000	It was like a three hour fifteen minute show
201000	203000	So tonight probably won't be as long
203000	205000	Because there simply just isn't as much to talk about
205000	209000	However, I am looking forward to a little later on in the show
209000	213000	We're going to be welcoming our good buddy and pal and friend
213000	218000	Game maker, independent game maker YYR is going to join us
218000	220000	For a little bit of a chat
220000	227000	And I am told he's going to break an exclusive here about his games on the show tonight
227000	228000	So that is very exciting
228000	230000	So we'll talk about that
230000	232000	So at least we still have a little excitement building here
232000	235000	On our special little mini edition of Orange On Radio
235000	238000	For those of you that are watching on Sunday night
238000	241000	Over at twitch.tv slash vog network
241000	244000	Where we usually do tape live every Sunday night
244000	246000	At six o'clock pacific, nine o'clock eastern
246000	247000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
247000	249000	For those of you that are there
249000	252000	You can still chat along with the show
252000	255000	And your comments will show up for at least two more days
255000	257000	Until twitch pulls the plug on all that
257000	259000	Which I don't, I have to be honest
259000	262000	I do love twitch or we wouldn't be using them as a platform to stream
262000	265000	But I don't understand why they got to get rid of that
265000	266000	Maybe it's a resource hog
266000	271000	Maybe for most channels it's just something really horribly underutilized
271000	272000	But I'm going to miss it
272000	274000	I'm going to miss the chat on the video on demand
274000	276000	So this is your last chance
276000	278000	Pour one out for the chat
278000	281000	But in fact right now in chat
281000	283000	Push F to pay respects
283000	285000	For the video on demand
285000	286000	That way I'll know who is here
286000	288000	I even saw an article that
288000	291000	The pay F for respects is five years old today
291000	293000	That's right it's celebrating a birthday
293000	296000	That meme is five years old
296000	299000	Oh my gosh we're all getting older
299000	301000	You know what quick aside
301000	303000	Because we never get on tangents here on Orange On Radio
304000	307000	I was at work today and talking with a co-worker
307000	311000	And the subject of the classic 70s, late 70s, early 80s
311000	314000	Television program Mork and Mindy came up
314000	317000	And my co-worker who is a few years younger than I am
317000	319000	Had no idea who Mork and Mindy was
319000	323000	And like I had to explain like you know like Robin Williams
323000	325000	Big TV, Nanu Nanu, nope
325000	327000	No idea who Mork and Mindy was
327000	329000	Oh come on everyone knows Pam Dauber
329000	332000	I know and it was Robin Williams
332000	335000	And then even my other co-worker who totally knew the show
335000	337000	Was like and who is the gal that played Mindy
337000	338000	What was her name
338000	339000	I'm like Pam Dauber
339000	340000	What else was she in
342000	345000	She was in that movie Stay Tuned with John Ritter
345000	347000	She was also, wasn't she in
349000	351000	I don't remember what else Pam Dauber was in
351000	352000	No she was in a TV movie
352000	355000	And I know about this because she was playing
355000	357000	Someone who was meant to be Lisa Dalby
357000	361000	Who was the woman who worked for a year in the 70s
361000	364000	As an actual geiko in Kyoto
364000	368000	As in what they call geisha in Kyoto
368000	370000	Who worked for a year as a geiko
370000	373000	She was there working on her like her doctorate thesis
373000	376000	I think on kimono and geiko culture
376000	379000	So but I saw that movie I knew she was in it
379000	382000	Well who knew listening to Orange Lawn's radio this week
382000	384000	I'd learned something about Pam Dauber
384000	386000	And wasn't she in that 80s series
387000	390000	She wasn't in My Sister Sam was she
390000	392000	I don't know can somebody pull up her wikipedia
392000	393000	I'm looking
393000	395000	But you remember that show right My Sister Sam
395000	399000	Oh yeah I think that was her
399000	401000	Yeah I do remember that
401000	403000	Was that the show
403000	405000	The girl also died
405000	406000	I was like was that the show
406000	409000	Yeah it was Pam Dauber and Rebecca Schaefer
409000	412000	Rebecca Schaefer was the one that had the stalker that shot her
412000	415000	I know it's really tragic and not something I'm trying to make light of
415000	417000	But that was I mean for those that were like
417000	420000	Those of you that are like in your early 40s or late 30s
420000	423000	Probably remember hearing about that when you were a kid
423000	425000	That there was this popular show on TV
425000	427000	And the actress unfortunately yeah
427000	429000	Cause that changed like stalking laws and stuff
429000	432000	Like that was a big big deal when that happened I remember
432000	433000	So okay
433000	437000	I didn't realize that Pam Dauber actually screen tested for the role of Tabitha
437000	439000	Which was the spinoff of Bewitched
439000	441000	Huh how bout that
441000	442000	Wow
442000	444000	Alright the classic actress of the week
444000	446000	Right here on Orange Lounge Radio
446000	449000	I didn't realize that she was married to Mark Harmon
449000	451000	But yeah she was um
451000	454000	She did a couple other shows
454000	456000	And actually worked with Robin Williams
456000	458000	On one of his comedy shows called The Crazy Ones
458000	460000	Has she done anything in the past 10 years
460000	462000	That was in 2014
462000	465000	Oh The Crazy Ones was that last TV show he had before
465000	467000	He died the one with Sarah Michelle Gellar
467000	469000	Yeah interesting
469000	470000	Okay anyway
470000	472000	Alright the Pam Dauber show
472000	473000	Alright let's
473000	475000	Well I'm just saying I'm looking at on here
475000	477000	She actually did some voice acting too
477000	479000	Any video games?
479000	481000	Well it was 101 Dalmatians the series
481000	485000	So there's no way to tie Pam Dauber to video gaming
485000	487000	She's on the show Dream On remember that
487000	489000	Completely on a tangent I do remember Dream On
489000	491000	Alright enough enough
491000	494000	Okay sorry I just I just I just think it's it's kind of funny
494000	495000	I think it's
495000	496000	She has a lot of movies
496000	498000	I haven't thought about her in many years
498000	501000	Alright let's talk about some early gaming headlines
501000	503000	Again I do want to give this disclaimer
503000	505000	We're taping this about 5 days in advance of when it's airing
505000	508000	A whole lot of shit could go down during the week
508000	511000	So we're just gonna take a look at some of the early headlines from the week
511000	512000	And give you our thoughts
512000	515000	So Dark Sakura I know you've pulled a few things for us
515000	518000	Um yeah
518000	520000	Alright what do you want to talk about?
520000	522000	Well how about some Sony shenanigans
522000	525000	Because I don't know
525000	527000	We we talk about things like this happening
527000	528000	I don't want to get so mad
528000	531000	But this one might actually be a travesty
531000	533000	Smooshy agrees
533000	537000	Yes Mr. Smoosh is very much commenting on the case at hand
537000	545000	Anyway the servers for Sing Star are gonna close on January 31st
545000	549000	I know all those copies of Sing Star out in circulation
549000	551000	Which actually I think it was a pretty good seller
551000	553000	I wasn't into it but eh
554000	559000	But at any rate they did make a post about it publicly online
559000	563000	That all online functionality, network features, song purchases
563000	570000	Will be disabled immediately as of 11.59pm on January 31st 2020
570000	575000	And it will go on all Playstation platforms
575000	578000	But offline features will still be available
578000	581000	The thing in particular to keep your eyes on
581000	585000	Is that for PS4 users you will be able to re-download any songs
585000	588000	That you have downloaded and deleted previously
588000	591000	But that will not be possible on PS3
591000	594000	You will need to download all of your digital purchases
594000	599000	Prior to the server shutdown
599000	603000	And then after that the deleted content will be completely irretrievable
603000	606000	It's being replaced with a game called Sing Smoosh
606000	609000	Which is actually going on in the background right now
610000	613000	Well I kinda like Sing Star
613000	615000	Do you have Sing Star Abba?
615000	617000	I do, I have Sing Star Abba
617000	618000	Download all your shit
618000	621000	Well I don't have to download Sing Star Abba because that's all on the disc
621000	623000	So if I'm hearing you right
623000	626000	The disc version of Sing Star Abba should work
626000	628000	And there was also Sing Star Queen
628000	629000	Which I think I have as well
629000	630000	So Sing Star Queen, Sing Star Abba
630000	633000	And then there was the random Sing Star 1, 2, and 3
633000	634000	They had all of that
634000	637000	And then you could download a bunch of songs online
637000	638000	Which I did
638000	640000	I remember having house parties
640000	642000	We downloaded a bunch of stuff on Sing Star
642000	644000	Because I had those microphones
644000	646000	And then around the Playstation 4 era
646000	649000	They kinda changed it more to like a stand alone thing
649000	652000	Where you just have the Sing Star app basically
652000	655000	And you can sing, there's like an app you get for your phone
655000	656000	And you use your phone as the mic
656000	657000	Which is a smart way to do it
657000	660000	So you don't have to worry about those blue and red plug in mics anymore
660000	662000	But that means if the servers are going down
662000	665000	You won't be able to download any new songs now
665000	668000	Well to be specific what people will still be able to do
668000	670000	Is access all the songs on the discs
670000	671000	Play party mode
671000	675000	Track and record your high scores offline
675000	678000	Take in store videos and snapshots to the hard drive
678000	679000	And create song playlists
679000	682000	But things like the challenges
682000	685000	Scoreboards, user generated content
685000	687000	Will no longer be available online
687000	690000	You can't share your media to Facebook, Twitter, PSN
690000	692000	Sing Star communities or any of that
692000	694000	And of course you will not be able to unlock
694000	697000	The channel surfer, concert debut, star in my eyes
697000	699000	Or Sing Star trophies
699000	701000	Yeah there's a lot of stuff that's gonna be locked away
701000	703000	Because I seem to remember
703000	705000	What was the Sony initiative called
705000	707000	Was it called Play Create Share or something like that
707000	708000	Was that the Sony thing
708000	710000	And I wanna say Sing Star was a big part of that
710000	712000	Because LittleBigPlanet was a huge part of that
712000	713000	When it first came out too
713000	716000	But Sing Star has all that online stuff
716000	719000	And again this, Sing Star was out in an era
719000	721000	Right before, maybe like when YouTube
721000	723000	Was kinda still like first coming out
723000	724000	Was still kinda new
724000	726000	Like people knew YouTube and got linked YouTubes
726000	729000	Kelly's shoes existed on YouTube at the time
729000	731000	So there was something to go visit there
731000	734000	But it wasn't like it is now
734000	736000	And like something like Twitch
736000	738000	Wasn't really what it is now
738000	741000	You know where there's the immediate like sharing of things
741000	744000	Or you know even something like
744000	747000	Justin TV, Twitch's predecessor was still kinda
747000	749000	I think still in its very much like its formative years
749000	753000	So Sing Star was really like a place to really like share
753000	756000	Like here's my singing you know
756000	758000	For good and for bad
758000	761000	So it's kinda sad to see it go
761000	763000	But I guess it would make sense
763000	765000	That perhaps licensing issues
765000	766000	Are now coming into play
766000	768000	I mean we would be like
768000	770000	It could be like a
770000	772000	You know whatever licenses are coming due
772000	774000	Yeah I mean but it would be like
774000	776000	I mean Sing Star ABBA was a PlayStation 3
776000	778000	I wanna say a game like Sing Star ABBA
778000	780000	Was almost 10 years ago at this point
780000	781000	You know so
781000	783000	I remember how excited you were
783000	784000	Well hell yeah
784000	785000	The video game all about ABBA
785000	786000	Are you kidding?
786000	789000	They don't often make dedicated video games
789000	790000	To groups I adore
790000	792000	Wasn't Tiara here when we played that
792000	794000	Like Spice World was the only other one I can think of
794000	795000	I'm trying to look
795000	796000	Cause I actually have off camera
796000	798000	A bunch of PlayStation 3 games
798000	799000	I'm curious of
799000	801000	I think my copies of Sing Star are in the other room though
801000	803000	Because I think I pulled those discs
803000	805000	To do something with the PlayStation 4 version
805000	807000	I don't think the PlayStation 4 version reads them
807000	809000	But it definitely knew
809000	811000	Like I had bought these certain songs
811000	812000	Online previously
812000	813000	And so like
813000	815000	I do have a PlayStation 4 copy of the client
815000	816000	So
816000	818000	I should go through and see if there's any
818000	820000	Other songs I wanna grab
820000	821000	Before it all goes away forever
821000	822000	But I feel like
822000	823000	They kinda
823000	825000	They didn't really do a lot of updates
825000	827000	To that library starting a couple years ago
827000	828000	But
828000	830000	It is a library I've spent
830000	831000	A bit of money on
831000	833000	I mean I would say over the years
833000	835000	I probably dropped like 40 bucks
835000	836000	On additional songs
836000	837000	I know it sounds like a lot
837000	838000	But
838000	839000	You know
839000	840000	Again you have parties
840000	842000	And it's very easy to sign into the store
842000	843000	And people are like
843000	844000	I wanna sing that one
844000	845000	I think even
845000	846000	Your wife
846000	847000	Loki
847000	848000	I wanna say at one of these parties
848000	850000	Convince me to download Whitney Houston songs
850000	852000	That sounds like her
852000	853000	Right?
853000	854000	I don't
854000	855000	I'm almost
855000	856000	Vaguely remember something
856000	857000	I'm almost positive
857000	858000	I had a birthday party
858000	859000	Way way way back when
859000	861000	When we used to do the show in the garage
861000	862000	At the house that I lived at
862000	863000	Then
863000	864000	Maybe
864000	865000	I think I had a party way back then
865000	866000	And I think we played Sing Star
866000	867000	And I wanna say
867000	868000	Your wife made me download
868000	869000	I Wanna Dance With Somebody
869000	870000	By Whitney
870000	871000	Which is not a bad selection
871000	872000	I'm not upset with it
872000	873000	That sounds like her
873000	874000	Yeah right
874000	876000	I don't know why I associate your wife
876000	877000	With Whitney Houston
877000	878000	But I do
878000	881000	It's a very easy association
881000	883000	The Bodyguard really is
883000	884000	You know the number one thing
884000	885000	Yeah
885000	886000	I wish that was a play on Broadway
886000	887000	I could go see
887000	888000	Wanna go
888000	889000	The Bodyguard?
889000	890000	Yeah The Bodyguard
890000	891000	The Bodyguard's a play you know
891000	892000	Did you?
892000	893000	We saw the musical
893000	894000	Oh that's right
894000	895000	You saw the one with Deborah Cox right?
895000	896000	Yes
896000	897000	How'd you guys like it?
897000	898000	It was pretty good actually
898000	900000	I'm sad it's not on Broadway still
900000	902000	Did I say on this show what I'm gonna go see
902000	903000	I'm gonna go see Moulin Rouge
903000	906000	And I'm gonna go see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway
906000	910000	Cause it just started the preview performances like this past weekend
910000	911000	Cool
911000	913000	So I'm gonna get to see it in like its first couple weeks of existence
913000	915000	I'm being a total Broadway hipster right now
915000	916000	But I'm really excited so
916000	917000	Yeah
917000	918000	Anyway
918000	919000	By the time you guys hear this
919000	922000	Actually at the time you guys are watching this on Twitch
922000	924000	I will be in the second act of Moulin Rouge
924000	926000	So I'm really excited
926000	927000	Anyway
927000	933000	And I can no longer download the Elephant Love medley to sing on SingStar from Moulin Rouge
933000	936000	So rest in peace SingStar thanks for the memories
936000	937000	Anyway
937000	939000	Anything else StarSaga?
939000	941000	No not in regard to SingStar
941000	944000	What about any other stories you wanna talk about?
944000	945000	A couple of things
945000	946000	Okay
946000	950000	So there has been another video game related death
950000	955000	But due to being too into the game I guess
955000	960000	There was a teenager in Thailand who was found dead after a marathon gaming session
962000	965000	His name is Piawet Harikun
965000	967000	I guess I pronounced that right
967000	972000	Was discovered on I guess yesterday in his home in Thailand
972000	975000	After playing a bunch of multiplayer games
975000	977000	And they said that he died from a stroke
977000	982000	He was discovered near his computer chair in his bedroom
982000	985000	The desk was covered with food containers and the curtains were drawn
985000	989000	And his father discovered him
989000	1000000	And apparently yeah they said that they're trying to use that to bring bigger alertness
1000000	1007000	I guess to the use of video games and people with addictive personalities
1007000	1011000	Because I don't think video games themselves are addictive
1011000	1014000	I think it's addictive personalities the same way that people
1014000	1018000	Because the same type of response like to gambling and things like that
1018000	1022000	Almost anything consumable can be addictive
1022000	1025000	Not like though with a drug where it does create
1025000	1027000	Like I'm addicted to these Tootsie Roll vanilla things
1027000	1029000	But that's part of a chemical reaction
1030000	1036000	Addiction on games and gambling is a different kind of chemical reaction
1036000	1037000	I gotcha
1037000	1041000	So you know that same dopamine response
1041000	1044000	Whereas I don't consider that a consumable
1044000	1051000	I consider that going to be more something who is more easily stimulated by that sort of response
1051000	1052000	Is going to want to keep doing it
1052000	1056000	And it's interesting that you kind of put games and gambling in the same category
1056000	1060000	Because I think a lot of the issues we've been hearing about in the past few years with the loot box concerns
1060000	1063000	Are kind of falling in a very similar thing
1063000	1065000	Is that you know it's getting a little too close to gambling
1065000	1068000	And hits kind of a lot of those same nerves for people
1068000	1072000	Well and on top of that I mean you know the World Health Organization
1072000	1077000	Has included video game addiction to its list of international classifications of diseases
1077000	1080000	I like though how it's phrased
1080000	1083000	The disorder is characterized by impaired control over gaming
1083000	1087000	An increased priority given to play video games over other daily activities
1087000	1090000	Usually lasting for at least 12 months to be diagnosed
1090000	1094000	And that is very much like how gambling is classified
1094000	1098000	Or how workout addiction
1098000	1101000	You know of workout addiction right?
1101000	1102000	Sure
1102000	1106000	Sometimes it's things like steroids and stuff in regards to those
1106000	1108000	Although again I think there are different types of addiction
1108000	1109000	Runners
1109000	1110000	What?
1110000	1111000	Runners
1111000	1112000	Oh yeah
1112000	1116000	And interesting you kind of bring up the ICD coding of the issue
1116000	1121000	Because you know the industry switched ICD coding standards
1121000	1123000	2015 I think was the big year
1123000	1124000	So they were running on an older version
1124000	1128000	They switched to a newer version that was already being used in places like Europe and stuff
1128000	1129000	But this new kind of coding
1129000	1133000	So even though it's like wow they actually have coding for video game addiction
1133000	1136000	They switched to a system that allows them to code for almost anything
1136000	1138000	Like there's an ICD code out there for subsequent
1138000	1141000	No I think the craziest one because this was my old world
1141000	1144000	That I can be a little more open about now because it's not my world anymore
1144000	1149000	There used to be a code for piece of a UFO flying on you for a subsequent time
1149000	1152000	Like they have all sorts of things classified
1152000	1153000	I know
1153000	1154000	Unidentified flying object
1154000	1156000	Doesn't necessarily mean an alien
1156000	1157000	No
1157000	1158000	Something fell out of the sky
1158000	1160000	Somebody's cheap ass drone
1160000	1161000	Yeah somebody's drone
1161000	1163000	That's right a drone would be a UFO in that
1163000	1164000	That would actually be a perfect example of that
1164000	1166000	Weather balloons Rob weather balloons
1166000	1167000	Yeah that could be too
1167000	1169000	So anyway
1169000	1174000	So don't redo it too much that they've actually given it an ICD coding
1174000	1177000	Almost anything that can end up in a doctor's office
1177000	1181000	They have the capacity to give an ICD-10 code to now
1181000	1184000	Well then and last but not least
1184000	1188000	You know I hate to be like the pooper on here
1188000	1193000	But New Zealand is banning a video game that's glorifying mass shootings
1193000	1196000	I think it might be that same one that we talked about before
1196000	1201000	They didn't mention it by name so I guess not to give any
1201000	1205000	What sort of attention to the game itself
1205000	1206000	Sure
1206000	1211000	But there is a you know they had the Christchurch mass shooting
1211000	1215000	Where they were 51 Muslims were murdered in a mosque
1215000	1218000	Wasn't that the one that was streamed online
1218000	1219000	It was streamed on Facebook
1219000	1220000	Gross yeah
1220000	1223000	With a gunman with semi-automatic weapons
1223000	1228000	Who went into two mosques on March 15th and killed 51 people and wounded more
1228000	1234000	They were talking about the release of this game and advertisement of this game
1234000	1239000	Because it has one play from the perspective of a white supremacist
1239000	1244000	So the game is banned outright in New Zealand
1244000	1248000	With further urging internationally to ban the game
1248000	1249000	Interesting
1249000	1254000	You know and I know this was the same incident that led them to pass gun reform
1254000	1255000	Like within a weekend right
1255000	1257000	And I remember a lot of people were pointing at that
1257000	1260000	Because you know and I'm trying to walk a real fine line
1260000	1263000	Because we could have a three hour show about the politics of this issue
1263000	1265000	And yeah and that whole thing
1265000	1272000	I have to ask this question as much of a slippery slope as it is into a complete political spin-off
1272000	1277000	But with this disgusting as a subject matter about like white supremacy and all that is
1277000	1281000	Are we going down a slippery slope if we start to ban these sorts of things
1281000	1285000	Because like for me it starts to get down like kind of like
1285000	1290000	Do you remember when the Supreme Court intervened on that Schwarzenegger law
1290000	1295000	Like who is to define what is obscene and what is not obscene
1295000	1298000	Or in that case what is a violent game and what is not
1298000	1300000	Because there was no like official rating
1300000	1304000	So I think and you guys have to forgive me because I don't have all the references in front of me
1304000	1306000	But I want to say where that law ended up getting tripped up
1306000	1309000	Was because there is no
1309000	1310000	It's too vague
1310000	1312000	It's too vague on what is a violent game
1312000	1315000	So I guess my kind of my kind of thought is here
1315000	1316000	And New Zealand can do whatever they want
1316000	1319000	And Australia has banned games before
1319000	1321000	We know like Mortal Kombat been banned
1321000	1323000	They also banned assault weapons
1323000	1324000	Right
1324000	1325000	Much earlier on
1325000	1327000	So are we I'm trying to keep the question kind of simple
1327000	1329000	Without going too far down the rabbit hole
1329000	1333000	But is it a slippery slope to start banning video games
1333000	1336000	Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious
1336000	1338000	Say that again sorry
1338000	1341000	Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious
1341000	1344000	So I don't like to think in terms like that
1344000	1347000	I think there is such a thing as setting precedence
1347000	1354000	But America is so stupid when it comes to violence anyway
1354000	1358000	They'll ban sex before they ban violence
1358000	1360000	Which is absolutely ridiculous
1360000	1363000	I don't know it's
1363000	1364000	Yeah it's tough
1364000	1367000	I'm not saying there's necessarily an easy answer here
1367000	1369000	Maybe this is one of those things we just have to think
1369000	1370000	America is stupid about it
1370000	1372000	And it's one of those things we have to think about
1372000	1376000	Like what is the correct response to something like this
1376000	1377000	How do we you know
1377000	1380000	I guess for me it's more like
1380000	1383000	How do we teach people or demonstrate to people
1383000	1386000	That this is something that's effective
1386000	1389000	This is something that you know when
1389000	1391000	And I don't even know the game in question
1391000	1393000	So I can't even like say XYZ game is offensive
1393000	1394000	Because I haven't seen it
1394000	1396000	And I don't really care to hearing about this
1396000	1397000	But maybe that's the whole thing
1397000	1401000	Is that because I know it involves these types of things
1401000	1402000	I'm like that's disgusting
1402000	1403000	I don't need to play it
1403000	1406000	For example I don't go to see those Saw movies
1406000	1408000	I don't like those Saw movies right
1408000	1409000	Because I know they're gross
1409000	1411000	I know they show people getting shot
1411000	1413000	They don't know what they're doing
1413000	1414000	I know they're gross
1414000	1416000	I know they show people getting chopped up
1416000	1418000	In the little bitty pieces and stuff
1418000	1420000	So when I hear that a new Saw movie is coming out
1420000	1422000	I'm like there's a movie I don't need to see
1422000	1423000	Right
1423000	1424000	So that's how I approach it
1424000	1427000	Now maybe Loki goes and buys popcorn
1427000	1428000	And goes to opening night
1428000	1430000	Fine he can go do whatever he wants
1430000	1431000	I've missed too many Saw movies
1431000	1434000	Unfortunately I'm too far behind in the Saw series
1434000	1436000	My own husband loves those gory things
1436000	1438000	He watches those compilations on YouTube
1438000	1440000	I should watch them again though
1440000	1442000	The lore behind it is kind of great
1442000	1443000	Have fun
1443000	1444000	I think they're gross
1444000	1446000	The overreaching thing about it
1446000	1451000	Is that it's a matter of the mental fortitude
1451000	1455000	Of the person who is indulging in the genre
1455000	1459000	It's a different thing if it's set as
1459000	1463000	I think it's when you get into the specifics of it
1463000	1465000	You know that
1465000	1468000	First of all serial killers in the United States
1468000	1471000	Are actually a very very small small like
1471000	1476000	3% of mass murders are considered serial killings
1476000	1477000	If you look at it
1477000	1478000	You know
1478000	1479000	So you're not
1479000	1481000	You're going to be really unlikely to have
1481000	1484000	That level of psychotic going around killing people
1484000	1485000	Just saying
1485000	1486000	You know
1486000	1489000	Whereas with a mass shooting
1489000	1491000	At least in America
1491000	1494000	You are more likely to see something like that happening
1494000	1495000	As opposed to a serial killer
1496000	1498000	You know as opposed to
1498000	1499000	You know
1499000	1501000	And yeah both of them are fictionalized accounts
1501000	1503000	But the other one is
1503000	1506000	A lot more in
1506000	1508000	An influenceable realm
1508000	1509000	Does that make sense?
1509000	1510000	Yeah
1510000	1514000	Especially when it's picking a very specific type of issue
1514000	1516000	Where it is a white supremacist
1516000	1518000	Which right now our political environment
1518000	1521000	Is absolutely encouraging of that type of mind state
1521000	1522000	And secondly
1522000	1523000	Secondly
1523000	1525000	Where we live in a place where
1525000	1528000	Weapons like that are super easy to obtain
1528000	1531000	And people can televise their murder sprees
1531000	1532000	This
1532000	1535000	It's getting when it hits too close to reality
1535000	1539000	That is when you know that it's an influenceable item
1539000	1541000	Because it is likely to happen
1541000	1542000	It has happened
1542000	1543000	And it will happen
1543000	1546000	Whereas you're probably not going to get somebody
1546000	1547000	You know
1547000	1548000	On an intercom
1548000	1551000	You know telling people to cut your leg off
1551000	1554000	That's just not really going to happen
1554000	1557000	Unless you pay money to do an escape room in L.A.
1557000	1558000	Or where is that place?
1558000	1559000	Vegas
1559000	1560000	I always see ads for it
1560000	1563000	Like that is the number one thing I do not want to do in my life
1563000	1564000	Is it a saw?
1564000	1565000	It's a saw themed escape room
1565000	1569000	But that one's not actually going to still cut your leg off
1569000	1570000	No but they'll pretend
1570000	1572000	I don't even like to pretend
1572000	1573000	When it comes to that
1573000	1575000	I don't even like to pretend
1575000	1576000	I wouldn't play
1576000	1577000	Remember when they did the video games
1577000	1578000	And they were showing them at E3
1578000	1580000	I wouldn't even play the games
1580000	1583000	I was like I don't need to be a part of it
1583000	1586000	There's 5,000 other games here at E3
1586000	1588000	I don't need to play that one
1588000	1589000	Right?
1589000	1590000	Anyway
1590000	1592000	I'll be perfectly honest
1592000	1593000	I mean the things
1593000	1597000	I'm not the biggest advocate of any censorship at all
1597000	1598000	Yeah
1598000	1601000	But that would be something that I would absolutely censor
1601000	1607000	Because as far as the terms of I think obscenity laws
1607000	1611000	It would number one be something that would be considered a non-artistic work
1611000	1613000	They say it's satire
1613000	1616000	But it really strikes too close of a nerve for it to even
1616000	1619000	I think they're just using satire as a way to protect themselves
1619000	1621000	When truly it's not
1621000	1624000	That would be one thing I would be in favor of
1624000	1629000	I mean honestly I would also like to see weapons banned as well
1629000	1633000	Funny that Australia had one big mass murder
1633000	1635000	And it was gone
1635000	1636000	New Zealand
1636000	1637000	Big mass murder
1637000	1639000	Now it's gone
1639000	1641000	I have to be honest
1641000	1644000	I think it's okay to say I'm not sure how I feel about this right now
1644000	1648000	Because I think that if we are to say that video games are truly art
1648000	1651000	There should be a way to put this in a museum and say
1651000	1656000	Wow what a disgusting reflection of a disgusting place society was at in the year 2019
1656000	1659000	And so our kids can look back on that and go wow
1659000	1661000	I hope we don't make these same mistakes
1661000	1664000	I don't know there's a part of me that sort of thinks that
1664000	1665000	But I don't know
1665000	1672000	I look at preserving the code for it but still not making it publicly accessible
1672000	1678000	You know just like I believe that civil war items belong in a museum
1678000	1682000	But I don't think we should have fucking statues everywhere to the losers
1682000	1685000	And guess what southern girls saying this
1685000	1688000	Oh confederacy lost
1688000	1690000	Get over it
1690000	1691000	The Nazis lost
1691000	1693000	Get the fuck over it
1693000	1697000	I do believe that the memorabilia should be allowed in museums lest we forget
1697000	1700000	As well because there are people out there and you know this
1700000	1702000	That will say oh that didn't happen right
1702000	1704000	There's people out there say that didn't happen
1704000	1708000	So by putting it in a museum it's like it's proof that no it did
1708000	1710000	And it better not happen again
1710000	1711000	Anyway
1711000	1713000	Anyway long long discussion
1713000	1715000	But beyond that but I'm gonna leave it at that
1715000	1718000	I would really be curious what you guys think
1718000	1720000	I hope our chat room is lighting up because I can go read it
1720000	1723000	Also you can always email us participate at orangeontreaty.com
1723000	1728000	You can also comment on our episodes as we post them at vognetwork.com
1728000	1731000	So I think that was everything Dark Sakura had for the news
1731000	1733000	We're gonna go over to Loki and myself
1733000	1735000	However I do want to take a quick tangent
1735000	1737000	I know it's a little further down on the list there
1737000	1742000	But we actually have waiting on the phone I believe
1742000	1745000	YYR is joining us via discord
1745000	1747000	Are you there?
1747000	1749000	Rob this isn't fair
1749000	1751000	What isn't fair?
1751000	1755000	How can I possibly follow a deep impactful discussion about white supremacy
1755000	1758000	Serial killers, weapons, and the delicate balance of free speech
1758000	1761000	Versus the well deserved condemnation of hate speech
1761000	1764000	With bungee ferret tossing of course
1768000	1770000	Yeah about that
1771000	1778000	Sometimes video games are distractions from the horrors of the real world
1778000	1782000	And video games can be fun and frivolous
1782000	1787000	And why you've made some very fun and frivolous games yourself
1787000	1789000	I've done my best
1789000	1792000	So how have you been?
1792000	1795000	I know we've talked a little bit on the show
1795000	1799000	You have become a father within the past year and a half-ish right?
1799000	1801000	That's right
1801000	1805000	So I know understandably that's been monopolizing a little bit of your time
1805000	1807000	Oh absolutely
1807000	1811000	Have you been able to dedicate any time to taking a look at the old game library
1811000	1814000	And seeing what fantasy game you want to make come true next?
1816000	1823000	Actually over the last few months I've decided to spend some time actually playing games
1823000	1826000	More specifically one game
1826000	1829000	I actually spent a lot of time with Forza Horizon 4
1829000	1832000	Good choice though, good choice that's a good one
1832000	1838000	But it's like every week they put up a new playlist with all these different activities to complete
1838000	1844000	And some of them are multiplayer challenges that have you playing games against other teams
1844000	1848000	Team games against computer drivatars
1848000	1851000	And just all kinds of fun things to do
1851000	1855000	Games is a service yo
1855000	1858000	Well except that this service didn't cost any extra money
1858000	1862000	And there's no like fake currency to waste money on
1862000	1865000	And heck the thing is available on Game Pass now
1865000	1868000	So anyone can try it
1868000	1871000	But of course you know that was time
1871000	1875000	And so I actually didn't get a lot done over the last few months
1875000	1880000	So I do very much apologize to anybody who was waiting for the new sharpshooter that I mentioned
1880000	1883000	Which is like 90% done
1883000	1886000	It just needs a few more things and then it's ready to release
1886000	1889000	Yeah but you know that last 10% is the hardest part
1889000	1892000	I've said the same myself
1892000	1896000	I know that's who I stole it from you or Bobby one of the two or both
1896000	1898000	Or both
1898000	1903000	And the new BFT that's definitely delayed to I have no idea when next year
1903000	1910000	But I actually have some fairly exciting news that I want to share
1910000	1915000	Okay and you know what I treat your games like any other
1915000	1919000	If the delay is to serve to make the game a great product at the end of the day
1919000	1924000	Then a delay is worth it so I'm going to applaud YYR for delaying his games
1924000	1926000	And not rushing them
1926000	1928000	Let's all applaud hello let's celebrate that
1928000	1930000	Woohoo
1930000	1935000	So this is a short story about magfest actually
1935000	1939000	Oh it sounds like you want to tell a story too don't you
1939000	1944000	Aw hey your child and my cat should have a show
1945000	1951000	Well they both have a limited vocabulary so I'm not sure what the final entertainment value would be
1951000	1956000	Oh you want to grab the microphone that's a very good idea except it's not really
1956000	1959000	Thank you for your input darling
1959000	1961000	Alright now go put her in kitty jail
1961000	1963000	She's playing with her pom pom balls
1965000	1967000	Some of which are shiny
1967000	1975000	Anyway yes so magfest 2018 which was actually about two years ago
1975000	1980000	I put super multitasking in to the showcase or attempted to
1980000	1986000	It was not accepted but what they have there is something called the quick play table
1986000	1995000	And if your game doesn't get a full slot you're encouraged our spot at the quick play table
1995000	1999000	And you can do it multiple times throughout the weekend and you can show your game there
1999000	2004000	And you know for anyone who wants to come up to the table and play
2004000	2011000	So two years ago I was lucky enough to get a room in the Gaylord right in the same hotel as magfest
2011000	2016000	And so I had my equipment with me so I said well you know what why not
2016000	2022000	So I showed it I took the last slot on I think Friday initially
2022000	2027000	And I asked the staff who were stuck there for 24 hours because they have to monitor everything
2027000	2030000	So if I have the last slot of the day can I just leave my stuff here overnight
2030000	2035000	And they said well as long as you get it out before the first slot the following morning sure
2035000	2043000	And I said okay and I left my stuff there the whole night and set an alarm so I would be down early in the morning
2043000	2049000	And sure enough when I got back I found that the staff had been enjoying the heck out of the game
2049000	2055000	For a good amount of time overnight so I ran it overnight Saturday night too
2055000	2063000	And then I discover when I get back that there's like a nine minute record some like on just seemingly impossibly high
2063000	2071000	Survival record on there and I'm like what happened and they said oh yeah we played as a team we gathered around the controller
2071000	2078000	So they really enjoyed this game they went so far as to cheat at your game to feel better about themselves
2078000	2092000	So anyway so as far as the selection process you're encouraged to you know not submit the same game twice
2092000	2098000	Or at the least not submit the same game in the same state twice because that counts against you in the submission process
2098000	2103000	But nonetheless I haven't shown it a convention in a while I haven't this year I didn't last year
2103000	2111000	So I'm like you know maybe I'll just submit super multitasking for the heck of it for the 2020 showcase
2111000	2117000	But I did so with the promise that there would be some new features coming if it was accepted
2117000	2124000	And well I don't know what happened but I got accepted to the 2020 MAGFest showcase
2124000	2128000	Good for you congratulations pretty cool
2128000	2135000	Thank you so now of course I have to deliver on my promises so I am ready to announce
2135000	2140000	And mind you I always intended on releasing three versions of multitasking in total
2140000	2146000	The first was the 2016 XBL-IG version which is now gone
2146000	2150000	The second was super multitasking on Steam which came out early 2018
2150000	2157000	And the final version which I was originally going to call the very unoriginal ultra multitasking
2157000	2164000	Is now going to be known as super multitasking versus ultimate
2164000	2172000	I love it you're going the Street Fighter route you got to put turbo in there at something maybe there'll be an unlock code
2172000	2177000	For matching service featuring true kiss destination
2177000	2180000	Yes featuring dreams come true also
2180000	2189000	But no the the reason I'm calling it versus ultimate is because of well both words have significance
2189000	2196000	Not only is it going to be the ultimate challenge but well there's the surprise that I'll save for a couple minutes from now
2196000	2204000	The first major change is the original game had four slots the screen was split into four slots
2204000	2209000	You had your left stick your right stick your face buttons and then everything on the top of the controller
2209000	2218000	For people who hate themselves we can now split the top of the controller into individual slots for the triggers and the bumpers
2218000	2221000	And now you have five slots
2221000	2224000	You're a madman
2224000	2230000	So now so if I'm if I'm I'm hearing this right so for those that have played super multitasking
2230000	2235000	I wish I'd had time today to grab b-roll but check it out on Steam I guess or check out the YouTube trailer
2235000	2245000	Just look up super multitasking right now it's four games going on at once this new version will allow you to do five because four wasn't enough
2245000	2248000	First for some people obviously
2248000	2257000	Of course though if you're just getting your feet wet if you're just starting to play you can also do the opposite and lower it down to three slots
2257000	2262000	Completely eliminating the bumpers and the triggers and making things maybe a little easier
2262000	2271000	Although the challenge mode is going to challenge your thought that maybe three slots is definitely easier
2271000	2274000	I'll find a way to test that theory
2274000	2278000	Have you considered a one slot mode for Bobby Blackwolf?
2278000	2281000	Well that would defeat the purpose of the game wouldn't it?
2281000	2283000	I guess it would
2283000	2285000	It's just tasking
2285000	2287000	Bobby Blackwolf gets to play tasking
2287000	2290000	Solo tasking
2290000	2292000	Solo tasking
2292000	2296000	Maybe as a joke that's actually kind of funny
2296000	2302000	I would die if you put his name on it like I don't know if legally you can
2302000	2306000	But I would die if you called it Bobby Blackwolf's tasking
2306000	2310000	Well if he gives it his consent then I don't see why not
2310000	2314000	Alright Bobby you know who to tweet alright
2314000	2318000	So the challenge mode is going to be greatly expanded
2318000	2322000	Before it was just a single list of 42 challenges
2322000	2325000	Now we're going to separate it into multiple courses
2325000	2330000	They'll be the original 42 challenges and super multitasking
2330000	2332000	That'll be one course
2332000	2336000	But now they're going to be multiple like they'll be a three slot course
2336000	2338000	A five slot course
2338000	2342000	A hell course which is just going to be the worst thing ever
2342000	2347000	Like there's going to be a lot of new missions and they're also going to be able to be more complex
2347000	2352000	Let's put that quote on the back of the box by the creator quote the worst thing ever
2355000	2359000	That's actually yeah you know maybe I'll put that on the Steam page
2359000	2361000	Okay great
2361000	2367000	But yeah right now the challenge is they're set up a certain way
2367000	2373000	At most one game plays in each slot and then when that game ends that's it
2373000	2379000	We're going to throw that out the window and allow more complex missions that have
2379000	2384000	A second game starting in a slot once the first one is finished or more
2384000	2388000	So they're not just going to all last 20 seconds like before
2388000	2392000	They're going to be some that are deeper dives so please look forward to that
2392000	2394000	Oh boy
2394000	2398000	Speedrunners will have more ways to impact or make mistakes
2398000	2401000	So that's I want to add some depth
2401000	2406000	You know some someone might have pointed at the existing game and said well it's fun
2406000	2411000	But it doesn't really look like there's a whole lot to do. I want to I want to attack that
2411000	2415000	And then of course there will be new mini games
2415000	2419000	Some of them will be difficult versions of the games that are there now
2419000	2427000	Like an alternate version of the paddle the pong game where you have to control paddles on both the top and bottom
2427000	2432000	Rather than just on the bottom. So this way you can miss the ball in two different ways. Oh my god
2432000	2438000	Oh, this is gonna be wow. This is really gonna be a mindfuck, but I'm excited
2438000	2441000	And then some some mini games are gonna be completely new
2441000	2451000	I'm really gonna try to find a good way to make an intuitive mini game where you're typing a text on a cell phone
2451000	2455000	Just so that I can pair that with the driving game
2455000	2464000	That's great. You could take the swipe thing
2464000	2467000	You know, I mean you don't have to if you just with the yes something like controller
2467000	2471000	You could just do like a swipe thing. It doesn't have to actually hit each letter. Oh, I love that
2471000	2476000	You're gonna pair the pair texting game with the driving game. It has to be done. I love it
2476000	2483000	It just has to be done and then finally the last major addition that I'm gonna be making to this game is a two-player
2483000	2486000	versus mode
2486000	2493000	Now it's something that people were asking for and we finally figured out a good way to do this
2493000	2498000	So basically what's gonna happen is they're gonna be variants of the mini games
2498000	2502000	Like let's take the pong game again as an example
2502000	2506000	So instead of just being a paddle and hitting the ball against a wall
2506000	2512000	There's gonna be a red paddle on the bottom and a blue paddle on top
2512000	2518000	You're gonna be, you know, controlling whichever color you are and the ball is gonna slowly get faster
2518000	2523000	And whoever messes up first the opponent gets a point
2523000	2527000	There's gonna be the tennis game and you know what you've probably seen
2527000	2531000	Have you seen the the battle mode and pop in music?
2531000	2536000	It's been a long time but yes, I do vaguely remember, yeah
2536000	2541000	Some versions, I don't know if it's all versions but at least some versions of pop in music
2541000	2545000	They've had it where, you know, you're playing the game, you're playing the game against an opponent
2545000	2550000	The main game and then all of a sudden this mini game appears along the bottom of the screen
2550000	2552000	Where you're hitting a ball back and forth
2552000	2558000	And you have to take one of your buttons, you know, the extra button that you're not using
2558000	2564000	Because each player only has to hit three lanes in pop in music's battle mode
2564000	2567000	And then you're hitting that button to hit the ball back and forth
2567000	2575000	And whoever misses, they get some terrible mod applied to their lanes for a few seconds
2575000	2577000	Which causes them to completely mess up
2577000	2582000	So it's gonna be like that but, you know, four of them on the screen at once
2582000	2586000	Okay, I'm into it, this sounds really, you know what's also interesting about this
2586000	2589000	I don't know if you've thought about this YY or maybe you have
2589000	2594000	But you know Steam not that long ago or I think they just announced they're gonna do that whole thing
2594000	2601000	Where you can do any game multiplayer over the internet kind of akin to PlayStation 4's SharePlay
2601000	2606000	So theoretically, I imagine you're building this with same room in mind
2606000	2609000	Especially with some of the specific timings that go into this
2609000	2613000	But technically I could play this with a friend of mine online
2614000	2616000	I just hope you've got a good connection
2616000	2618000	Yeah, I was gonna say it might not be
2618000	2620000	I can understand why maybe you're not gonna emphasize that
2620000	2623000	Because the timing probably has to be very specific on that
2623000	2626000	And it is still kind of a beta-e early feature
2627000	2631000	Well, I mean it's gonna be meant for local play
2631000	2636000	If there's any lag, one player's gonna be at a big disadvantage
2636000	2637000	True
2637000	2641000	But yeah, I'm really hoping that people have a really great time with this
2641000	2645000	You know, you'll set it to play to five or whatever
2645000	2648000	And then whoever gets five points first wins the game
2648000	2650000	And then you do it again
2650000	2652000	And then you purse a little and then you do it again
2652000	2656000	And then you throw your controller and maybe do it again if it still works
2657000	2659000	Well I'm really excited for you YYR
2659000	2663000	And you know I love the concept behind multitasking, super multitasking
2663000	2667000	And now super multitasking versus ultimate, right?
2667000	2670000	Yeah, I have no idea when this will be done
2670000	2675000	However, what I can tell you is that at the least the versus mode
2675000	2678000	The five slot mode's already in the game
2678000	2681000	And the versus mode I'm working on now
2681000	2685000	You'll be able to try all these new features at MAGFest if you are there
2686000	2688000	Sadly, I am not there this year
2688000	2692000	I may be able to return in 2021
2692000	2696000	As you know, and I say you as in the listeners and everybody
2696000	2698000	I started a new job
2698000	2699000	New job
2699000	2701000	A little quick for me to make MAGFest happen
2701000	2704000	But the nice thing is with this new job
2704000	2709000	I am better taken care of when it comes to time away to go to nerd expos
2709000	2711000	Than I maybe was before
2711000	2715000	So things like MAGFest and some of the things I've had to cut back on the past couple of years
2715000	2717000	Are now again a possibility
2717000	2720000	So nothing's off the table when we move into
2720000	2723000	As we get it past, probably once we get into summer next year
2723000	2725000	I may show up at more places
2725000	2729000	So MAGFest 2021 is something that's not out of the picture
2729000	2733000	That's exciting. Maybe VOD could have a greater presence there on the whole
2733000	2736000	I will have to talk to Mr. Blackwolf about that because I would really love that
2737000	2738000	Nice
2738000	2740000	And I mean the last thing
2740000	2745000	I don't know yet if I'm allowed to sell anything at the booth
2745000	2748000	I would love to be able to sell the game there because it's out
2748000	2753000	But if I am able to sell stuff there and you mention OLR
2753000	2756000	I will give you my best possible deal
2756000	2760000	Oh and you know I totally didn't mention this
2760000	2763000	If you already own Super Multitasking
2763000	2767000	By the time these features are released
2767000	2772000	You will be upgraded to Super Multitasking vs. Ultimate for free
2772000	2774000	Look at you, good guy YYR
2774000	2775000	How about that?
2775000	2777000	Free upgrade, congratulations
2777000	2778000	That is great
2778000	2781000	For everybody else the price is going to go up a few dollars
2781000	2783000	If you haven't bought it yet
2783000	2786000	So maybe that's a hot tip for OLR listeners
2786000	2788000	Hot tip, get it now
2788000	2790000	Before he jacks up the price
2793000	2796000	Because I mean this is my best concept
2796000	2799000	There's going to be a lot of effort put into this
2799000	2801000	Into these upgrades too
2801000	2806000	So I really want to deliver the best possible package with this game
2806000	2809000	And then possibly look to port it to consoles afterward
2810000	2812000	Well I am wishing you all the luck in the world while you are
2812000	2815000	And I think one reason why this game does well at expos
2815000	2817000	I think it's one thing to talk about the game and do this
2817000	2820000	People do not really understand how addictive
2820000	2823000	Because it is a game you play in very short bursts
2823000	2825000	Kind of like a warrior type of thing
2825000	2828000	But it can also because of that be very subject to the whole
2828000	2830000	Just one more turn type of thing
2830000	2833000	Like I've got to break the two minute mark
2833000	2835000	It turns into that sort of addicting thing really fast
2835000	2837000	And I think once people get their hands on it
2837000	2841000	They really kind of realize like oh this is addicting
2841000	2843000	This is very addicting
2843000	2846000	And so the fact that you are making it bigger, badder and better
2846000	2848000	And maybe simpler for Bobby Black Wolf
2848000	2850000	Is very exciting
2852000	2853000	Thank you
2853000	2855000	That's great, well congratulations OLR
2855000	2858000	I mean certainly congratulations on getting the spot back at MAGFest
2858000	2861000	I hope we get pictures and video and all that good stuff
2861000	2865000	And I hope it goes so well that you come back in 2021
2865000	2868000	With your other projects that you're working on
2868000	2870000	I'm really hoping to
2870000	2873000	I'm really hoping that once this is done
2873000	2876000	I can actually start porting the new platforms
2876000	2880000	And creating a couple of new IPs that I have already planned out
2880000	2884000	It's like there's so much that's just waiting on me
2884000	2887000	Finishing up all these existing projects
2887000	2889000	I've got way too many
2889000	2892000	Well at least you've finished several games
2892000	2894000	Unlike some people I know
2895000	2897000	Congratulations
2897000	2899000	I haven't forgotten about Vecturds
2900000	2902000	Appreciate it, appreciate it
2903000	2904000	That makes me happy
2904000	2908000	It warms the cold dark recesses of my shriveled heart
2908000	2910000	Alright
2910000	2912000	YYR I am going to let you go for now
2912000	2914000	But thank you so much and best of luck to you
2914000	2918000	And I can't wait to hear how MAGFest goes in a couple months for you
2918000	2920000	I can't either
2920000	2921000	Take care my friend
2921000	2924000	Thank you as always for trusting OLR
2924000	2927000	If there's one game maker that'll break the news here on OLR
2927000	2929000	It's YYR, we appreciate it
2929000	2930000	Hey
2930000	2933000	You have me as an exclusive
2933000	2939000	Even if the major sites are looking to get me on
2939000	2941000	The biggest podcasts in the world
2941000	2944000	I'll be like nope, OLR gets me first
2944000	2946000	That warms my cold black heart
2946000	2948000	Big hug for you my friend
2948000	2950000	Now I have to go get famous
2950000	2952000	Alright, take care my friend
2952000	2953000	Now get to programming
2953000	2954000	Alright, see you later
2954000	2955000	I will
2955000	2956000	Alright, bye
2956000	2957000	Bye
2957000	2959000	Always good to hear from our pal YYR
2959000	2962000	I love that he's kind of like reinvigorating
2962000	2964000	I guess if you will super multitasking
2964000	2966000	Because I really do think like it's the type of game that
2966000	2969000	I'm really surprised kind of didn't go viral the first time around
2969000	2971000	But it's sometimes you just got to catch that spark
2971000	2972000	You know what I mean?
2972000	2974000	So having the additional visibility at MAGFest
2974000	2976000	And this time around he's going to be able to say
2976000	2978000	Not like it's coming soon
2978000	2979000	Or oh he's going to be able to say
2979000	2980000	Oh you can buy it right now
2980000	2981000	Like right here
2981000	2983000	And that I think is really going to help him out
2983000	2984000	For sure
2984000	2986000	Yeah because I was there I think the year before
2986000	2988000	When he first showed the game
2988000	2989000	And so he could only say
2989000	2990000	Can you upvote me on Greenlight
2990000	2991000	Can you upvote me
2991000	2993000	But now that he actually has this
2993000	2995000	You can buy this game you're playing right here
2995000	2998000	Or at least even if the versus ultimate isn't out at that point
2998000	3000000	At least you can still play the basic version
3000000	3002000	This game can be yours if the price is right
3002000	3003000	That's right, exactly right
3003000	3004000	Exactly right
3004000	3006000	So wishing YYR all the success out there
3006000	3008000	And again if you want to check out Super Multitasking
3008000	3009000	If you're newer to OLR
3009000	3013000	Because we were talking ears off about this game
3013000	3014000	When it first came out
3014000	3015000	It is available on Steam
3015000	3017000	The Super Multitasking he's referencing
3017000	3018000	You can play it on Steam right now
3018000	3020000	So go check it out in the Steam store
3020000	3025000	There's no Epic or Origin
3025000	3028000	Or any of those GOG wars going on
3028000	3029000	It is only on Steam
3029000	3031000	Because I know he got there through the Greenlight process
3031000	3033000	Before they pulled it
3033000	3035000	They don't have Greenlight anymore right?
3035000	3036000	No they don't
3036000	3038000	They just throw your crap up there
3038000	3040000	Throw whatever crap you want up there
3040000	3042000	Okay let's get back into some news
3042000	3045000	So we had taken care of the stories Dark Soccer was going to talk about
3045000	3047000	Although I do have some kind of unrelated news
3047000	3048000	Alright sure why not
3048000	3051000	Kathy Griffin was sainted by the San Francisco Sisters
3051000	3055000	Oh I didn't know that was a procedure that you could do
3055000	3057000	Did she have a show there tonight?
3057000	3061000	I don't know but she just was very recently sainted
3061000	3063000	She had a show there coming up
3063000	3064000	And I wanted to go but I couldn't
3064000	3066000	I was like oh it's the same day as something else
3066000	3067000	But anyway
3067000	3070000	So she is now Saint Kathy of the acerbic profundity
3070000	3072000	Herder of Hussies, defender of D-listers
3072000	3074000	And probably not a member of ISIS
3074000	3075000	Oh probably not
3075000	3077000	Anyway back to gaming headlines
3077000	3078000	Loki
3078000	3081000	Alright so let's talk a little bit about Smash Brothers
3081000	3084000	So there's a new version coming out soon
3084000	3087000	And there's a brand new update
3087000	3089000	On Intended Direct that's coming
3089000	3090000	So we have Ultimate
3090000	3092000	Which will have happened by the time people hear this
3092000	3093000	Yes it would have happened already
3093000	3096000	And as you probably have now heard
3096000	3098000	There's no new announcement
3098000	3101000	Sorry it's just talking about Terry
3101000	3103000	Well they might be playing Terry Bogard
3103000	3107000	I mean aren't we anticipating that Terry Bogard will be unlocked after the direct problem
3107000	3108000	Most likely
3108000	3109000	I don't know
3109000	3112000	But they're going to at least show what Terry Bogard does
3112000	3114000	So that's kind of cool
3114000	3116000	And of course along with the vault
3116000	3119000	The version 6 updates they have
3120000	3125000	Of course there's the vault shopper set that's been announced
3125000	3127000	That's going to be made available to Switch Online members
3127000	3133000	And that includes 5000G and 3 classic tickets for no cost
3133000	3136000	If you happen to have Switch Online
3136000	3139000	Which if you're playing Smash you probably do anyways
3139000	3142000	And then they have fighter adjustments
3142000	3145000	And some other features that will be detailed
3145000	3147000	I'm assuming during the direct
3147000	3149000	And then along with Smash
3149000	3153000	It is now the number one selling fighting game in history
3153000	3154000	Oh wow
3154000	3155000	In one year
3155000	3163000	So yeah it sold 15.71 million units as of September 30th
3163000	3164000	Wow that's really
3164000	3168000	Especially when you consider that they had a version that was on Wii and 3DS
3168000	3170000	But I guess maybe you still count those separately
3170000	3172000	Or excuse me Wii U and 3DS
3172000	3173000	But I guess maybe you still have to count those separately
3173000	3175000	I just think it just didn't sell as well
3175000	3177000	Because there weren't as many systems out there maybe
3177000	3178000	You're right that's probably the case
3178000	3179000	Yeah
3179000	3181000	Apparently though they're still saying though
3181000	3183000	If you counted
3183000	3187000	If you count the SNES classic mini
3187000	3192000	Then Street Fighter 2 would hold the record still with 20 million units
3192000	3194000	I was just about to ask
3194000	3196000	But wasn't Street Fighter 2 everywhere
3196000	3198000	But we just had the story
3198000	3201000	And luckily this time I can remember what we just talked about
3201000	3203000	Because it really was just the day before yesterday
3203000	3206000	But we just had that story that Dark Soccer was talking about on the last show
3206000	3210000	About how the Switch has now outsold the Super Nintendo
3210000	3212000	So even though it feels like
3212000	3215000	Oh my god Street Fighter 2 was everywhere
3215000	3216000	On the Super Nintendo when it came out
3216000	3217000	Well the reality is
3217000	3219000	There wasn't as many Super Nintendos as there are Switches
3219000	3223000	That's how this has now been able to get out there more
3223000	3224000	It's pretty cool
3224000	3225000	And then in other news
3225000	3230000	Nintendo is saying that they're open to more remakes on the Switch
3231000	3234000	So much like we had with Zelda Link's Awakening
3234000	3240000	They're looking at possibly doing some other games in a similar fashion
3240000	3243000	And this came out of an investor Q&A
3243000	3249000	They're saying there's a possibility to bring back titles that have been previously developed for handheld consoles
3249000	3250000	However
3250000	3254000	Within Nintendo rather than re-releasing past handheld games
3254000	3257000	Because of the Nintendo Switch Lite's release
3257000	3265000	We are discussing more what sorts of new games can we create for an entire Nintendo Switch family
3265000	3268000	Within that we also are considering past titles
3268000	3271000	But regarding what sorts of discussions are being held in detail
3271000	3273000	There's nothing I can say at the present
3273000	3276000	I have a nomination to put forward
3276000	3280000	If we want to bring back classic handheld franchises
3280000	3281000	Well we just heard Brain Age
3281000	3282000	We had that about a month ago
3282000	3284000	That Brain Age was coming back
3284000	3287000	I would put forward Clubhouse Games
3287000	3288000	Remember that one on 3DS?
3288000	3290000	I thought that game was so cool
3290000	3293000	And it didn't really seem to
3293000	3296000	It didn't end up being like a Nintendo thing that really stuck around
3296000	3297000	But I'm really surprised
3297000	3299000	I would have thought Clubhouse Games would have been a bigger deal
3299000	3301000	So it's an old 3DS title
3301000	3303000	Maybe it was the regular DS
3303000	3304000	It was the regular DS
3304000	3305000	Oh god
3305000	3306000	So you gotta go way back
3306000	3307000	It was the regular DS
3307000	3309000	It was like parlor games
3309000	3310000	Mini collection of parlor games
3310000	3311000	It was really well done
3311000	3312000	And with the DS stylus
3312000	3315000	And that you could do things that were pretty cool
3315000	3318000	So we haven't really talked about Minecraft Earth recently
3318000	3321000	But I think they're just about the release over here at some point
3321000	3324000	They just, as of October 31st
3324000	3327000	Released in South Korea, Canada and the Philippines
3327000	3330000	Just today, the UK
3330000	3332000	So we're getting bigger territories
3332000	3334000	Are these the full releases or just betas?
3334000	3335000	Full release
3335000	3336000	Oh shoot, okay
3336000	3339000	So we're, I mean they've been releasing all sorts of territories
3339000	3341000	Australia's had it for a little bit
3341000	3343000	So they're getting bigger, bigger territories
3343000	3345000	I mean the UK is pretty big
3345000	3348000	So maybe soon?
3348000	3349000	Yeah, maybe
3349000	3351000	It looks like weekly has been what they've been putting that stuff on
3351000	3354000	Again, by the time you guys hear this, it might be a thing
3354000	3355000	Yeah, so that'd be pretty cool
3355000	3357000	And last but not least
3357000	3361000	There's rumors that Microsoft may be purchasing, or set to purchase
3361000	3363000	The developers of Yooka-Laylee
3363000	3366000	Oh, that would make sense
3366000	3368000	Yeah, interesting
3369000	3373000	Like, who's the, like how, on a rumor scale of 1 to 10
3373000	3376000	They're saying that there's, you know
3376000	3379000	There's the Xbox XO 19 celebration
3379000	3383000	That takes place in London on November 14th
3383000	3386000	That would be a good place to announce something like that
3386000	3388000	Alright, so keep your eye on that one
3388000	3389000	Yeah
3389000	3390000	Alright, interesting
3390000	3391000	I have a few headlines for you guys
3391000	3395000	Actually, a lot of these have to do with like other, like streaming updates
3395000	3396000	And streaming news
3396000	3398000	YouTube being one of them
3398000	3400000	Of course, YouTube is a streaming platform as well
3400000	3401000	If you weren't already aware
3401000	3403000	YouTube is now rolling out something
3403000	3405000	You know, because like on Twitch and Mixer
3405000	3408000	We just talked in the last episode about subscriptions on Mixer
3408000	3411000	You know, so how is YouTube trying to get a little bit more into the monetization game
3411000	3413000	Allowing creators to make a little more coin
3413000	3415000	Subscriptions are a thing on YouTube as well
3415000	3417000	And I guess they have like super chat
3417000	3420000	Which means you get a comment that's pinned at the top of a chat
3420000	3422000	Kind of like, I guess it'd be similar to like a highlighted message
3422000	3424000	Which is the, you could
3424000	3427000	You probably noticed it's there on VoG network
3427000	3429000	Like, when we heard it open
3429000	3431000	Bobby and I were just kind of like
3431000	3433000	Yeah, might as well just open and see what happens
3433000	3435000	It's not something you really, it's like the more you watch
3435000	3437000	The more little virtual coins you get
3437000	3438000	Yeah, I saw that
3438000	3439000	It's Mixer's biddies
3439000	3440000	Or no, not biddies
3440000	3441000	What do they call them on Mixer?
3441000	3442000	Sparks
3442000	3443000	It's the Sparks from Mixer
3443000	3445000	Twitch kind of has their own system of that now
3445000	3446000	So we just kind of turned it on
3446000	3448000	But we haven't really, really given it thought
3448000	3450000	On how to best use it
3450000	3453000	But I have noticed people have started highlighting their messages
3453000	3455000	So this is kind of a similar thing you can do on YouTube
3455000	3457000	Well now another thing you're going to be able to do
3457000	3459000	Is animated stickers
3459000	3461000	So it's a little different from emojis
3461000	3462000	Because I guess they're big
3462000	3464000	They're like super stickers
3464000	3467000	And they've rolled them out to creators in over 60 countries
3467000	3469000	When you are doing streams or video premieres
3469000	3471000	You can buy a sticker
3471000	3472000	And drop it in the chat
3472000	3475000	And a streamer will get a cut of that sticker
3475000	3477000	A creator can moderate the super stickers
3477000	3479000	There are eight sticker packs
3479000	3481000	Five of which are animated
3481000	3484000	And so there will be different packs in different languages
3484000	3487000	Like English, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese
3487000	3491000	And you have to have super chats enabled on your stream
3491000	3493000	To be able to enable super stickers
3493000	3495000	Because YouTube has the various criterias that you can monetize
3495000	3497000	And all that stuff, different levels
3497000	3499000	So kind of interesting but I've got to admit
3499000	3501000	Stickers? I don't know
3501000	3504000	I mean if you're trying to get noticed by a big YouTube streamer
3504000	3506000	Maybe, I don't know
3506000	3509000	But ok, I mean they've got to think of ways to monetize
3510000	3515000	I've got to admit, one reason why I think Twitch is a great platform
3515000	3518000	Is because it's really easy to monetize on Twitch
3520000	3522000	It used to be easy to monetize on YouTube
3522000	3524000	But it no longer is
3524000	3527000	So it's pretty easy to monetize on Twitch
3527000	3530000	And so that's why I think a lot of people kind of go that way
3530000	3533000	Not that you're going to make a fortune broadcasting on Twitch
3533000	3535000	I mean we all still have day jobs, hello
3535000	3537000	But you know you make a nice amount of money
3537000	3540000	To maybe offset the cost of buying microphones
3540000	3542000	And doing a show and all that stuff
3542000	3544000	So it's kind of neat
3544000	3546000	And mic stands
3546000	3548000	That's right and mic stands which yes is in our future
3548000	3550000	Because I was actually listening to a recent episode
3550000	3552000	And I'm like oh my god every time Dark Soccer I pick up a mic
3552000	3554000	You can kind of hear it
3554000	3556000	So depending on how you guys listen to the show
3556000	3558000	I've been trying not to pick up the mic that much
3558000	3560000	I know we are going to address that issue
3560000	3562000	It's just one of those like you know
3562000	3564000	Making it better one step at a time
3564000	3566000	But yeah mic stands
3566000	3568000	Even if they're like handheld mic stands
3568000	3570000	Even if we had like handheld mic stands
3570000	3572000	It would not make all the rattling that it does now
3572000	3574000	I'm doing some investigation
3574000	3576000	Okay please do
3576000	3579000	Alright speaking of YouTube and all that stuff
3579000	3582000	Another Twitch streamer has announced that they are leaving
3582000	3584000	But they're going to YouTube this time
3584000	3588000	So what we've had two big streamers leave Twitch for Mixer
3588000	3590000	And now we have
3590000	3592000	Courage, CooRage
3592000	3595000	I don't know it's Courage but the R is capitalized
3595000	3598000	I don't usually get into the celebrity streamer culture a lot
3598000	3600000	So I don't know who these folks are
3600000	3601000	Do you?
3601000	3602000	Nope no idea
3602000	3603000	Well he's a big
3603000	3605000	And I'm not trying to shade him I just don't know him
3605000	3606000	I don't know her
3606000	3608000	But his real name is Jack Dunlop
3608000	3610000	But he goes by Courage online
3610000	3613000	And he is going to be going exclusively to YouTube
3613000	3615000	He has 2.1 million Twitch followers
3615000	3618000	And already 1.9 million subscribers on YouTube
3618000	3622000	I think there are a lot of Twitch streamers that kind of double dip on YouTube a little bit
3622000	3625000	By the way go check out our YouTube channel at VOG Network
3625000	3629000	So that part's not completely unheard of
3629000	3631000	But yeah now he's going to go over there pretty much exclusively
3631000	3633000	So that's going to be very interesting
3633000	3635000	And it does
3635000	3639000	Folks are saying that YouTube as opposed to Mixer
3639000	3642000	Maybe makes a little more sense for this particular streamer
3642000	3645000	Because he said he wants to go beyond gaming
3645000	3648000	Like he wants to do cooking and ASMR
3648000	3651000	Although this could be like tongue and cheek type of announcements
3651000	3654000	But maybe he's looking to go a little bit beyond just gaming
3654000	3655000	Interesting
3655000	3657000	Very interesting because I'm really surprised
3657000	3658000	And I got to say this
3658000	3660000	I am really surprised at this point
3660000	3665000	That Twitch has not tried to take on YouTube a little more
3665000	3667000	Like I realize that Twitch is broad in its categories
3667000	3670000	We have the things like competitive eating and ASMR and all that stuff
3670000	3672000	But I'm really surprised that they
3672000	3676000	That they're almost scaling back on some of the video on demand features
3676000	3678000	Like we're losing the live commenting
3678000	3679000	We're losing the premiere stuff
3679000	3681000	Like that they're almost scaling back on that
3681000	3684000	When I would have thought that Amazon would have really made it
3684000	3685000	Because they own Twitch right
3685000	3688000	Amazon would have really made a play to take on YouTube
3688000	3691000	And try to meet YouTube in that space
3691000	3693000	I'm kind of surprised they haven't done that
3693000	3695000	Maybe it's just me
3695000	3698000	But maybe the audience has not shown it's there
3698000	3701000	It would be nice to have an alternative for YouTube
3701000	3703000	It would be very nice to have an alternative for YouTube
3703000	3705000	Maybe Twitch doesn't want to have to
3705000	3707000	Or Amazon in general doesn't want to have to police that
3707000	3710000	You know there's a lot of the dark side of YouTube
3710000	3711000	We've heard a lot about
3711000	3713000	And maybe Amazon's just like you know what
3713000	3714000	We'd rather not deal with it
3714000	3716000	Twitch community's pretty cool
3716000	3717000	They're already not
3717000	3721000	They're already kind of having difficulties policing Twitch stuff as it is
3721000	3722000	I guess that's true
3722000	3724000	It is getting more and more difficult the bigger and bigger it's getting
3724000	3730000	And like you know I know Dark Soccer brought up that really unfortunate shooting incident
3730000	3732000	And I don't mean to go to a horrible place
3732000	3734000	But the reality is like I know more recently
3734000	3736000	It wasn't that one but there was another one that very recently
3736000	3738000	Was streamed on Twitch
3738000	3742000	And so you know that's not Twitch's fault per se
3742000	3745000	You know but certainly they don't want to be involved with that shit
3745000	3747000	They don't like having their name put out there
3747000	3749000	Next to gross content like that
3749000	3752000	So you know it's going to be interesting
3752000	3755000	Anyway a little tangent but just something that kind of surprised me
3755000	3758000	One more article that does not have to do with streaming
3758000	3760000	But it does have to do with movies
3760000	3762000	We're going to bring up Hideo Kojima again
3762000	3765000	By the time you guys hear this
3765000	3766000	You will be sick of me
3766000	3768000	Death Stranding will be out
3768000	3770000	And I'm so curious to see how the
3770000	3771000	We've seen the reviews
3771000	3774000	But now I want to see how the general population takes to that game
3774000	3778000	I'm only about a week away from my live hate playthrough
3778000	3780000	Of Death Stranding
3780000	3782000	And that's going to be the title of the stream
3782000	3785000	Hate playing Kojima's latest art school project
3785000	3786000	Excited
3786000	3787000	Anyway
3787000	3791000	But in being interviewed by the BBC about Death Stranding
3791000	3794000	Because obviously Hideo Kojima is out there doing the circuit and the press and all that
3794000	3797000	Kojima mentioned that Kojima Productions
3797000	3798000	The studio he runs
3798000	3800000	Is going to venture into filmmaking
3800000	3803000	Which I don't know if this is a rumor or what
3803000	3808000	But when you hear that Death Stranding has a two hour cut scene at the end of the game
3808000	3810000	Maybe not too surprising to hear
3810000	3813000	That Kojima is interested in getting into filmmaking
3813000	3817000	I thought that was the same as Mel Gursault 4 had a really long cut scene at the end of the game too
3817000	3819000	He's kind of already making films
3819000	3821000	But it's interesting
3821000	3822000	I mean
3822000	3828000	For all the crap that people are giving Death Stranding for being a walking simulator
3828000	3830000	Or whatever, what the game is
3830000	3832000	Maybe this is causing people to really think
3832000	3834000	What would Death Stranding be like as a movie?
3835000	3836000	Who knows?
3836000	3838000	I mean we won't really know until more of us get our hands on the game
3838000	3843000	But what's Kojima going to be capable of in a movie space or a more traditional film space?
3843000	3848000	He certainly has plenty of friends in Hollywood to help him make it happen right?
3848000	3852000	So it's going to be interesting to see what happens if he were to get into that
3852000	3854000	So yeah
3854000	3859000	Excited to see if they actually really do go that way in the near future
3859000	3860000	Who knows?
3860000	3863000	So would Kojima announce a film at E3?
3863000	3865000	Or how would that work?
3865000	3867000	He'd probably get his buddy Jeff Keighley to help him out
3867000	3869000	I imagine that's how that would work
3869000	3871000	Yeah that would be the game awards type of thing
3871000	3872000	Yeah right?
3872000	3873000	So anyway
3873000	3875000	It would depend if his project is based on a game or not
3875000	3879000	Can you imagine if they made Metal Gear Solid a more traditional movie?
3879000	3880000	You know?
3880000	3883000	If they just took some of the concepts from Metal Gear Solid and made a 90 minute film out of it
3883000	3884000	Could be interesting
3884000	3885000	I don't know
3885000	3887000	Wasn't that already Metal Gear Solid 4?
3887000	3889000	Perhaps
3889000	3892000	I think that is on record of having the longest number of
3892000	3895000	The longest length of cutscenes total
3896000	3898000	I hate Death Stranding is almost out
3898000	3899000	Alright
3899000	3903000	Well you know Kojima wanted to go into filmmaking to begin with anyway
3903000	3904000	So
3904000	3905000	Yeah
3905000	3906000	So maybe this is one way
3906000	3908000	Maybe he's going through that midlife crisis right now
3908000	3911000	Where he's like I gotta do that thing I always wanted to do when I was younger
3911000	3912000	And never got around to doing
3912000	3913000	And now I have all these holl-
3913000	3916000	I'm friends with Conan O'Brien I can do what I want
3916000	3919000	No it might sound like I'm shading Hideo Kojima
3919000	3920000	But I'm really not
3920000	3922000	I actually think like a movie would be
3922000	3923000	I'd watch it
3923000	3924000	Hell yeah I would
3924000	3926000	Like he's a good storyteller so why not
3926000	3928000	It's only 90 minutes maybe 2 hours
3928000	3930000	Ok maybe a Kojima movie is going to be like Titanic length
3930000	3931000	Like 3 and a half hours
3931000	3933000	But I'd still watch it right
3933000	3934000	Alright anyway
3934000	3936000	Let's travel around the room
3936000	3937000	That's all we have for news
3937000	3939000	Again these are early headlines
3939000	3942000	Huge news could have broke Thursday or Friday
3942000	3945000	Unfortunately the magic of radio is not that strong
3945000	3948000	For us to have heard it in advance
3948000	3950000	But you know we'll talk about
3950000	3952000	If there's anything really big that breaks
3952000	3955000	We will talk about it on our next live episode of OLR
3955000	3958000	Which will be next Sunday when we return
3958000	3960000	Which by the way is also starting to shoulder up
3960000	3964000	On the big Bamani holiday of 19 November and 20 November
3964000	3966000	I believe the show is on the 10th
3966000	3968000	Or no excuse me 10th was we're missing
3968000	3970000	17th is when the next show will be
3970000	3972000	So we're starting to saddle up against that
3972000	3973000	Yeah
3973000	3974000	Bamani holiday so anyway
3974000	3977000	Alright let's travel around and just catch up with our hosts
3977000	3979000	I know it's only a couple days into the week
3979000	3981000	But I don't know if you guys have anything
3981000	3982000	Any personal tidbits you want to get out
3982000	3985000	Or what kind of video games you have been playing
3985000	3987000	With what little time we've had
3987000	3989000	Darsakha I know you were mentioning a little bit of The Sims
3989000	3990000	While you've been recovering
3990000	3992000	Yeah I'm still on Sims 4
3992000	3995000	That's really about it
3995000	3998000	Just because I don't really have much attention span
3998000	4001000	For anything with everything else I've got going on
4001000	4003000	And honestly instead of playing Sims 4
4003000	4005000	I really should be working on that website
4005000	4008000	And getting an email migration finished
4008000	4014000	But I'm still just sore and itchy
4014000	4017000	Yeah but even when you're working on a big project like that
4017000	4019000	Taking a 30 minute game break can sometimes be
4019000	4022000	Sims is not a 30 minute game break
4022000	4023000	Fair, fair
4023000	4028000	I started playing last night around midnight
4028000	4032000	And it was 4 in the morning when I quit
4032000	4036000	And the only reason I quit is because the game crashed
4036000	4038000	Because I would save the game
4038000	4040000	Did you say I played a little bit of Sims?
4040000	4042000	That is a little bit
4042000	4044000	That is a little bit of Sims
4044000	4046000	Because basically I have to gear myself up for it
4046000	4048000	And not make any plans
4050000	4052000	Cancel the Friday night plans
4052000	4054000	Order a pizza
4054000	4056000	Dim the lights
4056000	4058000	It's Sims night
4058000	4060000	Hey that's me and Civilization
4060000	4062000	So you know what
4062000	4064000	There's always going to be some game
4064000	4066000	Build the pool, remove the stairs
4066000	4068000	That doesn't work anymore
4068000	4070000	I will find creative ways to make that work dammit
4070000	4072000	And actually though
4072000	4074000	With the next household that I'm doing
4074000	4076000	I'm actually building the current version
4076000	4078000	Of the full house
4078000	4080000	Because the full plans
4080000	4082000	Yeah but I want to build it with the current design
4082000	4084000	There's actually pictures of it
4084000	4086000	It's really really cute inside
4086000	4088000	Like the actual house in San Francisco
4088000	4090000	So not what you see on TV
4090000	4092000	Because obviously what you saw on TV is not the actual house
4092000	4094000	I mean honestly it's a really gorgeous house
4094000	4096000	But I'm thinking about doing that
4096000	4098000	But I'm going to have it
4098000	4100000	I'm going to have a witch
4100000	4102000	A vampire and a ghost
4102000	4104000	Live in the house
4104000	4106000	Because I can't have a werewolf
4106000	4108000	Like in being human
4108000	4110000	So I'm going to try to recreate that
4110000	4112000	Thing and see how it lasts
4112000	4114000	If my ghost doesn't want to move off
4114000	4116000	Dark Sakura I hate to break this to you
4116000	4118000	But Halloween is over
4118000	4120000	Halloween
4120000	4122000	Is not just a holiday
4122000	4124000	It's a way of life
4124000	4126000	Listen this is how you do it
4126000	4128000	Okay because I was
4128000	4130000	She is Jack Skellington
4130000	4132000	By the way I know my cheat codes to pick what type of
4132000	4134000	Ghost I get and how they died
4134000	4136000	Like my kids were talking about the neighbors having their
4136000	4138000	Halloween decorations still up
4138000	4140000	I'm like it's fine all they have to do is put Christmas
4140000	4142000	Hats on everything or Santa hats
4142000	4144000	And then it's Christmas stuff
4144000	4146000	You can just put hats on everything
4146000	4148000	And then you can just keep it up all your own
4148000	4150000	They have one of those witches that looks like it's
4150000	4152000	Flown into the door those are hilarious
4152000	4154000	I never see those
4154000	4156000	Just put a Santa hat on that witch
4156000	4158000	They have the feet sticking out of the ground
4158000	4160000	Of course of course
4160000	4162000	And then they have this weird skeleton like
4162000	4164000	Grim reaper thing that's always
4164000	4166000	I tell the kids that it's always staring at them
4166000	4168000	And then one time somehow it triggered from
4168000	4170000	20 feet away so that freaked them out
4172000	4174000	Good times
4174000	4176000	You could just go eco and just put a real skeleton in your yard
4176000	4178000	Right
4178000	4180000	Humans are
4180000	4182000	Are uh
4182000	4184000	What's the word I'm thinking of
4184000	4186000	Biodegradable
4186000	4188000	Oh yeah well you think your garage haunted house
4188000	4190000	Is cool Karen? Well at my house we've got
4190000	4192000	The bodies exhibited
4192000	4194000	Anyway
4194000	4196000	Alright moving on
4196000	4198000	Loki what about you? What's going on with you?
4198000	4200000	I've just been playing more of
4200000	4202000	What the golf?
4202000	4204000	And I've like
4204000	4206000	They have the way it works is like they have
4206000	4208000	Different labs so it's like different themed
4208000	4210000	Courses or whatever they're in there but there's like a
4210000	4212000	Ton of levels it's ridiculous and then each
4212000	4214000	Level has like a par or
4214000	4216000	Like a slightly more challenging level than
4216000	4218000	Another challenging level on top of it
4218000	4220000	And they have homages to a bunch of stuff
4220000	4222000	There's homages to like Mario
4222000	4224000	Brothers um I'm playing through
4224000	4226000	One right now that's an homage to Portal
4226000	4228000	Um that was pretty cool and then
4228000	4230000	Um
4230000	4232000	Yeah so I've been just doing lots of that
4232000	4234000	I'm probably gonna work some more on my game
4234000	4236000	I'm starting to like
4236000	4238000	Feel that like frustration that
4238000	4240000	Haven't progressed very far recently
4240000	4242000	Because I've been trying to get my
4242000	4244000	Respawn stuff to work correctly
4244000	4246000	And it
4246000	4248000	Hasn't been because
4248000	4250000	And I don't know why like
4250000	4252000	I was trying to focus on doing the most
4252000	4254000	Simplest thing possible but
4254000	4256000	Because it's sort of modeled after
4256000	4258000	Smash TV all the enemies spawn
4258000	4260000	Through doors so they have to walk through a
4260000	4262000	Door and trying to program a
4262000	4264000	Door to only work at certain times
4264000	4266000	When like say the player is on the other
4266000	4268000	Side of the door and I need to open
4268000	4270000	But also not have the player be able to
4270000	4272000	Jump back through the door
4272000	4274000	It's a pain in the ass
4274000	4276000	So I've been stuck
4276000	4278000	With door logic and stuff
4278000	4280000	Trying to get like one way walls
4280000	4282000	To work and stuff and
4282000	4284000	In many creative ways to
4284000	4286000	Do that and always finding a way to
4286000	4288000	Somehow break it
4288000	4290000	So
4290000	4292000	I may just say fuck the doors eventually
4292000	4294000	And just spawn into the level like
4294000	4296000	I don't care anymore just whatever
4296000	4298000	I just want this to be done but
4298000	4300000	Stay tuned for Loki's second game fuck the doors
4300000	4302000	Alright
4302000	4304000	My week obviously I've been
4304000	4306000	Preparing for my trip to New York this weekend
4306000	4308000	Which I'm very excited about but now I'm like
4308000	4310000	I'm not going to be able to do everything
4310000	4312000	That we want to do like their text messaging
4312000	4314000	Today about everything they want to do I'm like we don't have that kind of time
4314000	4316000	And it's like trying to fit in
4316000	4318000	People and stuff too I'm just like oh my gosh
4318000	4320000	It's going to be a busy busy weekend but I am
4320000	4322000	Looking forward to it
4322000	4324000	But early in the week I'm
4324000	4326000	Still playing Final Fantasy 14
4326000	4328000	It's kind of a thing I get on and regularly do with my friends
4328000	4330000	My Machinist is almost 18
4330000	4332000	So I'll finally have a healer, a tank
4332000	4334000	And a DPS at 80
4334000	4336000	Since my Gunbreaker and my Astrologian are already
4336000	4338000	80 my Machinist will soon be there too
4338000	4340000	Which has been a lot of fun to play
4340000	4342000	And I'm still continuing on in Bloodstained
4342000	4344000	I made quite a bit more progress last night
4344000	4346000	I got past the second boss
4346000	4348000	Which is funny because for all the difficulty
4348000	4350000	The first boss in that game gave me
4350000	4352000	I one shotted the second boss
4352000	4354000	It is all about that drill weapon which we talked about last week
4354000	4356000	Dark Sakura that Dan
4356000	4358000	I guess used a lot too
4358000	4360000	That drill made that second boss cake
4360000	4362000	So yeah
4362000	4364000	Pro tip get that shard
4364000	4366000	From one of those guys that has the drill as soon as you can
4366000	4368000	Because it makes things easier
4368000	4370000	Anyway that's really it
4370000	4372000	For my gaming week so far
4372000	4374000	So with that let's go to Twitter
4374000	4376000	Because we did open up Twitter
4376000	4378000	For your questions
4378000	4380000	And we want to get to some of those questions
4380000	4382000	That you guys sent us
4382000	4384000	So let's get to some of these
4384000	4386000	So we had some tweets and our first tweet
4386000	4388000	With a question comes from
4388000	4390000	Superhulk1999
4390000	4392000	Who asked us
4392000	4394000	Will the new consoles come with enough
4394000	4396000	SSD hard drive space
4396000	4398000	Like at least
4398000	4400000	8 terabytes or more
4400000	4402000	And that's signed Mike B
4402000	4404000	So thanks for the question Mike B
4404000	4406000	What do you think?
4406000	4408000	It seems like when companies release new consoles
4408000	4410000	Maybe there isn't always enough storage
4410000	4412000	Right away especially for where the generation
4412000	4414000	Ends up by the end of its life
4414000	4416000	Yeah I don't think there's gonna be
4416000	4418000	Maybe I would see one or two terabyte
4418000	4420000	Hard drives in these consoles
4420000	4422000	I would like more
4422000	4424000	Especially when you look at like say
4424000	4426000	Red Dead Redemption 2 which just came out on PC
4426000	4428000	That's a 121 gigabyte download
4428000	4430000	And because everything
4430000	4432000	Works perfectly when you download it
4432000	4434000	As they're downloading it
4434000	4436000	Or they preloaded it early
4436000	4438000	And they go to decrypt it or whatever
4438000	4440000	It redownloaded it
4440000	4442000	Oh shit
4442000	4444000	Good job
4444000	4446000	Game sizes especially
4446000	4448000	They're pushing 4K and everything
4448000	4450000	And pushing better graphics
4450000	4452000	That's higher resolution textures
4452000	4454000	More uncompressed stuff
4454000	4456000	That's gonna fill up really fast
4456000	4458000	Yeah
4458000	4460000	So I think what their solution's
4460000	4462000	Gonna be is probably allowing
4462000	4464000	External storage again
4464000	4466000	And so they'll be on you to buy an external
4466000	4468000	5 terabyte drive or something like that
4468000	4470000	To load your shit on
4470000	4472000	But that's
4472000	4474000	That's unfortunate and in order to keep the cost down
4474000	4476000	That's what they're gonna have to do is cut back on storage
4476000	4478000	So I would hope that one to two terabytes
4478000	4480000	Would be the kind of norm but
4480000	4482000	Yeah I would think as game companies
4482000	4484000	Are pushing more and more and more to digital
4484000	4486000	You know and the digital downloads and so forth
4486000	4488000	They've gotta have more space
4488000	4490000	But I think these companies could get away with a
4490000	4492000	1 or 2 terabyte drive a solid state drive
4492000	4494000	Well but solid state drives
4494000	4496000	Don't really go that high
4496000	4498000	Like you know the tweeter says 8 terabytes
4498000	4500000	But the simple mac
4500000	4502000	Mac to fatter?
4502000	4504000	Fact of the matter
4504000	4506000	Yes the fact of the matter is
4506000	4508000	The solid state drives are usually much
4508000	4510000	Smaller than your like you know
4510000	4512000	I have a 3 terabyte drive in my computer
4512000	4514000	But it's not solid state
4514000	4516000	Cause most solid state drives you can buy at Fry's
4516000	4518000	Like they don't go much past like 500 gigs
4518000	4520000	Maybe you can get a terabyte
4520000	4522000	Yeah but maybe they can like
4522000	4524000	Decide how they want to store that data
4524000	4526000	So that they can put the stuff that they need
4526000	4528000	Faster on the solid state drive
4528000	4530000	And you know maybe cash in the other stuff
4530000	4532000	From like your larger drive
4532000	4534000	I don't know
4534000	4536000	I think it would be more important for
4536000	4538000	Expansion to be easy
4538000	4540000	Like you know for all the shit that Nintendo
4540000	4542000	Is not having any room on its console
4542000	4544000	At least it's very easy to buy a new card
4544000	4546000	And expand it right
4546000	4548000	You know in the Playstation 4 you can expand
4548000	4550000	You know fairly easy and so forth so
4550000	4552000	I think as long as you can expand on whatever they give you
4552000	4554000	Relatively easy it'll be less of a problem
4554000	4556000	One other thing to consider
4556000	4558000	I think is that gaming is going
4558000	4560000	To go more and more into the cloud
4560000	4562000	Right cause that's a big thing as we talk about
4562000	4564000	Project xCloud we know Sony
4564000	4566000	Has been getting some interesting partners
4566000	4568000	When it comes to cloud gaming
4568000	4570000	Well maybe that space
4570000	4572000	Won't be as important as we think
4572000	4574000	Because there will be stuff
4574000	4576000	In the cloud which is just
4576000	4578000	On the internet but you know
4578000	4580000	That's the term everybody uses in the cloud
4580000	4582000	So it'll be interesting to see maybe the effects that that
4582000	4584000	Has on space
4584000	4586000	But I will bet the first printing
4586000	4588000	Will not be nearly enough so let's just
4588000	4590000	Hope that they allow it to be expandable
4590000	4592000	So we have a foodie question next
4592000	4594000	So this is from Redertainment
4594000	4596000	Who tweets orange lounge
4596000	4598000	Foodio I'm looking for
4598000	4600000	Recipe app suggestions
4600000	4602000	IOS preferably free
4602000	4604000	No dietary restrictions
4604000	4606000	I already have the joy of cooking
4606000	4608000	How to cook everything and
4608000	4610000	Mia lime
4610000	4612000	So I haven't a clue
4612000	4614000	There was one called Pepper for a while
4614000	4616000	But I don't know that it was free
4616000	4618000	He said no website it's all
4618000	4620000	App right? Yeah he just said app
4620000	4622000	Well I mean cause you can go
4622000	4624000	On websites like I have Epicurious
4624000	4626000	And Bon Appetit
4626000	4628000	And all of that
4628000	4630000	Yeah and technically if I'm not mistaken
4630000	4632000	In Safari you just click a couple buttons
4632000	4634000	And you can turn any website into like an app
4634000	4636000	Button basically so it runs like
4636000	4638000	It is an app kinda
4638000	4640000	Well and on top of that I'm actually
4640000	4642000	In the middle of compiling all of the recipes
4642000	4644000	That I like to use
4644000	4646000	As a PDF
4646000	4648000	To put into Apple Books just for myself
4648000	4650000	But I just did a quick search
4650000	4652000	On the app store right now there's NYT
4652000	4654000	Which is New York Times recipes
4654000	4656000	There's Yummly, Tasty
4656000	4658000	Which I actually use Tasty that's the one
4658000	4660000	Done by Buzzfeed
4660000	4662000	I was gonna say I think Redotainment is looking for suggestions
4662000	4664000	And so but you've used
4664000	4666000	I've used them before
4666000	4668000	Cause I gotta admit
4668000	4670000	Epicurious has an app
4670000	4672000	I'm terrible with recipes
4672000	4674000	Like Alan is truly the one
4674000	4676000	Who cooks between the two of us
4676000	4678000	I know how to do chicken on the form and grill
4678000	4680000	But that's
4680000	4682000	The extent of my knowledge
4682000	4684000	I would
4684000	4686000	So Yummly is good but their
4686000	4688000	Website is pretty terrible
4688000	4690000	Their videos because they've
4690000	4692000	Done some very dangerous things
4692000	4694000	On their videos before
4694000	4696000	But I mean Epicurious I've always been really good
4696000	4698000	I made my first cake with an Epicurious recipe
4698000	4700000	I did it from their website
4700000	4702000	But apparently they have an app
4702000	4704000	And I think I'm gonna get the New York Times
4704000	4706000	Cooking one myself
4706000	4708000	Cause that one looks pretty good
4708000	4710000	I do a lot of baking lately
4710000	4712000	Alright
4712000	4714000	Getting into another tweet
4714000	4716000	This one isn't awkward at all
4716000	4718000	This comes to us from
4718000	4720000	You all know who that is right?
4720000	4722000	That is GrandpaWarcraft
4722000	4724000	Or Captain Matt from the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast
4724000	4726000	Who tweeted us
4726000	4728000	This lovely gem of a question
4728000	4730000	Why did you dump GrandpaWarcraft
4730000	4732000	In 2009?
4732000	4734000	He would've made a good boyfriend
4734000	4736000	Now
4736000	4738000	It's a completely awkward thing to tweet me
4738000	4740000	When you know I'm married
4740000	4742000	And I know he's saying that only tongue in cheek
4742000	4744000	I wouldn't have read that on air
4744000	4746000	He just wasn't being a sass master
4746000	4748000	Because that's what he does
4748000	4750000	He drinks and he sasses
4750000	4752000	Sometimes you know
4752000	4754000	This has happened to everybody
4754000	4756000	At some point in their life
4756000	4758000	They go out on a date and they go
4758000	4760000	This person is going to be a great friend
4760000	4762000	Right?
4762000	4764000	And we are great friends
4764000	4766000	We did a podcast together for so many years
4766000	4768000	I live in his old house
4768000	4770000	And the reality is
4770000	4772000	If you had been my boyfriend
4772000	4774000	You'd be dead by now
4778000	4780000	Alright
4780000	4782000	Womp womp
4782000	4784000	I had to give him an answer
4784000	4786000	He'd enjoy
4786000	4788000	We're going on the
4788000	4790000	Star Trek Cruise together very soon
4790000	4792000	So I hope
4792000	4794000	I'm going to print out this tweet and frame it
4794000	4796000	And hang it in my cabin
4796000	4798000	Matt
4798000	4800000	And just remember it's 7 days and nights
4800000	4802000	At sea with me and my husband
4802000	4804000	Alright
4804000	4806000	Moving on
4806000	4808000	Girl
4808000	4810000	Look
4810000	4812000	If he's going to be awkward
4812000	4814000	I'm going to make it more awkward
4814000	4816000	Awkwarder?
4816000	4818000	Alright one more question
4818000	4820000	Coming from Flaco Jones
4820000	4822000	A more serious topic
4822000	4824000	Yeah come break our show again Flaco we miss you
4824000	4826000	Alright
4826000	4828000	Flaco Jones asks
4828000	4830000	Not sure if you got into this last week
4830000	4832000	But I noticed a lot of debate
4832000	4834000	About Death Stranding
4834000	4836000	Being good but not fun
4836000	4838000	In some reviewers opinions
4838000	4840000	My question is
4840000	4842000	Do games have to be fun?
4842000	4844000	If all games have to be fun
4844000	4846000	No matter what
4846000	4848000	Doesn't that prove that games
4848000	4850000	Can't be art
4852000	4854000	There's a difference between fun
4854000	4856000	And enjoyment
4856000	4858000	You know? Like you can
4858000	4860000	Enjoy something but not exactly
4860000	4862000	Have the most amount of fun looking at it
4862000	4864000	Right? Like
4864000	4866000	Like looking at
4866000	4868000	A painting. Like looking at Bosch
4868000	4870000	One of my favorite ever paintings
4870000	4872000	In the universe is
4872000	4874000	The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch
4874000	4876000	It's the same one that's got
4876000	4878000	Like the person
4878000	4880000	With the chicken head
4880000	4882000	And the ass bent over with people coming out of it
4882000	4884000	And the egg and all the weirdness
4884000	4886000	Because Bosch was an interesting fella
4886000	4888000	But I wouldn't say
4888000	4890000	That's a fun painting
4890000	4892000	It's not like something that's comfortable to look at
4892000	4894000	But it's enjoyable
4894000	4896000	Makes sense?
4896000	4898000	Yeah and I would say too that like
4898000	4900000	You know sometimes it's not necessarily about fun
4900000	4902000	I mean yes
4902000	4904000	Video games should be fun
4904000	4906000	It should be something that makes you feel good
4906000	4908000	But at the same time
4908000	4910000	I think it's more about emotion
4910000	4912000	Because art invokes emotion
4912000	4914000	Art invokes response right?
4914000	4916000	The biggest insult an artist
4916000	4918000	Can see with their work
4918000	4920000	Is for it to evoke nothing
4920000	4922000	But I would say like movies
4922000	4924000	We compare games to movies a lot
4924000	4926000	And going out to the movies
4926000	4928000	Is fun right?
4928000	4930000	But then I think about the time I went and saw
4930000	4932000	The movie Dancer in the Dark starring
4932000	4934000	Dancer in the Dark
4934000	4936000	And I cried so hard
4936000	4938000	And so much that I was like scream crying
4938000	4940000	At the end of the movie
4940000	4942000	And my shirt was like halfway soaked
4942000	4944000	I don't know if I would call that experience
4944000	4946000	Fun
4946000	4948000	But does that mean Dancer in the Dark is not art?
4948000	4950000	Yeah
4950000	4952000	So I kind of think there's like a similar sort of thing here
4952000	4954000	It's not necessarily that I went to the movie
4954000	4956000	And I realized Dancer in the Dark
4956000	4958000	Is a bit of an obscure pick
4958000	4960000	But pick a sad movie that you've seen
4960000	4962000	I see the grudge
4962000	4964000	Any kind of Japanese horror movie
4964000	4966000	That doesn't necessarily have a happy ending
4966000	4968000	Cause like American movies are all about
4968000	4970000	Happy endings and shit
4970000	4972000	What about like a serious movie
4972000	4974000	Like a Schindler's List
4974000	4976000	A Saving Private Ryan
4976000	4978000	You know movies that are
4978000	4980000	Kind of about some very serious heavy
4980000	4982000	Topics
4982000	4984000	But it's kind of like you get
4984000	4986000	And I don't think I would call either of those movies
4986000	4988000	Fun
4988000	4990000	I mean I go they're bad
4990000	4992000	Or I had a bad time or I regret seeing them
4992000	4994000	There's a difference between enjoyment
4994000	4996000	And having fun
4996000	4998000	I look at fun as a kind of a positive
4998000	5000000	Mirthful sort of thing
5000000	5002000	But to enjoy just means that you get
5002000	5004000	Some sort of satisfaction out of it
5004000	5006000	Right
5006000	5008000	There's also something to consider
5008000	5010000	This might actually be true of some games
5010000	5012000	I say that about Dancer in the Dark
5012000	5014000	I don't know if I would watch that movie
5014000	5016000	Again
5016000	5018000	There's other movies out there
5018000	5020000	I know I'm trying to think of something
5020000	5022000	I wouldn't say that Everybody's Gone under the Rapture
5022000	5024000	Was fun
5024000	5026000	But it's enjoyable and provocative
5026000	5028000	Like and there's certain games where I'm like
5028000	5030000	I'm glad I played that
5030000	5032000	And I'm really glad I experienced that
5032000	5034000	But I'm probably never going to play that again
5034000	5036000	Yeah I don't think I can go play it again
5036000	5038000	You know just
5038000	5040000	I had
5040000	5042000	I was playing it
5042000	5044000	I played it on stream
5044000	5046000	I kind of
5046000	5048000	Part of me was just I played it privately
5048000	5050000	Because I did have just a response
5050000	5052000	Where I had to you know once I was off camera
5052000	5054000	I was like oh my god
5054000	5056000	Oh my god and I had already seen you play it
5056000	5058000	It's a heavy game and again
5058000	5060000	I think so many people slept on this game
5060000	5062000	Because I got smacked with a walking simulator
5062000	5064000	Type of thing
5064000	5066000	Maybe that is a great
5066000	5068000	Because Death Stranding keeps getting labeled with this
5068000	5070000	Walking simulator and all this thing
5070000	5072000	Like that was a game where everybody's gone
5072000	5074000	And I remember the rapture got that whole thing about
5074000	5076000	Where's the game? What are you doing? What's the game?
5076000	5078000	A game
5078000	5080000	It's a narrative
5080000	5082000	I don't look at it as a game
5082000	5084000	I look at it as an interactive narrative
5084000	5086000	And honestly those are the kinds of games
5086000	5088000	I've personally been getting more into lately
5088000	5090000	Are those kinds
5090000	5092000	Other than building houses and watching my sims die
5092000	5094000	But I like the ones
5094000	5096000	Where you're living the story
5096000	5098000	You're seeing it unfold
5098000	5100000	Like To the Moon was another good one
5100000	5102000	I think the game
5102000	5104000	In Everybody's Gone to the Rapture was the exploration
5104000	5106000	Because you didn't necessarily do things
5106000	5108000	In the same order
5108000	5110000	There is a way you can play that game
5110000	5112000	Where you can beat it in like 15 minutes
5112000	5114000	If you just skip everything basically
5114000	5116000	But I don't think you'd get the same thing
5116000	5118000	Out of that necessarily
5118000	5120000	It's going and exploring and getting all the little
5120000	5122000	All the little
5122000	5124000	Unlocks, bits of story and the memories
5124000	5126000	That you unlock
5126000	5128000	Are part of the reward system
5128000	5130000	That you earned for doing your effort
5130000	5132000	An example akin to that
5132000	5134000	Is something like Lost Odyssey
5134000	5136000	You remember that classic Xbox 360 game
5136000	5138000	That really just was Final Fantasy
5138000	5140000	Under a different name pretty much
5140000	5142000	But part of Lost Odyssey was that the main character was immortal
5142000	5144000	It's not a spoiler, it's established in the opening
5144000	5146000	Is that the main character is immortal
5146000	5148000	And you get these books
5148000	5150000	Throughout the story
5150000	5152000	As you're playing a video game
5152000	5154000	You sit there and you read a book
5154000	5156000	Skyrim and Oblivion do this too
5156000	5158000	There's books in there
5158000	5160000	And some people go, meh, reading
5160000	5162000	And just throw away the book, right Logie?
5162000	5164000	Yes
5164000	5166000	But other people, especially in I think Lost Odyssey
5166000	5168000	Because if you actually go
5168000	5170000	And you read those books
5170000	5172000	It's like, holy shit
5172000	5174000	Some of those stories
5174000	5176000	Have almost a stronger
5176000	5178000	Emotional impact than the game
5178000	5180000	So isn't it weird
5180000	5182000	That we're talking about an art form
5182000	5184000	Embedded in another art form
5184000	5186000	Emotional response embedded within another
5186000	5188000	Emotional response
5188000	5190000	Or what about lore hunters in series
5190000	5192000	Like, you know, because
5192000	5194000	When I was playing WoW
5194000	5196000	I mean, the biggest thing that I got enjoyment out of
5196000	5198000	Was lore hunting
5198000	5200000	Was reading the books and seeing the things
5200000	5202000	And then, of course, breaking the game with my demon hunter
5202000	5204000	And there's some people that will play MMOs
5204000	5206000	And I'm sometimes guilty of this
5206000	5208000	They'll just, oh, quest text, meh
5208000	5210000	They skip it, it's like, what am I supposed to do in this quest, right?
5210000	5212000	But you're right, there's a whole rich world
5212000	5214000	In that, if you want to experience that
5214000	5216000	Anyway, I think we might be getting a little bit lost
5216000	5218000	From the original question that was asked
5218000	5220000	But I think we are kind of giving some examples
5220000	5222000	Is that there's also, like, different
5222000	5224000	There's different ways to have fun
5224000	5226000	Yeah
5226000	5228000	And sometimes that exploration
5228000	5230000	That sort of is the fun
5230000	5232000	And I think Death Stranding, if what I'm hearing about it
5232000	5234000	Is true, and again, I'm not going to know this
5234000	5236000	Till the next episode when I get to play it for myself
5236000	5238000	There might be a part of Death Stranding
5238000	5240000	That's kind of like everybody's gone to the rapture
5240000	5242000	Where it's like, you could just focus on the game part
5242000	5244000	Which maybe is not going to be the most
5244000	5246000	Maybe it is just going to be walking and tricky balancing
5246000	5248000	But if you allow yourself to get immersed
5248000	5250000	In that story and that universe around it
5250000	5252000	Then potentially
5252000	5254000	There might be more fulfillment out of that
5254000	5256000	And you might be left with a more rewarding sense out of that
5256000	5258000	I'm looking forward to the story aspects of it
5258000	5260000	Yeah
5260000	5262000	You know, and
5262000	5264000	That's why, like, for example, Breath of the Wild
5264000	5266000	Yeah, very
5266000	5268000	It could look like a very simple story
5268000	5270000	On the surface, but when you're
5270000	5272000	But I like seeing the way the societies are built
5272000	5274000	And the language behind it
5274000	5276000	And seeing how they've built the world
5276000	5278000	The world that something exists in
5278000	5280000	To me is more of the game than the game
5280000	5282000	Isn't it interesting, Dark Sakura
5282000	5284000	How, like, you and I
5284000	5286000	Especially, like, in the early
5286000	5288000	Reveals of this Death Stranding thing
5288000	5290000	We're both kind of like, what?
5290000	5292000	Okay, where's the game, right?
5292000	5294000	We're both kind of, like, sitting here going, come on
5294000	5296000	Right? But now it's like,
5296000	5298000	Now that we know more and more about it
5298000	5300000	It's kind of like, I have this morbid curiosity
5300000	5302000	But I'm more fascinated with this than ever
5302000	5304000	Yeah, and I mean
5304000	5306000	And you know me, I'm attracted to kind of the
5306000	5308000	Offshoot weirdo kind of storylines
5308000	5310000	Anyway
5310000	5312000	But it's like, I'll put it this way
5312000	5314000	I have learned a whole
5314000	5316000	In-game written language before
5316000	5318000	I mean, I've forgotten it since then
5318000	5320000	Because this was in high school
5320000	5322000	But I mean, my friends and I used to write
5322000	5324000	Each other codes in
5324000	5326000	And in other, you know, kind of
5326000	5328000	In-game languages
5328000	5330000	In a game that we've played before
5330000	5332000	You know, so having just
5332000	5334000	That richness to it
5334000	5336000	And I really think this is going to be a very rich
5336000	5338000	Universe with the work that's put into it
5338000	5340000	And the people behind it
5340000	5342000	So, yeah
5342000	5344000	Yeah, so we'll see
5344000	5346000	Great question, Flocko
5346000	5348000	Made a great conversation
5348000	5350000	Out of it, so
5350000	5352000	Love to have those here on the show
5352000	5354000	Sadly, that's all the questions we got
5354000	5356000	But, you know, the last time
5356000	5358000	We got probably twice as many
5358000	5360000	But we also had twice as much
5360000	5362000	So, that's alright
5362000	5364000	We're gonna try to really grow the family
5364000	5366000	Here at OLR as we move into our 800th
5366000	5368000	Episode and so forth, try to get the word out
5368000	5370000	God, that many
5370000	5372000	What are we gonna do when we hit a thousand?
5372000	5374000	That's still
5374000	5376000	A thousand would be
5376000	5378000	A good four years away
5378000	5380000	You know, I just like, I'm saying when
5380000	5382000	Because I think it's gonna happen
5382000	5384000	There's a, okay, real block
5384000	5386000	There's that honest part of me that's like, are we gonna
5386000	5388000	Hit a thousand? I'm like, oh my god
5388000	5390000	Four more years of this, but then I'm like
5390000	5392000	Didn't we think we were gonna hit 500?
5392000	5394000	We never thought we'd hit 500 and here we still are
5394000	5396000	So it's like, it's one of those things where it's like
5396000	5398000	I don't know what I'd do with myself
5398000	5400000	Maybe I'm not having fun, but I'm enjoying the ride
5404000	5406000	So if you're not having fun, is this art?
5406000	5408000	Is this art?
5408000	5410000	I'm choking some emotions
5410000	5412000	I mean, and not just to go back
5412000	5414000	On the nostalgic, you know, thing before
5414000	5416000	But look at what all of us have done
5416000	5418000	Every single one of us
5418000	5420000	In this room have gotten married
5420000	5422000	Yeah
5422000	5424000	One of us has spawned
5424000	5426000	One of us has prevented spawning
5426000	5428000	We have
5428000	5430000	Animals
5430000	5432000	We have lost people close to us
5432000	5434000	Yes
5434000	5436000	We have gained people that we don't want to be close to us
5436000	5438000	And lost them
5438000	5440000	And lost them
5440000	5442000	In a different sense
5442000	5444000	We have changed jobs
5444000	5446000	Yeah, all of us have changed jobs
5446000	5448000	All at some point in this room have been fun employed
5448000	5450000	Rob
5450000	5452000	No
5452000	5454000	No, you have not
5454000	5456000	I have not been fun employed
5456000	5458000	I was super fun employed though and that was great
5458000	5460000	Except I like money
5460000	5462000	You know, we adult harder than we used to
5462000	5464000	But
5464000	5466000	That's not fun, but it's enjoyable
5466000	5468000	But I'm just saying, it's like
5468000	5470000	No, for sure
5470000	5472000	I don't see any point in giving up
5472000	5474000	No, you're right, you're right
5474000	5476000	We will continue to do this until
5476000	5478000	One of two things
5478000	5480000	Either we can't
5480000	5482000	We're not able to get in the same room
5482000	5484000	And do this anymore on Sunday nights
5484000	5486000	Rob has a full hip replacement
5486000	5488000	Yeah, I mean, well
5488000	5490000	We physically can't
5490000	5492000	That might be one reason we don't do it anymore
5492000	5494000	Or we just kind of decide
5494000	5496000	I think we've said everything we have to say
5496000	5498000	No, that'll never happen
5498000	5500000	See, that's where I'm kind of at
5500000	5502000	Well, we've kind of
5502000	5504000	That is never going to happen
5504000	5506000	We still find new things to say
5506000	5508000	I don't know, here's
5508000	5510000	Let me ask this honest question
5510000	5512000	I'm going to reward those that have stuck around
5512000	5514000	With a bonus episode this deep in
5514000	5516000	With some real deep content here
5516000	5518000	Oh, yeah
5518000	5520000	Do you think your emotions
5520000	5522000	And your feelings about gaming
5522000	5524000	Are as strong as they were
5524000	5526000	When OLR first started
5526000	5528000	Probably more so
5528000	5530000	I mean, I wouldn't say that I am the gamer
5530000	5532000	I was
5532000	5534000	You know, ten years ago
5534000	5536000	Fifteen years ago, etc.
5536000	5538000	You know, I like to think that I've
5538000	5540000	I've
5540000	5542000	Grown
5542000	5544000	As a gamer
5544000	5546000	And grown into different tastes
5546000	5548000	You know, but
5548000	5550000	I think that
5550000	5552000	As I've grown and matured through it
5552000	5554000	I've got different attitudes
5554000	5556000	And when I see people
5556000	5558000	Who are now in the position that I was
5558000	5560000	When we started
5560000	5562000	I feel like I've got more to contribute
5562000	5564000	So, I mean, does that make sense?
5564000	5566000	No, no, totally, for sure
5566000	5568000	I don't know, like
5568000	5570000	I have to admit there's a part of me that's having
5570000	5572000	A harder and harder time staying on top
5572000	5574000	Of everything that's going on in gaming
5574000	5576000	And I don't know if that's because of my
5576000	5578000	Tendency to just kind of use MMOs
5578000	5580000	As my gaming crutch or what have you
5580000	5582000	Where I'm just kind of like, this is my comfort zone
5582000	5584000	This is my place and the thing that I do
5584000	5586000	But I feel like it's been harder
5586000	5588000	As the years go on to really stay on top
5588000	5590000	Of everything that's going on in gaming
5590000	5592000	And I don't know if this is also like a sign of getting older
5592000	5594000	But there's also some times where you kind of look at
5594000	5596000	Like these things that
5596000	5598000	The big discussions and debate that gamers are having
5598000	5600000	Where you kind of go like, I don't know if I
5600000	5602000	Get that, or I don't know if I
5602000	5604000	Understand why people
5604000	5606000	Are having that type of reaction
5606000	5608000	I think it's necessarily like
5608000	5610000	Before, like I know when we first
5610000	5612000	That's where you respond, okay boomer
5612000	5614000	Just kidding, GenX
5614000	5616000	GenX, it's GenX
5616000	5618000	Thank you
5618000	5620000	I think right now it's just
5620000	5622000	We've kind of grown with
5622000	5624000	Before, like I thought I had to
5624000	5626000	Get everything to be able to talk about everything
5626000	5628000	And then it's just like
5628000	5630000	It's like, look how much money I've wasted on
5630000	5632000	Like all these systems I didn't play
5632000	5634000	It's like, okay, we'll just scale back
5634000	5636000	With what you get
5636000	5638000	And not necessarily
5638000	5640000	Purchase every single game that comes out
5640000	5642000	Yeah, I still do catch myself
5642000	5644000	Doing that, like I have several
5644000	5646000	Games that are like big titles that I have
5646000	5648000	Not touched at all, like Kingdom Hearts 3
5648000	5650000	Just the other day
5650000	5652000	I'm like, oh yeah, I do have that game, don't I?
5652000	5654000	So like, I have this whole library
5654000	5656000	Of stuff I haven't touched, but I'll pick stuff up
5656000	5658000	Because I feel like I want it
5658000	5660000	But that's going to be the same thing
5660000	5662000	I think when the next-gen systems come out
5662000	5664000	It's just like, I'm not going to buy
5664000	5666000	Both of those systems
5666000	5668000	I will see what happens
5668000	5670000	But I don't know
5670000	5672000	I don't feel the need to do that
5672000	5674000	Even right now, I haven't played my PlayStation 4 in months
5674000	5676000	So
5676000	5678000	I don't know
5678000	5680000	I mean, we'll see
5680000	5682000	It's time, really, a lot of it
5682000	5684000	We don't have as much time as we used to
5684000	5686000	Dedicate the stuff like that
5686000	5688000	You have to balance it between everything else
5688000	5690000	So, yeah
5690000	5692000	I don't know
5692000	5694000	Anyway, the other thing
5694000	5696000	I'll piggyback on what you were saying to our Sakura
5696000	5698000	About just having
5698000	5700000	This place to do the show
5700000	5702000	And everything that has transformed in our lives
5702000	5704000	While the show has gone on
5704000	5706000	I think there's something to be said as well
5706000	5708000	About the way we've watched our audience
5708000	5710000	Grow with us
5710000	5712000	And the things that our audience has done
5712000	5714000	We have seen folks from our audience
5714000	5716000	Go on to do their own shows
5716000	5718000	And to do their own live streaming
5718000	5720000	And broadcasting and getting their voices
5720000	5722000	Truly out there
5722000	5724000	And in many ways, and I really mean this when I say it
5724000	5726000	There is truly no greater compliment
5726000	5728000	To what we've done
5728000	5730000	Here at OLR than the fact that
5730000	5732000	Some of you
5732000	5734000	Feel empowered to do the same
5734000	5736000	Yeah
5736000	5738000	And I think that alone has made this adventure
5738000	5740000	Worth it
5740000	5742000	I sound like it's over, but it's not
5742000	5744000	The road thus far
5744000	5746000	We're entitled to a little rumination
5746000	5748000	Sure, of course
5748000	5750000	We're fucking old
5750000	5752000	What happens when you talk to the old player character
5752000	5754000	In the video games?
5754000	5756000	Well, let me tell you about it
5756000	5758000	Let me spin you a tale
5758000	5760000	Girl
5760000	5762000	You know, I think that also
5762000	5764000	I mean, just go back and listen
5764000	5766000	To even a hundred episodes back
5766000	5768000	We're always
5768000	5770000	You know, I think that in some cases
5770000	5772000	The people who have stayed with us
5772000	5774000	Have our own personal struggles that we've had
5774000	5776000	On the show
5776000	5778000	That I think
5778000	5780000	That maybe even outside of just the realm of gaming
5780000	5782000	You know, we're people
5782000	5784000	And if anything that we might have experienced
5784000	5786000	Will help other people
5786000	5788000	Then I'm fine sharing those experiences
5788000	5790000	With people
5790000	5792000	Yeah, for sure
5792000	5794000	That's why I talk about my health openly
5794000	5796000	That's why I talk about
5796000	5798000	Real life stuff openly
5798000	5800000	Because it's not
5800000	5802000	The games that you're playing can also be a reflection
5802000	5804000	Of where you are mentally
5804000	5806000	For sure
5806000	5808000	You made me think about
5808000	5810000	The greatest
5810000	5812000	Feeling, the greatest reward
5812000	5814000	The greatest thing I've probably ever felt
5814000	5816000	From doing this show
5816000	5818000	When you talk about being open with your life
5818000	5820000	And being your authentic self here on air
5820000	5822000	The emails I've gotten
5822000	5824000	Where they were like
5824000	5826000	I think it's a little different now in the year 2019
5826000	5828000	But this show's been around for 17 years
5828000	5830000	In the earlier years of the show
5830000	5832000	Especially when we were first a podcast
5832000	5834000	2006, 2007, right?
5834000	5836000	When I got that email that said
5836000	5838000	Rob, you being your authentic self
5838000	5840000	And being a quote unquote
5840000	5842000	Normal gay guy
5842000	5844000	But that's, you know
5844000	5846000	When people are in their feelings
5846000	5848000	I totally get why somebody phrases it that way
5848000	5850000	You being a normal gay guy
5850000	5852000	Out and open and a gaming fan like me
5852000	5854000	It helped me
5854000	5856000	To accept that this was a part of myself
5856000	5858000	Just thinking about it
5858000	5860000	There is no
5860000	5862000	There is no greater reward, period
5862000	5864000	And I think
5864000	5866000	Just with our dynamic on here
5866000	5868000	The three of us
5868000	5870000	We actually
5870000	5872000	Kind of represent a different demographic
5872000	5874000	Each of us
5874000	5876000	That can interact together
5876000	5878000	I think that's what's kept this show going
5878000	5880000	As long as it has
5880000	5882000	There's been nights
5882000	5884000	We can get into it
5884000	5886000	Very passionate opinions
5886000	5888000	And I'm sure we've said things that maybe even
5888000	5890000	Piss some of our listeners off
5890000	5892000	But at the end of the day
5892000	5894000	They kind of come back because
5894000	5896000	It's that bar where you go where everybody knows your name
5896000	5898000	That whole thing, right?
5898000	5900000	It's like this, we have a strong friendship here
5900000	5902000	Where it's like, we're going to have passion
5902000	5904000	We're going to have opinions
5904000	5906000	We're going to have those things
5906000	5908000	But at the end of the day
5908000	5910000	We're all cut from the same nerd cloth
5910000	5912000	I guess
5912000	5914000	I'm just the poorly sewn one
5914000	5916000	I'm the amateur cosplayer
5916000	5918000	Of the group now
5918000	5920000	Fuzzy wuzzy feelings
5920000	5922000	That was deep
5922000	5924000	Someone fart before I get, you know
5924000	5926000	Well I will say you know that Loki
5926000	5928000	Followed up the tweet that Flocko
5928000	5930000	Wrote putting fun plus
5930000	5932000	Art equals
5932000	5934000	Fart
5934000	5936000	So there you go
5936000	5938000	We hope you found this episode
5938000	5940000	This bonus episode of Orange Laundry
5940000	5942000	Is a big gigantic fart
5942000	5944000	That's fun plus art
5944000	5946000	Thank you for sticking with us
5946000	5948000	Through this bonus episode
5948000	5950000	Through however many episodes you've listened to Orange Laundry
5950000	5952000	One other thing I wanted to say real quick
5952000	5954000	Sorry not to go back to the deep stuff
5954000	5956000	I think we've been talking behind the scenes
5956000	5958000	About trying to do some creative
5958000	5960000	Kicks in the butt
5960000	5962000	For episode 800
5962000	5964000	We kind of always ask ourselves
5964000	5966000	How do we celebrate 17 years?
5966000	5968000	How do we celebrate another year?
5968000	5970000	How do we celebrate another hundred episodes
5970000	5972000	When you've been doing it like this long right?
5972000	5974000	And I think like a creative kick in the butt
5974000	5976000	And I don't want to over promise and under deliver
5976000	5978000	So that's why I'm trying to like really bite my tongue
5978000	5980000	On like what we want to do
5980000	5982000	You trash your hotel room and hire hookers
5982000	5984000	No but I think when we like creatively
5984000	5986000	Kind of go back to the show and go
5986000	5988000	What can we, what can we like
5988000	5990000	Tune up behind the scenes
5990000	5992000	What we want to do different, what we want to do better
5992000	5994000	What makeover do we want to give ourselves
5994000	5996000	I think it's a nice little like invigoration
5996000	5998000	Last one right? When we took the show
5998000	6000000	And moved it to Twitch
6000000	6002000	It was a big like creative kick in the ass
6002000	6004000	You know and it's
6004000	6006000	It kind of keeps you going just that much longer
6006000	6008000	So I think
6008000	6010000	I look forward to 800 episodes for that reason
6010000	6012000	Because like how are we going to kick ourselves in the butt
6012000	6014000	Now to keep moving
6014000	6016000	So our show is old enough to vote
6016000	6018000	Next year
6018000	6020000	Just in time for the next election
6020000	6022000	Fuck don't get me started on that
6022000	6024000	Alright then with that
6024000	6026000	I will shut it down tonight
6026000	6028000	We've been going for quite a bit for a pre-recorded show
6028000	6030000	So it's almost 9 o'clock here
6030000	6032000	And I know everybody has their lives to get back to
6032000	6034000	But it would not be an episode of Orange Laundry
6034000	6036000	Now keep in mind this was a bonus episode technically
6036000	6038000	We're not going to number this one
6038000	6040000	So there was no classic game of the week
6040000	6042000	We didn't do some of our regular segments
6042000	6044000	All of that stuff will come back next week
6044000	6046000	In a normal episode of Orange Laundry
6046000	6048000	But we will go around and get everybody's
6048000	6050000	Final thoughts still
6050000	6052000	DarkSakura, your final thought for us
6052000	6054000	I'm kind of hungry
6054000	6056000	We've kind of gone during the dinner time hours
6056000	6058000	Doing this show
6058000	6060000	So I don't blame you for that feeling
6060000	6062000	Loki, your final thought
6062000	6064000	So I've been following
6064000	6066000	Salt and Straw which is an ice cream place
6066000	6068000	That they have by Disneyland
6068000	6070000	And they have monthly flavors
6070000	6072000	That they put out
6072000	6074000	They have five different flavors that are based on
6074000	6076000	Thanksgiving
6076000	6078000	One of them is salted caramel Thanksgiving turkey
6078000	6080000	It's salted caramel with crispy
6080000	6082000	Turkey skin
6082000	6084000	You lost me at caramel
6084000	6086000	Okay, my final thought is
6086000	6088000	You inspired me to do one
6088000	6090000	Last thing here because I have something you have to try
6090000	6092000	Uh oh
6092000	6094000	Uh oh
6094000	6096000	Okay
6096000	6098000	Uh oh, Rob just got
6098000	6100000	Giggly and went and grabbed something
6100000	6102000	Oh fuck, are these leis?
6102000	6104000	No, worse
6104000	6106000	Okay, so these are from Trader Joe's
6106000	6108000	They're kettle chips
6108000	6110000	Turkey and stuffing
6110000	6112000	I need to try this
6112000	6114000	Loki, if you will
6114000	6116000	I ate one, I thought it was fucking nasty
6116000	6118000	But I'm not huge on Thanksgiving food
6118000	6120000	Here you go, Darth Zarya
6120000	6122000	It definitely smells like stuffing
6122000	6124000	You can thank Alan for bringing these
6124000	6126000	There you go, Pikachu
6126000	6128000	What do you think?
6128000	6130000	It tastes like gravy a little bit
6130000	6132000	This is fucking yummy
6132000	6134000	If Alan doesn't like them
6134000	6136000	I'm giving you the bag
6136000	6138000	It's alright
6138000	6140000	I don't like them
6140000	6142000	It's got a weird aftertaste
6142000	6144000	You know what, when leis had that
6144000	6146000	Biscuit and gravy flavor, the first time I had that
6146000	6148000	I was like, this is fucking gross
6148000	6150000	But then it was like
6150000	6152000	One of those, I'm hungry and it's the only option
6152000	6154000	I ate it again, I'm like, these aren't that bad
6154000	6156000	I like to shout down a little bit
6156000	6158000	These remind me though
6158000	6160000	Because I'm definitely getting that turkey
6160000	6162000	And the stuffing
6162000	6164000	I really like it
6165000	6167000	That's redundant
6167000	6169000	But you know I also like those
6169000	6171000	Soy and butter chips
6171000	6173000	Oh yeah
6173000	6175000	Those are really good
6175000	6177000	Alright, well it started and it ended with food
6177000	6179000	Have a great night everybody
