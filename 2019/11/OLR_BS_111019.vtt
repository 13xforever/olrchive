WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:27.000
There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
And how are you feeling?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm not drugged out of my brain anymore

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Did you go back and listen to all the crazy things you said last week?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
No

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
No, I'm just kidding

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I don't listen to myself

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Anyway, well hopefully the time off work and so forth while you're recuperating

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Great time to watch a lot of random YouTubes and play some games

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Actually it's time to build a website, rebuild a website

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
And yell at my computer while I'm playing The Sims

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Fair enough

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Also say hello to TechMasterLoki

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Hello

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Hi, how are you?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm fine

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You and I are both dressed up in button up shirts today

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
We just got off work

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
It's very formal

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It's a formal, it's a black tie

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And DarkSakura is dressed up too

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
This is what I wear to work

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
You should see this wig she's got on

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It's amazing and she's got makeup

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm just kidding

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Which is actually funny because I'm not wearing hardly any makeup

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
And I'm wearing a black flannel, a Captain Marvel t-shirt and leggings

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm about as unformal, I look like the 90s, really

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Revenge of the 90s

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Except I have better eyebrows

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I like the Captain Marvel shirt though, it's cute

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah, I paid four bucks for it at Target

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
A whole four dollars? No, that's a good deal

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I've been all about the clearance racks and thrifting lately

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Treasure hunting

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
We're not live tonight

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
This is kind of an extra episode that we're doing

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
We're taping, as I mentioned, Tuesday during the week

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
In advance of our usual Sunday night slot

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Because as I've mentioned on a previous episode of the show

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm going to be out of town this weekend

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
On a trip I planned like six months ago

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Before all the other stuff that knocked us off the air

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
For a couple weeks previously came up

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
So we just wanted to make sure we at least kind of recorded something for you guys

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
That make it a habit to show up on Sunday nights live

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
And of course download us as part of your podcast rotation and all that

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
So we're doing a little bit of a special bonus episode tonight

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Very free form, very unlike some of our usual episodes of Orange On Radio

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
So if it's your first episode of Orange On Radio

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
This may not be the best one to represent

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
It's just your appetizer

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
It's kind of like the appetizer

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
It's just a little bit of the three hour plus show

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
This last show we just did two days ago was three hours plus

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It was like a three hour fifteen minute show

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
So tonight probably won't be as long

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Because there simply just isn't as much to talk about

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
However, I am looking forward to a little later on in the show

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
We're going to be welcoming our good buddy and pal and friend

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Game maker, independent game maker YYR is going to join us

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
For a little bit of a chat

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
And I am told he's going to break an exclusive here about his games on the show tonight

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
So that is very exciting

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So we'll talk about that

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
So at least we still have a little excitement building here

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
On our special little mini edition of Orange On Radio

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
For those of you that are watching on Sunday night

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Where we usually do tape live every Sunday night

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
At six o'clock pacific, nine o'clock eastern

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
For those of you that are there

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
You can still chat along with the show

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And your comments will show up for at least two more days

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Until twitch pulls the plug on all that

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Which I don't, I have to be honest

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I do love twitch or we wouldn't be using them as a platform to stream

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
But I don't understand why they got to get rid of that

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Maybe it's a resource hog

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Maybe for most channels it's just something really horribly underutilized

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
But I'm going to miss it

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I'm going to miss the chat on the video on demand

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
So this is your last chance

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Pour one out for the chat

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
But in fact right now in chat

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Push F to pay respects

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
For the video on demand

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
That way I'll know who is here

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I even saw an article that

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
The pay F for respects is five years old today

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
That's right it's celebrating a birthday

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
That meme is five years old

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh my gosh we're all getting older

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You know what quick aside

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Because we never get on tangents here on Orange On Radio

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I was at work today and talking with a co-worker

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
And the subject of the classic 70s, late 70s, early 80s

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Television program Mork and Mindy came up

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And my co-worker who is a few years younger than I am

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Had no idea who Mork and Mindy was

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
And like I had to explain like you know like Robin Williams

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Big TV, Nanu Nanu, nope

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
No idea who Mork and Mindy was

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Oh come on everyone knows Pam Dauber

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I know and it was Robin Williams

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And then even my other co-worker who totally knew the show

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Was like and who is the gal that played Mindy

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
What was her name

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm like Pam Dauber

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
What else was she in

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
She was in that movie Stay Tuned with John Ritter

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
She was also, wasn't she in

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't remember what else Pam Dauber was in

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
No she was in a TV movie

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
And I know about this because she was playing

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Someone who was meant to be Lisa Dalby

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Who was the woman who worked for a year in the 70s

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
As an actual geiko in Kyoto

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
As in what they call geisha in Kyoto

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Who worked for a year as a geiko

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
She was there working on her like her doctorate thesis

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I think on kimono and geiko culture

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So but I saw that movie I knew she was in it

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Well who knew listening to Orange Lawn's radio this week

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I'd learned something about Pam Dauber

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And wasn't she in that 80s series

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
She wasn't in My Sister Sam was she

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I don't know can somebody pull up her wikipedia

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I'm looking

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
But you remember that show right My Sister Sam

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh yeah I think that was her

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Yeah I do remember that

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Was that the show

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
The girl also died

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I was like was that the show

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah it was Pam Dauber and Rebecca Schaefer

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Rebecca Schaefer was the one that had the stalker that shot her

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I know it's really tragic and not something I'm trying to make light of

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
But that was I mean for those that were like

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Those of you that are like in your early 40s or late 30s

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Probably remember hearing about that when you were a kid

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That there was this popular show on TV

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And the actress unfortunately yeah

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Cause that changed like stalking laws and stuff

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Like that was a big big deal when that happened I remember

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
So okay

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
I didn't realize that Pam Dauber actually screen tested for the role of Tabitha

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Which was the spinoff of Bewitched

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Huh how bout that

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Wow

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Alright the classic actress of the week

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Right here on Orange Lounge Radio

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I didn't realize that she was married to Mark Harmon

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But yeah she was um

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
She did a couple other shows

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And actually worked with Robin Williams

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
On one of his comedy shows called The Crazy Ones

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Has she done anything in the past 10 years

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
That was in 2014

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Oh The Crazy Ones was that last TV show he had before

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
He died the one with Sarah Michelle Gellar

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah interesting

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Okay anyway

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Alright the Pam Dauber show

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Alright let's

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Well I'm just saying I'm looking at on here

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
She actually did some voice acting too

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Any video games?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Well it was 101 Dalmatians the series

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So there's no way to tie Pam Dauber to video gaming

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
She's on the show Dream On remember that

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Completely on a tangent I do remember Dream On

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Alright enough enough

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Okay sorry I just I just I just think it's it's kind of funny

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I think it's

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
She has a lot of movies

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I haven't thought about her in many years

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Alright let's talk about some early gaming headlines

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Again I do want to give this disclaimer

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
We're taping this about 5 days in advance of when it's airing

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
A whole lot of shit could go down during the week

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
So we're just gonna take a look at some of the early headlines from the week

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
And give you our thoughts

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
So Dark Sakura I know you've pulled a few things for us

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Um yeah

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Alright what do you want to talk about?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Well how about some Sony shenanigans

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Because I don't know

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
We we talk about things like this happening

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I don't want to get so mad

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
But this one might actually be a travesty

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Smooshy agrees

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
Yes Mr. Smoosh is very much commenting on the case at hand

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
Anyway the servers for Sing Star are gonna close on January 31st

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
I know all those copies of Sing Star out in circulation

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Which actually I think it was a pretty good seller

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I wasn't into it but eh

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
But at any rate they did make a post about it publicly online

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
That all online functionality, network features, song purchases

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Will be disabled immediately as of 11.59pm on January 31st 2020

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
And it will go on all Playstation platforms

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
But offline features will still be available

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
The thing in particular to keep your eyes on

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Is that for PS4 users you will be able to re-download any songs

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
That you have downloaded and deleted previously

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
But that will not be possible on PS3

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
You will need to download all of your digital purchases

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Prior to the server shutdown

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
And then after that the deleted content will be completely irretrievable

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
It's being replaced with a game called Sing Smoosh

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Which is actually going on in the background right now

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Well I kinda like Sing Star

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Do you have Sing Star Abba?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I do, I have Sing Star Abba

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Download all your shit

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Well I don't have to download Sing Star Abba because that's all on the disc

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
So if I'm hearing you right

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
The disc version of Sing Star Abba should work

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And there was also Sing Star Queen

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Which I think I have as well

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
So Sing Star Queen, Sing Star Abba

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
And then there was the random Sing Star 1, 2, and 3

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
They had all of that

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
And then you could download a bunch of songs online

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Which I did

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I remember having house parties

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
We downloaded a bunch of stuff on Sing Star

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Because I had those microphones

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And then around the Playstation 4 era

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
They kinda changed it more to like a stand alone thing

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Where you just have the Sing Star app basically

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
And you can sing, there's like an app you get for your phone

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
And you use your phone as the mic

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Which is a smart way to do it

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So you don't have to worry about those blue and red plug in mics anymore

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
But that means if the servers are going down

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
You won't be able to download any new songs now

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Well to be specific what people will still be able to do

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Is access all the songs on the discs

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Play party mode

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Track and record your high scores offline

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Take in store videos and snapshots to the hard drive

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
And create song playlists

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
But things like the challenges

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Scoreboards, user generated content

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Will no longer be available online

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
You can't share your media to Facebook, Twitter, PSN

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Sing Star communities or any of that

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And of course you will not be able to unlock

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
The channel surfer, concert debut, star in my eyes

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Or Sing Star trophies

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah there's a lot of stuff that's gonna be locked away

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Because I seem to remember

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
What was the Sony initiative called

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Was it called Play Create Share or something like that

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Was that the Sony thing

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And I wanna say Sing Star was a big part of that

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Because LittleBigPlanet was a huge part of that

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
When it first came out too

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
But Sing Star has all that online stuff

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
And again this, Sing Star was out in an era

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Right before, maybe like when YouTube

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Was kinda still like first coming out

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Was still kinda new

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Like people knew YouTube and got linked YouTubes

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Kelly's shoes existed on YouTube at the time

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
So there was something to go visit there

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
But it wasn't like it is now

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And like something like Twitch

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Wasn't really what it is now

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
You know where there's the immediate like sharing of things

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Or you know even something like

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Justin TV, Twitch's predecessor was still kinda

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I think still in its very much like its formative years

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
So Sing Star was really like a place to really like share

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Like here's my singing you know

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
For good and for bad

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
So it's kinda sad to see it go

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
But I guess it would make sense

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That perhaps licensing issues

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Are now coming into play

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I mean we would be like

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It could be like a

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
You know whatever licenses are coming due

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah I mean but it would be like

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I mean Sing Star ABBA was a PlayStation 3

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I wanna say a game like Sing Star ABBA

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Was almost 10 years ago at this point

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
You know so

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I remember how excited you were

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Well hell yeah

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
The video game all about ABBA

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Are you kidding?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
They don't often make dedicated video games

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
To groups I adore

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Wasn't Tiara here when we played that

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Like Spice World was the only other one I can think of

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm trying to look

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Cause I actually have off camera

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
A bunch of PlayStation 3 games

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm curious of

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I think my copies of Sing Star are in the other room though

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Because I think I pulled those discs

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
To do something with the PlayStation 4 version

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I don't think the PlayStation 4 version reads them

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
But it definitely knew

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Like I had bought these certain songs

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Online previously

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
And so like

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I do have a PlayStation 4 copy of the client

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
So

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I should go through and see if there's any

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Other songs I wanna grab

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Before it all goes away forever

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
But I feel like

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
They kinda

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
They didn't really do a lot of updates

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
To that library starting a couple years ago

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
But

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It is a library I've spent

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
A bit of money on

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I mean I would say over the years

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I probably dropped like 40 bucks

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
On additional songs

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I know it sounds like a lot

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
But

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
You know

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Again you have parties

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And it's very easy to sign into the store

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
And people are like

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I wanna sing that one

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I think even

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Your wife

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Loki

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
I wanna say at one of these parties

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Convince me to download Whitney Houston songs

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That sounds like her

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Right?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I don't

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm almost

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Vaguely remember something

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I'm almost positive

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I had a birthday party

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Way way way back when

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
When we used to do the show in the garage

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
At the house that I lived at

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Then

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Maybe

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
I think I had a party way back then

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
And I think we played Sing Star

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
And I wanna say

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Your wife made me download

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I Wanna Dance With Somebody

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
By Whitney

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Which is not a bad selection

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm not upset with it

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
That sounds like her

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah right

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I don't know why I associate your wife

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
With Whitney Houston

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
But I do

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
It's a very easy association

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
The Bodyguard really is

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
You know the number one thing

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I wish that was a play on Broadway

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I could go see

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Wanna go

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
The Bodyguard?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah The Bodyguard

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
The Bodyguard's a play you know

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Did you?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
We saw the musical

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh that's right

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
You saw the one with Deborah Cox right?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yes

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
How'd you guys like it?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
It was pretty good actually

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I'm sad it's not on Broadway still

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Did I say on this show what I'm gonna go see

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm gonna go see Moulin Rouge

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
And I'm gonna go see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Cause it just started the preview performances like this past weekend

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Cool

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
So I'm gonna get to see it in like its first couple weeks of existence

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm being a total Broadway hipster right now

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
But I'm really excited so

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Anyway

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
By the time you guys hear this

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Actually at the time you guys are watching this on Twitch

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I will be in the second act of Moulin Rouge

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So I'm really excited

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Anyway

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
And I can no longer download the Elephant Love medley to sing on SingStar from Moulin Rouge

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
So rest in peace SingStar thanks for the memories

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Anyway

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Anything else StarSaga?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
No not in regard to SingStar

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
What about any other stories you wanna talk about?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
A couple of things

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Okay

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
So there has been another video game related death

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
But due to being too into the game I guess

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
There was a teenager in Thailand who was found dead after a marathon gaming session

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
His name is Piawet Harikun

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I guess I pronounced that right

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
Was discovered on I guess yesterday in his home in Thailand

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
After playing a bunch of multiplayer games

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And they said that he died from a stroke

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
He was discovered near his computer chair in his bedroom

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
The desk was covered with food containers and the curtains were drawn

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
And his father discovered him

16:29.000 --> 16:40.000
And apparently yeah they said that they're trying to use that to bring bigger alertness

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
I guess to the use of video games and people with addictive personalities

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Because I don't think video games themselves are addictive

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
I think it's addictive personalities the same way that people

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Because the same type of response like to gambling and things like that

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Almost anything consumable can be addictive

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Not like though with a drug where it does create

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Like I'm addicted to these Tootsie Roll vanilla things

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
But that's part of a chemical reaction

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
Addiction on games and gambling is a different kind of chemical reaction

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
I gotcha

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
So you know that same dopamine response

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Whereas I don't consider that a consumable

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
I consider that going to be more something who is more easily stimulated by that sort of response

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Is going to want to keep doing it

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
And it's interesting that you kind of put games and gambling in the same category

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Because I think a lot of the issues we've been hearing about in the past few years with the loot box concerns

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Are kind of falling in a very similar thing

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Is that you know it's getting a little too close to gambling

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
And hits kind of a lot of those same nerves for people

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Well and on top of that I mean you know the World Health Organization

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Has included video game addiction to its list of international classifications of diseases

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I like though how it's phrased

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
The disorder is characterized by impaired control over gaming

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
An increased priority given to play video games over other daily activities

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Usually lasting for at least 12 months to be diagnosed

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
And that is very much like how gambling is classified

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Or how workout addiction

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
You know of workout addiction right?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Sure

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Sometimes it's things like steroids and stuff in regards to those

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Although again I think there are different types of addiction

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Runners

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
What?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Runners

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Oh yeah

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
And interesting you kind of bring up the ICD coding of the issue

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Because you know the industry switched ICD coding standards

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
2015 I think was the big year

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
So they were running on an older version

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
They switched to a newer version that was already being used in places like Europe and stuff

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
But this new kind of coding

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
So even though it's like wow they actually have coding for video game addiction

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
They switched to a system that allows them to code for almost anything

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Like there's an ICD code out there for subsequent

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
No I think the craziest one because this was my old world

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
That I can be a little more open about now because it's not my world anymore

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
There used to be a code for piece of a UFO flying on you for a subsequent time

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Like they have all sorts of things classified

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I know

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Unidentified flying object

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Doesn't necessarily mean an alien

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
No

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Something fell out of the sky

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Somebody's cheap ass drone

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah somebody's drone

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That's right a drone would be a UFO in that

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
That would actually be a perfect example of that

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Weather balloons Rob weather balloons

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah that could be too

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
So anyway

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
So don't redo it too much that they've actually given it an ICD coding

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Almost anything that can end up in a doctor's office

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
They have the capacity to give an ICD-10 code to now

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Well then and last but not least

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
You know I hate to be like the pooper on here

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
But New Zealand is banning a video game that's glorifying mass shootings

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
I think it might be that same one that we talked about before

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
They didn't mention it by name so I guess not to give any

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
What sort of attention to the game itself

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Sure

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
But there is a you know they had the Christchurch mass shooting

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
Where they were 51 Muslims were murdered in a mosque

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Wasn't that the one that was streamed online

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
It was streamed on Facebook

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Gross yeah

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
With a gunman with semi-automatic weapons

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
Who went into two mosques on March 15th and killed 51 people and wounded more

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
They were talking about the release of this game and advertisement of this game

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
Because it has one play from the perspective of a white supremacist

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
So the game is banned outright in New Zealand

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
With further urging internationally to ban the game

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Interesting

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
You know and I know this was the same incident that led them to pass gun reform

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Like within a weekend right

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And I remember a lot of people were pointing at that

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Because you know and I'm trying to walk a real fine line

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Because we could have a three hour show about the politics of this issue

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And yeah and that whole thing

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
I have to ask this question as much of a slippery slope as it is into a complete political spin-off

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
But with this disgusting as a subject matter about like white supremacy and all that is

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
Are we going down a slippery slope if we start to ban these sorts of things

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Because like for me it starts to get down like kind of like

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Do you remember when the Supreme Court intervened on that Schwarzenegger law

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
Like who is to define what is obscene and what is not obscene

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Or in that case what is a violent game and what is not

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Because there was no like official rating

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
So I think and you guys have to forgive me because I don't have all the references in front of me

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
But I want to say where that law ended up getting tripped up

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Was because there is no

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
It's too vague

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It's too vague on what is a violent game

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
So I guess my kind of my kind of thought is here

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
And New Zealand can do whatever they want

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
And Australia has banned games before

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
We know like Mortal Kombat been banned

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
They also banned assault weapons

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Right

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Much earlier on

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
So are we I'm trying to keep the question kind of simple

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Without going too far down the rabbit hole

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
But is it a slippery slope to start banning video games

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Say that again sorry

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
So I don't like to think in terms like that

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
I think there is such a thing as setting precedence

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
But America is so stupid when it comes to violence anyway

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
They'll ban sex before they ban violence

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Which is absolutely ridiculous

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
I don't know it's

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah it's tough

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I'm not saying there's necessarily an easy answer here

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Maybe this is one of those things we just have to think

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
America is stupid about it

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And it's one of those things we have to think about

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Like what is the correct response to something like this

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
How do we you know

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
I guess for me it's more like

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
How do we teach people or demonstrate to people

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
That this is something that's effective

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
This is something that you know when

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
And I don't even know the game in question

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
So I can't even like say XYZ game is offensive

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Because I haven't seen it

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And I don't really care to hearing about this

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
But maybe that's the whole thing

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
Is that because I know it involves these types of things

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm like that's disgusting

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I don't need to play it

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
For example I don't go to see those Saw movies

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I don't like those Saw movies right

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Because I know they're gross

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I know they show people getting shot

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
They don't know what they're doing

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I know they're gross

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I know they show people getting chopped up

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
In the little bitty pieces and stuff

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
So when I hear that a new Saw movie is coming out

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I'm like there's a movie I don't need to see

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Right

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
So that's how I approach it

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Now maybe Loki goes and buys popcorn

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
And goes to opening night

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Fine he can go do whatever he wants

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I've missed too many Saw movies

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Unfortunately I'm too far behind in the Saw series

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
My own husband loves those gory things

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
He watches those compilations on YouTube

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I should watch them again though

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
The lore behind it is kind of great

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Have fun

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
I think they're gross

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
The overreaching thing about it

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
Is that it's a matter of the mental fortitude

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Of the person who is indulging in the genre

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
It's a different thing if it's set as

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
I think it's when you get into the specifics of it

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You know that

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
First of all serial killers in the United States

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Are actually a very very small small like

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
3% of mass murders are considered serial killings

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
If you look at it

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
You know

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
So you're not

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
You're going to be really unlikely to have

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
That level of psychotic going around killing people

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Just saying

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
You know

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Whereas with a mass shooting

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
At least in America

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
You are more likely to see something like that happening

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
As opposed to a serial killer

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
You know as opposed to

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
You know

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
And yeah both of them are fictionalized accounts

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
But the other one is

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
A lot more in

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
An influenceable realm

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Does that make sense?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
Especially when it's picking a very specific type of issue

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Where it is a white supremacist

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Which right now our political environment

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Is absolutely encouraging of that type of mind state

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
And secondly

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Secondly

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Where we live in a place where

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Weapons like that are super easy to obtain

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
And people can televise their murder sprees

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
This

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
It's getting when it hits too close to reality

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
That is when you know that it's an influenceable item

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Because it is likely to happen

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
It has happened

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
And it will happen

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Whereas you're probably not going to get somebody

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
You know

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
On an intercom

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
You know telling people to cut your leg off

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
That's just not really going to happen

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Unless you pay money to do an escape room in L.A.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Or where is that place?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Vegas

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I always see ads for it

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Like that is the number one thing I do not want to do in my life

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Is it a saw?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
It's a saw themed escape room

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
But that one's not actually going to still cut your leg off

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
No but they'll pretend

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I don't even like to pretend

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
When it comes to that

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I don't even like to pretend

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I wouldn't play

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Remember when they did the video games

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
And they were showing them at E3

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I wouldn't even play the games

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
I was like I don't need to be a part of it

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
There's 5,000 other games here at E3

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I don't need to play that one

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Right?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Anyway

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I'll be perfectly honest

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I mean the things

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
I'm not the biggest advocate of any censorship at all

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Yeah

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
But that would be something that I would absolutely censor

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
Because as far as the terms of I think obscenity laws

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
It would number one be something that would be considered a non-artistic work

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
They say it's satire

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
But it really strikes too close of a nerve for it to even

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
I think they're just using satire as a way to protect themselves

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
When truly it's not

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
That would be one thing I would be in favor of

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
I mean honestly I would also like to see weapons banned as well

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
Funny that Australia had one big mass murder

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
And it was gone

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
New Zealand

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Big mass murder

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Now it's gone

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I have to be honest

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
I think it's okay to say I'm not sure how I feel about this right now

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Because I think that if we are to say that video games are truly art

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
There should be a way to put this in a museum and say

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
Wow what a disgusting reflection of a disgusting place society was at in the year 2019

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
And so our kids can look back on that and go wow

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I hope we don't make these same mistakes

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
I don't know there's a part of me that sort of thinks that

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
But I don't know

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
I look at preserving the code for it but still not making it publicly accessible

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
You know just like I believe that civil war items belong in a museum

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
But I don't think we should have fucking statues everywhere to the losers

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
And guess what southern girls saying this

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh confederacy lost

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Get over it

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
The Nazis lost

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Get the fuck over it

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I do believe that the memorabilia should be allowed in museums lest we forget

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
As well because there are people out there and you know this

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
That will say oh that didn't happen right

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
There's people out there say that didn't happen

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
So by putting it in a museum it's like it's proof that no it did

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And it better not happen again

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Anyway

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Anyway long long discussion

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
But beyond that but I'm gonna leave it at that

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
I would really be curious what you guys think

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I hope our chat room is lighting up because I can go read it

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Also you can always email us participate at orangeontreaty.com

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
You can also comment on our episodes as we post them at vognetwork.com

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
So I think that was everything Dark Sakura had for the news

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
We're gonna go over to Loki and myself

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
However I do want to take a quick tangent

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I know it's a little further down on the list there

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
But we actually have waiting on the phone I believe

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
YYR is joining us via discord

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Are you there?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Rob this isn't fair

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
What isn't fair?

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
How can I possibly follow a deep impactful discussion about white supremacy

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Serial killers, weapons, and the delicate balance of free speech

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
Versus the well deserved condemnation of hate speech

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
With bungee ferret tossing of course

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Yeah about that

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
Sometimes video games are distractions from the horrors of the real world

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
And video games can be fun and frivolous

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
And why you've made some very fun and frivolous games yourself

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
I've done my best

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
So how have you been?

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
I know we've talked a little bit on the show

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
You have become a father within the past year and a half-ish right?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
That's right

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
So I know understandably that's been monopolizing a little bit of your time

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Oh absolutely

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Have you been able to dedicate any time to taking a look at the old game library

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
And seeing what fantasy game you want to make come true next?

30:16.000 --> 30:23.000
Actually over the last few months I've decided to spend some time actually playing games

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
More specifically one game

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
I actually spent a lot of time with Forza Horizon 4

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Good choice though, good choice that's a good one

30:32.000 --> 30:38.000
But it's like every week they put up a new playlist with all these different activities to complete

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
And some of them are multiplayer challenges that have you playing games against other teams

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
Team games against computer drivatars

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And just all kinds of fun things to do

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
Games is a service yo

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
Well except that this service didn't cost any extra money

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
And there's no like fake currency to waste money on

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
And heck the thing is available on Game Pass now

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
So anyone can try it

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
But of course you know that was time

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
And so I actually didn't get a lot done over the last few months

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
So I do very much apologize to anybody who was waiting for the new sharpshooter that I mentioned

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Which is like 90% done

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
It just needs a few more things and then it's ready to release

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah but you know that last 10% is the hardest part

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
I've said the same myself

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
I know that's who I stole it from you or Bobby one of the two or both

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Or both

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
And the new BFT that's definitely delayed to I have no idea when next year

31:43.000 --> 31:50.000
But I actually have some fairly exciting news that I want to share

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Okay and you know what I treat your games like any other

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
If the delay is to serve to make the game a great product at the end of the day

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
Then a delay is worth it so I'm going to applaud YYR for delaying his games

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And not rushing them

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Let's all applaud hello let's celebrate that

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Woohoo

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
So this is a short story about magfest actually

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
Oh it sounds like you want to tell a story too don't you

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
Aw hey your child and my cat should have a show

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
Well they both have a limited vocabulary so I'm not sure what the final entertainment value would be

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
Oh you want to grab the microphone that's a very good idea except it's not really

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Thank you for your input darling

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Alright now go put her in kitty jail

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
She's playing with her pom pom balls

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Some of which are shiny

32:47.000 --> 32:55.000
Anyway yes so magfest 2018 which was actually about two years ago

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
I put super multitasking in to the showcase or attempted to

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
It was not accepted but what they have there is something called the quick play table

33:06.000 --> 33:15.000
And if your game doesn't get a full slot you're encouraged our spot at the quick play table

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
And you can do it multiple times throughout the weekend and you can show your game there

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
And you know for anyone who wants to come up to the table and play

33:24.000 --> 33:31.000
So two years ago I was lucky enough to get a room in the Gaylord right in the same hotel as magfest

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
And so I had my equipment with me so I said well you know what why not

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
So I showed it I took the last slot on I think Friday initially

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
And I asked the staff who were stuck there for 24 hours because they have to monitor everything

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
So if I have the last slot of the day can I just leave my stuff here overnight

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
And they said well as long as you get it out before the first slot the following morning sure

33:55.000 --> 34:03.000
And I said okay and I left my stuff there the whole night and set an alarm so I would be down early in the morning

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
And sure enough when I got back I found that the staff had been enjoying the heck out of the game

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
For a good amount of time overnight so I ran it overnight Saturday night too

34:15.000 --> 34:23.000
And then I discover when I get back that there's like a nine minute record some like on just seemingly impossibly high

34:23.000 --> 34:31.000
Survival record on there and I'm like what happened and they said oh yeah we played as a team we gathered around the controller

34:31.000 --> 34:38.000
So they really enjoyed this game they went so far as to cheat at your game to feel better about themselves

34:38.000 --> 34:52.000
So anyway so as far as the selection process you're encouraged to you know not submit the same game twice

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
Or at the least not submit the same game in the same state twice because that counts against you in the submission process

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
But nonetheless I haven't shown it a convention in a while I haven't this year I didn't last year

35:03.000 --> 35:11.000
So I'm like you know maybe I'll just submit super multitasking for the heck of it for the 2020 showcase

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
But I did so with the promise that there would be some new features coming if it was accepted

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
And well I don't know what happened but I got accepted to the 2020 MAGFest showcase

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Good for you congratulations pretty cool

35:28.000 --> 35:35.000
Thank you so now of course I have to deliver on my promises so I am ready to announce

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
And mind you I always intended on releasing three versions of multitasking in total

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
The first was the 2016 XBL-IG version which is now gone

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
The second was super multitasking on Steam which came out early 2018

35:50.000 --> 35:57.000
And the final version which I was originally going to call the very unoriginal ultra multitasking

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
Is now going to be known as super multitasking versus ultimate

36:04.000 --> 36:12.000
I love it you're going the Street Fighter route you got to put turbo in there at something maybe there'll be an unlock code

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
For matching service featuring true kiss destination

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Yes featuring dreams come true also

36:20.000 --> 36:29.000
But no the the reason I'm calling it versus ultimate is because of well both words have significance

36:29.000 --> 36:36.000
Not only is it going to be the ultimate challenge but well there's the surprise that I'll save for a couple minutes from now

36:36.000 --> 36:44.000
The first major change is the original game had four slots the screen was split into four slots

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
You had your left stick your right stick your face buttons and then everything on the top of the controller

36:49.000 --> 36:58.000
For people who hate themselves we can now split the top of the controller into individual slots for the triggers and the bumpers

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
And now you have five slots

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
You're a madman

37:04.000 --> 37:10.000
So now so if I'm if I'm I'm hearing this right so for those that have played super multitasking

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
I wish I'd had time today to grab b-roll but check it out on Steam I guess or check out the YouTube trailer

37:15.000 --> 37:25.000
Just look up super multitasking right now it's four games going on at once this new version will allow you to do five because four wasn't enough

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
First for some people obviously

37:28.000 --> 37:37.000
Of course though if you're just getting your feet wet if you're just starting to play you can also do the opposite and lower it down to three slots

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
Completely eliminating the bumpers and the triggers and making things maybe a little easier

37:42.000 --> 37:51.000
Although the challenge mode is going to challenge your thought that maybe three slots is definitely easier

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
I'll find a way to test that theory

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
Have you considered a one slot mode for Bobby Blackwolf?

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Well that would defeat the purpose of the game wouldn't it?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I guess it would

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
It's just tasking

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Bobby Blackwolf gets to play tasking

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Solo tasking

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Solo tasking

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
Maybe as a joke that's actually kind of funny

38:16.000 --> 38:22.000
I would die if you put his name on it like I don't know if legally you can

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
But I would die if you called it Bobby Blackwolf's tasking

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
Well if he gives it his consent then I don't see why not

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
Alright Bobby you know who to tweet alright

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
So the challenge mode is going to be greatly expanded

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
Before it was just a single list of 42 challenges

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Now we're going to separate it into multiple courses

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
They'll be the original 42 challenges and super multitasking

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
That'll be one course

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
But now they're going to be multiple like they'll be a three slot course

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
A five slot course

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
A hell course which is just going to be the worst thing ever

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
Like there's going to be a lot of new missions and they're also going to be able to be more complex

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
Let's put that quote on the back of the box by the creator quote the worst thing ever

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
That's actually yeah you know maybe I'll put that on the Steam page

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Okay great

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
But yeah right now the challenge is they're set up a certain way

39:27.000 --> 39:33.000
At most one game plays in each slot and then when that game ends that's it

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
We're going to throw that out the window and allow more complex missions that have

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
A second game starting in a slot once the first one is finished or more

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
So they're not just going to all last 20 seconds like before

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
They're going to be some that are deeper dives so please look forward to that

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Oh boy

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
Speedrunners will have more ways to impact or make mistakes

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
So that's I want to add some depth

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
You know some someone might have pointed at the existing game and said well it's fun

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
But it doesn't really look like there's a whole lot to do. I want to I want to attack that

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
And then of course there will be new mini games

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Some of them will be difficult versions of the games that are there now

40:19.000 --> 40:27.000
Like an alternate version of the paddle the pong game where you have to control paddles on both the top and bottom

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Rather than just on the bottom. So this way you can miss the ball in two different ways. Oh my god

40:32.000 --> 40:38.000
Oh, this is gonna be wow. This is really gonna be a mindfuck, but I'm excited

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
And then some some mini games are gonna be completely new

40:41.000 --> 40:51.000
I'm really gonna try to find a good way to make an intuitive mini game where you're typing a text on a cell phone

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Just so that I can pair that with the driving game

40:55.000 --> 41:04.000
That's great. You could take the swipe thing

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
You know, I mean you don't have to if you just with the yes something like controller

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
You could just do like a swipe thing. It doesn't have to actually hit each letter. Oh, I love that

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
You're gonna pair the pair texting game with the driving game. It has to be done. I love it

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
It just has to be done and then finally the last major addition that I'm gonna be making to this game is a two-player

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
versus mode

41:26.000 --> 41:33.000
Now it's something that people were asking for and we finally figured out a good way to do this

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
So basically what's gonna happen is they're gonna be variants of the mini games

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Like let's take the pong game again as an example

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
So instead of just being a paddle and hitting the ball against a wall

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
There's gonna be a red paddle on the bottom and a blue paddle on top

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
You're gonna be, you know, controlling whichever color you are and the ball is gonna slowly get faster

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
And whoever messes up first the opponent gets a point

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
There's gonna be the tennis game and you know what you've probably seen

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
Have you seen the the battle mode and pop in music?

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
It's been a long time but yes, I do vaguely remember, yeah

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
Some versions, I don't know if it's all versions but at least some versions of pop in music

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
They've had it where, you know, you're playing the game, you're playing the game against an opponent

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
The main game and then all of a sudden this mini game appears along the bottom of the screen

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Where you're hitting a ball back and forth

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
And you have to take one of your buttons, you know, the extra button that you're not using

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
Because each player only has to hit three lanes in pop in music's battle mode

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
And then you're hitting that button to hit the ball back and forth

42:47.000 --> 42:55.000
And whoever misses, they get some terrible mod applied to their lanes for a few seconds

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Which causes them to completely mess up

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
So it's gonna be like that but, you know, four of them on the screen at once

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Okay, I'm into it, this sounds really, you know what's also interesting about this

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
I don't know if you've thought about this YY or maybe you have

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
But you know Steam not that long ago or I think they just announced they're gonna do that whole thing

43:14.000 --> 43:21.000
Where you can do any game multiplayer over the internet kind of akin to PlayStation 4's SharePlay

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
So theoretically, I imagine you're building this with same room in mind

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Especially with some of the specific timings that go into this

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
But technically I could play this with a friend of mine online

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I just hope you've got a good connection

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Yeah, I was gonna say it might not be

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I can understand why maybe you're not gonna emphasize that

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
Because the timing probably has to be very specific on that

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
And it is still kind of a beta-e early feature

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
Well, I mean it's gonna be meant for local play

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
If there's any lag, one player's gonna be at a big disadvantage

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
True

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
But yeah, I'm really hoping that people have a really great time with this

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
You know, you'll set it to play to five or whatever

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
And then whoever gets five points first wins the game

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
And then you do it again

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
And then you purse a little and then you do it again

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
And then you throw your controller and maybe do it again if it still works

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Well I'm really excited for you YYR

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
And you know I love the concept behind multitasking, super multitasking

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
And now super multitasking versus ultimate, right?

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
Yeah, I have no idea when this will be done

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
However, what I can tell you is that at the least the versus mode

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
The five slot mode's already in the game

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
And the versus mode I'm working on now

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
You'll be able to try all these new features at MAGFest if you are there

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Sadly, I am not there this year

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
I may be able to return in 2021

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
As you know, and I say you as in the listeners and everybody

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I started a new job

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
New job

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
A little quick for me to make MAGFest happen

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
But the nice thing is with this new job

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
I am better taken care of when it comes to time away to go to nerd expos

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Than I maybe was before

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
So things like MAGFest and some of the things I've had to cut back on the past couple of years

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Are now again a possibility

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
So nothing's off the table when we move into

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
As we get it past, probably once we get into summer next year

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I may show up at more places

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
So MAGFest 2021 is something that's not out of the picture

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
That's exciting. Maybe VOD could have a greater presence there on the whole

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I will have to talk to Mr. Blackwolf about that because I would really love that

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Nice

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And I mean the last thing

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
I don't know yet if I'm allowed to sell anything at the booth

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
I would love to be able to sell the game there because it's out

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
But if I am able to sell stuff there and you mention OLR

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
I will give you my best possible deal

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
Oh and you know I totally didn't mention this

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
If you already own Super Multitasking

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
By the time these features are released

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
You will be upgraded to Super Multitasking vs. Ultimate for free

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Look at you, good guy YYR

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
How about that?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Free upgrade, congratulations

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
That is great

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
For everybody else the price is going to go up a few dollars

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
If you haven't bought it yet

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
So maybe that's a hot tip for OLR listeners

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Hot tip, get it now

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Before he jacks up the price

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
Because I mean this is my best concept

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
There's going to be a lot of effort put into this

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Into these upgrades too

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
So I really want to deliver the best possible package with this game

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
And then possibly look to port it to consoles afterward

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Well I am wishing you all the luck in the world while you are

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
And I think one reason why this game does well at expos

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I think it's one thing to talk about the game and do this

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
People do not really understand how addictive

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Because it is a game you play in very short bursts

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Kind of like a warrior type of thing

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
But it can also because of that be very subject to the whole

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Just one more turn type of thing

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Like I've got to break the two minute mark

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
It turns into that sort of addicting thing really fast

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And I think once people get their hands on it

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
They really kind of realize like oh this is addicting

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
This is very addicting

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
And so the fact that you are making it bigger, badder and better

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
And maybe simpler for Bobby Black Wolf

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Is very exciting

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Thank you

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
That's great, well congratulations OLR

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
I mean certainly congratulations on getting the spot back at MAGFest

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
I hope we get pictures and video and all that good stuff

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
And I hope it goes so well that you come back in 2021

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
With your other projects that you're working on

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I'm really hoping to

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
I'm really hoping that once this is done

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
I can actually start porting the new platforms

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
And creating a couple of new IPs that I have already planned out

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
It's like there's so much that's just waiting on me

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
Finishing up all these existing projects

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I've got way too many

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
Well at least you've finished several games

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Unlike some people I know

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Congratulations

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I haven't forgotten about Vecturds

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Appreciate it, appreciate it

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
That makes me happy

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
It warms the cold dark recesses of my shriveled heart

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Alright

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
YYR I am going to let you go for now

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
But thank you so much and best of luck to you

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
And I can't wait to hear how MAGFest goes in a couple months for you

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I can't either

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Take care my friend

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Thank you as always for trusting OLR

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
If there's one game maker that'll break the news here on OLR

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
It's YYR, we appreciate it

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Hey

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
You have me as an exclusive

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
Even if the major sites are looking to get me on

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
The biggest podcasts in the world

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
I'll be like nope, OLR gets me first

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
That warms my cold black heart

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Big hug for you my friend

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Now I have to go get famous

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Alright, take care my friend

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Now get to programming

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Alright, see you later

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
I will

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Alright, bye

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Bye

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Always good to hear from our pal YYR

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
I love that he's kind of like reinvigorating

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I guess if you will super multitasking

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Because I really do think like it's the type of game that

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I'm really surprised kind of didn't go viral the first time around

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
But it's sometimes you just got to catch that spark

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
You know what I mean?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
So having the additional visibility at MAGFest

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
And this time around he's going to be able to say

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Not like it's coming soon

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Or oh he's going to be able to say

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Oh you can buy it right now

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Like right here

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And that I think is really going to help him out

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
For sure

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah because I was there I think the year before

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
When he first showed the game

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
And so he could only say

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Can you upvote me on Greenlight

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Can you upvote me

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
But now that he actually has this

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
You can buy this game you're playing right here

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
Or at least even if the versus ultimate isn't out at that point

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
At least you can still play the basic version

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
This game can be yours if the price is right

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
That's right, exactly right

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Exactly right

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
So wishing YYR all the success out there

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
And again if you want to check out Super Multitasking

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
If you're newer to OLR

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
Because we were talking ears off about this game

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
When it first came out

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
It is available on Steam

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
The Super Multitasking he's referencing

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
You can play it on Steam right now

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
So go check it out in the Steam store

50:20.000 --> 50:25.000
There's no Epic or Origin

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
Or any of those GOG wars going on

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
It is only on Steam

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Because I know he got there through the Greenlight process

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Before they pulled it

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
They don't have Greenlight anymore right?

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
No they don't

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
They just throw your crap up there

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Throw whatever crap you want up there

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Okay let's get back into some news

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
So we had taken care of the stories Dark Soccer was going to talk about

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Although I do have some kind of unrelated news

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Alright sure why not

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
Kathy Griffin was sainted by the San Francisco Sisters

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
Oh I didn't know that was a procedure that you could do

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Did she have a show there tonight?

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
I don't know but she just was very recently sainted

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
She had a show there coming up

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
And I wanted to go but I couldn't

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I was like oh it's the same day as something else

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
But anyway

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
So she is now Saint Kathy of the acerbic profundity

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Herder of Hussies, defender of D-listers

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And probably not a member of ISIS

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Oh probably not

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Anyway back to gaming headlines

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Loki

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about Smash Brothers

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
So there's a new version coming out soon

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
And there's a brand new update

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
On Intended Direct that's coming

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
So we have Ultimate

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Which will have happened by the time people hear this

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Yes it would have happened already

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
And as you probably have now heard

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
There's no new announcement

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
Sorry it's just talking about Terry

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Well they might be playing Terry Bogard

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
I mean aren't we anticipating that Terry Bogard will be unlocked after the direct problem

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Most likely

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
I don't know

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
But they're going to at least show what Terry Bogard does

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So that's kind of cool

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
And of course along with the vault

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
The version 6 updates they have

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
Of course there's the vault shopper set that's been announced

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
That's going to be made available to Switch Online members

52:07.000 --> 52:13.000
And that includes 5000G and 3 classic tickets for no cost

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
If you happen to have Switch Online

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Which if you're playing Smash you probably do anyways

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
And then they have fighter adjustments

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
And some other features that will be detailed

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I'm assuming during the direct

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
And then along with Smash

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
It is now the number one selling fighting game in history

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Oh wow

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
In one year

52:35.000 --> 52:43.000
So yeah it sold 15.71 million units as of September 30th

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Wow that's really

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
Especially when you consider that they had a version that was on Wii and 3DS

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
But I guess maybe you still count those separately

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Or excuse me Wii U and 3DS

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
But I guess maybe you still have to count those separately

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I just think it just didn't sell as well

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Because there weren't as many systems out there maybe

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
You're right that's probably the case

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Yeah

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Apparently though they're still saying though

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
If you counted

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
If you count the SNES classic mini

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
Then Street Fighter 2 would hold the record still with 20 million units

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I was just about to ask

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
But wasn't Street Fighter 2 everywhere

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
But we just had the story

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
And luckily this time I can remember what we just talked about

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Because it really was just the day before yesterday

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
But we just had that story that Dark Soccer was talking about on the last show

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
About how the Switch has now outsold the Super Nintendo

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
So even though it feels like

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
Oh my god Street Fighter 2 was everywhere

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
On the Super Nintendo when it came out

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Well the reality is

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
There wasn't as many Super Nintendos as there are Switches

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
That's how this has now been able to get out there more

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
It's pretty cool

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
And then in other news

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
Nintendo is saying that they're open to more remakes on the Switch

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
So much like we had with Zelda Link's Awakening

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
They're looking at possibly doing some other games in a similar fashion

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
And this came out of an investor Q&A

54:03.000 --> 54:09.000
They're saying there's a possibility to bring back titles that have been previously developed for handheld consoles

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
However

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
Within Nintendo rather than re-releasing past handheld games

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Because of the Nintendo Switch Lite's release

54:17.000 --> 54:25.000
We are discussing more what sorts of new games can we create for an entire Nintendo Switch family

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Within that we also are considering past titles

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
But regarding what sorts of discussions are being held in detail

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
There's nothing I can say at the present

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
I have a nomination to put forward

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
If we want to bring back classic handheld franchises

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Well we just heard Brain Age

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
We had that about a month ago

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
That Brain Age was coming back

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
I would put forward Clubhouse Games

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Remember that one on 3DS?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I thought that game was so cool

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
And it didn't really seem to

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
It didn't end up being like a Nintendo thing that really stuck around

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
But I'm really surprised

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I would have thought Clubhouse Games would have been a bigger deal

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
So it's an old 3DS title

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Maybe it was the regular DS

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
It was the regular DS

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Oh god

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
So you gotta go way back

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
It was the regular DS

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
It was like parlor games

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Mini collection of parlor games

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
It was really well done

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
And with the DS stylus

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
And that you could do things that were pretty cool

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
So we haven't really talked about Minecraft Earth recently

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
But I think they're just about the release over here at some point

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
They just, as of October 31st

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Released in South Korea, Canada and the Philippines

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
Just today, the UK

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
So we're getting bigger territories

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Are these the full releases or just betas?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Full release

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Oh shoot, okay

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
So we're, I mean they've been releasing all sorts of territories

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Australia's had it for a little bit

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
So they're getting bigger, bigger territories

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I mean the UK is pretty big

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
So maybe soon?

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Yeah, maybe

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
It looks like weekly has been what they've been putting that stuff on

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Again, by the time you guys hear this, it might be a thing

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Yeah, so that'd be pretty cool

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
And last but not least

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
There's rumors that Microsoft may be purchasing, or set to purchase

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
The developers of Yooka-Laylee

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
Oh, that would make sense

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah, interesting

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
Like, who's the, like how, on a rumor scale of 1 to 10

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
They're saying that there's, you know

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
There's the Xbox XO 19 celebration

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
That takes place in London on November 14th

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
That would be a good place to announce something like that

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Alright, so keep your eye on that one

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Yeah

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Alright, interesting

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
I have a few headlines for you guys

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
Actually, a lot of these have to do with like other, like streaming updates

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
And streaming news

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
YouTube being one of them

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Of course, YouTube is a streaming platform as well

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
If you weren't already aware

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
YouTube is now rolling out something

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
You know, because like on Twitch and Mixer

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
We just talked in the last episode about subscriptions on Mixer

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
You know, so how is YouTube trying to get a little bit more into the monetization game

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Allowing creators to make a little more coin

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Subscriptions are a thing on YouTube as well

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
And I guess they have like super chat

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
Which means you get a comment that's pinned at the top of a chat

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Kind of like, I guess it'd be similar to like a highlighted message

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Which is the, you could

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
You probably noticed it's there on VoG network

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Like, when we heard it open

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Bobby and I were just kind of like

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Yeah, might as well just open and see what happens

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
It's not something you really, it's like the more you watch

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
The more little virtual coins you get

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Yeah, I saw that

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
It's Mixer's biddies

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Or no, not biddies

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
What do they call them on Mixer?

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Sparks

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
It's the Sparks from Mixer

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Twitch kind of has their own system of that now

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
So we just kind of turned it on

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
But we haven't really, really given it thought

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
On how to best use it

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
But I have noticed people have started highlighting their messages

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
So this is kind of a similar thing you can do on YouTube

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Well now another thing you're going to be able to do

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Is animated stickers

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
So it's a little different from emojis

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Because I guess they're big

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
They're like super stickers

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
And they've rolled them out to creators in over 60 countries

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
When you are doing streams or video premieres

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
You can buy a sticker

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
And drop it in the chat

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
And a streamer will get a cut of that sticker

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
A creator can moderate the super stickers

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
There are eight sticker packs

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Five of which are animated

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
And so there will be different packs in different languages

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Like English, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
And you have to have super chats enabled on your stream

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
To be able to enable super stickers

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Because YouTube has the various criterias that you can monetize

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
And all that stuff, different levels

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
So kind of interesting but I've got to admit

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Stickers? I don't know

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
I mean if you're trying to get noticed by a big YouTube streamer

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Maybe, I don't know

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
But ok, I mean they've got to think of ways to monetize

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
I've got to admit, one reason why I think Twitch is a great platform

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Is because it's really easy to monetize on Twitch

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
It used to be easy to monetize on YouTube

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
But it no longer is

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
So it's pretty easy to monetize on Twitch

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
And so that's why I think a lot of people kind of go that way

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
Not that you're going to make a fortune broadcasting on Twitch

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I mean we all still have day jobs, hello

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
But you know you make a nice amount of money

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
To maybe offset the cost of buying microphones

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And doing a show and all that stuff

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
So it's kind of neat

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And mic stands

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
That's right and mic stands which yes is in our future

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Because I was actually listening to a recent episode

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And I'm like oh my god every time Dark Soccer I pick up a mic

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
You can kind of hear it

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
So depending on how you guys listen to the show

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I've been trying not to pick up the mic that much

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I know we are going to address that issue

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
It's just one of those like you know

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Making it better one step at a time

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
But yeah mic stands

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Even if they're like handheld mic stands

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Even if we had like handheld mic stands

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
It would not make all the rattling that it does now

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I'm doing some investigation

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Okay please do

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Alright speaking of YouTube and all that stuff

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
Another Twitch streamer has announced that they are leaving

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
But they're going to YouTube this time

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
So what we've had two big streamers leave Twitch for Mixer

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And now we have

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Courage, CooRage

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
I don't know it's Courage but the R is capitalized

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
I don't usually get into the celebrity streamer culture a lot

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So I don't know who these folks are

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Do you?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Nope no idea

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Well he's a big

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And I'm not trying to shade him I just don't know him

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I don't know her

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But his real name is Jack Dunlop

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But he goes by Courage online

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And he is going to be going exclusively to YouTube

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
He has 2.1 million Twitch followers

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And already 1.9 million subscribers on YouTube

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I think there are a lot of Twitch streamers that kind of double dip on YouTube a little bit

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
By the way go check out our YouTube channel at VOG Network

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
So that part's not completely unheard of

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But yeah now he's going to go over there pretty much exclusively

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So that's going to be very interesting

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And it does

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Folks are saying that YouTube as opposed to Mixer

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Maybe makes a little more sense for this particular streamer

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Because he said he wants to go beyond gaming

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Like he wants to do cooking and ASMR

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Although this could be like tongue and cheek type of announcements

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But maybe he's looking to go a little bit beyond just gaming

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Interesting

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Very interesting because I'm really surprised

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And I got to say this

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I am really surprised at this point

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
That Twitch has not tried to take on YouTube a little more

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Like I realize that Twitch is broad in its categories

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
We have the things like competitive eating and ASMR and all that stuff

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
But I'm really surprised that they

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That they're almost scaling back on some of the video on demand features

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Like we're losing the live commenting

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
We're losing the premiere stuff

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Like that they're almost scaling back on that

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
When I would have thought that Amazon would have really made it

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Because they own Twitch right

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Amazon would have really made a play to take on YouTube

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And try to meet YouTube in that space

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I'm kind of surprised they haven't done that

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Maybe it's just me

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
But maybe the audience has not shown it's there

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
It would be nice to have an alternative for YouTube

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It would be very nice to have an alternative for YouTube

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Maybe Twitch doesn't want to have to

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Or Amazon in general doesn't want to have to police that

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
You know there's a lot of the dark side of YouTube

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
We've heard a lot about

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And maybe Amazon's just like you know what

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We'd rather not deal with it

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Twitch community's pretty cool

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
They're already not

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
They're already kind of having difficulties policing Twitch stuff as it is

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I guess that's true

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It is getting more and more difficult the bigger and bigger it's getting

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And like you know I know Dark Soccer brought up that really unfortunate shooting incident

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And I don't mean to go to a horrible place

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But the reality is like I know more recently

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It wasn't that one but there was another one that very recently

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Was streamed on Twitch

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And so you know that's not Twitch's fault per se

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You know but certainly they don't want to be involved with that shit

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
They don't like having their name put out there

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Next to gross content like that

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So you know it's going to be interesting

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Anyway a little tangent but just something that kind of surprised me

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
One more article that does not have to do with streaming

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
But it does have to do with movies

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
We're going to bring up Hideo Kojima again

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
By the time you guys hear this

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
You will be sick of me

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Death Stranding will be out

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And I'm so curious to see how the

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
We've seen the reviews

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
But now I want to see how the general population takes to that game

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I'm only about a week away from my live hate playthrough

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Of Death Stranding

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And that's going to be the title of the stream

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Hate playing Kojima's latest art school project

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Excited

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Anyway

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But in being interviewed by the BBC about Death Stranding

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Because obviously Hideo Kojima is out there doing the circuit and the press and all that

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Kojima mentioned that Kojima Productions

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
The studio he runs

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Is going to venture into filmmaking

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Which I don't know if this is a rumor or what

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But when you hear that Death Stranding has a two hour cut scene at the end of the game

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Maybe not too surprising to hear

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That Kojima is interested in getting into filmmaking

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I thought that was the same as Mel Gursault 4 had a really long cut scene at the end of the game too

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
He's kind of already making films

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But it's interesting

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I mean

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
For all the crap that people are giving Death Stranding for being a walking simulator

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Or whatever, what the game is

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Maybe this is causing people to really think

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
What would Death Stranding be like as a movie?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Who knows?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I mean we won't really know until more of us get our hands on the game

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But what's Kojima going to be capable of in a movie space or a more traditional film space?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
He certainly has plenty of friends in Hollywood to help him make it happen right?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So it's going to be interesting to see what happens if he were to get into that

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So yeah

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Excited to see if they actually really do go that way in the near future

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Who knows?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
So would Kojima announce a film at E3?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Or how would that work?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
He'd probably get his buddy Jeff Keighley to help him out

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I imagine that's how that would work

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Yeah that would be the game awards type of thing

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Yeah right?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
So anyway

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
It would depend if his project is based on a game or not

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Can you imagine if they made Metal Gear Solid a more traditional movie?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
You know?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
If they just took some of the concepts from Metal Gear Solid and made a 90 minute film out of it

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Could be interesting

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I don't know

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Wasn't that already Metal Gear Solid 4?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Perhaps

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I think that is on record of having the longest number of

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
The longest length of cutscenes total

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I hate Death Stranding is almost out

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Alright

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Well you know Kojima wanted to go into filmmaking to begin with anyway

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Yeah

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So maybe this is one way

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Maybe he's going through that midlife crisis right now

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Where he's like I gotta do that thing I always wanted to do when I was younger

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And never got around to doing

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And now I have all these holl-

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I'm friends with Conan O'Brien I can do what I want

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
No it might sound like I'm shading Hideo Kojima

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
But I'm really not

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I actually think like a movie would be

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I'd watch it

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Hell yeah I would

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Like he's a good storyteller so why not

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
It's only 90 minutes maybe 2 hours

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Ok maybe a Kojima movie is going to be like Titanic length

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Like 3 and a half hours

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
But I'd still watch it right

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Alright anyway

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Let's travel around the room

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
That's all we have for news

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Again these are early headlines

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Huge news could have broke Thursday or Friday

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Unfortunately the magic of radio is not that strong

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
For us to have heard it in advance

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But you know we'll talk about

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
If there's anything really big that breaks

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
We will talk about it on our next live episode of OLR

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Which will be next Sunday when we return

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Which by the way is also starting to shoulder up

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
On the big Bamani holiday of 19 November and 20 November

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I believe the show is on the 10th

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Or no excuse me 10th was we're missing

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
17th is when the next show will be

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So we're starting to saddle up against that

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Yeah

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Bamani holiday so anyway

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Alright let's travel around and just catch up with our hosts

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I know it's only a couple days into the week

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
But I don't know if you guys have anything

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Any personal tidbits you want to get out

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Or what kind of video games you have been playing

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
With what little time we've had

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Darsakha I know you were mentioning a little bit of The Sims

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
While you've been recovering

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Yeah I'm still on Sims 4

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That's really about it

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Just because I don't really have much attention span

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
For anything with everything else I've got going on

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And honestly instead of playing Sims 4

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I really should be working on that website

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And getting an email migration finished

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
But I'm still just sore and itchy

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Yeah but even when you're working on a big project like that

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Taking a 30 minute game break can sometimes be

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Sims is not a 30 minute game break

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Fair, fair

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I started playing last night around midnight

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And it was 4 in the morning when I quit

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
And the only reason I quit is because the game crashed

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Because I would save the game

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Did you say I played a little bit of Sims?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
That is a little bit

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
That is a little bit of Sims

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Because basically I have to gear myself up for it

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And not make any plans

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Cancel the Friday night plans

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Order a pizza

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Dim the lights

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
It's Sims night

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Hey that's me and Civilization

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So you know what

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
There's always going to be some game

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Build the pool, remove the stairs

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
That doesn't work anymore

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I will find creative ways to make that work dammit

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And actually though

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
With the next household that I'm doing

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I'm actually building the current version

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Of the full house

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Because the full plans

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Yeah but I want to build it with the current design

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
There's actually pictures of it

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It's really really cute inside

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Like the actual house in San Francisco

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So not what you see on TV

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Because obviously what you saw on TV is not the actual house

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I mean honestly it's a really gorgeous house

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
But I'm thinking about doing that

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
But I'm going to have it

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I'm going to have a witch

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
A vampire and a ghost

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Live in the house

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Because I can't have a werewolf

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Like in being human

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So I'm going to try to recreate that

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Thing and see how it lasts

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
If my ghost doesn't want to move off

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Dark Sakura I hate to break this to you

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
But Halloween is over

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Halloween

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Is not just a holiday

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
It's a way of life

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Listen this is how you do it

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Okay because I was

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
She is Jack Skellington

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
By the way I know my cheat codes to pick what type of

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Ghost I get and how they died

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Like my kids were talking about the neighbors having their

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Halloween decorations still up

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I'm like it's fine all they have to do is put Christmas

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Hats on everything or Santa hats

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And then it's Christmas stuff

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
You can just put hats on everything

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And then you can just keep it up all your own

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
They have one of those witches that looks like it's

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Flown into the door those are hilarious

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I never see those

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Just put a Santa hat on that witch

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
They have the feet sticking out of the ground

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Of course of course

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And then they have this weird skeleton like

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Grim reaper thing that's always

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I tell the kids that it's always staring at them

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And then one time somehow it triggered from

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
20 feet away so that freaked them out

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Good times

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
You could just go eco and just put a real skeleton in your yard

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Right

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Humans are

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Are uh

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
What's the word I'm thinking of

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Biodegradable

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Oh yeah well you think your garage haunted house

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Is cool Karen? Well at my house we've got

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
The bodies exhibited

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Anyway

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Alright moving on

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Loki what about you? What's going on with you?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I've just been playing more of

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
What the golf?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And I've like

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
They have the way it works is like they have

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Different labs so it's like different themed

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Courses or whatever they're in there but there's like a

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Ton of levels it's ridiculous and then each

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Level has like a par or

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Like a slightly more challenging level than

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Another challenging level on top of it

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And they have homages to a bunch of stuff

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
There's homages to like Mario

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Brothers um I'm playing through

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
One right now that's an homage to Portal

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Um that was pretty cool and then

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Um

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Yeah so I've been just doing lots of that

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I'm probably gonna work some more on my game

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I'm starting to like

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Feel that like frustration that

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Haven't progressed very far recently

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Because I've been trying to get my

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Respawn stuff to work correctly

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And it

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Hasn't been because

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And I don't know why like

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I was trying to focus on doing the most

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Simplest thing possible but

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Because it's sort of modeled after

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Smash TV all the enemies spawn

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Through doors so they have to walk through a

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Door and trying to program a

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Door to only work at certain times

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
When like say the player is on the other

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Side of the door and I need to open

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
But also not have the player be able to

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Jump back through the door

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's a pain in the ass

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So I've been stuck

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
With door logic and stuff

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Trying to get like one way walls

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
To work and stuff and

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
In many creative ways to

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Do that and always finding a way to

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Somehow break it

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
So

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I may just say fuck the doors eventually

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And just spawn into the level like

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I don't care anymore just whatever

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I just want this to be done but

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Stay tuned for Loki's second game fuck the doors

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Alright

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
My week obviously I've been

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Preparing for my trip to New York this weekend

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Which I'm very excited about but now I'm like

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I'm not going to be able to do everything

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
That we want to do like their text messaging

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Today about everything they want to do I'm like we don't have that kind of time

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
And it's like trying to fit in

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
People and stuff too I'm just like oh my gosh

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
It's going to be a busy busy weekend but I am

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Looking forward to it

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
But early in the week I'm

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Still playing Final Fantasy 14

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It's kind of a thing I get on and regularly do with my friends

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
My Machinist is almost 18

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So I'll finally have a healer, a tank

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And a DPS at 80

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Since my Gunbreaker and my Astrologian are already

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
80 my Machinist will soon be there too

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Which has been a lot of fun to play

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And I'm still continuing on in Bloodstained

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I made quite a bit more progress last night

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I got past the second boss

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Which is funny because for all the difficulty

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
The first boss in that game gave me

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I one shotted the second boss

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
It is all about that drill weapon which we talked about last week

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Dark Sakura that Dan

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I guess used a lot too

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
That drill made that second boss cake

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So yeah

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Pro tip get that shard

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
From one of those guys that has the drill as soon as you can

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Because it makes things easier

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Anyway that's really it

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
For my gaming week so far

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So with that let's go to Twitter

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Because we did open up Twitter

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
For your questions

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And we want to get to some of those questions

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
That you guys sent us

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So let's get to some of these

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So we had some tweets and our first tweet

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
With a question comes from

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Superhulk1999

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Who asked us

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Will the new consoles come with enough

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
SSD hard drive space

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Like at least

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
8 terabytes or more

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And that's signed Mike B

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
So thanks for the question Mike B

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
What do you think?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
It seems like when companies release new consoles

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Maybe there isn't always enough storage

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Right away especially for where the generation

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Ends up by the end of its life

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Yeah I don't think there's gonna be

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Maybe I would see one or two terabyte

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Hard drives in these consoles

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I would like more

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Especially when you look at like say

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Red Dead Redemption 2 which just came out on PC

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
That's a 121 gigabyte download

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
And because everything

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Works perfectly when you download it

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
As they're downloading it

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Or they preloaded it early

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And they go to decrypt it or whatever

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It redownloaded it

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Oh shit

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Good job

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Game sizes especially

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
They're pushing 4K and everything

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And pushing better graphics

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
That's higher resolution textures

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
More uncompressed stuff

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
That's gonna fill up really fast

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Yeah

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
So I think what their solution's

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Gonna be is probably allowing

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
External storage again

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
And so they'll be on you to buy an external

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
5 terabyte drive or something like that

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
To load your shit on

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
But that's

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
That's unfortunate and in order to keep the cost down

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
That's what they're gonna have to do is cut back on storage

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
So I would hope that one to two terabytes

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Would be the kind of norm but

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Yeah I would think as game companies

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Are pushing more and more and more to digital

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
You know and the digital downloads and so forth

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
They've gotta have more space

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
But I think these companies could get away with a

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
1 or 2 terabyte drive a solid state drive

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Well but solid state drives

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Don't really go that high

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Like you know the tweeter says 8 terabytes

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
But the simple mac

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Mac to fatter?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Fact of the matter

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Yes the fact of the matter is

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
The solid state drives are usually much

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Smaller than your like you know

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I have a 3 terabyte drive in my computer

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But it's not solid state

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Cause most solid state drives you can buy at Fry's

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Like they don't go much past like 500 gigs

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Maybe you can get a terabyte

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Yeah but maybe they can like

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Decide how they want to store that data

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
So that they can put the stuff that they need

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Faster on the solid state drive

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And you know maybe cash in the other stuff

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
From like your larger drive

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I don't know

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I think it would be more important for

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Expansion to be easy

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Like you know for all the shit that Nintendo

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Is not having any room on its console

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
At least it's very easy to buy a new card

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And expand it right

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
You know in the Playstation 4 you can expand

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You know fairly easy and so forth so

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I think as long as you can expand on whatever they give you

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Relatively easy it'll be less of a problem

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
One other thing to consider

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I think is that gaming is going

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
To go more and more into the cloud

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Right cause that's a big thing as we talk about

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Project xCloud we know Sony

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Has been getting some interesting partners

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
When it comes to cloud gaming

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Well maybe that space

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Won't be as important as we think

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Because there will be stuff

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
In the cloud which is just

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
On the internet but you know

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That's the term everybody uses in the cloud

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
So it'll be interesting to see maybe the effects that that

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Has on space

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
But I will bet the first printing

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Will not be nearly enough so let's just

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Hope that they allow it to be expandable

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
So we have a foodie question next

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
So this is from Redertainment

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Who tweets orange lounge

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Foodio I'm looking for

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Recipe app suggestions

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
IOS preferably free

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
No dietary restrictions

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I already have the joy of cooking

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
How to cook everything and

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Mia lime

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
So I haven't a clue

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
There was one called Pepper for a while

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
But I don't know that it was free

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
He said no website it's all

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
App right? Yeah he just said app

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Well I mean cause you can go

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
On websites like I have Epicurious

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And Bon Appetit

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And all of that

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Yeah and technically if I'm not mistaken

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
In Safari you just click a couple buttons

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And you can turn any website into like an app

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Button basically so it runs like

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
It is an app kinda

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Well and on top of that I'm actually

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
In the middle of compiling all of the recipes

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
That I like to use

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
As a PDF

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
To put into Apple Books just for myself

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
But I just did a quick search

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
On the app store right now there's NYT

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Which is New York Times recipes

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
There's Yummly, Tasty

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Which I actually use Tasty that's the one

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Done by Buzzfeed

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I was gonna say I think Redotainment is looking for suggestions

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And so but you've used

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I've used them before

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Cause I gotta admit

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Epicurious has an app

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I'm terrible with recipes

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Like Alan is truly the one

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Who cooks between the two of us

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I know how to do chicken on the form and grill

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But that's

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
The extent of my knowledge

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I would

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So Yummly is good but their

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Website is pretty terrible

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Their videos because they've

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Done some very dangerous things

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
On their videos before

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
But I mean Epicurious I've always been really good

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I made my first cake with an Epicurious recipe

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I did it from their website

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
But apparently they have an app

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
And I think I'm gonna get the New York Times

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Cooking one myself

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Cause that one looks pretty good

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I do a lot of baking lately

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Alright

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Getting into another tweet

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
This one isn't awkward at all

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
This comes to us from

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You all know who that is right?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
That is GrandpaWarcraft

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Or Captain Matt from the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Who tweeted us

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
This lovely gem of a question

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Why did you dump GrandpaWarcraft

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
In 2009?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
He would've made a good boyfriend

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Now

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It's a completely awkward thing to tweet me

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
When you know I'm married

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And I know he's saying that only tongue in cheek

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I wouldn't have read that on air

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
He just wasn't being a sass master

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Because that's what he does

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
He drinks and he sasses

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Sometimes you know

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
This has happened to everybody

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
At some point in their life

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
They go out on a date and they go

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
This person is going to be a great friend

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Right?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And we are great friends

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
We did a podcast together for so many years

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I live in his old house

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And the reality is

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
If you had been my boyfriend

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
You'd be dead by now

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Alright

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Womp womp

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I had to give him an answer

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
He'd enjoy

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
We're going on the

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Star Trek Cruise together very soon

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
So I hope

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I'm going to print out this tweet and frame it

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And hang it in my cabin

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Matt

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And just remember it's 7 days and nights

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
At sea with me and my husband

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Alright

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Moving on

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Girl

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Look

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
If he's going to be awkward

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I'm going to make it more awkward

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Awkwarder?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Alright one more question

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Coming from Flaco Jones

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
A more serious topic

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Yeah come break our show again Flaco we miss you

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Alright

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Flaco Jones asks

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Not sure if you got into this last week

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
But I noticed a lot of debate

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
About Death Stranding

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Being good but not fun

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
In some reviewers opinions

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
My question is

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Do games have to be fun?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
If all games have to be fun

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
No matter what

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Doesn't that prove that games

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Can't be art

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
There's a difference between fun

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And enjoyment

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
You know? Like you can

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Enjoy something but not exactly

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Have the most amount of fun looking at it

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Right? Like

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Like looking at

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
A painting. Like looking at Bosch

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
One of my favorite ever paintings

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
In the universe is

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
It's the same one that's got

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Like the person

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
With the chicken head

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
And the ass bent over with people coming out of it

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And the egg and all the weirdness

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Because Bosch was an interesting fella

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
But I wouldn't say

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
That's a fun painting

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
It's not like something that's comfortable to look at

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
But it's enjoyable

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Makes sense?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Yeah and I would say too that like

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You know sometimes it's not necessarily about fun

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I mean yes

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Video games should be fun

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
It should be something that makes you feel good

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
But at the same time

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I think it's more about emotion

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Because art invokes emotion

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Art invokes response right?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
The biggest insult an artist

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Can see with their work

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Is for it to evoke nothing

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
But I would say like movies

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
We compare games to movies a lot

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
And going out to the movies

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Is fun right?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
But then I think about the time I went and saw

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The movie Dancer in the Dark starring

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Dancer in the Dark

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And I cried so hard

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And so much that I was like scream crying

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
At the end of the movie

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And my shirt was like halfway soaked

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I don't know if I would call that experience

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Fun

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
But does that mean Dancer in the Dark is not art?

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yeah

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So I kind of think there's like a similar sort of thing here

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
It's not necessarily that I went to the movie

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And I realized Dancer in the Dark

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Is a bit of an obscure pick

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
But pick a sad movie that you've seen

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
I see the grudge

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Any kind of Japanese horror movie

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
That doesn't necessarily have a happy ending

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Cause like American movies are all about

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Happy endings and shit

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
What about like a serious movie

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Like a Schindler's List

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
A Saving Private Ryan

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
You know movies that are

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Kind of about some very serious heavy

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Topics

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
But it's kind of like you get

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And I don't think I would call either of those movies

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Fun

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I mean I go they're bad

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Or I had a bad time or I regret seeing them

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
There's a difference between enjoyment

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And having fun

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I look at fun as a kind of a positive

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Mirthful sort of thing

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
But to enjoy just means that you get

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Some sort of satisfaction out of it

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Right

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
There's also something to consider

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
This might actually be true of some games

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I say that about Dancer in the Dark

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I don't know if I would watch that movie

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Again

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
There's other movies out there

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I know I'm trying to think of something

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I wouldn't say that Everybody's Gone under the Rapture

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Was fun

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
But it's enjoyable and provocative

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Like and there's certain games where I'm like

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I'm glad I played that

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And I'm really glad I experienced that

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
But I'm probably never going to play that again

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Yeah I don't think I can go play it again

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
You know just

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I had

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I was playing it

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I played it on stream

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I kind of

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Part of me was just I played it privately

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Because I did have just a response

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Where I had to you know once I was off camera

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I was like oh my god

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Oh my god and I had already seen you play it

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It's a heavy game and again

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I think so many people slept on this game

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Because I got smacked with a walking simulator

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Type of thing

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Maybe that is a great

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Because Death Stranding keeps getting labeled with this

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Walking simulator and all this thing

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Like that was a game where everybody's gone

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And I remember the rapture got that whole thing about

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Where's the game? What are you doing? What's the game?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
A game

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It's a narrative

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I don't look at it as a game

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I look at it as an interactive narrative

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And honestly those are the kinds of games

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I've personally been getting more into lately

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Are those kinds

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Other than building houses and watching my sims die

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
But I like the ones

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Where you're living the story

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
You're seeing it unfold

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Like To the Moon was another good one

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I think the game

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
In Everybody's Gone to the Rapture was the exploration

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Because you didn't necessarily do things

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
In the same order

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
There is a way you can play that game

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Where you can beat it in like 15 minutes

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
If you just skip everything basically

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
But I don't think you'd get the same thing

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Out of that necessarily

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
It's going and exploring and getting all the little

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
All the little

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Unlocks, bits of story and the memories

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
That you unlock

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Are part of the reward system

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
That you earned for doing your effort

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
An example akin to that

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Is something like Lost Odyssey

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
You remember that classic Xbox 360 game

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
That really just was Final Fantasy

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Under a different name pretty much

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But part of Lost Odyssey was that the main character was immortal

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
It's not a spoiler, it's established in the opening

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Is that the main character is immortal

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And you get these books

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Throughout the story

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
As you're playing a video game

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You sit there and you read a book

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Skyrim and Oblivion do this too

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
There's books in there

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And some people go, meh, reading

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And just throw away the book, right Logie?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Yes

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
But other people, especially in I think Lost Odyssey

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Because if you actually go

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And you read those books

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's like, holy shit

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Some of those stories

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Have almost a stronger

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Emotional impact than the game

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So isn't it weird

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
That we're talking about an art form

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Embedded in another art form

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Emotional response embedded within another

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Emotional response

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Or what about lore hunters in series

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Like, you know, because

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
When I was playing WoW

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I mean, the biggest thing that I got enjoyment out of

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Was lore hunting

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Was reading the books and seeing the things

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And then, of course, breaking the game with my demon hunter

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And there's some people that will play MMOs

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And I'm sometimes guilty of this

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
They'll just, oh, quest text, meh

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
They skip it, it's like, what am I supposed to do in this quest, right?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
But you're right, there's a whole rich world

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
In that, if you want to experience that

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Anyway, I think we might be getting a little bit lost

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
From the original question that was asked

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
But I think we are kind of giving some examples

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Is that there's also, like, different

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
There's different ways to have fun

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Yeah

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
And sometimes that exploration

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
That sort of is the fun

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And I think Death Stranding, if what I'm hearing about it

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Is true, and again, I'm not going to know this

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Till the next episode when I get to play it for myself

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
There might be a part of Death Stranding

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
That's kind of like everybody's gone to the rapture

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Where it's like, you could just focus on the game part

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Which maybe is not going to be the most

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Maybe it is just going to be walking and tricky balancing

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
But if you allow yourself to get immersed

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
In that story and that universe around it

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Then potentially

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
There might be more fulfillment out of that

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
And you might be left with a more rewarding sense out of that

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I'm looking forward to the story aspects of it

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Yeah

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
You know, and

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
That's why, like, for example, Breath of the Wild

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Yeah, very

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
It could look like a very simple story

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
On the surface, but when you're

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
But I like seeing the way the societies are built

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And the language behind it

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And seeing how they've built the world

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
The world that something exists in

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
To me is more of the game than the game

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Isn't it interesting, Dark Sakura

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
How, like, you and I

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Especially, like, in the early

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Reveals of this Death Stranding thing

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
We're both kind of like, what?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Okay, where's the game, right?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
We're both kind of, like, sitting here going, come on

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Right? But now it's like,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Now that we know more and more about it

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
It's kind of like, I have this morbid curiosity

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
But I'm more fascinated with this than ever

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Yeah, and I mean

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
And you know me, I'm attracted to kind of the

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Offshoot weirdo kind of storylines

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Anyway

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
But it's like, I'll put it this way

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I have learned a whole

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
In-game written language before

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I mean, I've forgotten it since then

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Because this was in high school

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
But I mean, my friends and I used to write

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Each other codes in

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
And in other, you know, kind of

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
In-game languages

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
In a game that we've played before

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
You know, so having just

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
That richness to it

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
And I really think this is going to be a very rich

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Universe with the work that's put into it

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And the people behind it

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
So, yeah

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Yeah, so we'll see

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Great question, Flocko

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Made a great conversation

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Out of it, so

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Love to have those here on the show

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Sadly, that's all the questions we got

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
But, you know, the last time

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
We got probably twice as many

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But we also had twice as much

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
So, that's alright

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
We're gonna try to really grow the family

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Here at OLR as we move into our 800th

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Episode and so forth, try to get the word out

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
God, that many

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
What are we gonna do when we hit a thousand?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
That's still

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
A thousand would be

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
A good four years away

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
You know, I just like, I'm saying when

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Because I think it's gonna happen

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
There's a, okay, real block

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
There's that honest part of me that's like, are we gonna

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Hit a thousand? I'm like, oh my god

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Four more years of this, but then I'm like

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Didn't we think we were gonna hit 500?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
We never thought we'd hit 500 and here we still are

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
So it's like, it's one of those things where it's like

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I don't know what I'd do with myself

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Maybe I'm not having fun, but I'm enjoying the ride

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
So if you're not having fun, is this art?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Is this art?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I'm choking some emotions

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I mean, and not just to go back

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
On the nostalgic, you know, thing before

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
But look at what all of us have done

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Every single one of us

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
In this room have gotten married

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Yeah

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
One of us has spawned

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
One of us has prevented spawning

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
We have

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Animals

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
We have lost people close to us

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Yes

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
We have gained people that we don't want to be close to us

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And lost them

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And lost them

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
In a different sense

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
We have changed jobs

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Yeah, all of us have changed jobs

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
All at some point in this room have been fun employed

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Rob

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
No

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
No, you have not

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I have not been fun employed

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I was super fun employed though and that was great

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Except I like money

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
You know, we adult harder than we used to

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
But

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
That's not fun, but it's enjoyable

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
But I'm just saying, it's like

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
No, for sure

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I don't see any point in giving up

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
No, you're right, you're right

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
We will continue to do this until

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
One of two things

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Either we can't

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
We're not able to get in the same room

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And do this anymore on Sunday nights

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Rob has a full hip replacement

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Yeah, I mean, well

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
We physically can't

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
That might be one reason we don't do it anymore

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Or we just kind of decide

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I think we've said everything we have to say

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
No, that'll never happen

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
See, that's where I'm kind of at

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Well, we've kind of

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
That is never going to happen

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
We still find new things to say

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I don't know, here's

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Let me ask this honest question

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I'm going to reward those that have stuck around

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
With a bonus episode this deep in

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
With some real deep content here

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Oh, yeah

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Do you think your emotions

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
And your feelings about gaming

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Are as strong as they were

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
When OLR first started

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Probably more so

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I mean, I wouldn't say that I am the gamer

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I was

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You know, ten years ago

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Fifteen years ago, etc.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
You know, I like to think that I've

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I've

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Grown

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
As a gamer

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And grown into different tastes

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You know, but

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
I think that

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
As I've grown and matured through it

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I've got different attitudes

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And when I see people

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Who are now in the position that I was

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
When we started

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I feel like I've got more to contribute

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
So, I mean, does that make sense?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
No, no, totally, for sure

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I don't know, like

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I have to admit there's a part of me that's having

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
A harder and harder time staying on top

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Of everything that's going on in gaming

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
And I don't know if that's because of my

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Tendency to just kind of use MMOs

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
As my gaming crutch or what have you

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Where I'm just kind of like, this is my comfort zone

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
This is my place and the thing that I do

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
But I feel like it's been harder

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
As the years go on to really stay on top

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Of everything that's going on in gaming

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And I don't know if this is also like a sign of getting older

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
But there's also some times where you kind of look at

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Like these things that

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
The big discussions and debate that gamers are having

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Where you kind of go like, I don't know if I

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Get that, or I don't know if I

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Understand why people

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Are having that type of reaction

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I think it's necessarily like

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Before, like I know when we first

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
That's where you respond, okay boomer

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Just kidding, GenX

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
GenX, it's GenX

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Thank you

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I think right now it's just

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
We've kind of grown with

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Before, like I thought I had to

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Get everything to be able to talk about everything

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
And then it's just like

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
It's like, look how much money I've wasted on

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Like all these systems I didn't play

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
It's like, okay, we'll just scale back

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
With what you get

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And not necessarily

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Purchase every single game that comes out

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Yeah, I still do catch myself

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Doing that, like I have several

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Games that are like big titles that I have

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Not touched at all, like Kingdom Hearts 3

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Just the other day

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I'm like, oh yeah, I do have that game, don't I?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So like, I have this whole library

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Of stuff I haven't touched, but I'll pick stuff up

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Because I feel like I want it

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
But that's going to be the same thing

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I think when the next-gen systems come out

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
It's just like, I'm not going to buy

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Both of those systems

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I will see what happens

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
But I don't know

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I don't feel the need to do that

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Even right now, I haven't played my PlayStation 4 in months

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
So

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I don't know

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I mean, we'll see

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
It's time, really, a lot of it

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
We don't have as much time as we used to

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Dedicate the stuff like that

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
You have to balance it between everything else

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So, yeah

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I don't know

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Anyway, the other thing

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I'll piggyback on what you were saying to our Sakura

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
About just having

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
This place to do the show

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
And everything that has transformed in our lives

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
While the show has gone on

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I think there's something to be said as well

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
About the way we've watched our audience

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Grow with us

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And the things that our audience has done

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
We have seen folks from our audience

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Go on to do their own shows

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And to do their own live streaming

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And broadcasting and getting their voices

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Truly out there

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And in many ways, and I really mean this when I say it

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
There is truly no greater compliment

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
To what we've done

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Here at OLR than the fact that

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Some of you

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Feel empowered to do the same

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Yeah

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And I think that alone has made this adventure

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Worth it

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I sound like it's over, but it's not

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
The road thus far

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
We're entitled to a little rumination

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Sure, of course

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
We're fucking old

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
What happens when you talk to the old player character

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
In the video games?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Well, let me tell you about it

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Let me spin you a tale

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Girl

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
You know, I think that also

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I mean, just go back and listen

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
To even a hundred episodes back

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
We're always

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
You know, I think that in some cases

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
The people who have stayed with us

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Have our own personal struggles that we've had

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
On the show

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
That I think

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
That maybe even outside of just the realm of gaming

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
You know, we're people

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And if anything that we might have experienced

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Will help other people

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Then I'm fine sharing those experiences

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
With people

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yeah, for sure

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
That's why I talk about my health openly

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
That's why I talk about

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Real life stuff openly

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Because it's not

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
The games that you're playing can also be a reflection

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Of where you are mentally

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
For sure

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
You made me think about

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
The greatest

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Feeling, the greatest reward

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
The greatest thing I've probably ever felt

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
From doing this show

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
When you talk about being open with your life

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And being your authentic self here on air

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
The emails I've gotten

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Where they were like

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I think it's a little different now in the year 2019

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
But this show's been around for 17 years

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
In the earlier years of the show

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Especially when we were first a podcast

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
2006, 2007, right?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
When I got that email that said

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Rob, you being your authentic self

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
And being a quote unquote

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Normal gay guy

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
But that's, you know

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
When people are in their feelings

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I totally get why somebody phrases it that way

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
You being a normal gay guy

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Out and open and a gaming fan like me

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
It helped me

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
To accept that this was a part of myself

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Just thinking about it

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
There is no

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
There is no greater reward, period

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And I think

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Just with our dynamic on here

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
The three of us

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
We actually

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Kind of represent a different demographic

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Each of us

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
That can interact together

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I think that's what's kept this show going

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
As long as it has

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
There's been nights

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
We can get into it

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Very passionate opinions

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And I'm sure we've said things that maybe even

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Piss some of our listeners off

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
But at the end of the day

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
They kind of come back because

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
It's that bar where you go where everybody knows your name

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
That whole thing, right?

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
It's like this, we have a strong friendship here

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Where it's like, we're going to have passion

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
We're going to have opinions

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
We're going to have those things

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
But at the end of the day

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
We're all cut from the same nerd cloth

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I guess

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I'm just the poorly sewn one

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I'm the amateur cosplayer

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Of the group now

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Fuzzy wuzzy feelings

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
That was deep

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Someone fart before I get, you know

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Well I will say you know that Loki

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Followed up the tweet that Flocko

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Wrote putting fun plus

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Art equals

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Fart

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
So there you go

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
We hope you found this episode

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
This bonus episode of Orange Laundry

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Is a big gigantic fart

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
That's fun plus art

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Thank you for sticking with us

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Through this bonus episode

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Through however many episodes you've listened to Orange Laundry

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
One other thing I wanted to say real quick

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Sorry not to go back to the deep stuff

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I think we've been talking behind the scenes

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
About trying to do some creative

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Kicks in the butt

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
For episode 800

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
We kind of always ask ourselves

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
How do we celebrate 17 years?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
How do we celebrate another year?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
How do we celebrate another hundred episodes

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
When you've been doing it like this long right?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And I think like a creative kick in the butt

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And I don't want to over promise and under deliver

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So that's why I'm trying to like really bite my tongue

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
On like what we want to do

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
You trash your hotel room and hire hookers

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
No but I think when we like creatively

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Kind of go back to the show and go

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
What can we, what can we like

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Tune up behind the scenes

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
What we want to do different, what we want to do better

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
What makeover do we want to give ourselves

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I think it's a nice little like invigoration

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Last one right? When we took the show

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And moved it to Twitch

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
It was a big like creative kick in the ass

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
You know and it's

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
It kind of keeps you going just that much longer

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
So I think

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I look forward to 800 episodes for that reason

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Because like how are we going to kick ourselves in the butt

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Now to keep moving

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
So our show is old enough to vote

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Next year

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Just in time for the next election

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Fuck don't get me started on that

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Alright then with that

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I will shut it down tonight

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
We've been going for quite a bit for a pre-recorded show

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
So it's almost 9 o'clock here

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And I know everybody has their lives to get back to

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
But it would not be an episode of Orange Laundry

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Now keep in mind this was a bonus episode technically

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
We're not going to number this one

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
So there was no classic game of the week

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
We didn't do some of our regular segments

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
All of that stuff will come back next week

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
In a normal episode of Orange Laundry

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
But we will go around and get everybody's

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Final thoughts still

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
DarkSakura, your final thought for us

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I'm kind of hungry

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
We've kind of gone during the dinner time hours

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Doing this show

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So I don't blame you for that feeling

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Loki, your final thought

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
So I've been following

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Salt and Straw which is an ice cream place

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
That they have by Disneyland

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And they have monthly flavors

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
That they put out

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
They have five different flavors that are based on

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Thanksgiving

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
One of them is salted caramel Thanksgiving turkey

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
It's salted caramel with crispy

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Turkey skin

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
You lost me at caramel

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Okay, my final thought is

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
You inspired me to do one

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Last thing here because I have something you have to try

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Uh oh

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Uh oh

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Okay

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Uh oh, Rob just got

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Giggly and went and grabbed something

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Oh fuck, are these leis?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
No, worse

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Okay, so these are from Trader Joe's

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
They're kettle chips

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Turkey and stuffing

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I need to try this

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Loki, if you will

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I ate one, I thought it was fucking nasty

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
But I'm not huge on Thanksgiving food

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Here you go, Darth Zarya

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
It definitely smells like stuffing

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You can thank Alan for bringing these

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
There you go, Pikachu

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
What do you think?

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
It tastes like gravy a little bit

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
This is fucking yummy

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
If Alan doesn't like them

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I'm giving you the bag

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
It's alright

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I don't like them

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
It's got a weird aftertaste

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You know what, when leis had that

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Biscuit and gravy flavor, the first time I had that

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I was like, this is fucking gross

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
But then it was like

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
One of those, I'm hungry and it's the only option

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I ate it again, I'm like, these aren't that bad

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I like to shout down a little bit

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
These remind me though

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Because I'm definitely getting that turkey

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And the stuffing

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I really like it

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
That's redundant

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
But you know I also like those

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Soy and butter chips

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Oh yeah

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Those are really good

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Alright, well it started and it ended with food

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Have a great night everybody

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
