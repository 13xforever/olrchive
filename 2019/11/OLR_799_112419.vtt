00:00.000 --> 00:17.320
This week, Toyota decides that its legacy in racing games should not continue to be

00:17.320 --> 00:19.240
arse and resumes licensing their cars.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.660
Get your Supra on in Forza Horizon 4 soon.

00:21.660 --> 00:24.640
This is just one headline from the Week in Gaming News, stay tuned for the rest, starting

00:24.640 --> 00:29.760
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.640 --> 00:37.520
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.520 --> 00:43.520
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 799 for this November the 24th

00:43.520 --> 00:45.480
of 2019.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.680
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.680
Sup.

00:50.680 --> 00:51.680
Hi, how are you?

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
I'm here.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
Glad to have you here as always.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.080
Thank you for bringing a refill on the coffee supplies tonight, appreciate that.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.200
I thought it was something better than what I grabbed, but I'm glad it tastes pretty good.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.040
Yeah, it was like this, it wasn't like coffee beans, it was like a mix thing that was like

01:04.040 --> 01:05.040
mocha mix.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
It was pretty good.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.040
No, it was not bad.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
Coffee powers OLR.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.840
Unless you're Tech Master Loki over there to my side here.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.480
In which case, sugar free Red Bull is what powers Loki.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.480
Sure.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
How are you doing?

01:16.480 --> 01:17.480
I'm fine.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.480
Yeah?

01:18.480 --> 01:19.480
Good, good.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.400
All right, we are live on Twitch TV over twitch.tv slash VOG network or VOG network

01:23.400 --> 01:27.760
for the voice geeks network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

01:27.760 --> 01:30.920
nine o'clock Eastern ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:30.920 --> 01:35.000
I say ish because if he has a long show, if he has a lot to talk about like he did tonight,

01:35.000 --> 01:36.400
he loves his VR stuff.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.120
So today was or this week was a pretty big week in AR, I think we're going to get right

01:40.120 --> 01:43.360
into that here at the top of the show, but we do tape live of course, right after Bobby

01:43.360 --> 01:47.840
does at the voice geeks network and we invite you guys to participate along with our chat

01:47.840 --> 01:51.000
room over at twitch.tv slash VOG network.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.440
But if you're listening on the podcast feed, hey, that's great too.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.000
We appreciate all the support.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.680
I should say as well tonight is, as you may notice, episode number 799, which means next

02:01.680 --> 02:05.720
week, which is bound to be a slow news week, which is a, I'm not even sure we should really

02:05.720 --> 02:06.880
be doing a show next week.

02:06.880 --> 02:07.880
We will.

02:07.880 --> 02:08.880
We will.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.880
We're going to be here.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.480
Because the holiday and the, I say, why would we, because the holiday in the US.

02:13.480 --> 02:18.460
So for the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, many people travel and go places.

02:18.460 --> 02:21.780
It's a big, uh, you know, eating dinner together type of holiday.

02:21.780 --> 02:26.500
Um, but, uh, unless you're me, then you go out and eat with, you know, your significant

02:26.500 --> 02:27.500
other and your dad.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.500
That's it.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.620
This is three of us going out, but do you know where we're going this year?

02:31.620 --> 02:36.020
Actually, we're going to the local Brazilian grill for Thanksgiving.

02:36.020 --> 02:40.740
So in addition, the fire and flame, in addition, Dan and I had an anniversary there once.

02:40.740 --> 02:41.740
Yeah.

02:41.740 --> 02:45.640
In addition to the meat parade that they have there, they have all the fixes for Thanksgiving.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.540
So I'm hoping, yeah, I'm hoping to get the giant Turkey on the sword and grilled pineapple.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.540
That's awesome.

02:51.540 --> 02:52.540
I should have done that.

02:52.540 --> 02:57.800
But then my wife decided to see, we were going to have Thanksgiving without family.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.880
And then one of the family asked and I said, no, because the plan was, we're not having

03:01.880 --> 03:03.400
Thanksgiving in the family.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.120
Then one of her family asked and she said, yes.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.820
You know what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving?

03:08.820 --> 03:10.800
Not cooking, letting someone else do it.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.940
I have to do a bunch of baking because like I was like, they're like, Oh, they want us

03:14.940 --> 03:18.020
to bring some like, okay, I'll make some roast potatoes and I'll make my cranberry

03:18.020 --> 03:19.020
sauce.

03:19.020 --> 03:20.020
Dan's like, they want you to bake.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.020
I'm like...

03:21.020 --> 03:22.020
So they're open on Thanksgiving?

03:22.020 --> 03:23.020
Yeah.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.380
Oh, a lot of restaurants open on Thanksgiving.

03:24.380 --> 03:28.440
And a big thank you to the staff for doing that because I know we see a lot of crap this

03:28.440 --> 03:32.180
time of year about retail workers working on Thanksgiving, which, you know, it's, I

03:32.180 --> 03:36.700
don't, I just, I don't like shopping during, I don't like shopping at all this weekend

03:36.700 --> 03:39.240
because it's, it's, it's parking lots.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.260
Parking lots are hell on earth.

03:41.260 --> 03:42.260
I'm not doing it.

03:42.260 --> 03:45.500
So, you know, and I realized there's the whole controversy with, with workers and everything,

03:45.500 --> 03:47.780
but the reality is there are a lot of people that work on Thanksgiving.

03:47.780 --> 03:50.020
Emergency personnel, people who work at gas stations.

03:50.020 --> 03:54.260
I just don't think people should be working like during Thanksgiving lunch.

03:54.260 --> 03:55.260
Yeah.

03:55.260 --> 03:58.100
So hopefully, hopefully they have a nice way to split it up or something.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.720
Um, but, uh, yeah.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.340
So thank you to all the restaurant people out there and folks that do work Thanksgiving.

04:03.340 --> 04:07.380
They don't want to be, I think though, I remember one year we asked the server like, Oh, are

04:07.380 --> 04:08.380
you sad?

04:08.380 --> 04:11.100
You have to, you know, be, well, I think we said it more tastefully than that, but we're

04:11.100 --> 04:13.740
kind of like, Oh, how do you feel about working here Thanksgiving?

04:13.740 --> 04:17.540
And they were like, I don't mind it because the tips are great today.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.100
So not everybody, not everybody.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.780
So hopefully, hopefully many folks out there get to do it by choice and aren't forced to,

04:23.780 --> 04:30.220
or at least those that are forced to have a way to still enjoy the holiday however you

04:30.220 --> 04:31.220
like.

04:31.220 --> 04:35.620
Anyway, maybe enjoying the holiday for you is a marathon video game session where you

04:35.620 --> 04:37.700
finally get to catch up on your backlog.

04:37.700 --> 04:38.700
Show of hands.

04:38.700 --> 04:43.460
Who's binging a Pokemon sword or shield, Death Stranding, any of the other new releases that

04:43.460 --> 04:47.520
came out in the past week or so, uh, or the past month, past year.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.340
How many of you guys are going to binge those this weekend?

04:49.340 --> 04:51.180
My advice, go outside.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.300
Well, you could, you could do both.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.300
Yes.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.300
Take it with you.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.300
You're on a switch.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.300
That's true.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.300
Why aren't you playing a switch?

04:58.300 --> 04:59.300
That's right.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.300
I can go play Pokemon shield at the park.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.300
Why not?

05:01.300 --> 05:02.580
Uh, anyway, you know, that thing's going to be on me all the time when animal crossing

05:02.580 --> 05:03.580
comes out.

05:03.580 --> 05:04.580
Yeah, it's true.

05:04.580 --> 05:05.580
It's true.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.460
Anyway, uh, let's start off the show tonight with our kickoff topic.

05:07.460 --> 05:11.500
I'm talking about a game that sadly will not be portable, uh, because the technology

05:11.500 --> 05:16.680
is not really there to make a setup like this go portable, but, um, Loki, do you want to

05:16.680 --> 05:17.680
start us off?

05:17.680 --> 05:20.680
You're talking about, uh, what just got announced this week?

05:20.680 --> 05:25.460
So did this, did the ceiling open up and did microphones fall from the snow?

05:25.460 --> 05:30.520
Because this is not the same, not the same.

05:30.520 --> 05:37.240
So we got a brand new half life, um, trailer for a game called half life.

05:37.240 --> 05:42.080
Um, Alex wanted to say Alexa, but I didn't.

05:42.080 --> 05:48.160
So half life Alex and it's going to be a brand new VR game that's coming out, um, in March

05:48.160 --> 05:50.560
of next year and it looks pretty cool.

05:50.560 --> 05:57.120
It takes place between the first and second half life games and yeah, I mean, that's all

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
I know.

05:58.120 --> 06:02.600
I'm a terrible person because I've never played a half life game despite, well, they just

06:02.600 --> 06:08.240
sit, uh, idly collecting dust with the rest of my backlog that's in, um, my scene library.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.680
And yes, I would like to say that, well, now we've got the Thanksgiving break, maybe I

06:11.680 --> 06:14.920
can go play as this, but I know better that I'm never going to do that.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.720
So, um, I'll play it someday.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.720
Yeah, I must've missed.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.720
Go ahead.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.040
It's not enough to make me want to play it because it's VR.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.040
I won't play it.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.640
Well, I'll totally play it for VR, but like, um, I don't know.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.640
Um, I, I have not really gotten into half life, the half life series myself.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.480
Um, I'm kind of in your boat, Loki.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.920
Like I have some of the games, especially cause the orange box, I actually know I did

06:38.920 --> 06:40.880
play.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.760
When the orange box came out, I remember trying to play half life, but I didn't really get

06:44.760 --> 06:50.320
like absorbed into it, but my husband loves half life and I'm sure you all are very curious

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
for Alan's thoughts.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.440
We will get those thoughts later in the program.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.440
He's out on an errand right now.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
He'll be back around seven o'clock.

06:55.840 --> 07:00.040
So I, he's the resident half-life Stan, uh, here in this house, we will get his thoughts

07:00.040 --> 07:01.440
a little later in the show.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.920
However, I can still appreciate for what it's worth.

07:03.920 --> 07:09.120
I was very taken with how good it looked like I thought the graphics, well, it's the new

07:09.120 --> 07:10.120
source engine.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.120
Yeah, exactly.

07:11.120 --> 07:16.080
And I think that's a big part of it is because, you know, we haven't had a new official valve

07:16.080 --> 07:19.120
game in a long time, like a long time.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.120
I should say, I should say like a mainline valve game, cause I know you could throw the

07:22.120 --> 07:26.640
Dota card game thing at me, or, you know, the fact that they've been working on the,

07:26.640 --> 07:32.600
the VR, uh, you know, uh, the, the palette of games that comes with HTC Vive and so forth,

07:32.600 --> 07:33.600
those experiences.

07:33.600 --> 07:40.040
Um, but I mean like, uh, like a mainline fricking game, you know, uh, I don't think there, there's

07:40.040 --> 07:44.840
really been one of those since what, like Dota two would probably be the closest or

07:44.840 --> 07:47.480
even maybe portal to those kids for a long time.

07:47.480 --> 07:53.240
I don't remember what came out last was a Dota two or was it there?

07:53.240 --> 08:02.440
They did like a VR mini experience thing for the, um, well, yeah, that's what I was saying

08:02.440 --> 08:06.600
is that the VR thing for the HTC Vive, but I don't count that because that's essentially,

08:06.600 --> 08:08.360
it's not like a mainline game.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
You know what I mean?

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
That's it.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.360
But I'm glad that source two is out finally.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.440
Cause then other people that want to make games in that can maybe now mod stuff into

08:16.440 --> 08:17.440
it.

08:17.440 --> 08:22.000
I feel like what's probably taken a long time for valve to make a new like main game, if

08:22.000 --> 08:25.920
you will, is the fact that it's the, it's the source engine that they've been working

08:25.920 --> 08:26.920
on.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.280
And, and now, you know, I presumably, I don't think we've had it confirmed unless one of

08:31.280 --> 08:37.440
you guys knows different, but, uh, presumably this half-life Alex is running on some semblance,

08:37.440 --> 08:43.960
excuse me, of a source engine part three, um, which three or two or two, I don't know

08:43.960 --> 08:44.960
anymore.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.560
Uh, they go, they don't go to three.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.560
That's how you know.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.560
Okay.

08:48.560 --> 08:49.560
The newest source engine.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.560
Excuse me.

08:50.560 --> 08:54.360
Uh, it's going to be source engine Alex when it goes to three.

08:54.360 --> 08:59.160
But I got to say it looked really good and honest to God, my gut reaction was, man, I

08:59.160 --> 09:03.080
wish I could play this with a mouse and keyboard cause it looks like a really nice game, but

09:03.080 --> 09:07.880
I don't know if it's going to be enough for me to jump to VR on PC.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.680
Like I like VR.

09:09.680 --> 09:14.440
Um, I have PlayStation VR and I like some of the things I've checked out with that,

09:14.440 --> 09:21.280
but I'm not sure for one game in a series I'm kind of on if I want to jump into PC VR,

09:21.280 --> 09:24.720
especially because I feel like the way technology is progressing, the VR is just getting like

09:24.720 --> 09:25.960
better and better.

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
I don't know.

09:26.960 --> 09:27.960
I'm a little bit torn.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.960
I guess.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.160
I mean, you could just probably borrow my Oculus rift.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.040
I mean, well, if you're offering now we're talking, there's a way to enjoy it without

09:35.040 --> 09:39.800
having to drop all that money on a, you know, PC, it's just sitting in a box right now.

09:39.800 --> 09:43.720
I mean, I eventually plan on bringing it out again, but it's just, it's sitting in a box

09:43.720 --> 09:44.720
right now.

09:44.720 --> 09:45.720
Cause it's really the only space I have to play.

09:45.720 --> 09:50.440
The rift is in the kitchen and yeah, it's not always convenient to do that.

09:50.440 --> 09:55.280
But anyway, from looking at the trailer, honestly, that was my gut reaction was like, Hey, this

09:55.280 --> 09:57.160
game looks like really good.

09:57.160 --> 10:01.840
Like if this is the engine that valve is working on now, I hope they're going to use this to

10:01.840 --> 10:05.320
make, can we get another orange box, another orange box, please?

10:05.320 --> 10:11.240
Well, or make another portal, make another left for dead, make another, or if they are

10:11.240 --> 10:16.520
insistent on not ever counting to three with one of their franchises, making a new experience

10:16.520 --> 10:19.920
that uses the engine, I think would be really cool.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.600
License that shit out to other people to make your games.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.000
So that was, that was my honest to God reaction to the trailer.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.480
I was like, neat, too bad.

10:27.480 --> 10:31.000
I'm not going to spend the money to play this, but dang, if that's where valve is at right

10:31.000 --> 10:33.520
now, I hope they turn out some more games with that.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
That's honest to God.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.640
Well, why would you work on an engine if you're not going to use it?

10:36.640 --> 10:40.360
I mean, they're getting the very least license it out to other companies to make games where

10:40.360 --> 10:42.480
why develop an engine if you're gonna make one game for it?

10:42.480 --> 10:45.680
You would hope, but at the same time that EA engine can go, what is it?

10:45.680 --> 10:46.680
Frostbite?

10:46.680 --> 10:47.680
What is it?

10:47.680 --> 10:48.680
What is it?

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
Yeah, but they use it for every single goddamn game that they have.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
It needs to die in a fire.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.680
It doesn't need to die in a fire, it's just they should stop forcing everybody to use

10:53.680 --> 10:54.680
it.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.680
It looks pretty good for Dragon Age Inquisition.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.400
Yeah, but like you've heard the horror stories about how some games trying to work with that,

10:59.400 --> 11:02.640
like, you know, that engine is part of the reason why Mass Effect Andromeda came up way

11:02.640 --> 11:04.960
short of what they really wanted to do.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.360
Like Mass Effect Andromeda was supposed to be like Mass Effect No Man's Sky, but it was,

11:08.360 --> 11:14.040
I mean, if rumors are to be believed, but you can tell that Mass Effect Andromeda, like

11:14.040 --> 11:16.080
it's disjointed.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.160
And I think that's why, I mean, this narrative would certainly explain why.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.680
If it's like Mass Effect No Man's Sky, those sex scenes are going to be some fucking weird

11:23.680 --> 11:24.680
shit.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.680
That's all I guess.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.280
I don't know what it's doing.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.280
All right.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.360
Let me look at some comments in our chat.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.680
Kaijuto in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says they could have skipped Half-Life

11:36.680 --> 11:38.720
and went for a portal VR.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.520
That would have been so freaky.

11:40.520 --> 11:46.840
I worry about like, you know, already we know Dark Soccer is not the biggest fan of VR because

11:46.840 --> 11:49.940
she gets motion sick pretty easy.

11:49.940 --> 11:55.200
And when I think of a game like Portal in VR, I'm going like, I don't, I would get motion

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
sick.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.200
They had a game.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.200
They had what wasn't VR.

11:59.200 --> 12:04.200
It was a version of Portal that used the motion controllers.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.560
So that's what Bobby's talking about.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.440
Valve actually did license a portal VR experience.

12:08.440 --> 12:14.560
Oh, well also they, they had the, I want to say it was for the PlayStation three, uh,

12:14.560 --> 12:20.120
was a DLC or something like that that used the PlayStation move controllers.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.800
Maybe they had something similar with that on the PC as well, but there was something

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
that did that.

12:24.800 --> 12:30.640
It was kind of, um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat, the break man in chat says, Alex

12:30.640 --> 12:32.240
looks so good.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.480
It makes me drool.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.120
Uh, is that a problem?

12:35.120 --> 12:37.140
No, you are free to like what you like.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.600
And I'm sure there's a lot of people that are very excited about this.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.160
I'm not saying I'm not excited.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.960
I'm more excited for the engine than I am the game.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.160
If that makes sense.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.340
That's that's where I'm at.

12:46.340 --> 12:48.640
And so, and to your point, it looks good.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.960
Yeah, it looks good.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.320
That's why I'm like, Ooh, I wonder what else they're going to do in this.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.280
I wonder if they're going to make keyboard and mouse, you know, more traditional games

12:55.280 --> 12:58.200
for this or, or what else is going to be possible with this.

12:58.200 --> 13:02.740
But I also completely understand like, whereas I am of the mindset where I'm like, damn,

13:02.740 --> 13:05.580
I would love to play this if it was keyboard and mouse.

13:05.580 --> 13:09.900
And I'm sure some type of hacker is going to make that happen where you, I mean, but

13:09.900 --> 13:14.260
not to say it's going to be any fun that way, because I'm sure there's going to be certain,

13:14.260 --> 13:17.860
you know, kind of like how the Wii U shows off the Wii U, the, the touch pad and how

13:17.860 --> 13:22.260
the Wii games, you know, I think there's going to be things in it that aren't going to work

13:22.260 --> 13:23.820
per se on keyboard and mouse.

13:23.820 --> 13:29.420
So even though a hacker might hack it to run on a monitor, like, is it gonna be the same?

13:29.420 --> 13:30.420
Probably not.

13:30.820 --> 13:35.540
Get very soon to a place you get stuck, unless hackers work on bypasses or something that's

13:35.540 --> 13:40.260
probably going to take too much effort, honestly, that probably isn't worth their time.

13:40.260 --> 13:46.020
But anyway, I completely understand why Valve, because they have entered this VR space with

13:46.020 --> 13:53.860
almost said Oculus Rift with HTC Vive, whatever one of them, Valve has entered that space.

13:53.860 --> 13:58.920
I understand, you know, they've got to back that up by throwing the weight of one of their

13:58.920 --> 14:04.720
mighty franchises behind it, and really doing what they can to get it moving, you know,

14:04.720 --> 14:07.680
get the sales moving, get people excited about VR.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.680
So this is what they're doing.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.400
They're doing the first Half-Life game in Lord knows how long since whenever the orange

14:12.400 --> 14:17.160
box came out, which was probably 14, 13, 14 years ago at this point, maybe even further

14:17.160 --> 14:18.320
back than that.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.800
This show was going when it came out.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.360
I remember that because, well, right, it was Xbox 360.

14:23.360 --> 14:33.120
So it's, I think it was 2005, no, 2005 was still the Xbox 2007, maybe, okay, that was

14:33.120 --> 14:38.000
around the launch of the PlayStation three, and it wasn't that podcast switch to being

14:38.000 --> 14:40.160
about all games and not just music based games.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.500
I'm pretty sure it sounds about right.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.080
Like fall of 2017.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.080
That sounds, or you mean 2007.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.080
I'm sorry, 2007.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.880
But that's still 12 years ago, you know, it's a long, long time since the, you know, the

14:50.880 --> 14:51.880
orange box.

14:51.880 --> 14:57.360
We're selling it.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.400
The break man in chat says orange box.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.400
Great game, bad name.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.360
I wonder if that's what people say about this podcast.

15:03.360 --> 15:08.600
Bobby Black Wolf either went to Wiki or just knows off the top of his head, October, 2007.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
So you're close.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
Right.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
Yeah.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.600
So there you go.

15:12.600 --> 15:17.400
Y Y R says, how would you even hack in keyboard and mouse controls for something like use

15:17.400 --> 15:19.000
your hands to clear the shelf?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.760
In VR, that's where I think it would get stuck a little bit, but then Bobby follows that

15:23.760 --> 15:24.760
up.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.760
Use mouse to look at object, hold E, move mouse to move object.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.580
Like they could do it, but will a hacker want to go to that kind of effort?

15:31.580 --> 15:32.580
I don't know.

15:32.580 --> 15:37.640
And to be honest, like if valve is building this through VR, then they want you to experience

15:37.640 --> 15:38.640
it in VR.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.560
And they're building like, it's not just going to be a normal, just do it like, just do it

15:42.560 --> 15:49.080
like they do with the, um, there's a, like, I forget what the spell is in elder scrolls

15:49.080 --> 15:52.440
Skyrim, but there's a spell where you can pull objects towards you.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.440
Just do it like that.

15:53.440 --> 15:58.480
Just look in the general direction of something, just pull it through the, um, now I will say

15:58.480 --> 16:01.920
this because this was an interesting little debate I saw in discord, which I think was

16:01.920 --> 16:05.480
actually a Bobby black Wolf's channel, but I'm going to steal it because it was still

16:05.480 --> 16:08.280
our discord over at vog network.com slash discord.

16:08.280 --> 16:12.200
There's a lot of talk about the hands and the way that the hands look in the trailer.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.360
Uh, and then what we've seen so far, because the hands are kind of disembodied, you don't

16:16.360 --> 16:17.360
actually see arms.

16:17.360 --> 16:21.560
You just see these floating hands and some people thought that was a little weird.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.720
I kind of think it looks like, I don't think it looks weird either.

16:24.720 --> 16:29.400
I think it looks like pretty much any Wii game I ever played ever had, like that would

16:29.400 --> 16:32.840
try to be somewhat realistic, had the disembodied hands as well.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.840
I don't think it's a big deal.

16:34.840 --> 16:41.680
Like I get, I get where the mindset is because everything we do in gaming is one step closer

16:41.680 --> 16:43.560
to the holiday, right?

16:43.560 --> 16:45.380
Everything we do in gaming is one step closer to the holiday.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.260
So if you want the holodeck, then you ought to be able to see your hands, right?

16:48.260 --> 16:53.220
But I also understand, and to Bobby's credit on his show, and he even used Twitch to give

16:53.220 --> 16:57.420
the full thing, like this is why you don't see hands because the game can, like the way

16:57.420 --> 17:00.180
VR is today, it cannot track your hands.

17:00.180 --> 17:03.820
It doesn't know if you're turning just your wrist or if you're turning your entire elbow.

17:03.820 --> 17:08.420
Like the game doesn't know that unless they were selling these full body tracking suits.

17:08.420 --> 17:12.940
So the technology's there, but like is the technology in every home?

17:12.940 --> 17:13.940
God, no.

17:13.940 --> 17:17.580
The technology is only the type of thing you see in those commercials where dudes are running

17:17.580 --> 17:22.120
on treadmills and you see the neon lights all over in that place.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.640
That's where that technology exists.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.140
It's not in people's homes yet.

17:25.140 --> 17:28.220
Will it be in people's homes in 10 years?

17:28.220 --> 17:29.220
Maybe.

17:29.220 --> 17:31.040
Decade challenge.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.500
What my video games look like today and what they look like in 2029.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.500
Who knows?

17:35.500 --> 17:40.300
But for now, we just have the disembodied hands, but I don't, I don't think it looks

17:40.300 --> 17:41.300
bad.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.300
No, who cares?

17:42.300 --> 17:43.300
I don't.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.980
In fact, I kind of actually, that's what modders are for.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.380
If you really want to mod in stupid elbows and go right ahead.

17:48.380 --> 17:49.380
Yeah.

17:49.380 --> 17:53.740
So, um, you know, well, I kind of liked the fact that they're see-through because you

17:53.740 --> 17:57.740
know, especially since the game is all about the visuals, like, you know, if my big old,

17:57.740 --> 18:01.620
my big old hands were in the shot, I want it to go.

18:01.620 --> 18:02.620
I want it to go the opposite.

18:02.620 --> 18:07.260
I want them to mod it in so that instead of your hands being there, it's just feet.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.820
It's just your feet.

18:08.820 --> 18:13.100
I want to see a mod called 45 where your hands are there.

18:13.100 --> 18:16.940
They're just very tiny.

18:16.940 --> 18:17.940
Very tiny.

18:17.940 --> 18:24.700
It's like the tiniest hands, like the big head mode, but like giant head, tiny hands.

18:24.700 --> 18:25.700
All right.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.740
Anyway, one time I had to one big joke.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.740
Easy joke.

18:28.740 --> 18:29.740
I had to take the swing.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.220
You just couldn't see my hands when I did the swing.

18:31.220 --> 18:32.220
All right.

18:32.220 --> 18:33.220
Anyway.

18:33.220 --> 18:36.420
Um, I would rather though just not play a throw up game.

18:36.420 --> 18:38.300
You'd rather not play what?

18:38.300 --> 18:39.300
A throw up game.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.300
Oh.

18:40.300 --> 18:44.260
That's what VR games are to me, they're throw up games.

18:44.260 --> 18:53.660
So well, let me ask you this, since you aren't a big VR person and I know that, um, what,

18:53.660 --> 18:57.260
what would you do if the next, like, cause you are a big fan of the portal series.

18:57.260 --> 19:01.020
Like I know Half Life, you're kind of ambivalent on like, you know, like Loki, like myself,

19:01.020 --> 19:03.260
but what if the next portal game was VR?

19:03.260 --> 19:04.260
I won't play it.

19:04.260 --> 19:05.260
You're not going to play it.

19:05.260 --> 19:06.260
Not at all.

19:06.300 --> 19:10.780
Do you want to watch play throughs or, or would you just kind of be like, I'm out playing

19:10.780 --> 19:15.100
at watching it played on a smaller screen with stuff around it may not make me a sick.

19:15.100 --> 19:19.980
That's why I watched the Duncan Rompa, um, thing and it was okay.

19:19.980 --> 19:27.340
Um, but I just, I don't want to, I, if it were on my head, I would be sick.

19:27.340 --> 19:32.340
It would screw with my eyes almost anytime I get a migraine and it just screws with my

19:32.340 --> 19:33.340
depth perception.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.060
I cannot do it.

19:35.060 --> 19:36.940
It's not a, it's not at this point.

19:36.940 --> 19:40.460
I won't do it because I don't want the consequences.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.460
Okay.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.740
So it's people say, Oh, I can't do it.

19:43.740 --> 19:49.340
Well, I can, I physically can put it on my head and watch it, but there will be consequences

19:49.340 --> 19:50.660
and the consequences aren't worth it.

19:50.660 --> 19:54.100
I remember you've done some minor VR things when you kind of like knew a lot about it

19:54.100 --> 19:55.100
in advance.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.940
Remember there was the last gamer X that we went to.

19:56.940 --> 20:01.640
I like that one little thing cause it didn't make me so sick, but then like something like

20:01.640 --> 20:06.600
five minutes after taking it off of my head, my head started to hurt and my eyes were like

20:06.600 --> 20:10.300
doing that weird kind of after image thing.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.940
So I mean, it was fun.

20:11.940 --> 20:12.940
I enjoyed it.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.800
It was a great experience and it was a neat little game.

20:14.800 --> 20:19.680
What about something like Beat Saber that you're kind of like, nothing's really moving.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.540
It's still trying to do a 3d environment that my eyes are trying to translate.

20:23.540 --> 20:27.600
And even for me, like I like VR, I appreciate VR, but like, remember I was trying to play

20:27.600 --> 20:29.200
Skyrim in VR.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.440
And I say trying cause I didn't get all the way through it, but I played a pretty good

20:32.440 --> 20:33.440
chunk of it.

20:33.440 --> 20:38.440
My problem was I could play for maybe like 45 minute clumps.

20:38.440 --> 20:42.060
And then like when I was getting to about 45 minutes, I was going, all right, I need

20:42.060 --> 20:43.060
a break.

20:43.060 --> 20:46.760
You know, I need to take this off my head and have a little bit of a break, which is

20:46.760 --> 20:47.760
probably a good thing.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.800
You're not supposed to do with any game hours and hours long session without taking a break.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.740
I saw someone play Minecraft for 24 hours in VR.

20:54.740 --> 20:58.680
That was, Oh God, that's no, that sounds terrible.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.040
Was he taking breaks?

21:00.040 --> 21:01.040
He did sleep.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.040
Okay.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.040
Well, he did play total.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.040
Yeah.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.040
So.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.040
All right.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.040
Anyway.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.800
Uh, and Bobby, Bobby reaffirming with as much as a VR fan and advocate as he is, he says,

21:10.800 --> 21:13.740
I'm won't ever try to convince dark soccer to do more VR.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.560
She tried it and felt ill effects.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.320
I'd rather her be healthy than play anything in VR.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.100
I look at it as a green eggs and ham kind of thing.

21:20.100 --> 21:23.120
You know, this is the whole story trying to convince him of the dude likes it, but the

21:23.120 --> 21:28.320
same thing you can't officially say that you don't like something until you've tried it.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.100
And like I said, I enjoyed the stuff that I've done.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.580
It's just not worth it to me.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.400
So you get it for other people.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.400
You just don't get it for yourself.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.400
Yeah.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.040
Other people, if you have fun with it, do it.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.040
Great.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.040
Good for you.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.040
Huzzah.

21:42.040 --> 21:45.740
You know, while you've got the thing on your head, I'll just go run off with all of your

21:45.740 --> 21:48.280
coffee and yay.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.080
All right.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
Anyway.

21:51.080 --> 21:56.680
And keep in mind, I had a virtual boy dear Lord.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.200
Well that's kind of different.

21:58.200 --> 22:02.160
I mean, for what it's worth, I can already see like where things are going because here

22:02.160 --> 22:09.240
we are getting closer and closer to March, 2020, March, 2020 is March, 2020 is going

22:09.240 --> 22:11.760
to be a hell of a gaming month.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.560
And I can tell you what's going to happen.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.080
Dark soccer is going to be over here.

22:15.080 --> 22:19.000
She's going to be playing her animal crossing brand new Loki or excuse me.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.920
Bobby Black Wolf is going to be all about this half-life Alex thing and talking all

22:22.920 --> 22:28.000
about it on his show in the VR myself, I will be consumed with the final fantasy seven remake

22:28.000 --> 22:30.400
and I'm going to be playing the shit out of that.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.640
And Loki will still not be working on his game.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.720
I work on my game every week.

22:35.720 --> 22:40.680
I will have, you know, if you give me proof that you finished it right before midnight

22:40.680 --> 22:45.920
on the first of the year, I'll buy you a piece of, I don't need you to buy me a pizza.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
They're like five bucks.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.640
I bought a pizza today.

22:48.640 --> 22:51.000
I'll make you a pizza.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Handmade everything.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Okay.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.480
So what I only made that joke cause a it's easy and B I don't know what your wife will

22:57.480 --> 22:58.960
do because she wants to hold on.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.920
I don't know what in March, 2020 is like calling you.

23:02.920 --> 23:07.680
Oh, nothing right now, but, uh, April, 2020 is cyber cyberpunk.

23:07.680 --> 23:14.120
So I I'm down with that, but, uh, cyberpunk, but I don't know more.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.760
I'm sure there's something, you know?

23:16.760 --> 23:17.760
Yeah.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.740
Here's hope of first saints row announcement.

23:19.740 --> 23:20.740
Come on.

23:20.740 --> 23:22.520
I was game awards right around the corner.

23:22.520 --> 23:27.000
Actually it did not make the show roll tonight, but there was a brief cause it was all the

23:27.040 --> 23:28.040
story was, was based.

23:28.040 --> 23:32.600
I almost put it in rapid fire, but, um, I didn't, uh, it was basically like saints row

23:32.600 --> 23:35.560
announcement is brewing for next year.

23:35.560 --> 23:39.600
Well they're working on, they just felt like, I don't know if we talked about it before,

23:39.600 --> 23:43.780
but I'll mention now since we brought it up, um, they're working on, they found the source

23:43.780 --> 23:45.400
code for saints row too.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.840
They thought that they had lost it for the longest time and they finally found it again.

23:49.840 --> 23:55.680
And so now they're able to go back and fix all the bugs that were in saints row too.

23:55.680 --> 24:03.520
And so now, um, they're just going through and just remastering that whole thing basically

24:03.520 --> 24:06.940
making it run better, which I am totally for.

24:06.940 --> 24:09.260
And it's going to be a free update if you have saints row too.

24:09.260 --> 24:14.800
So, um, more power to them, but like just that whole team that came out of, you know,

24:14.800 --> 24:19.160
the gentleman of the row and stuff, and now they're officially supported like modders

24:19.160 --> 24:20.160
for that.

24:20.160 --> 24:23.400
And actually I think he's on the development staff just, I, and I can't remember his goddamn

24:23.400 --> 24:29.720
screen name, but, um, just, uh, I'm very excited about that cause I do love saints

24:29.720 --> 24:30.720
row too.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.720
All right.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.000
This is moving away from the half life story.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
That's fine.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.520
At least they got the three, but, but then after that, you know, but then four was basically

24:40.520 --> 24:41.520
a mod for three.

24:41.520 --> 24:45.080
It was, yeah, it was cheap.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.080
It's all right.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.080
It's an okay game.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.800
I'm willing to go back to saying it's an Oak.

24:48.800 --> 24:55.200
It's not terrible game and you know, the, the gat one was okay.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.640
Really three fucked up by getting ready to get, and then they kind of tried to retcon

24:58.640 --> 25:04.520
that and now they've struck on the whole thing with leave gotten there.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.520
All right.

25:05.520 --> 25:09.320
Let's move on to our gaming weeks since we're, we were clearly not talking about half life

25:09.320 --> 25:10.320
Alex anymore.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.520
Uh, the types of video games we have been playing this week, dark soccer, how was your

25:13.520 --> 25:14.520
gaming week?

25:14.520 --> 25:19.080
Um, I started Pokemon sword because I want to surf etched.

25:19.080 --> 25:23.680
I fall in love with my Pika Corgi, which I always forget the name of every yamper yamper.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.680
Okay.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.920
I have a hard time when I give them nicknames because I forget what the fuck they're called

25:27.920 --> 25:29.840
if I give them a nickname.

25:29.840 --> 25:33.360
Although I've come up with nicknames for them in my head and Dan's been watching me play

25:33.360 --> 25:35.720
and he and I have just been laughing at shit.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.320
I don't give my nicknames for the record.

25:37.320 --> 25:41.560
In fact, there's actually an option where you can turn that question off and I did turn

25:41.560 --> 25:43.200
it off because I never renamed.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.640
I named Pika Corgi and I named my starter.

25:47.640 --> 25:52.920
I started off with the fire bunny who looks like a score bunny score bunny.

25:52.920 --> 25:57.280
I started off with score bunny who now looks like an angry youth with his hoodie.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.840
Um, actually looks like a Naruto character now, whatever he's called.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.600
Flame foot rabbit.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.280
I don't remember the evolutions left on my head.

26:05.280 --> 26:09.720
I named him Hikaru because I thought it fit and Dan's just been calling him Hikaru.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.520
He's like, what's up with your Hikaru bunny?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.400
I'm like, he's, he's cool, dude.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.120
Um, so I've been enjoying it.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.400
How much XP did you get?

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
Over 9,000.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
Whatever.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.200
That's like, that's Dragon Ball.

26:20.200 --> 26:25.400
That's like Vegeta, but any who's, I've been enjoying the game.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.400
It's been cute.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.360
I'm just on my way to the first gym.

26:28.360 --> 26:32.360
I mean like I just got through the caves and like there's, there's some fierce bitches

26:32.360 --> 26:33.360
in there.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.880
I need to, I've just been doing like crazy leveling.

26:34.880 --> 26:39.000
Like every time hop comes up, I'm like, dude, you don't want to step to this.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.040
And I'm like, I have just beaten that ass all over the place and I think his brother

26:44.040 --> 26:45.040
is stupid.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.040
Seriously.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.620
Like, can you be any more full of yourself with your stupid, ugly shorts and your white

26:49.620 --> 26:50.620
tights?

26:50.620 --> 26:53.360
I mean, seriously, dude, you are a fucking champion.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.120
You could afford some fashion sense.

26:55.120 --> 27:00.240
Did you love how like the very first town you go into the very like first store you're

27:00.240 --> 27:04.240
going to see is like a fashion outlet and it's like, let's play dress.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.360
You can spend all your money.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.000
You spent most of my money on clothes on dress up.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.520
And then I was basically like looking for trainer battles just so I could save up money

27:11.520 --> 27:12.900
to change my character's look.

27:12.900 --> 27:13.900
So I changed her hair.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.400
She's red head.

27:15.400 --> 27:19.000
It's it's like their hazel does not look like hazel, at least not like my hazel, but I have

27:19.000 --> 27:20.720
a lot of blue as well.

27:20.720 --> 27:25.420
So I really couldn't pick like the right color for like I spent the longest trying to match

27:25.420 --> 27:29.700
my eye color and I ended up going with green instead because it went better with the red.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.960
I'm pissed you can't have facial hair on your character.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.840
I mean, you are a prepubescent child.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.840
So what?

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
Sure.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.100
Let's go with realism there.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.400
But the giant fucking long cat.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
That's fine.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.200
That's I can have rainbows in my eyes.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.800
My eyes are literally that is kind of cool.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.680
I went for a little bit more.

27:50.680 --> 27:51.680
You know what?

27:51.680 --> 27:55.080
I because I'm you know, it's like I'm going to my hair, I'll do the bun or whatever.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.080
So it's cute.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.440
And I wear the jaunty beret.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.680
I'm laughing, though, at how they're kind of screwing up British slang, like they're

28:01.680 --> 28:03.900
just throwing it out all over the fucking place.

28:03.900 --> 28:07.440
And it's just like, I don't really think that's how people talk there.

28:07.440 --> 28:10.640
I know what you're basing it off of, but that's a little bit that's like that's fan

28:10.640 --> 28:14.200
fiction level of bad British speak.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.560
That's what I'm saying there.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.720
So other than that, I've been having a great time, like who's in my party?

28:18.720 --> 28:22.320
I like whatever that thing is that carries a log around, not the log.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.320
That's the koala thing.

28:23.320 --> 28:27.600
I'm talking about the the fighting Pokemon with the big yeah, I know what the four by

28:27.600 --> 28:28.600
four.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.600
Yeah.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.600
Yeah.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.080
I just want to I would cosplay that and just carry around a four by four and that Pokemon.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.240
Did you name that Pokemon splatter house?

28:35.240 --> 28:36.240
I didn't get one yet.

28:36.240 --> 28:41.480
You haven't gotten here yet, but at some point in the game, you're going to meet a character

28:41.480 --> 28:43.280
named Opal.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.080
That is like cosplay dream right there.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.720
Opal is fucking fierce.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.720
I like the goth girl.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.560
Oh, wait, is Opal in your game?

28:50.560 --> 28:51.560
No.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.560
Yeah.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.560
Opal is in both games.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.560
I like the goth girl.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.560
Some gym leaders aren't in both games.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.560
The goth girl.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.560
Yeah.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.560
Marnie.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.560
Yeah.

28:59.560 --> 29:00.560
She's cool.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.560
I'm like, that's like my aesthetic.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.560
Why didn't I do that?

29:02.560 --> 29:04.600
I hate the one guy who's like, I'm better than everybody because the chairman picked

29:04.600 --> 29:05.600
me baby.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
I think.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
Yeah.

29:07.600 --> 29:13.080
I'm like, um, dude, you need to, um, you know, use an enema.

29:13.080 --> 29:17.280
You need like an industrial size enema where they have to hang you from your feet.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.280
You need a colonic.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.280
That's it.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.280
You need a colonic.

29:20.280 --> 29:24.440
So what you're saying is like a fire hose imminent because he is so full of shit and

29:24.440 --> 29:25.960
up his own ass.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.960
Congratulations.

29:26.960 --> 29:31.600
You get to drink from the fire hose the other way.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.320
You found the marble in the oatmeal.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.840
Anyway, there's so many people that don't get these references.

29:37.840 --> 29:38.840
It's weird, Al.

29:38.840 --> 29:39.840
They should know it.

29:39.840 --> 29:45.440
But anyway, um, but at any rate, that's like, I just been coming up with like all of this.

29:45.440 --> 29:49.000
I'm just, I do nothing but talk shit about the characters when I play the game.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.520
And Dan is just like talking shit about them with me.

29:51.520 --> 29:55.600
So cause you know, normally if he's playing something, um, I'm his navigator.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.600
Like they're prepubescent.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.020
Jamie, do you always make fun of children?

29:59.020 --> 30:00.020
He's tall.

30:00.020 --> 30:01.020
So he's at least pubescent.

30:01.060 --> 30:05.500
So anyway, because normally when Dan plays something, I'm his navigator, I say, Hey,

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
did you see that?

30:06.500 --> 30:09.180
And Dan will look out for like shiny things for me.

30:09.180 --> 30:10.660
And look, that's a sparkle thing.

30:10.660 --> 30:14.100
And he apparently really like zigzag zoon.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.100
He calls...

30:15.100 --> 30:16.780
Who they changed for the gala region.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.700
Yeah, it's like white and white, like black and white.

30:18.700 --> 30:19.700
It's not bad.

30:19.700 --> 30:20.700
I was like, that doesn't look like...

30:20.700 --> 30:23.180
And then he like went up looking at, well, when you're on the last thing, you should

30:23.180 --> 30:26.100
have a Gyarados and you should have this and this and Dan's like started like being

30:26.100 --> 30:27.100
my coach.

30:27.100 --> 30:29.440
Like he, he's my trainer coach.

30:29.440 --> 30:33.440
I really wish I could change the trainer outfits because they're fucking terrible.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.440
You can later.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.440
Good.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
Because they're fucking terrible.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
Yeah.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.800
Um, and at any rate though, it's just like, I'm having fun, but I'm really having fun

30:40.800 --> 30:41.800
shit talking it.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.360
Now, what number did you pick for your uniform?

30:44.360 --> 30:48.040
Did you pick 666, 69 or 420?

30:48.040 --> 30:49.040
808.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.040
Okay.

30:50.040 --> 30:57.200
It just like my two, my favorite number is eight and I like most multiples of two.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.600
I do not like six as much.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.440
And it's for me, it actually is very much an ass.

31:00.440 --> 31:05.640
We think I've been this way since I was little, I like things in twos, fours and eights.

31:05.640 --> 31:09.120
So I also love the number zero because it's nothing.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.300
It's an infinite number.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.160
It's absolute nothing.

31:12.160 --> 31:15.320
So I'd picked my favorite combination of numbers, 808.

31:15.320 --> 31:21.600
808 makes me think Bob because 8008 is boob on a calculator.

31:21.600 --> 31:22.600
You know what?

31:22.600 --> 31:26.600
When I forget to name, uh, what to name a hard drive, I call it Bob five, three, one

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
8008.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
I have a hard drive named Bob.

31:28.600 --> 31:40.000
The magic number five, three, one, eight, oh, wait, anyway, if that's, if that's it

31:40.000 --> 31:45.160
for your gaming week and besides, yeah, it has to be, uh, three digits, but no, I wanted,

31:45.160 --> 31:46.160
I wanted 808.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.160
It works and I'm enjoying, it's fun.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.520
It's the first time I've played a Pokemon game that I've actually really enjoyed myself

31:52.520 --> 31:53.520
in a while.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.520
All right.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.520
Anything else for your gaming week?

31:56.520 --> 32:04.120
Um, idle pouring, um, uh, Pokemon go, Harry Potter.

32:04.120 --> 32:07.080
Um, I did get, um, what the golf.

32:07.080 --> 32:11.280
So I am just when I get all this shit out of the way, it's just re I've got a lot of

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
baking to do.

32:12.280 --> 32:17.160
I'm hardly gonna have time to play anything, but it'll, it'll be good.

32:17.160 --> 32:22.920
Um, I'll, I'll be playing more stuff once the stupid idiot holidays are over and it's

32:22.920 --> 32:24.280
not fucking Christmas yet.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.760
So put your shit away.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.720
No, no, uh, putting up Christmas until the day after Thanksgiving.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.720
And then it's Hanukkah.

32:29.720 --> 32:32.680
I already got latke mix and then I realized I had four more boxes of latke mix.

32:32.680 --> 32:34.760
I think we still have latke mix from last year.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.400
So I'm going to be coming over here.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.140
Do not bring new latke mix.

32:38.140 --> 32:39.140
We have plenty.

32:39.140 --> 32:40.140
I'll cook all of it.

32:40.140 --> 32:42.120
You'll just have a pile of latkes.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
All right.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
All right.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.800
Uh, Loki, did you play a lot of games this week?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.600
No, I did not.

32:48.600 --> 32:53.120
I played a little bit of Minecraft earth, so I've just been going through that.

32:53.160 --> 32:58.200
I did a few more of the adventures the other day, um, and I've had some different ones.

32:58.200 --> 33:02.000
So there's one that's actually like a red stone puzzle, which was kind of neat.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.160
Um, I just kept feeling though, cause especially after that one where I'm like just digging

33:06.160 --> 33:09.920
in the hole after I killed the skeletons and then all of a sudden skeletons come out of

33:09.920 --> 33:13.720
the side because they spawned up top for no reason.

33:13.720 --> 33:17.680
Uh, I'm still worried every time I do one of these things that there's skeletons are

33:17.680 --> 33:20.360
going to come and just shoot me with some arrows and kill me.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.640
And then I'm going to lose everything that I just got.

33:22.640 --> 33:26.280
So that's kind of annoying, but, uh, it's all right.

33:26.280 --> 33:31.140
I didn't play it all week long because I'm kind of getting bored with it already cause

33:31.140 --> 33:32.260
there's not a lot to do.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.460
They have been updating it though.

33:33.460 --> 33:38.640
So I noticed that there's now, um, seeds in there, so I guess you can plant those just

33:38.640 --> 33:39.840
like you can in a normal game.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.280
And then they have dyes now that they've added in.

33:42.280 --> 33:46.320
And so they're updating and it's just, um, still can't do anything with meat.

33:46.320 --> 33:50.200
Have a bunch of meat I'm sitting on, but I don't know.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.280
And then of course, you know, I was fighting the one skeleton and they're pissing me off.

33:53.280 --> 33:58.760
So I threw some TNT down there and blew them up and that worked out pretty well.

33:58.760 --> 34:05.560
I played a little Pokemon Go and, uh, worked on my game some, I started working on the

34:05.560 --> 34:07.440
procedural generation stuff on that.

34:07.440 --> 34:13.160
So I have to, uh, develop something that I want to do for, uh, procedural maze generation

34:13.160 --> 34:15.320
to get the level structure right.

34:15.320 --> 34:21.360
And then once I get that done, then it's going to be random room generation and random, uh,

34:21.360 --> 34:23.200
spawn wave generation.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.800
So that's what I've been working on.

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
And what else?

34:26.800 --> 34:32.600
Uh, I'm sure I play a little bit of what the golf in there as well and yeah, that's it.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
All right.

34:33.600 --> 34:38.280
Um, my gaming week, um, a lot of the same old, same olds, uh, continuing on Final Fantasy

34:38.280 --> 34:42.120
14, of course, uh, was helping a friend of mine reach level 80 this week.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
So that's exciting.

34:43.120 --> 34:48.200
Uh, and then, um, I was playing all the GPS games, all of them playing a little bit of

34:48.200 --> 34:51.440
Pokemon Go, probably that one, the least, uh, just because I didn't bother with the

34:51.440 --> 34:52.440
team rocket event today.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.800
I just haven't, I've really missed a lot of that.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.960
And I, oh, there was an event today, there was an event today and there's a whole, like

34:57.960 --> 35:02.200
you're supposed to fight Giovanni to get the shadow, uh, Articuno, I think it is.

35:02.200 --> 35:06.360
And you know, all, but I'm just kinda like, I, I I'm kinda cutting that part out.

35:06.360 --> 35:09.200
It's like, I don't, I don't have the time to go run around and find those and whatever,

35:09.200 --> 35:11.660
because I'm too busy playing the other GPS games.

35:11.660 --> 35:15.380
So I play, um, the Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, there's been an event going on there.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.680
So I've been, you know, kind of, you know, getting the traces, uh, and then I really

35:18.680 --> 35:24.260
went hard on Ingress this last week because, uh, there was the double AP, uh, event that

35:24.260 --> 35:26.940
happened in Ingress and it just ended, uh, on Friday.

35:26.940 --> 35:28.500
So, but I made the most of it.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.780
I was out doing little bits of fielding every day.

35:31.780 --> 35:36.060
And have you leveled back up to 16 again, not all the way to 16, I'm back to level 14.

35:36.060 --> 35:38.180
So I just dinged 14 during the double AP.

35:38.220 --> 35:42.180
Have they still figured out what you get for doing that?

35:42.180 --> 35:44.220
No, they haven't, which is getting more and more frustrating.

35:44.220 --> 35:47.060
Like, has it been like a year since they announced you can do it?

35:47.060 --> 35:49.580
Yeah, Ingress is in a really rough place right now.

35:49.580 --> 35:50.580
It's it's hard.

35:50.580 --> 35:54.500
And you know, it's, you're watching the development team, like, you know, they're on the forums

35:54.500 --> 35:58.980
and stuff saying, wow, we're trying, but I, if I feel like they don't have enough resources,

35:58.980 --> 36:03.320
like it's very obvious, Pokemon goes the cash cow, that's where all the resources go.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.740
And there's probably like a team of six people in the corner that are like the Ingress team

36:06.740 --> 36:07.740
and God bless them.

36:07.740 --> 36:12.060
I don't know what they can, but it's just not enough to stay on top of the very vocal,

36:12.060 --> 36:13.540
very loud player base.

36:13.540 --> 36:16.260
So you know what they need to do now?

36:16.260 --> 36:18.300
So release another goddamn AR game.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.300
Yeah, right.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.300
Oh, which yeah.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.180
Also, I know that was announced.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.700
So Niantic is making a Catan game.

36:24.700 --> 36:25.700
Yeah.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.780
That's the next game they're doing is Catan.

36:28.780 --> 36:34.300
I don't remember the subtitle, but it is Catan World Explorers, Catan World Explorers.

36:34.300 --> 36:39.540
So it is basically the world's largest game of Settlers of Catan played on the real world,

36:39.540 --> 36:43.140
which actually like as much as I, you know, every time Niantic has announced something

36:43.140 --> 36:45.100
new, I've kind of done this, like, what the fuck?

36:45.100 --> 36:48.820
Like when, when they announced Pokemon Go as their next thing, you know, after, because

36:48.820 --> 36:53.060
I had played Niantic, or excuse me, I had played Ingress, I knew of Niantic for many

36:53.060 --> 36:54.060
years.

36:54.060 --> 36:56.860
So when they announced that Pokemon Go is their next thing, I was like, what the fuck?

36:56.860 --> 37:02.020
Like, you know, but it turned out to be a rough start, but then the game got really

37:02.020 --> 37:03.020
good.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.020
Right.

37:04.740 --> 37:07.700
And, you know, Harry Potter Wizards Unite isn't really a night.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.660
It's more a Warner Brothers game, but you know, it's happy as whatever.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.300
So that kind of, you know, it exists.

37:12.300 --> 37:13.300
It's fine.

37:13.300 --> 37:16.740
I think, I think that actually, I would say the Harry Potter game, as much as I don't

37:16.740 --> 37:21.000
think the traces are as exciting as like catching the cute Pokemon, I would say the Harry Potter

37:21.000 --> 37:26.460
game has done a very good job of like communicating with their audience, admitting when they make

37:26.460 --> 37:30.900
fuck ups, being very good about what's coming out to the game, making regular updates to

37:30.900 --> 37:31.900
the game.

37:32.100 --> 37:36.860
In Harry Potter, if you weren't aware, that just released like three days ago.

37:36.860 --> 37:37.860
I haven't played Harry.

37:37.860 --> 37:41.340
I think I installed Harry Potter, but for those of you that may still have it lurking

37:41.340 --> 37:45.580
on your phone, you can now send gifts to people, which is great because that helps with the

37:45.580 --> 37:47.220
spell energy issue.

37:47.220 --> 37:51.020
So if somebody goes to an inn, they can send you a gift that's like two spell energy, which

37:51.020 --> 37:53.460
doesn't sound like a lot, but you can open 10 gifts a day.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.620
That's like 20 spell energy at something to work with.

37:55.620 --> 37:57.420
So it's kind of neat.

37:57.420 --> 38:00.460
Helps a little bit with that kind of like how Pokemon gifting kind of helps with being

38:00.500 --> 38:02.220
able to send like Pokeballs and stuff to people.

38:02.220 --> 38:07.540
I just, I just, I don't know, like, cause you know, I know that they're struggling with

38:07.540 --> 38:12.140
making updates to stuff and it's like really adding a fourth one is a good idea at this

38:12.140 --> 38:13.140
point.

38:13.140 --> 38:14.140
Yeah.

38:14.140 --> 38:18.980
So anyway, um, yeah, I, I, I'm curious to see what the Catan thing works out.

38:18.980 --> 38:25.100
I just, I feel like Ingress is not in a great place and if Niantic overall does not show

38:25.100 --> 38:30.740
that game some TLC, I mean, they, I, they really, really botched the transition to Prime.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.100
There's no nice way to put it.

38:32.100 --> 38:35.140
They promised parody that they didn't deliver on.

38:35.140 --> 38:39.320
And I think, you know, when I say parody, the features might be there, but what's not

38:39.320 --> 38:42.100
there is the speed and the convenience.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.420
And I think that's, what's throwing a lot of the player base off.

38:44.420 --> 38:48.800
Like I, there's a lot that I like about Prime, don't get me wrong, but like, I don't like

38:48.800 --> 38:54.100
the fact that it takes like, it takes easily three times as long to start up as the other

38:54.100 --> 38:56.180
Ingress, uh, the original client did.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.940
And heaven forbid if you switched to something in the background and then you got to go back

38:58.940 --> 39:01.120
to Prime and then it's got to start all over again.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.540
So it's just, it's really irritating.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.360
Also, there's still a pay to win stuff in there too, which is kinda, and it's just,

39:06.360 --> 39:09.700
you know, it's been the same fucking game for how many years.

39:09.700 --> 39:13.740
Um, it would be nice if they'd mix it up a little bit and maybe this week you're competing

39:13.740 --> 39:18.500
for unique portals or this week is about banners or, you know, something different, you know,

39:18.500 --> 39:22.860
like, and not just throwing the same field in the same part of town over and over and

39:22.860 --> 39:25.660
over again to win a cycle.

39:25.660 --> 39:29.020
You know, it's just that aspect of the game is getting really boring.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.860
So anyway, that's why I kind of quit playing.

39:31.860 --> 39:32.860
I know.

39:32.860 --> 39:33.860
It's just, they need more.

39:33.860 --> 39:37.860
I think that people, cause especially as the game has been losing a lot of its regular

39:37.860 --> 39:41.460
players because of the parody thing, it would just be nice if there was more that you could

39:41.460 --> 39:44.500
do kind of as an individual, if that makes sense.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.500
Yeah.

39:45.500 --> 39:46.500
I don't know.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.660
Like I know a lot of people that have just made it an individual game at this point.

39:48.660 --> 39:52.300
Like it's just, Oh, I'm going to go get the banners or I'm just, you know, micro fielding

39:52.300 --> 39:58.180
this little park or whatever it is, you know, it's just kind of, I don't know, anyway.

39:58.180 --> 40:02.140
Other games I've been playing this week because what I've been playing a lot, a lot, a lot

40:02.140 --> 40:04.140
is the same game I talked about last week.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.580
That's Pokemon Shield.

40:05.580 --> 40:09.760
I've been playing enough Pokemon Shield where I am further in Pokemon Shield than I've ever

40:09.760 --> 40:11.660
gotten in a Pokemon game ever.

40:11.660 --> 40:16.660
I am six gym badges in and I think the furthest I ever got, I think I got four or five gym

40:16.660 --> 40:19.320
badges in Sun and Moon.

40:19.320 --> 40:25.840
So I'm up to six badges in Pokemon Shield and I think I'm going to see it through to

40:25.840 --> 40:26.840
the end.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.240
I really do.

40:28.240 --> 40:32.460
Because there's just so much about this particular gen that I'm liking.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.960
And I got to say, I think one of the biggest things for me are those Dynamax raids.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.400
Like they're so cool.

40:37.400 --> 40:42.040
And what I love about it is that it gives an alternative for how to level your characters

40:42.040 --> 40:44.400
as opposed to just grinding.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.720
Like I don't feel like I have to go grind, grind, grind, kill two Pokemon, run back and

40:48.720 --> 40:49.720
heal.

40:49.720 --> 40:50.720
Kill two more Pokemon, run back and heal.

40:50.720 --> 40:51.840
Like I don't feel like I have to do that.

40:51.840 --> 40:57.960
I can just do some Dynamax raids, get some candy and level up my Pokemon that way and

40:57.960 --> 41:03.000
then focus on the gym battles, which the gym battles are really well done.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.720
I love the gym battles in this series.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.380
Like the music is great.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.200
The fact that they incorporate this whole stadium into it is awesome.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.040
The Dynamaxing during the gym battles is really cool.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.640
Like they did such a bang up job with the presentation in that regard.

41:15.640 --> 41:20.160
And I think also honestly for me, and I know I'm the opposite of a lot of people, a lot

41:20.160 --> 41:22.720
of people love that convenience of gaming on the go.

41:22.720 --> 41:28.440
Me, I love playing video games on my TV, big, lying on my couch, you know, and I have it

41:28.440 --> 41:30.640
all on the big noise and stuff.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.640
I love playing on my TV.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.800
And I think just having that all on my TV, even though ironically right now the Switch

41:35.800 --> 41:38.800
is right here in front of me and I could play it right here during the show if I wanted

41:38.800 --> 41:42.700
to, although I'm trying to focus on doing a show, I love being able to dock it and play

41:42.700 --> 41:43.700
on the TV.

41:43.700 --> 41:46.940
Switch is just a great platform for it.

41:46.940 --> 41:50.260
So yeah, I'm trying to make my way to the seventh gym right now.

41:50.260 --> 41:54.720
Just kind of got sidetracked with some rating as I usually do, because now I'm having to

41:54.720 --> 41:56.300
sub in the right Pokemon.

41:56.300 --> 42:00.080
So the next gym I'm going to is a dark type gym.

42:00.080 --> 42:02.220
So I need some fighting Pokemon.

42:02.220 --> 42:08.340
I mean, I can have, what is it, bug, fighting, or there's one other typing I'm forgetting

42:08.340 --> 42:09.340
in the moment.

42:09.340 --> 42:10.700
I'm sure somebody in chat is screaming it.

42:10.700 --> 42:17.700
But I have my little Ninjask, which is my final swipe character, because it's the only

42:17.700 --> 42:19.700
one I have that has final swipe.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.840
And she also does a bug move.

42:21.840 --> 42:22.840
So I have that.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.260
But then I had to sub in my party.

42:24.260 --> 42:28.040
Now I have a Bewear, because I have one of those little pink bears, so they're a fighting

42:28.040 --> 42:29.040
type.

42:29.040 --> 42:33.920
And then a Hitmonlee I have in my party as well, so another fighting type.

42:33.920 --> 42:38.340
So I have those to go to the next gym with.

42:38.340 --> 42:40.420
But you know what else is kind of nice?

42:40.420 --> 42:46.940
I like the big open wild area, even though it runs like shit on the Switch when you're

42:46.940 --> 42:51.640
online and the weather effects and everything, like the frame rate gets really bad.

42:51.640 --> 42:55.020
It's one of those things where it's like, this is not impressive Nintendo technology

42:55.020 --> 42:56.500
right here.

42:56.500 --> 43:01.780
But as a game concept, I like it actually, because it kind of sets this precedent early

43:01.780 --> 43:07.260
on that it's like, hey, you're not going to be able to catch everything.

43:07.260 --> 43:12.460
And if you do miss things, they're probably here in this gigantic wild area.

43:12.460 --> 43:14.520
So go forth and play the story.

43:14.520 --> 43:18.020
You can always come back here and catch all these Pokemon at the end.

43:18.020 --> 43:22.700
That's like the feeling I get, which to be fair, most Pokemon games, you can just play

43:22.700 --> 43:25.760
straight through the story and then go back and get all the Pokemon you missed.

43:25.760 --> 43:30.360
But there's something about that kind of setup where I just, I don't feel the need to catch

43:30.360 --> 43:32.900
every Pokemon on every route along the way.

43:32.900 --> 43:36.940
And I can just focus on trying to get through the story, leveling the right Pokemon in my

43:36.940 --> 43:39.640
party to do it in that aspect of the game.

43:39.640 --> 43:40.820
And it's worked for me.

43:40.820 --> 43:45.540
And I've gotten further in this game than I ever have in a Pokemon game.

43:45.540 --> 43:50.180
So I think that goes and just the quality of life stuff, man, having access to the Pokemon

43:50.180 --> 43:54.100
boxes anywhere without having to be at a computer and things like that, like it goes a long

43:54.100 --> 43:55.100
way.

43:55.100 --> 43:59.540
Like they've done, they've done a really good job with the mainframe basically of this Pokemon

43:59.540 --> 44:00.540
game.

44:00.540 --> 44:03.580
I understand the whole DEXIT thing still bothers a lot of people.

44:03.580 --> 44:06.420
I think that would be one of those things where like, it would be the whipped cream

44:06.420 --> 44:11.700
and cherry on top if, when you beat this game, then all of the Pokemon's ever showed

44:11.700 --> 44:14.260
up in the game, but it's not.

44:14.260 --> 44:15.340
And that's okay.

44:15.340 --> 44:17.220
It's still a damn good piece of pie.

44:17.220 --> 44:20.740
You know, it's always, there's always a chance for updates later on.

44:20.740 --> 44:22.220
I'm not going to hedge my bets on it.

44:22.220 --> 44:25.940
In fact, I think they've been pretty clear in coming out and saying, don't count on it.

44:25.940 --> 44:29.380
And that's, that's, that's for the third version, that's going to have both sword and shield

44:29.380 --> 44:34.780
together and Pokemon gun, Pokemon gun, or I think that the popular and most likely would

44:34.780 --> 44:36.900
be Pokemon armor.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.020
So, but we'll see.

44:39.020 --> 44:40.020
I don't, I don't know.

44:40.020 --> 44:44.580
I mean, I, I don't know, like, and I kind of want to see him do another Pokemon game,

44:44.580 --> 44:47.660
but then you're like, gen nine will be like four years away.

44:47.660 --> 44:48.660
So I don't know.

44:48.660 --> 44:49.660
We'll see.

44:49.660 --> 44:52.780
But I do a remake of two, let's go, whatever.

44:52.780 --> 44:54.220
Yeah, I would see more.

44:54.220 --> 44:55.220
Okay.

44:55.220 --> 44:58.320
So Kaijuna says, I still haven't beat my copies of ultra sun and moon.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.420
So yeah, this is another thing that tends to happen.

45:00.420 --> 45:03.820
So you get ultra sun and moon, you had black two and white two, right?

45:03.820 --> 45:06.380
There was never a, what are those?

45:06.380 --> 45:10.820
I mean, sequels in the same universe, same universe, same rosters, basically.

45:10.820 --> 45:15.420
They're just different stories, but I could see where maybe there will be a sword to,

45:15.420 --> 45:19.360
or, you know, ancient sword and ancient sealed or whatever they're, I don't know.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.220
They could do a lot of things with it, but I could see something where they could put

45:22.220 --> 45:27.540
out a sword and shield sequel that will expand on the decks, I suppose.

45:27.540 --> 45:32.220
But I don't think the decks thing is like a deal breaker at the end of the day.

45:32.220 --> 45:36.860
Like I can see why people are like hissy about it, but I also see a lot of criticisms

45:36.860 --> 45:41.880
that are like, this Pokemon game sucks because it's the shortest one.

45:41.880 --> 45:44.100
But then I'm like, okay.

45:44.100 --> 45:49.820
But when I think about how many hours of Pokemon red and blue and yellow are in a fucking cave

45:49.820 --> 45:53.700
running into random encounters over and over that you just want to run from anyway, because

45:53.700 --> 45:58.980
you're trying to get to this next area and like how much of it is just grinding and grinding.

45:58.980 --> 46:03.140
Like I kind of think the comparison is a little unfair because I think those numbers in the

46:03.140 --> 46:10.100
older Pokemon games are a little bit artificially raised because it's grinding.

46:10.100 --> 46:14.420
I know that's a hot take some of you aren't going to like, but that's the reality.

46:14.420 --> 46:19.820
Like I feel like, for me, my reality, and I feel like in Pokemon sword and shield, like

46:19.820 --> 46:21.380
I'm always moving.

46:21.380 --> 46:22.620
I'm moving in this story.

46:22.620 --> 46:23.780
I'm progressing.

46:23.780 --> 46:26.220
I'm not having to just sit there and grind shit.

46:26.220 --> 46:29.660
And even if I am doing like the Dynamax raids, it's kind of fun and different and online

46:29.660 --> 46:30.660
and stuff.

46:30.660 --> 46:36.900
So anyway, I do feel like the Dynamax raids was something that they took from Pokemon

46:36.900 --> 46:38.140
Go.

46:38.140 --> 46:40.420
And it's like, it's a great addition to the game.

46:40.420 --> 46:43.620
So it's amazing how the games are kind of helping each other like that.

46:43.620 --> 46:48.500
So anyway, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf says I would rather play a 10 hour game where I'm always

46:48.500 --> 46:52.780
moving forward than a 60 hour game with 50 hours of grinding.

46:52.780 --> 46:53.780
Yes.

46:53.780 --> 46:55.460
Print that, put it on the back of the box.

46:55.460 --> 46:56.460
That is how I feel.

46:56.460 --> 46:57.460
Absolutely.

46:57.460 --> 46:58.460
Let's see.

46:58.460 --> 46:59.460
Other comments here.

46:59.460 --> 47:03.900
Act Def says it is Pokemon, but most people have the dumb idea that it's only looking

47:03.900 --> 47:06.340
at your phone and throwing balls at everything that pops up.

47:06.340 --> 47:10.740
Pokemon Go has raid battles, has community events, it has PVP and other stuff.

47:10.740 --> 47:13.780
Yeah, I guess a Go topic came up in chat.

47:13.780 --> 47:19.360
Yeah, I love Pokemon Go as well, but it's a different Pokemon experience.

47:19.360 --> 47:23.620
That's the interesting thing about this franchise is it's been imagined in all these different

47:23.620 --> 47:24.620
ways.

47:24.620 --> 47:28.700
I mean, Pokemon Puzzle League, am I right?

47:28.700 --> 47:32.580
That's another way that the Pokemon franchise has been imagined.

47:32.580 --> 47:33.580
So anyway.

47:33.580 --> 47:34.580
All right.

47:34.580 --> 47:38.620
I don't think I have anything else to share for my gaming week.

47:38.620 --> 47:41.020
So that's it.

47:41.020 --> 47:42.020
I guess we will move on.

47:42.020 --> 47:45.260
We're going to get to the headlines for the week and talk about what is going on in the

47:45.260 --> 47:46.260
gaming world.

47:46.260 --> 47:48.020
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

47:48.020 --> 47:49.020
Yes.

47:49.020 --> 47:57.620
It's rumored that Amazon is going to enter the cloud streaming service for games next

47:57.620 --> 47:58.620
year.

47:58.620 --> 48:02.380
So, of course, Amazon has the Amazon Web Service.

48:02.380 --> 48:10.660
That's a pretty big source for a lot of web infrastructure and basically really powerful

48:10.660 --> 48:12.340
for something like this.

48:12.340 --> 48:15.860
And it only makes sense that they would try to leverage that, especially with their other

48:15.860 --> 48:22.940
streaming services that they have and Prime to try to get that all integrated.

48:22.940 --> 48:28.140
I could see almost like now that they own Twitch integration with that, much like you

48:28.140 --> 48:33.220
have with YouTube integration with Google Stadia.

48:33.220 --> 48:40.060
My question would be is what are they going to do to try to differentiate themselves from

48:40.060 --> 48:46.740
what Google's done and maybe being that they would be launching at least a year from now,

48:46.740 --> 48:51.940
looking at what they can do differently so that they don't kind of flop like Stadia is?

48:51.940 --> 48:52.940
Well, Amazon.

48:52.940 --> 48:58.500
Well, I think it's too early to call Stadia a flop, not to derail the topic at hand, but

48:58.500 --> 49:02.680
I think and I will say this coming up later in the show, our voiceover guy, Jason, since

49:02.680 --> 49:06.420
none of us picked up Stadia early, but Jason, our voiceover guy did.

49:06.420 --> 49:10.900
So he has a nice little package you put together for the break tonight that he's going to talk

49:10.900 --> 49:12.340
about his impressions on Stadia.

49:12.340 --> 49:15.700
So I'm really excited to hear it because I actually haven't heard the whole thing myself.

49:15.700 --> 49:19.180
I only heard like the first minute when I was setting up for the show tonight, but I

49:19.180 --> 49:20.340
didn't have time to listen to the whole thing.

49:20.340 --> 49:24.500
So I'm excited to hear his impressions of Stadia, but I think it's too early to call

49:24.500 --> 49:32.100
Stadia a flop because even though right now the early adopters of Stadia had to buy this

49:32.100 --> 49:36.300
whole thing, remember that Stadia's vision is to be a free thing.

49:36.300 --> 49:39.680
It is something that you'll be able to open up your Chromebook and you just launch Chrome

49:39.680 --> 49:42.100
and you can run Stadia within the browser.

49:42.100 --> 49:45.980
I think that's going to be the true test of, is there a demand for something like this

49:45.980 --> 49:48.620
when they open it up to the wider market?

49:48.620 --> 49:52.700
I think right now, honestly, truly people paid the beta test it.

49:52.700 --> 49:55.340
So I hope you guys are enjoying that beta test.

49:55.340 --> 49:56.340
That's what being an early adopter is.

49:56.340 --> 50:00.700
But the problem I see with this though right now is that it's not really something I think

50:00.700 --> 50:08.620
like, you know, games pass is like a better option than Stadia is because it doesn't make

50:08.620 --> 50:09.620
sense.

50:09.620 --> 50:12.100
Like, Oh, I get it's a cloud streaming service, but you got to buy everything.

50:12.100 --> 50:15.800
And a lot of this stuff is really old and it's just, I got you the pricing model is

50:15.800 --> 50:16.800
it doesn't make any sense.

50:16.800 --> 50:21.600
Like if they have like, Hey, you pay $10 a month and you get access to all of these games

50:21.600 --> 50:25.620
in this library and you could stream them all and play them more like a PlayStation

50:25.620 --> 50:27.880
now, then that would make more sense to me.

50:27.880 --> 50:31.760
But the way that they've done it right now, not really making any sense.

50:31.760 --> 50:35.720
Well, let me steer the car back to the topic of hands as we are talking about Amazon potentially

50:35.720 --> 50:36.720
entering this space.

50:36.720 --> 50:41.680
We all know that Amazon has their Amazon prime, that they've leveraged all these different

50:41.680 --> 50:44.920
services that Amazon has onto this Amazon prime.

50:44.920 --> 50:49.300
It would seem logical, though nothing is certain until they announce something, it would seem

50:49.300 --> 50:52.440
logical that if Amazon were to enter this space, it's very possible they could tie it

50:52.440 --> 50:56.800
to a prime membership, or at least maybe some games you would buy, but there will be some

50:56.800 --> 51:00.680
things that would be included as part of your prime membership.

51:00.680 --> 51:02.680
Because that is, you know, Amazon makes a lot of money on that prime.

51:02.680 --> 51:05.440
Or if you have your Twitch library that you could stream stuff.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.440
Potentially.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.440
I mean, we don't know.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.440
There's so much to be determined.

51:08.440 --> 51:13.600
We do know, and sometimes forget, Amazon's been working in the gaming space for quite

51:13.600 --> 51:14.600
some time.

51:14.600 --> 51:18.120
They've been working on that, what that MMO that they've been developing is they bought

51:18.120 --> 51:19.120
that one developer.

51:19.120 --> 51:23.640
And there was, I remember there was like some videos and things that were put out a while

51:23.640 --> 51:24.640
ago.

51:24.640 --> 51:26.760
I don't remember the name of it, but maybe somebody in chat remembers.

51:26.760 --> 51:30.440
Amazon's working on something big within their own studios.

51:30.440 --> 51:34.280
It's just that we don't know what the plan is for them to release it.

51:34.280 --> 51:37.080
Are they just going to release it as something they sell on the Twitch app?

51:37.080 --> 51:41.560
I don't know, but this would be a pretty big, if Amazon does want to enter the space, they

51:41.560 --> 51:45.280
may have a bang up MMO exclusive game that they want to put in that.

51:45.280 --> 51:46.800
So who knows?

51:46.800 --> 51:47.800
New World.

51:47.800 --> 51:48.800
Thank you, Quest Buster.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.200
New World is the MMO that they're working on.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.920
So there you go.

51:52.920 --> 51:55.640
And then Lumberyard, says Bobby Black Wolf.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.360
But is that the engine?

51:57.360 --> 51:58.360
That's their engine.

51:58.360 --> 52:02.320
I thought that they had, I wasn't sure if they were still working on it because I thought

52:02.320 --> 52:08.360
that they were doing some other stuff for, I guess there's some games, I see Star Citizen

52:08.360 --> 52:12.160
uses Lumberyard and Crucible and New World.

52:12.160 --> 52:16.880
So certainly, I mean, you know, I know some people don't like to talk about rumors and

52:16.880 --> 52:22.360
things, but I think this certainly, I mean, the things that aren't a rumor, we know that

52:22.360 --> 52:24.840
Amazon has been working on gaming.

52:24.840 --> 52:27.800
They just haven't done anything as far as releasing it yet.

52:27.800 --> 52:28.800
Amazon owns Twitch.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.700
They bought Twitch for a reason.

52:30.700 --> 52:33.680
They have a really great gaming community within Twitch.

52:33.680 --> 52:38.100
If they were to launch something like this and tie it to Twitch, it would probably get

52:38.100 --> 52:41.040
some eyes on it because of the fact that they're behind Twitch.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.440
You know, those things are facts.

52:42.440 --> 52:48.160
So you feel like that, oh, there's this interesting little hole in the puzzle where something

52:48.160 --> 52:49.920
could nicely fit.

52:49.920 --> 52:54.000
And this does seem like a logical, I feel like five years ago on the show, the talk

52:54.000 --> 52:56.240
was Amazon's going to put out a console.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.240
And then that died.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.240
You remember the rumors?

52:58.240 --> 53:02.120
Amazon's going to put out a console because I knew there was, uh, they were built it into

53:02.120 --> 53:04.320
fire or whatever the fire stick and that stuff.

53:04.320 --> 53:09.100
I mean, they could, but I don't, I don't think, I don't think Amazon's going to put out a

53:09.100 --> 53:10.100
console at this point.

53:10.100 --> 53:15.560
I think it's this, I think now it's, oh, this is where things are going is the cloud service.

53:15.560 --> 53:21.600
Hey, AWS, we got a big cloud that we operate and can deliver that type of bandwidth.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.960
Let's do it.

53:22.960 --> 53:27.440
But Amazon is probably taking a damn good look at what's happening with Stadia right

53:27.440 --> 53:33.760
now and thinking about a lot of that because I, they would be fools over at Amazon to not

53:33.760 --> 53:38.560
see all this complaining about bandwidth that people are having about Stadia right now,

53:38.560 --> 53:41.380
which continues to be kind of the biggest complaint.

53:41.380 --> 53:44.840
So an Amazon system really is going to have to answer that question.

53:44.840 --> 53:47.640
What are they going to do about bandwidth?

53:47.640 --> 53:48.640
Who knows?

53:48.640 --> 53:50.960
And I don't, I don't know if it's an easy answer.

53:50.960 --> 54:00.240
So, so anyway, Mr. Smoosh smells, a dark soccer is a dinner and he's putting on a show.

54:00.240 --> 54:03.640
Oh, he's, he's, I think stalking off to check his own.

54:03.640 --> 54:04.640
Yeah.

54:04.640 --> 54:07.460
What he doesn't, he was asleep when the food dispenser went off earlier.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.960
So he's going to be in for a real treat when he walks over there.

54:09.960 --> 54:13.840
And I'm going to have to start a new Instagram for Midna anyway, because like, I don't even

54:13.840 --> 54:16.520
remember the email I signed up for it with.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.520
Oh no.

54:17.520 --> 54:20.240
I changed it once because I couldn't remember the initial one and then I remembered the

54:20.240 --> 54:22.120
initial one and all this shit.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.320
So there's going to be a new Midna Instagram.

54:25.320 --> 54:26.320
Fun.

54:26.320 --> 54:27.640
All right.

54:27.640 --> 54:32.740
So anyway, I guess there's not a lot else to say on the Amazon cloud thing right now

54:32.740 --> 54:39.120
until we know that what they're doing or what they're planning, but it does, I feel like

54:39.120 --> 54:44.160
this is the direction they're moving in and I'm curious to see what they unveil maybe

54:44.160 --> 54:45.160
next year.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.280
Well, and that's going to also depend on a lot of what, you know, they're doing with

54:48.280 --> 54:52.760
the Microsoft X cloud stuff as well and where that goes.

54:52.760 --> 54:56.720
And I think they're just gonna kind of look at what works, what doesn't work, and then

54:56.720 --> 54:57.720
kind of go from there.

54:57.720 --> 55:00.800
And that's what everybody seems to be doing.

55:00.800 --> 55:06.080
But launching early, do you have that problem that you don't get to learn from other people

55:06.080 --> 55:12.840
because you're, you're leading the charge however well you're doing it, I guess.

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
All right.

55:13.840 --> 55:17.640
Well, moving on to our next story, which is about again, Pokemon sword and shield, some

55:17.640 --> 55:21.720
of the big names in gaming this week as that did recently release.

55:21.720 --> 55:25.180
And of course, you all know by now one of the biggest controversies in Pokemon sword

55:25.180 --> 55:30.400
and shield is the fact that many of the previous Pokemon in the series were removed from the

55:30.400 --> 55:34.560
game, even though the Pokedex is somewhere in the realm of just over 400, that would

55:34.560 --> 55:39.560
still be about half the Pokemon did not make the cut in Pokemon sword and shield.

55:39.560 --> 55:45.140
But that hasn't stopped folks from hacking and modding and doing what they do to try

55:45.140 --> 55:48.040
to bring some of the Pokemon back into the game.

55:48.040 --> 55:53.420
So what's interesting, apparently using older models from other games, one hacker actually

55:53.420 --> 55:58.700
brought Omastar, which was cut, that's a gen one Pokemon that kind of looks like a snail

55:58.700 --> 56:01.120
starfish hybrid thing.

56:01.120 --> 56:05.180
And it was cut, it's not in Pokemon sword and shield, but somebody was able to kind

56:05.180 --> 56:10.980
of hack it to actually put it in Pokemon sword and shield and it kind of works.

56:10.980 --> 56:13.900
But I guess some of the entrance animations are a little borked.

56:13.900 --> 56:16.860
So there's actually a YouTube out there and I didn't have time to rip it for the show

56:16.860 --> 56:22.540
tonight, but you can actually see that it kind of does a fight and it works okay.

56:22.540 --> 56:28.760
So people were able to add at least one Pokemon back into the game, I guess, but yeah, I mean,

56:28.760 --> 56:32.140
that seems just more of like a challenge to me and it's honestly, Omastar is not that

56:32.140 --> 56:36.520
great a Pokemon and it just seems like kind of a, eh.

56:36.520 --> 56:40.500
It's neat that hackers and modders have accomplished that, neat.

56:40.500 --> 56:46.480
And it does go to show that maybe Game Freak Nintendo should consider some type of addition

56:46.480 --> 56:50.820
to add the older Pokemon back into the game, but at the same time, I can, you know, and

56:50.820 --> 56:55.380
I got into this last week and I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll just summarize.

56:55.380 --> 56:59.600
Game Freak may have made some strategical cuts to try to update the competitive side

56:59.600 --> 57:00.800
of Pokemon.

57:00.800 --> 57:04.600
Maybe there's a reason they wanted to throw away all the old legendaries, because anytime

57:04.600 --> 57:08.580
you watch a Pokemon match, it's all those legendaries going up against each other.

57:08.580 --> 57:13.120
So maybe they wanted to re- It's the third game that they're gonna put all of them just

57:13.120 --> 57:14.120
in that game.

57:14.120 --> 57:15.120
Oh, we'll see.

57:15.120 --> 57:18.880
Anyway, now did this whole controversy slow down the sales?

57:18.880 --> 57:24.180
Did people put their money where their mouth was and not buy the new Pokemon as a result?

57:24.180 --> 57:26.680
And the answer is probably not.

57:26.680 --> 57:30.460
I mean, I'm sure there's some people out there that are like, I sure didn't, but the sales

57:30.460 --> 57:32.580
numbers are coming in.

57:32.580 --> 57:38.560
Nintendo announced that over 6 million units between Sword and Shield, and I'm sure five

57:38.560 --> 57:42.000
million of them were Shield and one million of them were Sword based on what I see on

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
my friends list.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.600
That's no shade, it's just I see way more people playing Shield than Sword.

57:47.600 --> 57:52.600
But anyway, Nintendo announces 6 million units of the game have been sold worldwide, 2 million

57:52.600 --> 57:58.480
of them in the US during the first two days, meaning it's the highest grossing Pokemon

57:58.480 --> 58:00.580
launch ever.

58:00.580 --> 58:06.300
So that should hopefully be some good news for the folks at Game Freak that have had

58:06.300 --> 58:12.180
to put up with a lot of social media online Twitter bullshit leading up to its release.

58:12.180 --> 58:17.800
And quite frankly, and again, I'm probably gonna take a little shit for my hot take opinion,

58:17.800 --> 58:19.280
but I'm still gonna put it out there.

58:19.280 --> 58:23.900
I think this just furthers the proof that a lot of what you see on Twitter is just echo

58:23.900 --> 58:28.700
chamber noisy bullshit that people never follow through on.

58:28.700 --> 58:31.940
I shouldn't say never, rarely follow through on.

58:31.940 --> 58:32.940
That's Twitter.

58:32.940 --> 58:36.060
But you can craft Twitter into a very lovely echo chamber.

58:36.060 --> 58:39.560
I've met a lot of great people on Twitter, I've made some great friendships on Twitter,

58:39.560 --> 58:42.460
and know many people around the world from Twitter, but that's because I block a lot

58:42.460 --> 58:44.360
of the annoying shit.

58:44.360 --> 58:49.300
So I think the people pouring themselves into a tizzy and calling the games fails, the results

58:49.300 --> 58:52.220
are in and biggest launch ever.

58:52.220 --> 58:54.420
So I'm a big fan of muting people.

58:54.420 --> 58:55.420
Yeah.

58:55.420 --> 58:58.260
Oh, I like to block I understand why people do the muting.

58:58.260 --> 59:01.340
I like to I like you to know you've been blocked.

59:01.340 --> 59:04.860
I don't want to but it's different for me because if it's especially if it's a guy,

59:04.860 --> 59:07.340
I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing that I blocked him.

59:07.340 --> 59:08.580
Yeah, I've heard that before.

59:08.580 --> 59:09.580
Yeah.

59:09.580 --> 59:10.580
I understand.

59:10.580 --> 59:13.740
Have you ever visited those profiles were in the about information?

59:13.740 --> 59:17.100
It says blocked by so and so and it's like you're proud of that.

59:17.100 --> 59:18.700
Like, I don't know.

59:18.700 --> 59:22.180
Like the people that I've blocked on Twitter deserved it.

59:22.180 --> 59:30.000
Like, you want people that I don't know, I just block everybody that adds me as a follower.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
You block everybody?

59:31.000 --> 59:34.620
No, no, no, I bought I've been blocking a lot because I've been getting a lot of the

59:34.620 --> 59:40.900
these guys who like to post naked pictures of themselves following me for some reason.

59:40.900 --> 59:46.120
And no offense, but like, I just don't want to keep having to like, and not even just

59:46.120 --> 59:51.260
that, just even like some that my other followers or people that I follow seem to like their

59:51.260 --> 59:55.160
photos, and then they get thrown into my feed.

59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.440
And if I'm browsing on my phone or at work or something like that, that might be bad.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.060
So I preemptively block them.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.060
Do you know how?

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.320
I mean, and you've I know you've expressed you've had this problem too, but do you know

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.600
how much gay porn finds its way into my feed?

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.860
And like, I don't follow triple X accounts.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.000
There's nothing wrong with it.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.440
It's just that, you know, sometimes I'm looking on my phone at work and I don't need to see

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.260
that on my Twitter feed, but Twitter will show the things that your friends liked.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:27.340
And some of y'all out there are thirsty, which again, I understand it's fine.

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.340
There's nothing wrong.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:33.580
We all get in those moods, but like, Twitter stopped putting it in my feed.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.580
There's nothing wrong.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:39.040
It's like, you know, I, I, I, I'm curious who's following me and I see the profile picture

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.100
and I can't really tell.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.020
So I go to their profile and there's butthole there.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:46.540
So I'm like, well, I'm going to have to block you.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.180
And I'd have to do the same thing if it was a female butthole.

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:52.980
But it's just like, I've seen titties to titties pop up on my feed to for the same.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:56.940
I follow straight dudes to the, you know, it's just lesbians that like that stuff.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.860
And it's just, it's just, I can't, I've got to keep my feed somewhat clean.

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:05.380
You know, maybe I, if I have some time one of these days, I can put it in a separate

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.300
like don't have like lists or some shit now.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.620
And actually, I think you can do categories now too.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.140
So you can do all that when I have the free time, which will never happen.

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.240
Maybe I can do that kind of crap.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.100
But right now I got to block that shit.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.040
So oh, I live by the list thing.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.300
I the only there's a handful of accounts that I stay current on and it's thanks to the list

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.300
thing.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.940
But the problem with lists is that you can't block retweets from your list.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:32.920
So I had to remove somebody from my list that I really like and I really want to follow

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.140
because over three quarters of their timeline are retweets.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:38.860
I just wish they had like options like, I don't want to see retweets from this person.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:39.860
Yes.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.860
My God.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.860
Anyway.

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:42.860
All right.

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.860
That's enough.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.860
Turn into Twitter rant.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.860
Who knew?

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.860
Anyway, let's talk more about Pokemon.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:51.100
Dark Sakura, you have another little interesting tidbit.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.680
Yes, I do.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.180
So you know, people have a lot of multiple devices that are plugged in, you know, to

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.860
their TVs that may have some interaction interaction.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:08.420
Well right now, Pokemon Sword and Shield are causing some problems with Roku devices.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:14.000
It's their Y-Com feature, the way it searches for the Internet for other players, is sending

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.080
out data packets that make the Roku go what and it gets stuck in a boot loop.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.360
So right now the only way to fix it is turn on airplane mode on the switch or move the

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.740
switch in Roku to different wireless networks.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:32.980
Roku is actually working on fixing it, but it's not really the fault of Pokemon.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.300
It's something having to do with Roku.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:38.300
So hopefully they'll get that fixed up, but it's not the first time I've heard of stuff

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.300
like that happening.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.820
That is such a strange thing.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.060
It has to be like some signal that it's using or something.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:49.780
I do know like the switch in general, one thing I like about it is that when I just

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:54.820
when I hit my controller to turn on the switch, if it's docked, my TV turns on as well.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.500
Like it sends that there's some type of smart signal or something it sends to the TV that

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.580
makes your TV turn on.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.980
And I really think that's cool.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:11.620
But yeah, like it's weird that maybe that signal is interfering with these other things

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.620
as well.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.700
So I don't know anyway.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.700
Let's move on.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.300
Loki, what else is happening in the gaming world?

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.860
We had some big news this week, right?

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:28.820
Yeah, so they have the nominees for the Death Stranding Awards starring Jeff Keighley.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:34.220
Basically it's the Game Awards and Death Stranding, of course, is getting nominations, which we

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:42.860
can kind of discuss how that's a little kind of sketchy being that Jeff Keighley is in

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.860
the game.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:49.180
I mean, if it wins Game of the Year, it's kind of I don't know.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:53.700
But I mean, it's his damn award show, so I guess he can do whatever he wants.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.620
I don't always say the nicest things about a lot of gaming journalists, because I think

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.580
a lot of them are drunk on power.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.580
Not all of them.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.780
I've met some really humble, really awesome people.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.340
So again, I don't want you to think I'm talking about you, just if you do happen to be one.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.620
But you've probably met these same people that I'm talking about that are just drunk

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.860
with power on that type of stuff.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:17.460
And I think Jeff, especially the ones that have really made it big or really mainstream

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:21.600
and so forth, I think he's a pretty respectable guy.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.580
I think he made a big mistake in agreeing to be in the game Death Stranding.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:32.980
And I do think he should maybe acknowledge that, especially if this game does end up

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.340
cleaning up some awards.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:40.020
He may need to acknowledge that as the guy who's running this, producing this premier

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:46.200
Game Award show, it is a little bit of a problem that he is showing up in a game and everybody

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.020
knows how tight he is with Hideo Kojima.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:54.160
And I'm sure, and I'm confident, this was not a rigged process.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.480
I'm sure the journalists did their thing in the nomination process the same way they've

01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.480
done in the years past.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.680
I'm sure everything was done the same way as it always has been.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.400
It's the perception.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.280
The perception is there that it's worse.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.280
And you know what?

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.560
He should really, he can't remove himself in the game at this point, or even stop the

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560
award show.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.560
And I don't think he should do either of those things.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.120
I do think he should say, hey, I learned something from this and I realized I crossed

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.500
a line that if I want this award show to be taken seriously in the future, I probably

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.120
shouldn't cross that again.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.120
So don't look for me to do any cameos in any future games.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.120
Right.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.520
So, so let's see, let's talk about the nomination.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:38.920
So Game of the Year, as mentioned, Death Stranding Control, The Outer Worlds, Resident Evil 2,

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:45.640
Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Action Game, they have Apex Legends,

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:53.040
Astral Chain, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Devil May Cry 5, Gears 5, and Metro Exodus.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.720
Let's see, we can, Action Adventure, Borderlands 3, Control, Death Stranding, Legends, All

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:04.800
the Links Awakening, Resident Evil 2, and Sekiro.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.440
Could you read the awards nominees for best art direction, please, because there's something

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.480
I want to point out in that category.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.600
Yes, actually, I was just getting there.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:21.400
Art direction, Control, Death Stranding, Grease, The Legend of Zelda, Links Awakening, Sayonara

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.640
Wild Hearts.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.760
I just wanted to interrupt here real quick.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.480
What did I say when I was reviewing Sayonara Wild Hearts here on this show?

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.600
Does anyone remember what I said on that when I was talking about the game?

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600
It purred.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
Yeah.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.320
Specifically, this game will get nominated for best art direction at award shows at the

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320
end of the year.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320
Thank you.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.480
But I mean, anybody who's played the game could tell you that.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.680
They have a shit ton of esports nominations.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:58.440
I didn't even realize that they had all that, event, coach, player, host, content creators

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.520
of the year, they've got stuff like that.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.000
I have no idea who those people are.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.840
I wanted to talk about indie games real quick, though.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.880
Can I say quickly on the esports thing?

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.840
Because I definitely noticed it seemed like a lot of that was increased.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.560
And I think maybe some of that is to try to bring more eyes to the show.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:18.840
I think it is an element of the gaming community, whether you personally follow it or not.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.840
I don't follow a lot of esports.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.960
I completely understand.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.080
But I get it.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.160
I get that the Overwatch League is something that's growing and growing and so forth.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.640
So I get it.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.540
It's not particularly the categories I personally have any interest in, but okay.

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:35.660
So it's just weird to see so much more of it this year than in years past.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.660
But anyway.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.660
Go ahead.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.660
And then, let's see.

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:39.660
I was going to...

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.660
Where was that?

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.660
Let's see.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:42.660
They had mobile and...

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.660
So mobile game I wanted to mention.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:48.660
They had Call of Duty Mobile, Grindstone, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Sky Children of Light,

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.240
and What the Golf.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.000
And then independent game, of course.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.620
We know who's going to win independent game here, I mean, come on.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:00.820
Baba's You, Disco Elysium, Katana Zero, Outer Wilds, and Untitled Goose Game.

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.340
I'm surprised Untitled Goose Game did not get more nominations, actually.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.340
Well they also got...

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.380
I would have thought Untitled Goose Game would have been a dark horse for Game of the Year,

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:10.380
honestly.

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.380
They had...

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.380
They have this...

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.500
I don't know why the category is called Fresh Indie Game.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.000
It sounds like Indie Studio, but it's...

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.580
They had House House, Untitled Goose Game, Mega Crit, Slay the Spire, Mobius Digital,

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:28.220
Outer Wilds, Dead Toast Entertainment, my friend Pedro, Nomada Studio, Gris, and ZA

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:31.380
slash UM, Disco Elysium.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:35.820
I know, there's a ton of damn categories, I'm not going to read them all here.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:41.900
Family Game category, or better known as its Nintendo category, Luigi's Mansion, 3 Ring

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.900
Fit Adventure, Super Mario Maker 2, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, and Yoshi's Craft

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.540
of World.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.100
Don't get me wrong, Nintendo does good family games, but I would like to think that there's

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.500
other people out there that have made some family games that, like, really?

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.460
This is all we have is just from Nintendo?

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.460
I don't know.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.520
Like, wasn't there, like, an, um...

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.520
Was that this year?

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.520
I can't remember.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.500
Wasn't there, like, one of the robots games that Sony made or something like that that

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.900
was pretty good for VR?

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.020
I don't know.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.020
I would like to see...

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:17.700
I would like to see more than just Nintendo in that category, and I think last year is

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.700
the same way.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.700
Okay.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:24.540
Real quick, go back and read the Game of the Year nominees for us, please.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.220
You know what I'm going to ask after this.

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:32.700
Game of the Year, Control, Death Stranding, The Outer Worlds, Resident Evil 2, Sekiro,

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.940
Shadows Die Twice, and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:40.540
Now, I realize not everybody's had time to play all those games, but certainly you've

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.780
had enough time to follow some of the buzz on these different games, and you kind of

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:48.060
know the perception and what the gaming community kind of views with these types of games.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.860
So that being said, who do you think out of this group takes the award?

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.860
The Outer Worlds.

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860
Wow.

01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.860
You're the...

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.860
I wouldn't have thought...

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.020
Why would you say The Outer Worlds?

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.700
Because it's actually a pretty decent game.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:04.100
It's of a quality of one of the older Fallout games.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:08.140
I have not heard anything really negative about it.

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.660
Death Stranding, I've heard all sorts of...

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:15.280
It just seems very like this is kind of a Kojima passion project thing, and it just

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.940
makes no sense, and the gameplay's not really there, but the story's okay.

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.180
Control has a pretty good story, and the gameplay's pretty good in that one, so that could be

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.380
one that I could see.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.380
Sekiro.

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.380
Sekiro.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.260
I don't care.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.260
I'm gonna pronounce it wrong.

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.260
You said it right the first time.

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.260
Whatever.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:37.940
That one seems like that might be a pretty good one.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.260
The gameplay in that was supposed to be pretty good, and I think, if I remember correctly,

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.940
that's kind of like the Dark Souls type game.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.980
Smash Brothers Ultimate's just Smash Brothers.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.820
I mean, I guess you could see some omniscience there.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.060
I would see that more of like a family game.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.940
It might win that category.

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.140
Resident Evil 2.

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.380
Dude, it's a fucking remake.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.260
I just don't really care.

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.980
I mean, it might do all right, but I think Outer Worlds will take it, unless it's really

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.820
rigged and Industrial will take it.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:04.820
Dark Sakura, thoughts?

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:10.020
I'm leaning to Death Stranding because everyone is up Kojima's ass, just saying.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:15.200
Other than that, though, my second for that would have been Sekiro, just because it's

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.940
been out longer, more people have played it, it's got a really great storyline, it's pretty,

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.220
and it's hard as shit.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:25.180
I actually think Smash Brothers is going to take it, and I think it's going to leave a

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:29.180
lot of people asking why the fuck wasn't this nominated last year, and the reason why is

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:33.180
because of the way the release windows work, and I think it is going to cause some questions

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:37.460
about, hmm, maybe the strange eligibility window for this ought to be revisited.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.460
However, I think Smash Brothers takes it because I think there is going to be blowback on Death

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:45.940
Stranding because of the Kili thing, I really do.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.700
And I don't think the game, I mean, I want to play it and form my own opinions, but the

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.140
game doesn't seem to be reviewing at the level where I thought it would have.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.020
So I'm not sure it's going to take the big prize for that reason.

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:03.300
I think, ultimately, the users vote on these, right, because you can go vote on them online, right?

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.820
And that's another reason why Smash Brothers takes it in the end.

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:11.300
I think that game is too goddamn popular to not win, and it's not like it's not deserving.

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.420
I mean, they've continued to deliver on that game over and over again throughout the year

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:18.360
with the DLC and so forth, so I mean, it certainly deserves it.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.200
I think just a lot of people are going to be asking, why didn't it win last year?

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.800
It should have won last year.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.680
And it was a December release, if I remember right, right?

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.280
So it's the eligibility window is a little weird.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.800
Yeah, I think it came out.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.800
Yeah.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:35.160
It's just like when the Oscar nominations come out, if Jordan Peele's Us gets nominated

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.520
for movie of the year, which it very well might, I think people are going to be asking,

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.840
wait a minute, what the fuck?

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.240
Wasn't that last year's movie?

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.240
No, came out in like February.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.280
So you know, sometimes the eligibility windows are a little weird.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.400
I do think there is a sleeper candidate in control.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.680
That one I hear is a pretty good game.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:01.760
I think if the critics were voting and not the gamers, I think there would, like if this

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.120
were the Oscars, where just industry people were voting, I have this really funky feeling

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.440
control would win.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.600
Because you know, again, I haven't played it, so it's hard for me to wrap my head around,

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.760
but it's on my radar, it's on my list of games I really want to play.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.360
Because everybody that has played it has really good things to say about it.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.440
And like just, you know, the studio that put it out puts all these other winners out and

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.440
so forth.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.720
So it's got a really, I feel like a cultish almost kind of following to that game in a

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720
way.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.920
So I feel like control is kind of a sleeper candidate there.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:41.520
But I just think, especially being the only Nintendo one in there, I think there's no

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.520
way Smash Brothers doesn't win.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.080
If Link's Awakening also got a Game of the Year nod, then it would be a tougher call.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.720
But I think there's no way that Smash Brothers, especially with the fans voting, I think Smash

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.720
Brothers has it in the bag.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.720
I don't know.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.720
But that's me.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.120
So anyway, the other, you know, the other thing, the one other thing I'll say is interesting

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.240
about the game awards.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:08.140
There was an award for community or something or like on what was it ongoing game, something

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:11.240
about like ongoing life of the game.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.760
Let's see, community support.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.760
That's it.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.160
Tell me, tell us the candidates in this category.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:25.480
So community support, Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Final Fantasy XIV, Fortnite, and Tom Clancy's

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.240
Rainbow Six Siege.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:32.480
And this I believe is the category for like continued support of the game post launch

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.680
basically and talking with the community and basically like hyping up the products and

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.680
things like that.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.680
Right.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.760
And like, you know, continuing support for the game after it's out.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:47.640
Yeah, I, I mean, Final Fantasy XIV should get that.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.280
I have a feeling they had their best expansion this year.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.640
I have a feeling Fortnite will get it, but users, Apex Legends better not fucking get

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640
it.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.640
Users vote?

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640
Oh, no, wait, wait.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640
No, I'm sorry.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.640
I'm thinking Anthem.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.640
Sorry.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640
Sorry.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640
Getting those confused.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640
Apex Legends.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640
That might not be so bad.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.640
Yeah, no, Apex won't be bad at all.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.480
And Apex arguably could deserve it, but I think it'll be Fortnite because again, users

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.520
vote on it.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:18.840
So, um, uh, but read that list one more time because I want you guys to listen.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.520
Who's not here?

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:29.120
Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Final Fantasy XIV, Fortnite and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:35.600
Who's not here in that lineup that is really stunning in, in, in my opinion, when it comes

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.560
to this community thing, like I'm actually stunned and shocked.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.680
Who's not in that list.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.680
Who's not in that list.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.760
World of Warcraft.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.080
How about any Blizzard product?

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.080
Overwatch.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:48.320
Because fuck them.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.440
For me, Overwatch is the glaring admission there.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:58.200
And is that punishment for what's happened the past couple months?

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:03.400
I don't know, but I, I have to, I am stunned that Overwatch was not in that category.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.360
They're banned from being awarded.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.880
You know, I don't even see now that I'm looking at this.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.880
Uh, well, the Overwatch is nominated for esports game of the year, which I think it won last

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880
year.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.920
That like, for me saying it's stunning for it to not be in the community category, it

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:26.200
would have been goddamn like fucking like, uh, uh, uh, uh, stop the presses, like interrupt

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.960
special news announcement time.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:34.000
Tom Brokaw here with a special news report, uh, that would not be in the esports category.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Come on.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.800
Especially with like everything Overwatch league has accomplished in the past year.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.740
That's a real, would have been a real interesting one.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.120
So a multiplayer game.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:49.320
We have apex legends, Borderlands three, call of duty, modern warfare, Tetris 99, and Tom

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.480
Clancy's the division two.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.280
So interesting.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.060
Anyway, I just, I, is something I noticed cause yeah, I get the Warcraft could be another

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.880
one too with the, especially with wow classic having launched, but I was just, you know,

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:05.360
as a final fantasy 14 fan, there was definitely a part of me that was like, yay, they're getting

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.000
acknowledged and rewarded because their latest expansion is the best they've ever been.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.800
So good for them.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:17.280
They have a good, I'm sorry, just one last one, uh, scored music, cadence of Hyrule,

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.280
Death Stranding, Devil May Cry 5, Kingdom Hearts 3, and Sayonara Wild Hearts.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.280
That's a pretty good category.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280
That's a pretty good category.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.280
It really is.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.280
So, all right.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.280
All right.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.840
Anyway, uh, SG100 Matt does want to say, I mean to play devil's advocate, Overwatch hasn't

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.620
really done much this year.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.280
Last year they were doing more with the game.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.740
This past year, it felt kind of the same, um, but I mean, there's still, still continuing

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:42.720
support with new heroes and stuff, but, and the, the special events, but maybe because

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.600
the special events are kind of recycled cause Overwatch 2 is on the horizon.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.600
I don't know.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.360
I just, I noticed it wasn't there a little bit surprised.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
That's all.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.400
Anyway, moving on.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.920
Let's talk about, uh, since obviously Kojima is taking up a lot of the talk when it comes

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.740
to the game awards, I think it's worth talking about this.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.420
What is Kojima going to do next?

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:04.780
Um, because I don't think it's going to necessarily be Death Stranding 2.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.500
You know what he said he wants to do?

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.460
Well, I think that's what I'm about to talk about.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.880
So, uh, what he said he wanted to talk about on Twitter.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:17.300
So he wrote a tweet, um, that he said, uh, this is the tweet as to make the scariest

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:22.700
horror game, I'll watch the scary movies in order to awaken my horror soul.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:28.260
The I is the Thai horror movie I rent when making PT.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:30.300
This freaky ass movie.

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:35.380
Notice he calls it PT and not Silent Hills.

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.980
Just just, it's just interesting that he didn't, it was, that whole thing was supposed to be

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:42.460
Silent Hills, but he called it PT maybe because that's all it ever ended up being.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.460
I don't know.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:47.940
But anyway, number one, interesting observation, uh, Thai horror movie I rent when making PT,

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.020
but was too scary to finish watching.

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.080
The package is scary, so I rented the disc only.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.740
Will I be able to finish watching?

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:55.740
You've seen this Dark Soccer?

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.740
I don't know anything about it.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.580
I tell, I probably wouldn't like it.

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.700
I started watching it movies, fucking creepy as fuck.

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:07.380
It's like this, this, uh, violent planner has like a cornea transplant.

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:12.940
Um, and, uh, uh, she starts seeing like multiple images of people dying.

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.420
It's really fucking creepy movie.

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:15.820
And they remade it with Jessica Alba.

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.940
Oh, it's that one.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:18.940
Yeah.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:22.700
Oh, I heard, cause I heard when the Jessica Alba one came out, people were razzing it

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:25.300
being like, this ain't shit compared to the original.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.300
So yeah.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:27.860
Anyway, interesting.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.860
Yeah.

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.740
If you ever want to watch it, I'll, I'll, I'll pick it up again.

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.580
I am perfectly content.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.700
This is like you and the VR thing.

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.020
I am perfectly content hearing your take on it.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.300
I much prefer Asian horror.

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.300
Sure.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.540
Although I will say that I'm still kind of about Train to Busan, but that is a good movie.

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.540
I will say this, you know what I do want to see?

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.500
Cause I've never, I have heard nothing but great things about it.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.260
Um, going over to, I think it's South Korean film Parasite.

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:56.980
Yeah.

01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:57.980
I want to see that.

01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:58.980
That's one I haven't seen.

01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.980
It's on my list.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:01.580
I'm hearing lots of stuff about that.

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.860
So anyway, I hope I'm right.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.580
I hope I didn't credit that to the wrong country.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.860
I just, I think it was, but I'll double, I'll double check it.

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:11.220
But have you, have you, well, you saw Ju-On, right?

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.060
Or did you see the original or did you see Grudge?

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.340
I think he made me watch the original Grudge at some point.

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:19.500
I need to have you watch Black Ghost and White Ghost cause they're a little bit more suspenseful.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.820
They're not really gross or super scary.

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.820
To me, they weren't super scary.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:27.980
But if you just want to sit and laugh the whole time, watch, um, Kayako versus, not

01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:31.740
that one, Sadako 3D, which was like Sadako from the Ring.

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:32.740
It's a terrible movie.

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.180
Actually, Kayako versus Sadako is also hilariously bad.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.300
Swongtong in chat says, I watched Suicide Club last week.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.300
That messed me up.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.500
Suicide Club Club is a fucked up movie anyway.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:44.020
Dark Sakura made me watch that or somebody made me watch that.

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.020
I have two copies of it.

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.020
I think you did.

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.020
Like Loki, somebody made me watch that.

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.020
I got a copy of it.

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.020
Yeah.

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.020
I was like, ugh.

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.020
Copy.

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.020
You know, they did, um, Battle Royale on Blu-ray.

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:55.740
I was just about to ask, why, why was Battle Royale all of a sudden floating around Facebook

01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.740
this week?

01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:00.740
Is it because it was the anniversary of, of, um, the movie's release.

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:04.540
And so like I did, What's Your Face doing the China to get exploded.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:05.540
Okay.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.580
You know, why don't they have a battle royale battle royale game?

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.020
Would that be inappropriate?

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:14.580
They recreated, they, they actually stole that idea for, um, a Marvel series about a

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:19.420
two years ago, a year ago, two years ago where they were kidnapping different teenage superheroes,

01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:25.220
including like some of the runaways and Jubilee and all them and put them in like a battle

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:27.020
royale, like full on deathmatch.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.900
So I fell down a Wiki rabbit hole and I was trying to look into why did they never remake

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:32.900
battle royale?

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:36.300
Because surely somebody wanted to remake it for a us audience.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.060
And sure enough, they were trying to do that at one point.

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:43.060
Um, even despite the controversies about, you know, the things that happen in schools

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:46.060
and stuff, you know, there was, there was a particular way they were going to frame

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:47.060
it.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.080
Um, and let's be real.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.200
It's not like seeing teenagers get cut up in horror movies is anything new.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.560
Hello, any Freddie or Jason movie or Halloween that ever existed, right?

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.880
Well, the hunger games games, even though she said she never read battle royale, I watched

01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.880
the movies.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.980
It's very reminiscent.

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:04.340
And that's, that's kind of where the story ultimately ends up is the reason why they

01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:08.480
have not remade the movie is because the hunger games happened and we had Lord of the flies.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.880
And he said the, the guy who owns the rights said, no matter what we did, if we were to

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:18.040
release battle royale here in America, everybody would say it's a rip off of the hunger games.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.080
Even though it came first, but he's like, you and I both know the world doesn't work

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.080
like that.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.160
Yeah, but it doesn't.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.120
It's just like when beat mania came out and everybody, the ex play fucking called it a

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.880
guitar hero rip off or whatever.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:32.080
It's like, wait, wait, you ignorant fuck.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.040
But so what though?

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.040
Like doesn't matter.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.120
So what if someone calls it a rip off of hunger games?

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:42.640
Who cares what people say about a movie doesn't mean it's going to be bad.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.440
Doesn't mean people won't go see it.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.840
There's plenty of things there, you know, based off of other things, make it even more

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.840
gory or something.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.840
Also, I think I shit a lot already kind of spawned off because of the hunger games.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:59.080
Like what was the other big teenage book movie they started doing the maze runners, the maze

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.800
runner or is that it was in.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:09.080
There's also, uh, there was the other one that was by the same author that did like

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:15.160
the, um, which I can't remember what it's called now.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.360
Um, yeah, they had, they've had a few other ones.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.960
There was, um, I don't, they all suck.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:21.960
That's what it was.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:26.600
Uh, but yeah, there's been several books of that genre that have been made into movies

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.600
and stuff.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600
So what's it matter?

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600
Early days.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:37.120
I mean, even, let me just, oh, and also battle royale two was crappy, hilariously crappy

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.120
divergent.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.160
Oh, divergent.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.160
Divergent isn't the same.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.160
Tiger Claw got me.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.160
That's what I was thinking of.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.960
But it's a completely different kind of genre.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.040
Yeah, but those movies exist because of the hunger games because they were looking for

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040
the next young adult.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.040
They want young adult shit.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.040
Yeah.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.800
But you know, I mean, if they wanted to do like a battle royale rip off, they could do

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.440
like a supernatural thing to it.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.440
That's the problem.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:01.580
See the reason why I'll tell you why they haven't made a, um, new or a remake of battle

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:02.580
royale.

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.580
The running man.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.580
There's another one like that, by the way.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:05.580
Ooh, yes.

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.580
They should do a remake of that.

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:10.940
The reason why they can't do a remake of battle royale is because they can't stretch it out

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:15.220
to be a franchise and milk that shit for as much fucking money as they can.

01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:16.220
That is the real reason.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:17.220
They tried in Japan.

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.220
We saw it happen.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.220
Let me bring it back to the comics.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.620
We're going to bring it back to the topic that started this whole tangent.

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:22.620
No, that's okay.

01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:26.060
And that is Kojima taking on horror games potentially because you know, he basically

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:29.160
is saying in that tweet, I'm trying to put myself in a horror game mood.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.060
So it's, I mean, he didn't say it like that, but it's read the subtext.

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:38.060
That's not the thing I thought he was going to talk about because he, the rumor was saying

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.820
the next thing Kojima productions were going to do was a movie.

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:45.740
Oh, there was the, Oh, so maybe what if he did a horror movie?

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:51.860
That seems likely, or what if he put the studios like CG, you know, cause you could do a whole,

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:56.420
I mean, especially as good as Death Stranding looked and how beautifully everything moved.

01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:01.580
Imagine if, well, in another, just earlier than that, uh, Detroit was the same way.

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.420
It was all mocap acting.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:10.660
You could do a movie all in mocap CG like that, which would give you a lot more, say,

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.300
less special, special effects.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.300
You know what I mean?

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:17.340
Things that actually seem more immersive in their environment.

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:18.340
What if he's doing that?

01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.340
Who knows?

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.860
Uh, only Kojima knows.

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:26.200
So we can, we can only look for the hints, uh, within the tweets in the time being.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.200
That's all we can do.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.420
Next franchise to be released, the audition.

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:32.060
Let's move on and talk about other movies.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.600
You don't know what the audition is.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.600
I don't think.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.100
I don't think so.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:41.300
It's this woman auditions a man to be, or she's pretending to be the audition, but she's

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:44.860
like trying him to be her husband and then it's kind of like borderline fake snuff film

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:45.860
type thing.

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:46.860
It's really, it's creepy.

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:47.860
Anyway.

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:48.860
Yeah.

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:49.860
And I haven't watched it.

01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:50.860
How about something family friendly?

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:51.860
Okay.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:52.860
How about Sonic?

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:53.860
Okay.

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:55.140
So again, Sanic.

01:25:55.140 --> 01:26:00.020
So you know how much they were saying that the redesign costs the company, right?

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.860
When the, the, the rumor was something like 35 million or something like that.

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:09.780
Well, there is a source close to the production quotes, quote, quote, um, uh, that was released

01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:14.900
through IndieWire that said that it was actually less than 5 million for Paramount.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.380
Um, a reason being, and actually the reason why this makes a lot of sense is because apparently

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:23.980
when the first trailer came out, the only, uh, the effects that were finished was the

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:24.980
stuff in the trailer.

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:28.980
So keep in mind how much VFX costs for design and render.

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:35.980
Um, on top of that too, they did, now they did have to rework the, um, you know, the

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.420
character design, reanimate, stuff like that, but that's going to be a lot less, especially

01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:42.300
if most of the rig is already done.

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:44.220
The body really looks about the same.

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:46.380
It's re-rigging the face, right?

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:49.660
And if they didn't have to add effects to it, going in afterwards to add the effects

01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:52.140
would really put it much, much lower.

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:57.900
They didn't have as much work to do, especially if that redesign was, uh, redesign was done

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:00.620
a lot earlier than we saw it happen.

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:04.140
So, and you know, it could be possible because this happens a lot.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:09.660
I mean, in 3d design, in web design, in anything, you know, anytime you design a character,

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.620
you're going to have mock-ups.

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:16.300
How many times have you looked at a beta version of the game and seeing that a character looks

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:17.300
completely different?

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:19.820
What about that pirate game that turned into Banjo Kazooie?

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:20.820
Right?

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:21.820
Right.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:26.060
So, I mean, and there's still like erroneous data for some of those models that are in

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.060
games.

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.060
The same thing happens with movies, especially when you're dealing with CG, you're going

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.140
to have test mock-ups.

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:39.300
So it could very well be that they may have already had that design already done.

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:43.740
You know, I think even if it had been 35 million, even I know it was five, but even if it had

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:48.240
been 35 million, I think it would have still been worth the investment because this movie,

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.440
you know, and it's funny because we just were talking about how Twitter and internet noise

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.880
doesn't always really matter at the end of the day, but at the same time, something felt

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.320
very different and legit about the Sonic movie talk.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.720
And I really think this movie would have just straight up bombed.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.160
There would have been so, like even myself, maybe, and maybe this is why I'm like, oh,

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.040
this is going to turn around because even myself, like based on that first movie trailer,

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.080
I was like, this is going to be bad.

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.360
I don't, I'm not going to see this.

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.360
Forget it.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.360
I'll just wait.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360
And what comes on Blu-ray.

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.480
I mean, it's a trailer.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.760
Even I'm kind of like, well, I think I've had something to go with, I'll probably go

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.760
check it out.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.760
Why not?

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.520
And I think there's a lot of people that now were like, Sonic, oh yes, that is the character

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.200
I remember from my childhood.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.040
I think that, I think it's going to make up that 35 million or 5 million, whatever it

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.040
is in box office.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.040
There's another point to this too.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:37.600
And these are a couple of deleted tweets by one of their VFX designers, um, named, uh,

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.640
actually a motion capture animator, Stu Whitten, um, at Stu underscore FX on Twitter.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.120
Um, and this was on November 12th.

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:51.960
Oh, one said pretty much went back to our original design, LOL, see, number two, mad

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.520
props to our character lab in Vancouver team.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.280
And he had a link on there, but these were deleted.

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.960
So apparently this design, like I said, was already done.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:02.960
Hmm.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.800
So very interesting.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.920
It doesn't surprise me.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.760
I had a feeling that it was already done.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.820
Um, tiger claw and chat says it has a lot to live up to considering the success detective

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:18.420
Pikachu had, um, that's pretty true as well, you know, detective Pikachu did pretty damn

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:19.420
well.

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:23.860
Um, and I did go see that in the theater actually, and it was a super fucking cute movie.

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:31.500
So, um, yeah, I mean, I have to say, uh, in the pre trailer, the first trailer era, when

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:36.220
tiger claw would post all these things on Sonic, I would, I would want to be like, dude,

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.340
stop trying to make fetch happen.

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:41.100
This movie's destined for failure, but now I'm like, all right, I get where your hype

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.100
is.

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:48.100
I may not be leading that hype train, but I'm like, okay, I see why people are excited.

01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.100
I get it.

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:50.940
It looks, it looks kind of neat.

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:54.580
So all right, anyhow, let's move on.

01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:59.020
Let's talk about, uh, potentially the future of gaming in our next story.

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.020
Loki.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.020
All right.

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:06.260
Uh, so obviously we're waiting, um, with beta breath about the announcement of the PlayStation

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:10.060
five and wondering what the hell is Sony going to offer with that?

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:15.620
Well, we get a little bit of a glimpse with a brand new patent for their controller.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:21.460
Now the controller looks pretty similar to the dual shock for, um, just some minor tweaks

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:22.460
with how it is.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:30.380
One thing that is noticed on the redesign is that the light bar seems to be missing.

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:34.340
Um, it doesn't seem to be in that picture, at least from what I can see.

01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:40.220
Still has the touch pad available, um, on top there, but maybe that'll be a touch screen.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:41.220
Who knows?

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:45.660
But right now, um, not a whole lot that we can see other than, I guess, being that there

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:50.300
is no light bar there, I guess that kind of makes sense because I'm assuming there may

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:53.980
not be a camera, although there would have to be a camera because you'd have to, how

01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.740
would you get PlayStation VR to work?

01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:00.020
So the VR needs one, well, unless they're going to change how that works, but I don't

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.020
know what that would be.

01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:02.020
I don't know what that would be.

01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:03.020
Can do that.

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:04.020
So we'll see.

01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:05.020
Um, but yeah, it looks pretty similar.

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:11.820
Maybe they just decided, I mean, what games use that light bar for control with a camera

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:16.420
that can't just be subbed in for the move, which is kind of required to use VR anyway.

01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.500
Like that, that the controller light bar hasn't been used on any recent games.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:22.660
I mean, I think it's pretty and I think it makes a neat ambient effect.

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:23.660
Don't get me wrong.

01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:27.380
Yeah, they use it for like indicators and stuff like that sometimes, but it's not like

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.380
anything meaningful.

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.740
And there's also that tiny little light strip in the, in the touch pad that you could kind

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.180
of use that for, um, maybe instead of having that whole backlight.

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:39.180
So, but, and then, and also just because this is a patent doesn't mean it's going to show

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:41.100
the exact design of that.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.140
Maybe they'll tweak that and have it in there.

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.140
Who knows?

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:46.620
Um, but it looks pretty similar.

01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:50.100
I mean the same layout and everything, they're not moving the six around or anything like

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:51.100
that.

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:55.860
I mean, it's, if you were to tell me that's a DualShock 4, I'd probably believe you.

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.740
So for the most part, it just kind of looks like they're just sticking with what's worked

01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:02.820
in the last generation, which seems plenty like a good idea to me.

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:06.540
I guess there's no, we're not expecting any big change with like, oh, they're saying like

01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:07.540
the share button showed up.

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:11.420
Maybe like similar, they're going to have haptic feedback or whatever in the triggers.

01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:13.380
And so that was something that they were talking about before.

01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:17.600
And that's something that the Xbox One X sort of has a little bit of rumble in the triggers

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.600
as well.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:23.300
So, uh, be curious to see what that's like, but like you're playing horizon and you go

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:26.780
to like fire the bow and it's going to kind of do that haptic feedback to make it really

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:29.260
feel like you're pulling the bowstring back or something like that.

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.260
Yeah.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:31.260
Yeah.

01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.260
So that can be neat.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.260
Yeah.

01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:34.260
All right.

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.260
Well, we'll see.

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:39.260
And again, we don't really know until it is officially unveiled by PlayStation.

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:41.460
All right.

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:45.780
Moving on to talking about sales, sales, sales, because you know, there are going to be a

01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.060
shit ton of sales on Black Friday.

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.060
They're going to be online.

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.060
They're going to be in stores.

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.060
They're going to be everywhere.

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:55.940
I'm sure some of you more thrifty, uh, gamers out there already have your eyes on what might

01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.380
you pick up on Black Friday.

01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:01.500
Sadly, you know what I'm not seeing on Black Friday sales, Death Stranding.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:04.780
I was hoping, I was hoping I might be able to get a deal on it if I waited, but it looks

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.100
like that's not happening.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:09.140
So maybe, I don't think it is at this point.

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:14.320
Uh, but you can already get in on some of the PlayStation four Black Friday deals, uh,

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.740
which include, uh, I guess the PlayStation VR is coming way down and this is a big one

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:26.940
$199 as opposed to $300, uh, the game bundle that has the VR headset, the camera and five

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:32.360
games, including Astrobot Rescue Mission, Skyrim VR, Resident Evil 7, Everybody's Golf

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:34.020
and PlayStation VR worlds.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.440
That's pretty damn good for $200.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.500
So I expect that may, uh, that may get some people on board with that.

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.500
We'll see.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:44.780
Um, also $200 for just a straight up PlayStation four.

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:48.860
If you don't have PS4 yet, if you haven't jumped into the, uh, latest generation, or

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:52.420
maybe, you know, you've been Xbox this whole time, you haven't, uh, picked up PS4 for whatever

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:57.500
reason, $200 for a one terabyte PlayStation four that comes with Last of Us, God of War

01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:02.220
and Horizon Zero Dawn, a PlayStation four pro for $300.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:07.060
So that's, um, pretty darn, you know, those are some big, deep cuts, but you would expect

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:12.100
those types of, uh, deep cuts, uh, this, you know, especially right before PlayStation

01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:13.580
five is coming out.

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:18.540
Um, also, uh, Death Stranding is going to be free with a PlayStation four bundle, a

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.700
certain one, uh, that you can pick up.

01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:25.260
So there's lots of deals and that's just the official PlayStation deals.

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:31.100
But I know everywhere, every, uh, company is having different sales of their own.

01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:35.940
Uh, Loki, I can't help but notice you have a cheap ass gamer who I know they live off

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:36.940
this stuff.

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:39.140
So anything that caught your eye over there?

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.740
Uh, not really.

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.700
I was just kind of taking a look to see what they had.

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.340
Yeah, they had, I haven't pulled it up, but they had on their Twitter, uh, link to an

01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:52.340
Excel, it's not an Excel spreadsheet, it's a Google docs, a spreadsheet or whatever that

01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.820
they've got, um, breaking down the different deals.

01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:00.060
I actually visited that the other day because I wanted to see if Death Stranding was on

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.060
it.

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.060
Yeah.

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.780
And I don't see Death Stranding on any of these, but there's lots of other stuff that's

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.780
on here.

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.020
I mean, it's worth checking out.

01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.020
Oh yeah.

01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:12.260
This is the time to catch up if there's anything else, you know, not from November this year.

01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:15.460
Uh, you know, cause we all know Pokemon sword and shield ain't getting discounted.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.540
So, you know, if there's anything not from this month that you want to pick up from the

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:20.860
year, you know, Black Friday is going to be a great time to do it.

01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:26.100
Uh, and you know, I think some places won't reveal their deals until what Black Friday

01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:27.860
or Cyber Monday will be another one.

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:28.860
Right?

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:29.860
Yeah, that would be another one.

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:32.820
Um, just trying to see what other stuff they have.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:36.220
I'm gonna wait for like, and obviously we'll have a steam sale pretty soon.

01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:38.780
So I'd be curious to see what they have on there.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.500
I made my purchase this week.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.600
So I've, what'd you pick up?

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:48.180
I picked up, um, it was a game that I played and I had talked about a little bit on my

01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:49.420
Twitter as well.

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:54.440
I had played this at one of our Sac Indie arcades couple of years ago, I think in 2017.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.980
And it's a local dev who's out of Oakland who put out a game called black future 88.

01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.780
It's a rogue light and it's fucking amazing.

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:05.300
And it's just like some indie guy that put this out.

01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.300
So it's out on switch and steam.

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:09.300
So go check it out.

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:13.780
It's like, they have a 10% off right now, so it's like 17 99, uh, while I are wants

01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:19.240
to recommend the recently released Contra and Castlevania collections currently 10 bucks

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.460
down from 20.

01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:24.700
You had me for a second there when you said, Contra is like the new one and then you let

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.900
the collections like, Oh, okay.

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:27.900
Okay.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.620
But that back when the concert games were good, right?

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:30.620
Right.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.620
Like new Contra.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.620
No.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620
Um, let's see.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.140
Oh, quest buster says dragon quest builders two is 25 bucks.

01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.140
That's pretty good.

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:41.980
Matt says Amazon is usually quiet until week of, but most of the time in lockstep with

01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.980
other retailers, prizes.

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:47.540
They came out with something today, uh, cause I know TVs, that was the thing that caught

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:48.540
my eye.

01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:53.080
Cause you guys know I still don't have a 4k TV cause I, I made the dumb mistake of buying

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.300
a TV like the year before 4k became affordable.

01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.220
So I'm, I missed the fuck out.

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:03.860
But now I'm starting to look at it going, Ooh, tempting, super tempting cause I kind

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:09.580
of want 4k gaming and I have a PS4 pro and other things is more 4k.

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:10.580
So I'm thinking about it.

01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.580
I think about it.

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:12.580
Yeah.

01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.580
We'll see.

01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.460
But it's, it's also like, but you could also be saving that money for like buying a house,

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.460
but we'll see.

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:20.460
All right.

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.460
Um, let's move on.

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:26.980
Let's move on to a time before, uh, you know, before games, before black Friday was really

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:32.540
like this holiday in and of itself, a simpler time when it was, when it was proper and easy

01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:34.020
to make a game based on poultry.

01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.020
Yes.

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:38.620
So we're going to go back to a classic time with the classic game of the week segment

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:42.460
where every week dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:44.660
Hey, you guys should check this game out.

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.560
Or maybe not so much sometimes a game that you should check out, but this game is kind

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560
of stupid.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:50.560
Isn't this game topical?

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.560
Yeah.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.560
So what'd you pick?

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.620
Well, I think it's a game called Ego mania and like I, for the longest time I always

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.340
thought it was a Turkey cause it doesn't look like a Turkey, but it's supposed to be a chicken

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:05.220
It's that's a, that is a fucking Turkey.

01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.340
That's a fucking Turkey across the top of the screen.

01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:13.460
That is a ugly ass Atari, 2,600 Turkey actually looks like a very well run, you know, rendered

01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:17.620
Turkey for the 2,600, but still, and can I say something about the guy playing this gate?

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.420
Cause I watched the four minutes or whatever I took of this video earlier.

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:24.540
Whoever's playing this sucks sucks.

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:29.540
I don't think he gets past like six eggs ever.

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:33.060
Here is another video, but it was actually a guy recording it on the TV cause it's for

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.140
a world record getting a fucking world record in Ego mania.

01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.740
Like this is stupid.

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.140
If I had an Ego mania, I'd want it to be about waffles.

01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.140
Okay.

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:46.180
So the first thing everybody's yelling in chat, which was the first thing I yelled,

01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:47.180
isn't this just kaboom?

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.180
Yeah.

01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:54.980
So at any rate, um, it was done, uh, and it came out in January, 1993 by us games for

01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.460
the Atari 2,600.

01:38:56.460 --> 01:39:03.860
And it was similar in design to kaboom, which is itself derived from the arcade game avalanche.

01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:08.380
You know, one could make the argument that that's big bird at the top of the screen because

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.380
it'd be all yellow.

01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:13.460
No, but it's the sad big bird from when they put them in the circus and the yellow.

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.020
So it'd be like half sad.

01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.020
He's half sad.

01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.500
I'd be sad if I was in this game too.

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.060
This game is fucking ugly.

01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:20.060
Dark soccer.

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:21.060
I should watch follow that bird.

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.940
Well, the only reason I picked it cause it's a fucking Turkey.

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:28.740
You don't know the classic games of the week are not always winners and we need to know

01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:29.740
about the shit.

01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:30.940
So we don't repeat our mistakes.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:31.940
That's true.

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:37.900
And this does come from a time and an era where games like this caused the entire industry

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:38.900
to crash.

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.100
I bet that I don't think this is as bad as ET.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.620
I used to play this game.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:43.940
I remember this game.

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:45.820
Oh my God.

01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:46.980
I bet that's what I want.

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:47.980
That's cookie monster.

01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:48.980
Hold on.

01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:49.980
Hold on a sec.

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:50.980
Look at, look at the picture.

01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:51.980
Look.

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:53.180
No, I'm looking at it right now.

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.420
I played this game.

01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.420
Okay.

01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:56.420
I remember this game.

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.420
Wow.

01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:58.420
Why didn't you play kaboom?

01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:59.420
The good game.

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.420
That's the same thing.

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:01.420
I don't remember.

01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:02.420
Hopefully I can get this to show up.

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:03.420
Oh, nevermind.

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.420
You're showing the video.

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.420
I'll send it in chat anyway.

01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:06.420
But anyway.

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.420
Ecomania.

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.420
It's a stupid, stupid ass game.

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:09.420
Anyway.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:12.180
So doesn't the chicken make like clucking noises as it's going around?

01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:15.620
If I remember correctly, it's an Atari 2,600.

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:20.300
So it probably made unless there's a port to like another console maintain.

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:21.760
It's a Turkey.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.120
So anyway.

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.440
So you basically have to catch eggs in a bowl and it's supposed to be a bear catching it

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440
by the way.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.440
Who's walking through honey.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.840
Cause you see how he's sinking down a little bit.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.840
Yeah.

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:32.840
He's it's barren.

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.960
Oh, 420 is the points.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.360
But I thought, I thought the bottom was all yolk from the cracked eggs.

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.360
They kept dropping cause the guy playing sucks, but you see it's going down.

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:51.160
Oh no, he drowns in the egg yolk, egg full of protein.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.160
Yeah.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.480
This little bow legged ass bear though.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.640
So maybe it, maybe it is.

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.640
All right.

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:56.640
Let me look at it.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.640
Let me wait till an egg falls on the ground.

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.640
No, he's just stupid.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:05.600
Um, anyway, so, um, you have to catch eggs in a bowl on top of your head.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.480
I mean, it's the, the, you actually have two difficulties.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.720
You have an easier one where you get a bigger, a larger hat for catching.

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.720
It's an upside down hat.

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:14.720
It looks like a bowl.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:15.720
Fuck ever.

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.720
Anyway.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.280
Um, so yeah.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.120
It's not like it has a plot cause it's an Atari 2,600 game.

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:30.000
So electronic games in June 20, uh, 20, 1983 said it was quote, delightful in a game that

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.160
improved on Kaboom.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.000
And it said that was, and I'm going to quote this again, a fully animated delight that

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:45.080
might even eclipse its inspiration with state of the art graphics on the 2,600 the fuck.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:51.200
It also, um, there was another game actually from 1982 inspired by avalanche called chicken.

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.320
Pretty much the same, same shit, but it actually looks like a chicken.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:01.080
I feel like the story behind this game is that big bird is deciding to poop eggs all

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.160
over his friend cookie monster.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:12.320
Big bird cannot cause big bird's a dude and I mean big bird does not have the egg producing

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.920
internal bits.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.360
Well big bird was really a bird anyway.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.360
Forget it.

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.520
I'm not going to try and just, I'm not trying to try and justify this game.

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.960
It was designed by Henry will and West Traeger music composed by Todd Marshall.

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:28.960
Okay.

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.320
I heard the target 2,600 in 1983.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.480
I think I did read that one thing that separates this from kaboom.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.160
So there is one way that this is different from kaboom is that if you actually get all

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.080
the eggs in the stage, which this guy never does a spoiler cause he is fucking terrible

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.080
at this game.

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.200
But if you get all the eggs in a stage, is Bobby Black Wolf playing this game?

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.680
No, come on.

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.680
Let's let's be fair.

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.880
Bobby Black Wolf would be like way better than stage one is actually playing in big

01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.880
hat mode.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.880
Oh my God.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:06.640
Anyway, but apparently if you catch all of the eggs, you get to throw the eggs back.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.640
That is the big twist.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.920
Even in kaboom, if you got to throw a bomb back at the bandit, that is the big twist

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:14.920
in this game.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.920
Apparently.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.760
So, and Bobby says, Hey, I would be better than this guy.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.040
No, that's true.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:30.560
And VG realness says the shade of it all SSJ 100 Matt does a bunch of salt emoji.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.600
I'm so mean.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.440
We should have, you know, for our next game jam, we should have terrible ripoffs as the

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440
theme.

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.440
And then we can do there.

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.440
So that's, that's a good idea.

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:44.920
But actually I will say this tiger claw with a really good thought in our chat, tiger claw

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:51.320
said, maybe it's time for a new category called the classic shitty game of the week.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.480
Well, you know, dark soccer already has next year's theming.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:00.320
I can do a shitty game a month, but you already have a monthly thing, but it's still a classic

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.320
game.

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:02.320
Okay.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.880
So it would fall under the umbrella of classic game.

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:08.040
It would just be my category would be, and here's your piece of shit for the month.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.040
Okay.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.040
All right.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.040
All right.

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.040
So do it.

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.320
So 2020, we're going to have what was classic pinball, classic pinball, and we're going

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.760
to have pinball 2000 classic shitty game of the week.

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:18.760
Classic shitty game.

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:19.760
Oh, this is good.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.760
This is good.

01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:21.760
Cause this will be a chance.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.560
I mean, we're, we've already, Halo's going to be the first game we've already, you've

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:29.120
already done Halo, but you, and we've already recognized games like miss nude world 96.

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.920
That's not really a shitty game.

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:31.920
It's actually fun.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.920
Yeah, that's true.

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:35.880
The technology in that game, the soundtrack, everybody move your body.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:41.560
Um, like I would do stuff like, I mean, night trap, night traps gotta be one of them.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:42.960
I think I might've done night trap.

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.960
I think you did too.

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:50.640
Um, I could do stuff like, um, Oh, like WCW thunder, which is one of the games that I

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.640
thought was so bad.

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640
I took it back.

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640
Oh God.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640
It's a good one.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.640
Oh yeah.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.640
Oh yeah.

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.640
Okay.

01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:58.640
I'll do yours.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.640
I mean, I'll just spoiler alert.

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:06.280
People don't fucking see that happening, which seriously, uh, what was all those games on

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.360
the 2,600 that caused the video game to crash?

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.680
Like the Chuck wagging pure in a Chuck wagon, like it was garbage.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.080
Uh, commercials were funny.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:14.560
What else on 2,600?

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.120
Not the, no adult games.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.120
Don't go.

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:19.280
So it's showing things like beat them and eat them.

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.280
Cause that's too easy.

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.280
That's gross.

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.280
Yeah.

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:23.280
But like, like, you know, there was et there's Pac-Man.

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.280
Yeah.

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.040
There's plenty of like, you just do a whole year of shitty 2,600 games and fill it up

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.040
like that.

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.440
Anyway.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.000
I mean, fuck I might even, I don't know.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Yeah.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
By the way, this is a completely off topic.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000
What else is new?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.080
I picked up one of the 1978 punk table tennis consoles that plugs into the little UHF.

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:44.080
Oh rad.

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.080
Thing.

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:46.080
Um, I haven't tested it or anything.

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.120
I paid like eight bucks for it, but I picked one up.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:52.480
Uh, the other thing that you picked up that you have yet to bring up on this show, fail,

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.880
fail, that you sent me a picture of last night.

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.320
Oh, well we don't own it.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.320
We're borrowing it.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.320
Still it's your house.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.080
I have, um, an Elvira scared stiff in my garage.

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.080
So cool.

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:03.080
Come play.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.080
I will.

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:05.080
I think I might.

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:06.080
Girl.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.080
Don't threaten me with any time.

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.560
Well, you know, um, Wednesday night is our classic gaming shit thing at my house.

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.240
Well, you know what I mean?

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:13.240
It's like we do it.

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:14.240
Um, we do it.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.240
Wow.

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.240
You hype it up so well.

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.240
Well, we, we do this thing.

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:20.240
Come over and have a shit time at dark soccer's shitty party.

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.240
I'll bake.

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.920
I'm going to be in there baking anyway, so fuck, cause I've got to bake for the sisters

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.840
and have to bake for Thanksgiving and have to bake for Dan's birthday, which is Friday.

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.080
So, I mean, what the fuck ever sisters coming over, I want to play pinball with them.

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:33.080
I don't think so.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.080
Really?

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:36.800
Cause I think, well, I mean, I'll invite the sisters, but I doubt they'd want to just play,

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.880
you know, Sega Saturn and Nintendo, but at any rate, um, but yeah, we do a classic gaming

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.840
thing on the night before Thanksgiving.

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.480
So you've been over for a couple of those.

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.480
Yeah.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.480
We've been before.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.080
Just dependent if we remember when we did the smash party.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.080
I do.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.080
Yeah.

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.080
So we did it.

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.080
One of our smash parties was like that.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:58.200
VGRealness says the stuff dark soccer bakes looks so damn good.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.800
Well, maybe dark soccer will have to send a care package.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.800
Maybe I will.

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:03.440
Even though Canadian Thanksgiving already happened.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.440
Well, yeah.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.440
Okay.

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440
Okay.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:07.440
I'll tell you what.

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.480
Message me on the Facebooks.

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.100
I will arrange a bake exchange with you.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:15.320
If your name is VGRealness or you're opening this up to everybody.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.320
In return for poutine.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.320
Oh, okay.

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.320
Are you opening this up to everybody or just VGRealness?

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320
No, just VGRealness.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.680
Cause VGRealness can get me Canada stuff.

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:22.680
Okay.

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:26.040
Just like freeze pack me some Tim Hortons.

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.960
I want some fucking ketchup chips.

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.560
No, no, no, no.

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.480
I have to look for Canadian stuff I want.

01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.480
So, but I will do it.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:35.120
Cause we can get all dressed here now.

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.120
I love all dressed.

01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:37.120
Oh my God.

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.120
But you know what?

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.120
But you know what?

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.520
If you do that, if we can set up a food trade and I will also send you C's candy.

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.520
Okay.

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.520
So anyway.

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.520
All right.

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:47.520
Moving on.

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.880
We actually, we have a break segment this week.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:50.880
I'm very excited.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.800
So we're going to take a quick break in studio, but for you guys that are watching along or

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.880
listening along on the podcast, this is great.

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.200
So we haven't talked a lot about Stadia tonight.

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.840
And that's because none of us have played it yet, but you know who has played it is

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.960
our voiceover guy VX Jason XV.

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.580
So he has worked very hard on this segment after he got his Stadia to give his impressions

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.580
for you guys.

01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:16.600
And so I'm very happy to debut it here tonight for you guys.

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.480
So I want to say a big preemptive, thank you to Jason for this.

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.740
I'm really excited to have this here on the show tonight.

01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:27.560
So without further ado, let's get to Jason's thoughts on Google Stadia.

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:44.080
Tonight, Jason gets more than 13 seconds of airtime.

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.760
I get to chat at you during this break about my feelings on Google Stadia, the next great

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.760
streaming game service.

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.360
What do I think about it?

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:53.560
Find out right now on orange voiceover radio.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.680
Google Stadia, Google's first grade foray into non-mobile gaming Stadia officially released

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:15.560
the week of November 18th, depending on where you live and your circumstances, you likely

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.340
received it someday that week.

01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:20.800
My account set up email came out on Wednesday, which I promptly opened and set up waiting

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:23.720
anxiously for the Stadia package to arrive the next day.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.400
And it did.

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:28.000
The Stadia package arrived on Thursday while I was still working.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I did open it up, inspect all the contents, take initial notes on all the hardware and

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.960
plugged in the controller to charge it just in case I decided to use it wirelessly.

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:40.200
You receive your color choice of a very typical looking console controller with a slight difference

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.200
in buttons.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.800
A double row of menu buttons on the top of the front face of the controller, a Stadia

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:49.040
button located in the same place as the PlayStation button on PlayStation style controllers.

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:53.760
It has PlayStation style analog sticks parallel to the bottom, yet Microsoft style face buttons,

01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:55.920
A on bottom, Y on top.

01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.120
There is also the requisite physical documentation with the lightest of details, a Chromecast

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.800
Ultra and its power brick.

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:05.480
The most noteworthy detail in all of this was that the Chromecast's power brick has

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.280
an ethernet port in it, which was neat.

01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:11.560
I've since learned this is a standard feature of the Chromecast Ultra, but I've never

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.920
used that before I received it in this package, so it's still neat.

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:19.080
I had a bunch of things to do on Thursday after I was done working, so the bulk of my

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:23.600
review time wasn't particularly extensive, it was only about a little bit over an hour.

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:27.680
As I do with all new systems, I spent the first amount of time going through the menus,

01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:33.480
and the first point of contention I faced was that when you use Stadia.com on a PC,

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.920
you have no access to the Stadia store.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.800
Both Stadia.com and playing via the Chromecast tell you to open the app to manage your Stadia

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.880
library or purchase games.

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:48.280
So I pull up my phone and claim the first two free Stadia Pro subscriber games, Samurai

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:52.480
Showdown, naturally the 2019 release, and Destiny 2, the collection.

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:56.520
Given the lack of time I had Thursday night, I opted for Samurai Showdown because I probably

01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:00.200
wouldn't even get through character creation in Destiny 2.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.480
Based off how playing Destiny went, I was correct in that assumption.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.400
Google has a gigantic leg up on content service providers.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:10.640
Their history, growth, and optimization for all things networking means that they have

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.760
data centers around the world, close to major internet hubs and in some cases even closer

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.200
to consumers.

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.360
This capacity is immense for their purposes alone, and grows even larger still since they

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.960
sell it to customers via Google Cloud.

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:25.640
And then there's the technical proficiency of the tools in use.

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:29.800
Their stewardship of the VP9 codec, the video codec they encode every YouTube video into

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:34.480
among others, means that they have gigantic amounts of source materials and tools to encode,

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.240
stream, and leverage the codec's capability.

01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:41.640
I assume Stadia's output is VP9, I don't actually know.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:45.520
There's been nothing in the Stadia interface that actually reports this, there's no technical

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:49.880
details right click option that I noticed, and I haven't done the research for it yet.

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:54.280
But if they don't use VP9 for this, I would be very surprised.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:57.280
So my Stadia controller had already been plugged in and was charging.

01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:02.320
I had to install Chrome in order to access Stadia.com on this PC as I hadn't yet.

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:07.080
And upon starting the Samurai Showdown, I immediately ran into something peculiar.

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:11.360
When you hit a button on any controller in Samurai Showdown for the first time, it displays

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:14.080
the confirmation that the device is in use.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.960
I had accidentally hit a key on the keyboard, and it said keyboard connected.

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:22.960
And then when I used the Stadia controller, it said player 2's controller is connected.

01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:23.960
Player 2.

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:24.960
Hmm.

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.840
And, unsurprisingly, Player 2's controller is not able to navigate the menus, so the

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:33.680
Stadia controller was doing, effectively, nothing in game.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.760
Okay, I have a lot of accessories plugged into this PC.

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:40.120
Is it Player 2 because the keyboard was pressed first?

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:43.480
Close the game, log back into it, hit the controller first.

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:44.480
Nope.

01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.120
Still Player 2 controller connected.

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:50.600
Look around at all my obvious things, my VR controllers are shut off, I do have the Xbox

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:53.240
wireless adapter plugged in, might have to remove that.

01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.360
Oh, wait a second.

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.680
My Xbox One controller didn't land on the dock correctly, so it was still on.

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:02.800
Okay, shut that off, restart the game just because of habits, and now the Stadia controller

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:04.600
connects for Player 1.

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:05.600
Hooray!

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:12.080
This was an immediate realization that the Stadia controller is seemingly not necessary.

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:19.200
The upfront $129 cost for Stadia now feels excessive, but more on that in a little bit.

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.460
Samurai Showdown played well.

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:22.960
There were no glaring visual imperfections to speak of.

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:27.840
I could tell a minor fuzzing and shine that I know has to do with re-encoding into lossy

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:30.480
codex, but only because I'm looking for it.

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:34.880
Only because I'm really staring at the sharp edge of static lines and text.

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:39.560
If you want an example of what this is and why it is, I recommend Tom Scott's video

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:44.040
Why Snow and Confetti Ruin YouTube Video Quality.

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:46.600
The weirdest thing about this is load times in the game.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.080
Between battles, there's still a 3-5 second load time.

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:54.840
Whenever I think of a server-backed system, I immediately expect the server to be powerful.

01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:59.860
More powerful than my PC, more powerful than whatever system I'm using to access it.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:05.120
The load time is likely no worse than it would be if locally on my PC, and giving every player

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:09.880
a super-powered PC doesn't really scale to the number of players I assume Google hopes

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:13.040
to achieve with this.

01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:17.040
The controls for Samurai Showdown felt a little rigid, but I think that's intentional Samurai

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:21.320
Showdown historically has always been a bit more strict, more so than Street Fighter,

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:23.240
way less floaty than Super Smash Bros.

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.360
But granted, this is also an assumption.

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.120
I haven't played Samurai Showdown since the original Neo Geo version, and I was never

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.480
any good at it.

01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:35.040
This isn't something that I can compare a feel against, because that varies from game

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:39.880
to game, and again, I don't have enough experience at Samurai Showdown.

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:42.680
This is something that's going to be best determined by something that I'm adequately

01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:46.560
experienced with, and as of this writing, the only games that I've played outside of

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:52.880
Stadia in its library are Thumper and Trials Rising, and I'm not really interested in re-buying

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.480
games.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.320
And that's a pretty big sticking point for me.

01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.940
I consider the library to be one of Stadia's two elephants in the room.

01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:02.320
I don't like the purchasing model.

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.280
Google Play should sell these games directly.

01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:10.800
This was my biggest complaint about OnLive, because if they fold and I lose my library,

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:11.800
that hurts.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.760
And as far as I'm aware, that's exactly what happened.

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:19.000
I didn't lose anything at the time, because they were waiving subscription charges, and

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.720
I just used the 30 minute free trials of all of the games that they offered.

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:25.480
I never bought anything directly through OnLive.

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:29.080
But all of this comes through as being a digital purchaser.

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.480
I've used Steam since its release in 2004.

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.660
I can't tell you the last time I bought a boxed PC game.

01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:39.720
Since about 2-3 years into the 3DS's life, and this entire generation of gaming consoles,

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:42.000
I have a strictly digital library.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.280
No Xbox discs.

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:44.520
No PS4 discs.

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.520
No Switch cartridges.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.040
Okay, that's a lie.

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.280
I have a disc of Titanfall for the Xbox One, but that's because I wanted the limited edition

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:54.440
box and the game came with, but it's still shrink-wrapped.

01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.960
And I already own the game digitally.

01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:00.440
I have a high degree of confidence in Microsoft and Sony staying power.

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.520
I had little confidence in OnLive staying power, and I'm on the fence about Google's

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.480
continued support of Stadia, so I'm kinda torn.

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.880
And this doesn't apply to Game Pass nor PS Now.

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:13.520
Those are both in addition to something you already have.

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.440
For Game Pass, you already have a PC or an Xbox One.

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.720
For PS Now, you already have a PlayStation, or a Vita, or a PlayStation TV.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:22.880
Do those still work if you already own them?

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.620
I don't actually know.

01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:29.600
But on that fact, the PlayStation TV, a product, died before PS Now.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.020
The service did.

01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:34.480
Game Pass and PlayStation Now can persist as long as those two companies are still in

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.740
the gaming business.

01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:38.700
And even if those services go away, there's a fallback.

01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:43.580
They still offer their digital library for use on hardware directly.

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:45.540
So then what is Stadia's fallback?

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:47.260
I don't know of one that already exists.

01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:49.540
I don't know if they've said there will be one.

01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:51.700
I do hope one comes.

01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:57.020
So going back to the $129 upfront cost, when you sit back and add it up, it's not unreasonable.

01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:03.740
For $129, you get a controller, $40, a Chromecast Ultra, $70, Stadia Pro for three months, which

01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:06.540
is a $30 value so far as they've announced so far.

01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:09.900
I'm not paying for Stadia Pro until February 2020.

01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:12.860
It does seem like Google is taking a bit of a loss here.

01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:16.740
I do think that allowing people that already have a game controller and a PC, which is

01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:21.580
many people, to pay $10 and just start playing games would have been a great decision on

01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:22.780
their part.

01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:26.580
After all, the point here is to not need powerful hardware.

01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:29.000
Okay, okay, enough about all this.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.300
Let's play some games.

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.300
Yeah, Samurai Shodown played well.

01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:34.740
I made it through a handful of rounds against CPU opponents.

01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:39.140
I dare not play human opponents because I'm not good at fighting games, and I didn't want

01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:41.060
to focus my attention on battles.

01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:46.380
I wanted to focus my attention on everything else that Stadia is offering about this experience.

01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:50.500
My first round of playing was on a Windows PC, ethernet wired directly into my router

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:54.500
using the Stadia controller via Google Chrome, and it held up really well.

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:59.800
As I said, I also played with my Xbox controller, which also worked, albeit without the convenience

01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:04.480
features the Stadia controller has for simple game exiting, nor the ability to take quick

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:07.360
screenshots and game clips, and so on and so forth.

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:09.240
I don't know what more I can say here.

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.520
Stadia held up on my network.

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:11.520
I used Comcast.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:16.840
It's rated at 85 megabits per second as an average download speed, sub 20 millisecond

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:22.240
latency, all of this to some speed test server that my router uses, and this is also on Amplify

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:23.740
router equipment.

01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:29.240
I played a game, and it felt good, which for being on some server somewhere reasonably

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:32.920
geographically close to me, I assume, is a good sign.

01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:34.560
My second round, I played Destiny.

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.680
I have played through the story of Destiny 1.

01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:41.460
I enjoy and play a lot of first person shooters, and this is probably more representative.

01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:47.200
Not only this, but this was also done on Stadia via the Chromecast, and I did not plug in

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.600
an ethernet cable.

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:53.040
I had slightly lower hopes for this because I know wireless latency, but I was still really

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:54.400
pleased with the result.

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:55.480
I set up my character.

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.960
I did the opening Guardian revival wake up and the initial quest to make it to the city,

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:04.400
and there were one or two points in which the quality stuttered a tiny little bit in

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:08.360
random moments, not like too much going on on the screen, anything like that.

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:12.080
I didn't notice if this actually impacted my inputs.

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:17.400
It was only notable for output video frame stutter, frame drops actually, and there were

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:21.120
at least two to three occasions where the output video quality dropped.

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:25.920
It was either a bitrate drop or a 4K downgrade to 1080p, maybe both.

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:30.560
I also was not playing this on a 4K TV, so I'm not sure.

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:34.320
Again, there's no technical indicators on the game screen to tell you anything like

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.720
this, at least as far as I've encountered.

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:41.400
There might be some indicator if the output channel fails outright for some reason, but

01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:45.600
that hasn't happened in my admittedly only few hours of playing so far.

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:49.920
The cute part of Stadia, socially speaking, was that the group of Guardians that I crossed

01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:53.840
paths with in the opening sequence showed up in my Recent Players section of the iOS

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.840
app.

01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:55.840
Cute.

01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:00.080
That said, I have not yet played Stadia via my phone nor a tablet.

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:03.200
So Stadia isn't bad, network conditions permitting.

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:08.160
If you have quality internet and network equipment, but lack any other high-powered devices, be

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:13.160
those being a console or a sufficiently powered PC, this could be a huge boon for you.

02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:17.160
I don't expect it to be an overwhelming success, because the players that would choose to use

02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:21.520
it are a subset of players that will put money into this hobby and don't already have

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:27.120
a console, don't have an up-to-date PC for these modern games, etc.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.520
But those players definitely exist.

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:32.560
For me, I need to go make some progress in Death Stranding.

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.440
So back to you, Studio N7.

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:39.540
All right.

02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:41.680
Thank you so much to Jason for that.

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:49.040
It was neat to hear the thoughts on Google Stadia, especially not just all the bad stuff

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:52.960
or the hang-ups or even just all the good stuff, but I liked that Jason took a deeper

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:56.200
dive there and was talking a little bit about some of the things under the hood and was

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.800
actually showing the app.

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:02.440
I had no idea that that was a thing, the app would show you who you were actually playing

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.440
with and things like that.

02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.440
So that part was kind of neat.

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.560
So thank you.

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.320
And folks in chat, give me some kudos as well.

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:14.720
We have some folks also in chat are noticing that we have a plus one now in Studio.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:18.120
So Alan has taken a seat and joined us here in Studio.

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:19.120
Hi, Alan.

02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.120
How are you?

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:21.120
Nice to have you back on the show.

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.120
Hello.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.120
Hi.

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.120
I'm here against my will.

02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.120
Now, come on.

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:26.280
Come on.

02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:28.000
You make people think I'm so mean.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.000
But no, I had to have you because I think you know about a certain news item that came

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
out this week.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Yes.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
And you know, I don't play Half-Life.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000
He doesn't play Half-Life.

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:41.720
So when it comes to the resident Half-Life stand in the house, that would be you.

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.480
So you love Half-Life, right?

02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:44.480
I do.

02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:48.920
And what is it about the Half-Life games that just you love?

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:57.720
It really was the first FPS to incorporate narrative storytelling into the gameplay without

02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:59.440
use of cutscenes.

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:03.360
Because well, cutscenes back then in the late 90s weren't really a thing to begin with.

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.320
I mean, outside of RPGs rather.

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:19.120
So just, it's like, it's really like deep sci-fi without being too convoluted.

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:24.000
It's yeah, I just think gameplay is great.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Okay.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.480
So obviously, I think you heard the big news this week about Half-Life.

02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:31.760
They didn't announce Half-Life 3, but they announced a new Half-Life game of some sort,

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.760
right?

02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:35.640
So I'm sure you have seen all the news on Half-Life, Alex.

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:36.640
Yes.

02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:37.640
So what are your thoughts?

02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.640
Are we going to have to buy a VR setup?

02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:47.660
There's a scene in the show Mad Men where Don Draper is in like an elevator with this

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.720
junior associate.

02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:57.640
And the junior associates talking to Mr. Draper and he says, you know, buddy, I'm really worried

02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:58.640
about you.

02:02:58.640 --> 02:02:59.640
I worry about you.

02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:03.320
And he says, I don't think about you at all.

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:04.320
That's sort of his retort.

02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.800
I don't, I feel nothing about this announcement.

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:10.920
I don't mean that pejoratively.

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:19.080
I've been, I've so absolutely made peace with the fact that I'm not going to get Half-Life

02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:23.740
3, that I don't feel, there's like, there's like a hole.

02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:26.000
There's a vacuum where my heart should be.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.120
And I'm like, oh, anyway.

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:30.120
So I'm hungry.

02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.600
Do you want to go to Chipotle?

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:40.160
It's really, it's sort of like, it's like the dad that leaves when you're three and

02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:43.120
you and your mom grew up to be fine.

02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:45.240
And then you find out like, oh yeah, he's alive.

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:46.240
He's living in Texas.

02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.280
Do you want to go meet him?

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:52.760
And it's like, I don't bear any ill will towards this person, but like, I don't know him.

02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:58.760
He's a stranger, you know, like, it's so.

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:03.800
That's really what I'm getting at.

02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:05.800
It looks, it looks well-made.

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:11.640
The biggest thing, it's a relief that knowing that Valve has like an A programming team

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:14.160
that still makes games, that was the revelation.

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:17.820
I was like, it wasn't so much, oh fuck, it's like new Half-Life.

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:23.560
It was more, Valve has a video game that isn't just the maintenance team for Dota and Team

02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:24.560
Fortress 2.

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:26.000
This is incredible.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.600
They make blue chip products still.

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:37.460
That's really what I, that was the stunner for me, but I don't care for the fact that

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:48.480
it takes place between Half-Life 1 and 2 or particularly before Half-Life 2.

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:53.080
There was a rumor that at the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 3, Gordon was going to die and then

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.960
it's sort of revealed, like the G-Man comes out and reveals that Alex was always like

02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:01.200
the chosen one and Gordon was sort of like a means to an end to get her to a certain

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.200
point.

02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:09.520
So, I love Alex as one of the best sort of like side NPC characters like ever made.

02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:14.880
So Alex is incredible, but yeah, the fact that it's sort of like a weird timeline thing

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:17.320
that they wedged in, I don't care about VR.

02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:21.940
I think that this is going to be the killer app that VR needs for people to pay attention

02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:27.320
to it because Beat Saber was, I think, the killer app for a lot of people.

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.240
But even then, it's kind of a music game.

02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:30.240
There's a novelty to it.

02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:31.620
I think Beat Saber is incredible.

02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:35.420
It's a killer app, but it's one killer app.

02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:36.420
Yes.

02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:44.340
There's still a point of entry with, because like there's the PlayStation VR.

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:50.800
To use like a Vive or the Oculus, you need a computer to go with it that's still pretty

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:51.800
powerful.

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:54.980
People were saying five years ago that PC gaming was going to be dead.

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:57.480
That turned out to be a complete and utter lie.

02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:02.760
PC gaming is a strong, they're porting stuff to PC that's like years and years old just

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:04.340
because they can.

02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:12.080
Like you've got Square releasing Saga Frontier 3 or Saga 3 on Switch, but also PC because

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:13.080
why not?

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.080
Well, we did it for Android.

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:15.080
Might as well.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:16.080
Yeah.

02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:20.240
So PC gaming is as relevant as it's ever been.

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:26.040
The fact that the point of entry with, and also, so like I don't, I'm sure it'll get

02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:30.880
cracked so that you don't need a VR device to play it because it's going to run off PC

02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:38.040
that then runs through your Oculus or to your Vive, whatever is a Valve compatible VR device.

02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:42.240
But like, I don't care about that.

02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:49.080
And this also does sort of give credence to the rumor that the reason why Gabe, I'm going

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:55.840
off, like I'll talk like this for the next three hours if you want, is chat enjoying

02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:56.840
this?

02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.920
Well, I was going to ask you about this because you call it Vive.

02:06:58.920 --> 02:06:59.920
I thought it was Vive.

02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:00.920
Vive, whatever.

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.020
No, they like your analogy.

02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:06.200
So please keep going.

02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:12.920
So I lost, I lost my train of thought.

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:16.140
You're talking about hacker because we got into this earlier in the show is that hackers

02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:22.020
are inevitably going to make you able to play this VR game on your keyboard and mouse.

02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:23.020
Possibly.

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:24.280
Is that really going to work?

02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:27.880
Because certainly the reason why this is in VR is that there's going to be certain things

02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:32.300
like you have to do this with your hands or you have to do this certain motion that might

02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:34.700
not translate very well into keyboard and mouse.

02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:40.580
So not only is somebody going to have to hack it to play on the monitor and keyboard, mouse,

02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:44.340
but somebody is going to have to hack the control scheme to get around things that are

02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:47.900
going to be very VR specific.

02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:55.620
So I'm not really interested in upgrading my PC to support whatever device it is.

02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:57.700
I have other things to spend money on.

02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:04.700
I'm glad that Half-Life fans, I think we're all like, I mean, oh, I remember what I was

02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:07.060
going to say.

02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:13.940
There was a rumor that the reason why Gabe didn't want to do Half-Life 3 is because he

02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:19.740
considers Half-Life to be this thing that has to show off the next evolution of gaming

02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:23.380
or whatever weird BS like had lost up his ass that he is.

02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:27.620
Because with Half-Life 2, it was twofold.

02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:31.980
It was the physics engine that was Source 2, which at the time was revolutionary, and

02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:37.020
the physics and weight puzzles that were in Half-Life 2, and then also Half-Life 2 was

02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:42.020
their modality of launching Steam.

02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:48.900
And Marc Laidlaw basically released the script for Episode 3 because it had been so goddamn

02:08:48.900 --> 02:09:02.380
long that the NDA had run out, so he's like, here's what the script of Episode 3 was.

02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:08.060
And I guess Gabe was like, no, I'm not going to make Half-Life 3 unless we have something

02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:11.740
worthy of it technology-wise to show off.

02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:13.900
That was always a weird rumor.

02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:19.420
And the fact that Gabe dined from his ivory tower, yes, here's a little crumb, a little

02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:20.900
morsel of Half-Life content.

02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:26.660
The fact that it's attached to what is probably the best big-budget VR title that we're going

02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:31.980
to see for a very long time, that sort of gives credence to that theory that Gabe doesn't

02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:37.260
want to put Half-Life on things that aren't revolutionary, whatever buzzwordy definition

02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:38.260
of that.

02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:46.940
My point is that I'm not surprised that we are finally seeing Half-Life content attached

02:09:46.940 --> 02:09:51.140
to VR because VR is sort of the thing where the technology's there, it looks great, it

02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:52.860
plays great.

02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:54.060
People don't care yet.

02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:57.900
And is Half-Life Alyx going to make them care?

02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:03.620
It's going to be closer than they ever have been in the past.

02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:06.780
I will say the takeaway that I took from the trailer, and not to repeat myself too much

02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:10.220
because we already got into this earlier in the show, but for your benefit, I'm not the

02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:16.700
big Half-Life fan, you are, I appreciate it, I understand why it's popular and all that.

02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:21.420
But I was more taken back like, ooh, this is pretty, are they going to use this engine

02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:22.420
to make more games?

02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:23.420
Is this the new source?

02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:26.660
Is this what my Portal 3 is going to look like?

02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:30.420
Is this what my future Valve games are going to look like?

02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:34.420
But Half-Life VR, meh, not my thing.

02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:39.100
So the fact that it's wedged into the current timeline, it's not a sequel to either Episode

02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:47.980
2 or whatever, the fact that it's VR, I'm so pleased to see that the programmers, the

02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:53.180
software developers who work at Valve haven't just been getting a paycheck with no product

02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:58.100
for the last, I don't know, what is the last real big blue chip Valve game that they, what

02:10:58.100 --> 02:10:59.100
is Dota, right?

02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:00.100
Dota's the last big thing they put out?

02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:06.260
Probably Dota 2, unless you were to count the pack-in stuff, the stuff that shows off

02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:07.260
the Vive.

02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:08.260
Yeah.

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.260
Vive, whatever.

02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:15.220
The cute little portal, there's a launching game in a warehouse, so there's a little mini

02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:16.420
game collection, Wii games.

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:21.900
The fact that the developers at Valve were given an opportunity to program something

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:26.060
big budget and A-list, for me, is an epiphany.

02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:33.040
I thought that they gave up eight, nine years ago and they were just letting Steam break

02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:34.120
in billions for them.

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:40.980
So the fact that they just even made a game is great, but I'm not, I don't, again, it's

02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:46.900
like there's a vacuum where my heart should be, it's not pejorative, I just, I want, it's

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:48.900
been so long that I want more.

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.460
I don't care about this.

02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:52.220
All right.

02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:54.980
So there you go, folks.

02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:58.340
Are you going to go and revisit the old Half-Life games as you do?

02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:01.460
Like once a year, I see you firing up Black Mesa.

02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:02.460
Yeah.

02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:07.060
They nerve, well, they, they, I played the Zen update for Black Mesa, which came out,

02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:08.300
I think, four or five months ago.

02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:10.380
If you haven't played it, it's incredible.

02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:16.900
I think they've released the chapter after the big head, the, whatever the big headcrab

02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:19.140
boss behemoth is.

02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:24.260
So I haven't played that, so there's still Black Mesa content I need to follow up on,

02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:30.020
or I may just wait for them to actually put out the whole rest of Zen because there's

02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:32.700
only like one or two chapters left and then the game's done.

02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:40.540
Um, so yeah, I will revisit Half-Life one and two and Black Mesa at some point, but

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:45.380
Half-Life Alex, I'm sure I'm, of course I'm going to play it at some point, but like 10

02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:49.500
years from now, five years from now, borrow his VR, whatever.

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:50.500
It's cool.

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:52.940
I like Alex fine.

02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:54.780
It's just, I've, I've moved on.

02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:56.420
I've grown as a person.

02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:57.860
You waited too long, Gabe.

02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:58.860
I don't care.

02:12:58.860 --> 02:12:59.860
Um, yeah.

02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:00.860
All right.

02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:08.260
Um, do you have any thoughts, Matt, cause I see you kind of eye in the mic.

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:09.260
No I don't.

02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:10.820
I mean, I'll, I'll check it out when it comes out.

02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:13.820
I mean, I'm sure it won't be that expensive of a game, so.

02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:19.020
So we've derailed a bit from, uh, the, the show role as, as listed on the television

02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:20.020
screen.

02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:23.500
But I do want to, since we do have Alan here, I want to ask you about one other thing.

02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:27.940
So, um, you're not really playing Half-Life at the moment and it doesn't sound like you're

02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:32.280
going to be playing Half-Life Alex anytime in the future, but I noticed you have been

02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:33.280
playing.

02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:34.280
What have you been playing?

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:35.980
I, you know, I got to ask you about this one.

02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:37.340
So what have you been playing?

02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:39.940
I, we talked about this the last time you had me on the show.

02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:40.940
Did we?

02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:41.940
Yeah.

02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:46.500
Cause I, I told, I said, everyone Google project brutality three and I saw Matt Google it right

02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:47.500
here.

02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:48.500
Um, it's doom.

02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:49.500
Doom mods.

02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:52.620
So it's the same thing you talked about weeks ago on the show, I thought you were doing

02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:53.620
something new with it.

02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:54.620
You haven't beat it yet?

02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:55.620
Well, no.

02:13:55.620 --> 02:14:03.540
Um, I've been, I, I've, you, it has all of these new enemies and you sort of can control

02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:06.980
like what randomization it has for the enemies and weapons.

02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:09.940
So I play it and then I bump it up a notch.

02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:14.820
Like I want, I want these really impossible monsters to spawn on level three instead of

02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:19.100
level eight and then level eight is going to have like even more terrifying stuff.

02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:22.780
So I've just been playing around with the config, the, the, it's, it's an incredible

02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:23.780
mod.

02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:24.780
There's like dozens of options.

02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:26.220
So that's still got my attention.

02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:29.260
It's just funny when I kind of peeked my head on it cause we still have that giant green

02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:31.260
screen that separates the two sides of the office.

02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:33.860
So I peeked my head over on your side of the office, I'm like, you're still playing doom.

02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:35.580
Do you know how old that game is?

02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:36.580
Yeah.

02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:40.100
And then, so you, you, you said, and this is funny, I hope that chat, you enjoy this,

02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:42.140
the viewers at home.

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:46.800
You said, so you're still playing doom, but you've modded it to death, right?

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:48.140
And I said yes.

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:54.420
And then I press the G key and I throw a grenade and he's like, why did you throw a grenade?

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:55.860
You can't throw grenades in doom.

02:14:55.860 --> 02:15:00.220
And I looked at Rob and I said, the words that just came out of your mouth were modded

02:15:00.220 --> 02:15:02.460
it to death.

02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:03.860
What does that mean?

02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:05.220
You can leave my program.

02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.220
Yes.

02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:09.140
Give the mic to Loki and remove yourself from the stage.

02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:10.140
Thank you.

02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:11.140
All right.

02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:12.140
Thanks for your thoughts.

02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:15.260
They have mods available where you can fuck the enemies in the game because they turn

02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:21.980
into hentai women or hentai, there's anything you could possibly do in doom you can do.

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:24.300
So throwing grenades is the least difficult.

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:27.940
In all seriousness, thanks to Alan for letting me put him on the spot with his half-life

02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:28.940
impressions.

02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:29.940
He did a very good job with that.

02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:31.580
So I appreciate it as always.

02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:35.780
For now though, let's get back into what we have coming up with our rapid fire news.

02:15:35.780 --> 02:15:36.780
Loki.

02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:40.460
I didn't even realize this is how often I play racing games nowadays, but I didn't even

02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:46.940
realize that Toyota has been holding out from putting their cars in games.

02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:47.940
So that's the thing.

02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:53.200
Apparently since 2017, they have not been including their games in racing games.

02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:54.420
But now that's going to change.

02:15:54.420 --> 02:16:00.420
Apparently they're going to start putting them back into games starting with Forza.

02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:07.660
So there on December 12th, Forza 4 is going to get the 1998 Toyota Supra RZ as part of

02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:10.500
the series 17 update.

02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:13.260
Interesting indeed.

02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:16.540
Someone was asking them about Need for Speed and apparently they said they didn't want

02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:18.380
to promote illegal street racing.

02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:19.380
Oh wow.

02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:20.380
Dude, come on.

02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:21.380
Oh wow.

02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:22.620
Like, dude, seriously, really?

02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:23.620
It's a video game.

02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:24.620
Give me a play.

02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:26.860
Like all the other companies are doing it.

02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:27.860
Seriously.

02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:28.860
Stupid.

02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:29.860
But, yeah.

02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:35.840
Funny enough, since we were just talking about Doom, if you're interested in 90s shooters

02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:40.360
like the such, you might want to check out Hellbound, which apparently is going to be

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:41.560
coming out pretty soon.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:49.200
They have a demo that is available that you can check out and it looks pretty awesome.

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:53.320
Very much a Doomquake vibe going on there.

02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:54.920
And that's available on Steam.

02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:55.920
Alright.

02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:58.680
Yay demos.

02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:02.800
For those of you that are into Pokemon Go, the details have been announced for Community

02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:04.280
Day for December.

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:08.520
So like last year, it's going to be an encore weekend, so you can catch all of the Community

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:12.400
Day Pokemon from prior Community Days in 2019.

02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:15.840
So it will be boosted all weekend and then I think there's special events that happen

02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:21.800
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. where you get the catch Stardust, the catch XP and half egg distance.

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:26.600
And if I remember right, that's the time when the shinies really show up too, is that same

02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:27.760
like three hour period.

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:31.360
So if you really want shinies, that's the time to play the game.

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:35.660
So Community Day weekend, but from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. everything will be boosted.

02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:40.760
So you can check that all out on Saturday, December 14th, as well as Sunday, December

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:41.760
15th.

02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:42.760
That's pretty cool.

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:47.160
I wish they did stuff like around holidays, like Thanksgiving.

02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:49.920
I think they have something for the day.

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.880
There's a Team Rocket event going on right now and I thought there was something about

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:57.800
you can trade like half Stardust trading and I think you can do two special trades a day

02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:00.240
and that's going to start like the Thanksgiving weekend.

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.000
And I thought it was really well timed because you're going to have people that are visiting

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.200
from far away, visiting family.

02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:10.320
So it's the time where people are going to be like, oh, here's my regional, you know,

02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:11.320
you can pick this up.

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:12.620
That's going to be pretty cool.

02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:15.120
So that is coming to the game also.

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:18.160
And I should mention this because a lot of people are excited about this.

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:23.440
Any Pokemon you evolve during that time frame will get the community move from the Community

02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:24.440
Day.

02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:26.480
So you have a second chance to get the special move.

02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:31.960
What's important about this is that that part of it is not just 2019, it's 2018 as well.

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.920
So some people have been sitting on a hundred percent Larvatars for a long time waiting

02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:39.240
to get a Tyranitar with the special move that's only from Community Day.

02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:42.200
So you will have that chance during December Community Day.

02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:44.200
So people are very hyped about that.

02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:46.320
So all right.

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:51.040
Also we should talk a little bit about Steam Remote Play together because that is now out

02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:52.040
of beta.

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:53.040
That is awesome.

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.480
And they have a sale going on to promote it.

02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:55.480
They do.

02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:58.960
If you are not familiar with Steam Remote Play together, it's pretty much PlayStation

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:01.240
4 SharePlay, but it's on Steam.

02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:02.700
You can play local multiplayer.

02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:07.240
So even if your game doesn't support online, you can do local multiplayer.

02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:11.260
And then this also will work with cross platform play.

02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:16.480
So I could be on Windows and Dark Soccer could be on Mac and Loki could be on Linux and we

02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:17.480
could still all play together.

02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:18.480
So that's pretty cool.

02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:20.960
It's still all through like Steam.

02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.820
Are you saying that super multitasking versus I'm going to actually build a plague?

02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:30.080
You may remember we asked Darren about that when he was here announcing it.

02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:32.300
And he's not building it with that in mind.

02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:36.080
He's building it for, you know, the expos and same room and all that.

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.080
And I think.

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:38.080
But no, no, no.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.080
But this could be.

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.080
No, this works with all.

02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:41.080
I know.

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:42.080
I know.

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:46.040
But you if there's any lag, you know how that game can be very unforgiving.

02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:49.520
So if any lag comes into it or what have you, you know, like, would you play a music game

02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.880
over share play?

02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:56.680
Well, yeah, so maybe the lag, you know, will it work?

02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:57.680
Yes.

02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:58.680
Will it work?

02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:01.480
Well, to be determined, but will it blend?

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:02.480
Yes.

02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:04.400
And unofficially or it's unofficial.

02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:07.120
It's not supported by the death, I guess would be a way to say that.

02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:08.120
All right.

02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:09.720
Anyway, Dark Soccer, you have a few things for us.

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:15.080
Soul Calibur six season two will actually be starting tomorrow, November 25th for us

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:16.080
here on Sunday.

02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:23.480
And it has a downloadable character Hilda will be on November 26th, along with the creation

02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:28.760
parts set C as stated by Bandai Namco.

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:35.680
It will she's got there actually will be a soul attack and resist impact battle systems.

02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:40.840
New stage called Silver Wolves Haven and a training exclusive stage called Grand Labyrinth

02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:42.480
Sealed Corridor.

02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:44.760
Different UI stuff, too.

02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:52.800
And season two will also introduce three other characters, including Haomaru from Samurai

02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:54.800
Showdown.

02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:58.840
And let me see if we can get the other two while I'm here.

02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:05.560
Cassandra and I don't see who else Cassandra, Haomaru, Hilda.

02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:06.560
So, yeah.

02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:12.040
And then also in other news, which I'm sure a lot of people were aware of, is that Arc

02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:17.120
System Works has a trailer for new Guilty Gear coming out and it's going to be called

02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:20.520
Guilty Gear Strive.

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:23.320
I had actually already been looking at that because I was kind of thinking of cosplaying

02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:24.320
Mei.

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:25.320
So.

02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:32.800
But the trailer came out and it's rebranded a few things around there, brought in some

02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:37.920
old school characters like Chip and Mei and Potemkin and Soul Bad Guy, who just has the

02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:39.400
best name.

02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:49.800
So I'm actually bringing out bringing back from the first Guilty Gear Dr. Baldhead, who

02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:51.280
became Faust.

02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:54.280
So but I think they're bringing him back as that role.

02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:55.280
So that'd be cool.

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:56.280
That's it.

02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:57.280
All right.

02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:58.280
Cool.

02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:01.880
We're going to now travel around the world and check out release dates.

02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:04.920
I have a feeling this is going to be a quick segment, at least certainly the U.S. part

02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:05.920
of it.

02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:06.920
I can't imagine it's going to be hopping.

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:10.720
It is a very Japanese week, ironically.

02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:16.760
So the two games we have coming out this week, Cyber Troopers Virtual On Masterpiece 1995

02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:24.280
to 2001 on PlayStation 4 and SD Gundam G Generation Cross Rays on PC.

02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:25.280
That's it.

02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:26.280
That's it.

02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:27.800
Well, happy Thanksgiving from Japan.

02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:28.800
To be expected.

02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:33.440
Now, funny, going over to Japan, you still have some releases, because obviously Thanksgiving

02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:38.080
is not a factor over there, but we do have some releases this week in Japan, including

02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:42.280
on the PlayStation 4 this week, 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.

02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:46.340
We also have that same SD Gundam Generation Cross Rays, which is also out in Japan, perhaps

02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:49.720
why it's timed for the world at the same time.

02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:55.880
And then we also have Aibea comes out in regular and premium editions this week, as well as

02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:58.360
Amamain comes out this week.

02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:02.520
And then we get A Plague Tale Innocence and a price reduction just in time for the next

02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.680
season, Soul Calibur 6.

02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:06.720
Price reduction also coming in for Days Gone.

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:10.000
But here's the title of the week.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.640
Here's the name that got me.

02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:18.520
So coming to the PlayStation 4 this week from Maker's 5 or Publishers 5 PB is the game.

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:21.320
Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:24.840
Infinite combat.

02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:29.520
And so, of course, I had to look like I was like, what the fuck and get this on the battlefield.

02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:34.840
Well, I should have known that's an anime based on the popular anime.

02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:37.320
Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:41.880
Infinite combat will let you play from the perspective of the protagonists and they will

02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:44.880
head into dungeons and interact with characters in the dungeons.

02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:47.760
So is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:52.480
I guess find out when that title releases this week on PlayStation 4 in Japan.

02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:57.320
Looking quickly at the Nintendo Switch to see if there's anything I should note here

02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:01.760
because if I clicked the wrong thing and accidentally brought up Nintendo 3DS, which is not looking

02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:02.760
great.

02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:09.000
But on the Switch, yes, we have that same SD Gundam game is out there too.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.600
Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:16.680
The only, oh, we have two new ones that aren't on PlayStation, Flowers, which is not to be

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:19.140
confused with the Journey Flower game.

02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:23.720
This is another one that looks like it's based off an anime or manga.

02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:29.860
And then Japanese Rail Sim 3D Journey to Kyoto comes out this week.

02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:31.040
And that looks really pretty.

02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:35.020
It's just like the train on the front cover is going through this very like flowery type

02:24:35.020 --> 02:24:36.920
of village and it's a pink train.

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:37.920
So fun.

02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:39.220
There's a Hello Kitty train.

02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:40.220
Yeah.

02:24:40.220 --> 02:24:43.260
So if you want to travel on a train from your Nintendo Switch, you can import that lovely

02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:45.140
title from Japan.

02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:46.700
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:47.700
Three games.

02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:51.140
I thought I had already mentioned, but apparently I guess they moved the date or something.

02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:57.380
The Asterix Novelics game is coming out on November 27th for the big three.

02:24:57.380 --> 02:25:00.820
And then for Switch, we have Black Sad Under the Skin.

02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:04.740
This kind of almost like a modern noir from the picture.

02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:10.820
And then on the 28th, also Honor and Duty D-Day All Out War Edition.

02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:11.820
That's it.

02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:12.820
All right.

02:25:12.820 --> 02:25:15.220
SSJ100Matt in chat says, this is cracking me up.

02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:16.420
I don't know why.

02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:21.660
It's a comment about the train sim game that I said, as 200 Matt says, there better be

02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:24.340
some train drifting action.

02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:27.780
And that makes me laugh because I'm like, that would be actually really funny.

02:25:27.780 --> 02:25:30.940
Can you imagine like a high speed train racing game?

02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.180
Have you not seen YouTube?

02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:33.700
Oh, is that a thing?

02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:34.700
It is a thing.

02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:36.940
They have a game that is train drifting.

02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:37.940
Really?

02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:38.940
They do.

02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:39.940
It is a real thing.

02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:40.940
Okay.

02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:41.940
Is the train actually on rails or?

02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:42.940
It is on rails.

02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:43.940
Wow.

02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:45.340
It's a ridiculous game.

02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:49.740
They actually did it during one of the AGD queues.

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:53.300
I don't remember the name, but there is, it is a thing.

02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:54.300
Okay.

02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:55.300
And it is awesome.

02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:57.500
I was just thinking how funny it would be if you had a game like Mario Kart, but you

02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:02.580
were driving this car that was just like pulling 20 cars behind it.

02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:09.020
And so it turns into like Mario Kart and Snake at the same time or Tron light bikes or something

02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:10.020
like that.

02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:15.300
It's called Densha de lightning stage.

02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:17.700
It's in the Densha de Go! series.

02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:20.820
And Orange Right just gets a gold star for naming it first in chat.

02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:21.820
There you go.

02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:25.460
They did it AGD queue 2018 and it was hilarious.

02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:26.940
All right.

02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:27.940
Let's move on to the mailbag.

02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:30.340
I think we have at least one letter tonight.

02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:32.860
Participate at orangelaungerator.com is the place to send emails.

02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:33.860
Dark Sakura.

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:35.860
We have two actually.

02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:38.460
One of them I can only read partially.

02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:42.740
So one, um, uh, it's from Ferto Swagons.

02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:45.540
I'm going to be nice.

02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:46.540
Hey, OLR.

02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:49.100
If you were forced to pick only one game to play for the rest of your life, what game

02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:50.660
would you choose?

02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:54.020
First of all, I wouldn't choose because I don't have to.

02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:55.340
Question really makes no sense to me.

02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:56.700
It's just a fun hypothetical.

02:26:56.700 --> 02:26:58.940
These hypotheticals are illogical.

02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:00.340
I don't know.

02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:01.340
People want to know.

02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:02.340
All right.

02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:05.180
Look, I'll answer it because I'm going to be that bitch and be the genie or excuse me,

02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:07.900
the one that wishes for more wishes when the genie comes out.

02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:11.420
Because the game I would pick would be Little Big Planet.

02:27:11.420 --> 02:27:15.740
I guess namely Little Big Planet 3 because I could get Little Big Planet 1 and 2 because

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:18.820
I could play other games that people have made.

02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:21.620
Mario Maker would be a really good choice in that regard too.

02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:26.300
Or I suppose Dreams might be the ultimate game to pick for that.

02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:29.900
So that is my clever little tongue in cheek way around.

02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:35.060
I would pick my 20, like 285 in one cartridge for Super Nintendo.

02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:36.060
There you go.

02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:38.180
See, it's not that hard a question to answer.

02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:44.780
But in all seriousness, even though I kind of joke that that's a way to wish for more

02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:49.500
wishes, at the same time, actually Little Big Planet was a really fucking solid platforming

02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:50.740
game that was a lot of fun.

02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:55.380
And like Mario Maker, I mean, Super Mario is one of the, it was my favorite game of

02:27:55.380 --> 02:27:56.380
the year.

02:27:56.380 --> 02:28:01.220
And honestly, even without the fact that I'm essentially getting more games in one with

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:05.080
those picks, they would be worthy selections.

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:08.220
I mean, I guess otherwise I'd say, what, Super Metroid, duh.

02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:11.700
Loki, do you have a game, one game for the rest of your life?

02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:12.700
One game?

02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:15.420
If I'm going to pick a game for the rest of my life, it's going to be fucking laser

02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:16.420
tag.

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:17.420
Oh, okay.

02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:19.700
Except I would have to pick a specific laser tag.

02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:24.420
So did you know your laser tag over here is a portal now?

02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:26.380
The one that you, the new one that you...

02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:27.780
The new laser tag is a portal?

02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:29.100
It's a portal.

02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:34.460
Why can that be a portal, but the one I suggested back in May is not a fucking anything yet

02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:37.020
because it's sitting there in goddamn limbo.

02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:40.380
But that place, it has nothing of fucking significance there.

02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:41.380
I know why.

02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:42.380
I know why.

02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:46.220
Because the player that submitted it has an Onyx reviewing badge, so like all her stuff

02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:47.220
gets upgraded.

02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:48.220
God fucking damn it.

02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:49.220
I swear to God.

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.220
All right.

02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:51.220
Anyway, uh, next email.

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:54.220
Oh, is this the one I can't read?

02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:58.740
Um, because it really, it's, well, okay, I'll go ahead and read it.

02:28:58.740 --> 02:28:59.740
Okay.

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:00.740
This is from Robert.

02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:03.300
I don't know why it was sent for this, but I'll go ahead and read it.

02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:06.140
Um, updating, actually, I'm not going to read it because there's a lot of stuff in here

02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:07.140
that's wrong.

02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:12.780
Um, because first of all, Mac OS 8 came out about 25 years ago and he's talking about

02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:14.340
current operating systems.

02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:17.420
So Mac OS 8 doesn't work, doesn't function on anything modern.

02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:19.900
So and iOS 10 is three years old.

02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:21.420
We're on iOS 13 now.

02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:22.420
Okay.

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:23.420
If we're not reading it, then don't read it.

02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:25.620
Is there a part of it that we are going to read?

02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:26.620
Um, no.

02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:29.620
Um, I'm just going to basically say, I said, and I replied to him that I was going to acknowledge

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:32.020
that he sent me email and thank you for writing in.

02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:33.540
We'll talk about this one privately.

02:29:33.540 --> 02:29:34.540
Oh, okay.

02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:35.540
Yeah.

02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:36.540
That's all.

02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:37.540
So that's it.

02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:38.940
Well, it's not every day.

02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:40.540
Someone gets a personal response from dark soccer.

02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:45.100
He got two personal responses because he was sending me, uh, uh, uh, something that should

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:48.940
have gone to another podcast on our network.

02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:49.940
Oh, okay.

02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:52.220
But it's in a, but I'll just say this right now.

02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:57.060
It's inappropriate to send it to our participate inbox instead of reaching out directly to

02:29:57.060 --> 02:30:00.220
contact the proprietor of the podcast or was it negative?

02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:01.220
No, it wasn't.

02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:02.220
Oh, okay.

02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:04.740
But it's still, we check this box like once a week.

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:05.740
Oh yeah.

02:30:05.740 --> 02:30:06.740
Yeah.

02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:07.740
No, it's just your message isn't going to get.

02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:08.740
Yeah.

02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:09.740
It's not going to get to them in a timely manner.

02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:12.340
And on top of that, again, if it's an important enough message like that, you need to reach

02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:15.740
out to the proprietor of that particular podcast.

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:16.740
I'm curious what it is.

02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:17.740
I didn't see it.

02:30:17.740 --> 02:30:18.740
So I'll tell you what it was later.

02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:19.740
All right.

02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:20.740
That's fine.

02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:21.740
All right.

02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:24.420
Oh, Bobby says he got it too.

02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:25.420
That's so interesting.

02:30:25.420 --> 02:30:26.420
All right.

02:30:26.420 --> 02:30:28.580
Anyway, so again, and I, I just wasn't my message.

02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:29.580
It's inappropriate.

02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:31.140
Go ahead and contact them directly.

02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:32.140
Okay.

02:30:32.140 --> 02:30:33.140
All right.

02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:34.140
Well, let's move on.

02:30:34.140 --> 02:30:37.140
I think we have some more stories to get to, so we'll start with you.

02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:38.140
Loki.

02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:39.140
What do you have next?

02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:40.140
So this is pretty cool.

02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:47.340
Someone had taken it upon themselves to port over, um, super Mario land to the super Nintendo.

02:30:47.340 --> 02:30:50.700
So they dubbed it new super Mario land.

02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:54.340
It is basically recreating the whole game from scratch.

02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:55.700
It is not a rom hack.

02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:57.740
It is its own thing.

02:30:57.740 --> 02:31:02.080
It actually has four player multiplayer in it as well, and apparently pushes the super

02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:06.260
Nintendo to its limits as far as what it's able to do.

02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:11.020
Um, what they've done with some of the animation is basically kind of have the crappiest like

02:31:11.020 --> 02:31:12.500
20 second clip.

02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:14.820
Oh, I had it on top of that.

02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:15.820
They're not going to release it.

02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:19.920
That's the annoying part because he did it as a Christmas present.

02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:22.000
The thing is, okay.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:26.200
The other clip that you're thinking of was like some dude's YouTube and I didn't want

02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:27.200
to put the whole thing.

02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:28.200
Yeah.

02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:30.320
So that's the clip you get.

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:38.140
So the thing is that files have their way of making it out to the internet.

02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:42.240
So whereas he said he wasn't going to release it on the internet.

02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:43.240
It's on the internet.

02:31:43.240 --> 02:31:46.240
He sent it to 30 people.

02:31:46.240 --> 02:31:47.240
That's it.

02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:51.040
And then one of those 30 put it back on the internet.

02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:56.920
So you know, it may have been out there in a place where I found it.

02:31:56.920 --> 02:32:03.440
And so I was able to get it and yeah, um, but yeah, it looked really cool.

02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:06.600
And it's, I mean, it's just a complete remake of the whole game.

02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:11.960
And the fact that he did this just with straight raw assembly and they even have like sound

02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:15.480
samples that, you know, it's basically like Mario's voice from like some of the other

02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:18.760
games, you know, just ridiculous.

02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:24.740
And the art style is done very much like he did or like Donkey Kong Country where it's

02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:26.520
actually he made the renders.

02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:32.160
So like they had, they did an interview with him on Nintendo life talking about, um, how

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:33.160
he did.

02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:37.560
And so he actually created the models in blender and then ended up, um, scanning them and putting

02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:42.280
them into as sprites into the game.

02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:48.120
And it's just, I mean, the amount of work that it would take to do that, it's just ridiculous,

02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:49.760
but pretty cool.

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:56.160
All right, well, uh, moving on, we just have a few more stories for you guys and then we're

02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.960
going to get to our discord.

02:32:57.960 --> 02:33:02.280
So if you guys want to, uh, can participate with the show by calling in tonight, you sure

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:08.020
can by joining our discord, uh, you can join the green room, uh, and we will be, uh, taking

02:33:08.020 --> 02:33:09.020
your calls live on air.

02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:12.160
Of course, if you have questions in chat, you can get those out there too.

02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:16.040
I will do my very best to, um, get any questions you guys have for us to discuss here at the

02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:19.800
end of the show, but we have a few more stories before we get there, including this one on

02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:23.400
Fortnite, uh, a new dungeon crawl mode in Fortnite.

02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:29.420
Uh, so specifically Fortnite saved the world, which I was so irritated when I found out

02:33:29.420 --> 02:33:33.280
and figured out, Oh, Fortnite saved the world is the one you have to pay for early access

02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:34.280
for.

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:38.000
I went and I fucking installed Fortnite again on my computer, just so I could play this

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000
only to find out.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.640
You got to pay 40 bucks if you want to access this mode.

02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:42.640
And I'm like, fuck that.

02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:45.280
I'm not paying 40 bucks for a game I feel kind of on the fence about.

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:48.760
I don't really like, I want to know if the dungeon crawler is good though.

02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:49.760
That's the problem.

02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.120
But anyway, I guess I've ruined the story for myself, but I was just so irritated by,

02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:59.720
Oh man, I got, you mean I got to pay for a video game, but anyway, uh, Fortnite saved

02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:04.420
the world has a subterranean area to explore in Hexylvania.

02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:09.740
You can get new weapons, new loot, uh, and there's new heroes, uh, to battle the monsters

02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:10.740
there.

02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:14.500
Uh, which of course will be hiding the ultimate boss because that's how a dungeon crawler

02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:15.500
works.

02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:21.580
Uh, Swamp Knight makes made their debut in Fortnite along with Murr Monster Ken.

02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:25.480
And then I guess the Mythic Storm Kings, there's all these new characters and there's a new

02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:27.340
crossover quest with that.

02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:30.620
I was all about trying the dungeon crawler cause I was like, Oh, this might be a fun

02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:35.220
mode and something that's a little more like PvE in Fortnite, which is what saved the world

02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:36.220
is.

02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:38.940
But up save the world is still in early access.

02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:42.220
So you have to pay 40 bucks if you want to be able to access it.

02:34:42.220 --> 02:34:46.060
Rumor is it's supposed to be on its way out of early access in some point in the near

02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:47.060
future.

02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:50.700
But I think a lot of people thought it would happen when the black hole event just happened

02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:52.700
and it went into, what do they call it?

02:34:52.700 --> 02:34:54.360
Chapter two or something.

02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:58.540
So they thought that would be the point that saved the world goes free, but it didn't.

02:34:58.540 --> 02:34:59.540
They're still charging for it.

02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:01.060
Got to make their money.

02:35:01.060 --> 02:35:05.860
I'm going to wait for like, I'll try maybe 20 bucks, but I'm not paying 40, especially

02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:07.280
when I don't know much about the mode.

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:11.380
Now at this point, I'm like, all right, I guess I will try to find a YouTuber or a Twitch

02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:14.800
streamer that's playing this part of Fortnite.

02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:20.300
I mean, I've watched like Flaco play the hundred match and it looks like he's having fun.

02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:25.060
I'm kind of like, Oh, it's, it's interesting to watch, but just, I, when I play it, I just,

02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:26.060
it's terrible.

02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:27.060
And I don't know what I'm doing.

02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:31.140
There's no tutorial or maybe there, if there is, I haven't found it cause I installed the

02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:35.240
game a long time ago, but, um, yeah, I just, I don't know.

02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:38.260
I can't get into Fortnite the same way everybody else does.

02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:42.100
So, all right, anyhow, uh, let's move on.

02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:46.220
Uh, and I forgot to advance there to Fortnite save the world, but we just talked about that.

02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:50.220
So let's go to, um, another Stadia follow-up dark soccer, right?

02:35:50.220 --> 02:35:55.260
So Stadia users have been complaining that on their Chromecast ultra, it's been getting

02:35:55.260 --> 02:36:00.580
extremely hot and it forces the system to shut down mid game without saving their progress.

02:36:00.580 --> 02:36:04.700
When Reddit users said that in the middle of the Destiny 2 fight, the Chromecast died

02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:06.780
and lost connectivity to the network.

02:36:06.780 --> 02:36:10.660
And then when he went to go and plug it from power, it was incredibly hot.

02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:15.100
Um, you know, when people say it's hot, they're supposed to have some sort of heat, you know,

02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:17.200
heat protection in any way.

02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:21.060
But one of the Google representatives said, this is a quote, we know, um, any sort of

02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:22.940
heat on a device can be worrisome.

02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:27.800
We confirm there's no thermal overheating issue with the Chromecast ultra.

02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:31.380
During normal usage, it can get hot to the touch, but it's working as designed, which

02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:32.380
is fine.

02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:33.900
You know, we deal with that with computers all the time.

02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:34.900
You've got them working.

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:35.900
They're going to get hot.

02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:36.900
They're going to be hot to the touch.

02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:43.340
You know, don't put your laptop on your fucking lap because heat sinks are in the bottom of

02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:44.340
it.

02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:45.660
Vents are in the back.

02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:48.660
Don't look at me because I know what I'm doing.

02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:53.940
I know we don't have a camera on dark Sakura, but, uh, her laptop is in her lap.

02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:57.520
I wouldn't think it would be necessarily a problem with her laptop.

02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:01.140
Mine on the other hand, mine doesn't get that hot.

02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:03.620
And on top of that, you'll notice my vents aren't blocked.

02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:04.620
Yeah.

02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:07.200
And also you're using it for a very limited amount of time.

02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:09.420
You see how often I put it back on the table, right?

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:10.420
I'm just giving you shit.

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.420
That's what I do.

02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:14.940
Well, at any rate, of course, people don't believe the official word because they don't

02:37:14.940 --> 02:37:16.740
understand technology.

02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:23.140
So, um, but people are saying that, yeah, that it's shutting down 10 minutes after overheating.

02:37:23.140 --> 02:37:25.580
And that is not how it's supposed to behave.

02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:27.700
I'll tell you that right now.

02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:34.460
Usually if something shuts down, like if I go outside with my phone on 110 degree day

02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:38.580
talking to people on it, I'm going to get the thermal warning on my phone and if I keep

02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:40.420
using it, it will shut down.

02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:44.300
If my computer were having a thermal event, I would have a warning pop up and it would

02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:45.300
shut down.

02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:50.060
These products are built to shut down when they are too hot.

02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:53.660
And if it's shutting down and you're getting widespread reports of this, so they're just

02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:58.080
talking about the heat and the heat is normal, but getting so hot that it shuts down.

02:37:58.080 --> 02:37:59.080
That is not normal.

02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:00.080
So.

02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:05.060
Especially in November, you know, like my phone will do that in the summer months.

02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:07.060
Our November is 70.

02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:08.060
True.

02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:14.920
You know, um, but yeah, and people are like, well, even with all that happening, Stadia

02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:17.960
just feels really niche and not important.

02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:25.400
So I didn't feel Jason's summary was that negative though, and not Bobby did a summary

02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:26.400
on it too.

02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:30.600
And you know, I feel like I, I do feel that, I mean, not to say like some of the things

02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:35.200
that Jason said, yeah, but it's, that also is more about like the, the, just the setup

02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:38.640
of the, the store and the model to begin with is interesting.

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:42.480
But anyway, all right, um, moving on, we have one more story.

02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:46.120
This is very sad, but, um, on a respectful note, Loki.

02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:47.120
Yeah.

02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:55.080
So, um, unfortunately the, uh, creator of, or one of the designers of EverQuest, Brad

02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:57.360
McQuaid has passed away.

02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:05.160
So he, um, passed away in his home, um, at the age of 51 and he was basically known in

02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:13.600
the community by his alias, um, Aradune and, you know, started his journey through the

02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:20.920
game industry back in 89, um, worked on a shareware RPG called Wizard War, which I think

02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:27.480
I've, I think I've played that, um, and then of course went to work on, you know, EverQuest

02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:28.480
as well.

02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:29.480
So that's unfortunate.

02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:30.480
Yeah.

02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:32.880
It's a very young age for that to happen.

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.040
Um, I know they didn't say why and it's, you know, if the family doesn't want to disclose

02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:40.120
that that's not our business, but, um, very, uh, very young and very sad to hear that he

02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:41.280
was working on something else.

02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:45.640
I know too, that unfortunately, um, he will not get to see through to completion, but,

02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:51.240
um, I know like EverQuest in particular, you know, uh, it was such an important game of

02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:52.840
the MMO genre.

02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:58.000
I did not get sucked into EverQuest personally, but I darn well recognize that without EverQuest,

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.040
we wouldn't have certainly like Final Fantasy 11 was very EverQuest inspired.

02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:05.360
Uh, and we would probably not have things the same way, like we have with like World

02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.600
of Warcraft and some of the other more modern MMOs that we have, you know, today.

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:12.200
Um, so this game really paved the way for that.

02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.080
And certainly, you know, Brad's, um, vision was a huge part of that.

02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:20.260
Um, I will also give a shout out, um, to, uh, Bobby, cause I know he did play a lot

02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:21.260
more EverQuest.

02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:23.220
He had a very touching tribute on his show tonight.

02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:27.420
So I mean, if he weren't already listening, um, at five o'clock, uh, when his show was

02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:31.020
on earlier, excuse me, five Pacific eight Eastern, when his show was on earlier, um,

02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:34.300
then you will definitely want to check out that podcast feed when it is released.

02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:36.100
So, um, rest in peace.

02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:40.980
Uh, always hard to hear about the game designers, you know, that did such big things, especially

02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:41.980
at such a young age.

02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:43.900
That's the, that's the hardest part of that.

02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:44.900
So, yeah.

02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:45.900
All right.

02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:48.060
Um, well, let's move on.

02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:52.380
So hopefully on a happier note, I want to get to our round table and invite, uh, some

02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:54.900
of the, uh, calls and all that good stuff.

02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:57.140
And we do have one caller that's on the line.

02:40:57.140 --> 02:40:59.660
So let's get to it and bring them on the show.

02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:00.660
Hello.

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:01.660
You're on orange launch radio.

02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:02.660
Who's this?

02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:03.660
Hey, this is Def.

02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:04.660
Hey Def.

02:41:04.660 --> 02:41:05.660
It's good to hear from you.

02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:06.660
What's on your mind tonight?

02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:11.940
Well, I was going to write an email about this because it was from last week, but I

02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:12.940
forgot.

02:41:12.940 --> 02:41:13.940
So whatever.

02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:16.900
What's on your mind about it?

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:18.900
I want to talk about Wayfarer.

02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:20.900
Oh sure.

02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:22.940
The Niantic, a point of interest submission.

02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:23.940
Oh boy.

02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:25.940
Can we talk about what I've seen?

02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:27.460
Have you seen my Twitter feed?

02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:28.460
I've seen.

02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:31.260
I just, I just decided to go all in this week.

02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:32.260
I have seen.

02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:33.260
Okay.

02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:35.580
So if you aren't already aware, we did talk about this last week, so I'll try not to repeat

02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:36.660
myself too much.

02:41:36.660 --> 02:41:42.020
But the Niantic point of interest system, which was exclusive to Ingress, uh, but affected

02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:47.700
Pokemon go and Harry Potter, it opened up to Pokemon go players of level 40 last week.

02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:52.900
And I sat here and I complained on the show, Oh God, we're going to get all this bullshit

02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:56.460
that's getting submitted because people are going to think, Oh, I want a Poke stop on

02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:57.560
my couch.

02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:00.220
And people are going to love that because it's more Poke stops.

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:01.780
Whereas I'm like, hold on.

02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:07.000
What you do affects a variety of games and you do not want player versus player battles

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.340
happening on your lawn or whatever bullshit's being submitted.

02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:11.740
But anyway, that was my take.

02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:14.660
What's your take Def?

02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:21.620
And I pretty much agree on at least the most part because yeah, there's people that have

02:42:21.620 --> 02:42:23.740
like gems on their house.

02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:31.580
I personally know that and, and it's like really, really tough to like do raids or something

02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:38.580
like that on those places because yeah, because it's not necessarily the best, but it, they're

02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:41.020
actually like, okay, submissions.

02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:45.420
There were, there are legit, they're, they're not like, Oh, they're in sight in a house

02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:51.360
or they're like, uh, manipulated what like you were talking about, uh, last week I think.

02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:58.160
And I think also Matt, uh, showed some, uh, some of the pictures, uh, of someone getting

02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:01.040
like, uh, a statue or something.

02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:07.480
And yeah, I was like, yeah, and most people here also have the same idea because if, if,

02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:13.480
if something like it's populated here in Mexico, it's like, we can sit the murals.

02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:18.560
We have a lot of religious murals here and they're, they're legit.

02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:24.040
They're okay by the Wayfarer standards, but it like there's tons of people like saying,

02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:29.880
Oh, I'm going to make one in my house so I can get a Pokestop or I can get a portal even.

02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:32.520
But I'm like, no, you shouldn't do that.

02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:37.720
If you're going to do something like that, think more like in an open space and in a

02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:46.200
place that needs the Pokestop is if there's already, uh, like already enough POIs on your

02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:49.520
place or near your place, you don't need more.

02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:55.440
And that's also like my stance on that, but at the same time and, and sometimes because

02:43:55.440 --> 02:44:01.960
of, of how the rating works and especially in places that, that don't have probably that

02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:07.380
commodities, especially like talking about safe, safe, uh, safe places that don't have

02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:09.960
like a proper sidewalk here.

02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:16.840
I, uh, and the place I live, there, there are streets that don't have even like a proper

02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:17.840
street.

02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:19.400
They're, they're just dirt.

02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:21.200
So they don't have a sidewalk.

02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.960
They don't have like a proper place for pedestrians.

02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:32.960
But uh, if I check that in the Pokestop or the POI, it's in a place that I know that

02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:36.400
people can traverse a walking there.

02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:43.720
I'm gonna submit it like a safe place because I know it's actually a place that people actually

02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:44.720
walk on.

02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:49.020
So yeah, yeah, that's tough because if you don't know the place and, and that's, that's

02:44:49.020 --> 02:44:56.020
also like one of the things, uh, I'm probably like, again, some of the people like that,

02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:59.920
that actually review here is that, Oh, it is not on a safe place.

02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:01.280
No, but you don't know that place.

02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:07.280
If you know the place, you know, that all you know, that actually people go there and,

02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:08.960
and do what pedestrian stuff.

02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:10.080
So yeah.

02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:11.080
Some of the advice.

02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:14.480
So this week is what has happened since when I was talking about this last week is that

02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:17.960
I'm seeing more of the Pokemon Go submissions come through this week.

02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:20.280
And let me tell you some of my pet peeves.

02:45:20.280 --> 02:45:23.400
And I think some of the people listening to the show probably know that, but I'm at like,

02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:26.420
for what it's worth, I'm going to put this out there for the greater population.

02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:31.040
These are some things that are going to instantly make me like, like hate your submission.

02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:32.600
Number one on the list.

02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:39.500
If your justification says in the justification, we need a pokey stop here because don't stop

02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:44.200
talking because what's happened, I've already deducted a star in my mind.

02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.680
I'm not supposed to do that.

02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:47.300
I'm going to admit I'm not supposed to do that.

02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:51.560
But in my mind, when you say we need a pokey stop here, you're not submitting this because

02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:52.960
it's a place of interest.

02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:55.760
You're not submitting this for the reasons you're supposed to be submitting a portal.

02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:02.060
You're submitting it because this is convenient for your walk or your life or your way of

02:46:02.060 --> 02:46:03.600
playing the game.

02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:08.240
And so when I see that in the justification, I'm looking for reasons to deny it.

02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:11.480
I'm not going to say I always do it because there was one that came through that said,

02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:13.000
we need a pokey stop here.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:16.760
And I was like, it's actually like, it was like a war memorial or something.

02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:20.360
And I was like, it was like in a post office and I'm like, I hate this.

02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:24.640
I hate that I have to approve this, but it actually does meet the standards and it's

02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:26.360
a super safe place to be.

02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:27.360
So I'm going to approve it.

02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:29.440
But like, I was looking for a reason to deny it.

02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:31.240
Like I really was.

02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:36.520
So you know, and you might hate me for saying that, but at the same time, I hate that you're

02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:38.480
submitting something not for the right reasons.

02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:41.520
So deal.

02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:46.580
And the other thing that like, just, oh my God, I've seen some real brazen stuff.

02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:51.200
Like people submitting the lawn at the apartment complex, calling it a dog park.

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:54.640
People submitting a restaurant just because we don't have a pokey stop in the strip mall

02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:56.000
and we should have one.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.440
And I'm just like, well, you're not getting one because this doesn't meet the criteria.

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:01.420
So try again.

02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:06.080
I will say though, like, you know, I do think not to say all the Pokemon submissions are

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:07.080
shit.

02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:10.400
I think some of them have been pretty decent.

02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:14.720
I tend to be a little more, it's interesting Act F because I tend to be a little more forgiving

02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:19.620
when I see that the submission is in Mexico or Puerto Rico, because I know those places

02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:22.140
are hurting for more points of interest.

02:47:22.140 --> 02:47:26.920
So I tend to be a little more lenient, but like I got one the other day that was exercise

02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:29.720
equipment at a park and like, it's fine.

02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:33.020
It meets standards and I approved it, but I know it's going to get denied because the

02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:37.220
picture was terrible and it made it look like it was the play structure that was already

02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:38.660
a portal.

02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:40.620
So it's not going to go through.

02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:46.340
I approved it because I'm like, it's pretty much, it's a park, it's Mexico and it does

02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:48.020
meet all the standards.

02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:51.260
Like I'm fine with this being a submission, but it's not going to, I can tell you it's

02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:52.340
not going to go through.

02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:54.580
So be aware of the pictures that you're taking.

02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:57.500
That is super important.

02:47:57.500 --> 02:48:00.100
And the last thing I would say is that don't submit shit.

02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:03.140
You don't want 30 people there for any x-rayed for.

02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:09.200
I saw somebody submit a tree in their backyard called a hundred year old tree.

02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:14.180
First off, if you do not have an official sign that has the seal of the city or county

02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:19.420
on it, that denotes it as a historic tree, that it's a fucking tree and a natural feature

02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:20.420
is not a portal.

02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:24.260
So it's getting denied, especially when that fucking portal is in your backyard, no matter

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:30.040
if you say it's on a walking trail, who's walking trail, bitch, yours, no, no pokey

02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:31.040
stop for you.

02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:32.420
Shut it down.

02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:35.020
So anyway.

02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:38.740
And yeah, I have seen those kinds of submissions.

02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:48.740
One of the first ones I reviewed there was a rock, a simple rock with a Pokeball bag

02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:51.580
or like a backpack on over it.

02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:55.340
I'm like, really, really?

02:48:55.340 --> 02:49:01.380
And you have seen, I have tweeted you some of the findings I have encountered this week.

02:49:01.380 --> 02:49:05.580
So yeah, but I have others.

02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:06.980
I have to read this comment from chat.

02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:11.260
Matt says some Pokemon go players are strange.

02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:15.260
There's a subset of folks that seem to think that Niantic owes them something and they

02:49:15.260 --> 02:49:16.980
should make anything a stop.

02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:21.260
Well, guess what, bitch Niantic ain't reviewing your portals.

02:49:21.260 --> 02:49:23.260
They outsource that to the player base.

02:49:23.260 --> 02:49:29.600
You know, who's reviewing your portals me and I don't owe you shit.

02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:34.780
So take your stop and shove it.

02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:35.780
And that's really true.

02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:46.340
We were basically doing the job that Niantic isn't doing, but at least in that sense, we're

02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:51.060
like taking proper precautions and stances on that.

02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:57.020
So at least that's something I actually like about this, that we are the players are taking

02:49:57.020 --> 02:50:04.740
care of this because yeah, even in my own community, me and some other players, even

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:12.180
Ingress players, we're trying to teach the other players that are submitting like, oh,

02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:20.060
you should do this, especially like you said in the part that you need to tell why this

02:50:20.060 --> 02:50:22.340
should be a POI.

02:50:22.340 --> 02:50:28.860
We're telling people do not tell that it should be a Poke stop, tell why it's important for

02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:33.860
the community, tell why the history behind the POI.

02:50:33.860 --> 02:50:38.780
So yeah, we're trying to tell people about that, the pictures, the photos, all that.

02:50:38.780 --> 02:50:42.180
You can document this.

02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:47.020
I can't speak for the entire Ingress player base that is already in Wayfarer and has been

02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:51.900
using Wayfarer for some time and probably needs to also support your submission to actually

02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:53.100
become a thing.

02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:58.620
But I can speak for a large chunk of the base that I've talked to that is in there in Ingress,

02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:04.020
they all feel what I just said earlier, that if you put in there, this should be a Poke

02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:08.940
stop because we're already going, nope, you're not following the rules.

02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:10.940
You're not submitting this for the betterment of the game.

02:51:10.940 --> 02:51:15.700
You're submitting it for the betterment of yourself and you're already going to be an

02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:16.700
uphill battle.

02:51:16.700 --> 02:51:24.380
Quite literally, the second one I reviewed just now is the back of a building, Thunderdome

02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:25.380
rear entrance.

02:51:25.380 --> 02:51:30.660
The Thunderdome is the location where trainers and masters converse on catching recent Pokemon.

02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:32.220
It is a sidewalk.

02:51:32.220 --> 02:51:35.300
First off, it broke through.

02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:40.220
You can deny it right there with the reason description because you cannot say in your

02:51:40.220 --> 02:51:43.740
description, Pokemon, Ingress, portal.

02:51:43.740 --> 02:51:47.620
I realized some things have snuck through like, you know, under the old rules when the

02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:52.220
player base wasn't doing it and Google was doing it themselves, some things snuck through.

02:51:52.220 --> 02:51:54.220
That's why you have like shapers.

02:51:54.220 --> 02:51:56.740
Sometimes you see reference to shapers or XM.

02:51:56.740 --> 02:51:58.620
Those are Ingress terms.

02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:02.320
But for now, when the player base is reviewing, just based on that description, they name

02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:03.940
check the game.

02:52:03.940 --> 02:52:05.140
That's not a point of interest.

02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:07.260
So rejected based on description.

02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:09.660
I don't even have to look at where it is or the picture itself.

02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:12.100
The description is bad enough.

02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:19.140
And I have seen that the like churches, temples, like stuff like that, that people say in the

02:52:19.140 --> 02:52:23.420
description, oh, people come here to pray, to get shinies.

02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:27.220
And I'm like, really, people, really?

02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:28.920
One star.

02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:34.260
One star because you're submitting something with a Pokemon reference and you are forgetting

02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:37.460
that you're not submitting just for Pokemon Go.

02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:40.500
That's what I need the player base of Pokemon Go to understand.

02:52:40.500 --> 02:52:42.300
And I love both games.

02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:45.700
I am max level in Ingress and max level in Pokemon.

02:52:45.700 --> 02:52:49.740
So I can speak with some sense of authority for the Pokemon group too.

02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:55.540
And I just, I need them to realize what they're submitting is not just for their game.

02:52:55.540 --> 02:53:01.820
And yeah, then one more thing about this, there's a video on YouTube from Pokemon Go

02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:09.460
YouTuber Trainer Tips that explains really, really well how Wayfarer works like in both

02:53:09.460 --> 02:53:13.660
points of view from the submitter and also like a reviewer.

02:53:13.660 --> 02:53:19.220
So I suggest people that probably don't understand that much about Wayfarer and want to get into

02:53:19.220 --> 02:53:24.260
it and are submitting like focus stop portals and all this stuff that check that video.

02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:25.260
It's really informative.

02:53:25.260 --> 02:53:28.100
But again, I don't want to keep this overly negative.

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:31.420
There are some positive things that I'm seeing, you know, and especially like, you know, I

02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:34.860
saw one the other day that was like, this park has been here for three years.

02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:36.980
And this is just a justification, not the description.

02:53:36.980 --> 02:53:40.020
This park has been here for three years and it's still not in the game.

02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:42.240
And I'm looking and I'm like, yep, it's a park.

02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:43.240
It should be in the game.

02:53:43.320 --> 02:53:46.120
Okay, you can have your stop because it meets the criteria.

02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:49.280
It was a sign at a park that really should be there.

02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:51.480
And those are the, that's the type of stuff I love.

02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:54.680
Things that like parks and historical places, universities.

02:53:54.680 --> 02:53:56.880
I'm pretty, you know, pretty good about that stuff too.

02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:00.000
Places where people should be gathering anyway.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:05.680
You know, the wonderful thing about these games, it's getting people to use public parks.

02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:09.800
You know, I realize some cities have had issues with that, but they're stupid.

02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:12.720
For the most part, I think a lot of cities are really happy about it.

02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:17.480
Like, you know, I see food truck events that are like, come to our food truck event and,

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:20.560
you know, we have pokey stops here you can play, you know, and so forth.

02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:23.120
So anyway, anyway.

02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:28.980
And yeah, and I also feel like for rural players, because obviously they don't have like that

02:54:28.980 --> 02:54:37.400
many POIs, but at least I'm seeing more people like, especially here locally from the outskirts

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:44.520
and places that like are small towns, basically, that are getting submissions and all that

02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:45.520
stuff.

02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:54.840
And I'm pretty much, of course, if it's a legit one, if it's a sorry for approval, I

02:54:54.840 --> 02:55:01.080
usually give those five stars, even if it has like a kind of shady description.

02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:07.040
But sometimes it's people, and I know my people, I know my Mexican people.

02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:08.040
So yeah, basically.

02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:09.040
I'm sorry.

02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:10.040
I'm sorry.

02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:14.400
While you were talking, I brought up something that SJ100 Matt put in chat.

02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:17.420
And this is a piece of work, for God's sake.

02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:21.680
So it's a picture of a fire hydrant that's been painted, and it's called American flag

02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:22.920
fire hydrant.

02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:26.960
This fire hydrant was painted to resemble an American flag after the events of 9-11

02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:28.600
in 2001.

02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:32.260
I believe that this pokey stop nomination is important because it stands as a symbol

02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:36.620
in a local community to help us remember what happened on September 11th, 2001, as

02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:38.980
well as what and who we lost.

02:55:38.980 --> 02:55:41.300
Through remembrance, we get stronger as people.

02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:42.300
Never forget.

02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:43.300
Okay.

02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:44.300
It's a fucking fire hydrant.

02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:48.400
It's a fucking fire hydrant, one star obstructs emergency services.

02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:51.980
And quite frankly, sir or madam, how dare you?

02:55:51.980 --> 02:55:57.220
Because you're trying to leverage this tragedy so you can have a fucking pokey stop?

02:55:57.220 --> 02:55:58.740
And what the fuck?

02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:03.100
Just even apart from that, not the first time fire hydrants have been placed and painted

02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:04.100
as the flag.

02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:06.220
There was one in the 80s when I was a kid.

02:56:06.220 --> 02:56:07.860
Which is, and you know, that's-

02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:12.060
And I think it's actually illegal, it has to be done by city ordinance.

02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:16.340
Well, one star obstructs emergency services, and you might be thinking, we don't have to

02:56:16.340 --> 02:56:19.580
be standing on the hydrant to access it.

02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:23.340
You aren't thinking of all the games because in Ingress, sometimes you have to stand on

02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:26.540
the center of the portal if you want to remove shields with ultra strikes.

02:56:26.540 --> 02:56:29.260
Your submission blocks emergency services, one star.

02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:30.260
Yep.

02:56:30.260 --> 02:56:31.260
Basically, yeah.

02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:32.260
So anyway.

02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:37.220
And then SGA-100 Matt says also Staten Island, just saying.

02:56:37.220 --> 02:56:40.300
We should have the Niantic Wayfarer review podcast.

02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:45.980
Actually, okay, so I'm trying to talk to one of my Ingress buddies to convince her to do

02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:46.980
something.

02:56:46.980 --> 02:56:47.980
But anyway.

02:56:47.980 --> 02:56:48.980
That would be hilarious.

02:56:48.980 --> 02:56:49.980
I know.

02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:50.980
It's a panel.

02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:51.980
We vote you out.

02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:52.980
Anyway.

02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:54.860
All right.

02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:55.860
Thank you so much, ActAft.

02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:56.860
I'm gonna let you go.

02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:57.860
So we wrap up the show.

02:56:57.860 --> 02:56:58.860
But great conversation.

02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:00.580
Nothing gets me riled up like a shitty pokestop.

02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:02.660
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:03.660
Like always.

02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:04.660
All right.

02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:05.660
Take care, buddy.

02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:06.660
You too.

02:57:06.660 --> 02:57:07.660
All right.

02:57:07.660 --> 02:57:08.660
All right.

02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:09.660
I think we're at the point of the show where it's time for us to wrap up.

02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:11.020
And Les, do we have any last minute stories?

02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:12.020
I don't know.

02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:14.060
I saw something and I actually downloaded it.

02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:17.580
I didn't look too much more into it where someone did like this.

02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:22.900
I mean, it really just looks like it was done in like some like maybe Unreal Engine or something,

02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:24.240
some real life world.

02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:26.720
But it's like a free running Mario game.

02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:31.920
And it looks like one of the more recent, you know, 3D models and new 3D Goombas and

02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:34.880
everything all in this just like overworld place.

02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:36.240
And I forgot the name of it.

02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:37.240
I downloaded it earlier.

02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:39.240
And if I could remember more about it, but I found it on Twitter.

02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:41.360
I'll have to see if I can find it again.

02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:42.360
But it's out there.

02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:46.280
It's just weird because it's got like realistic shading, even though it's like Mario.

02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:49.040
Just normal old Mario and Goombas.

02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:52.040
I didn't really see a point to it, but I'm like, oh, waste of time.

02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:56.840
I got into this YouTube, well, I just want to mention this because I got into this like

02:57:56.840 --> 02:58:03.320
YouTube, I don't know, rabbit hole earlier about the IAAPA.

02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:09.000
So that's a it's a convention for amusement parks and amusement park innovations and stuff

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:10.000
like that.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:14.240
And one of the videos they showed on there was somebody playing a game that looked like

02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:22.960
on a Tron light cycle VR, but the game itself looked much like Wipeout or F-Zero.

02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:24.920
That is a perfect combination of things right there.

02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:26.440
It is a good combination of things.

02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:27.440
I like that.

02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:28.440
All right.

02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:31.280
Well, we're about to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:36.100
But I do want to say happy Thanksgiving holiday to those of you here in the States that are

02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:38.480
celebrating Thanksgiving this week.

02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:42.480
But you know, around the world, thanks to everybody that listens to and supports the

02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:43.480
show.

02:58:43.720 --> 02:58:45.320
I do appreciate you guys.

02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:48.400
And you know, you may have noticed tonight is episode number seven hundred and ninety

02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:52.400
nine, which means next week will be episode number eight hundred of our show.

02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:53.400
Believe it or not.

02:58:53.400 --> 02:58:58.000
Any of you who are friends with my husband on the Facebook, just saying ask him to be

02:58:58.000 --> 02:58:59.520
on the show.

02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:02.900
So we're hoping we're going to have a good time and a good show to mark eight hundred

02:59:02.900 --> 02:59:04.440
episodes of the show.

02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:08.600
But I think it's an appropriate time of year to really give thanks to all of you that turn

02:59:08.600 --> 02:59:13.240
to tune into the show, whether it be here on Twitch as we record it live or if you're

02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:17.040
listening on the podcast feed every week, you are just as important as well.

02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:20.000
And we hope you do feel you have a voice at the table if you ever want to send us an email

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:21.960
or a tweet or anything like that.

02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:25.360
We would not have the motivation to keep going because of you guys.

02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:28.960
Longevity does not always translate into mainstream success.

02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:33.660
However, I feel like there's been many success stories out of this show.

02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:35.600
And that is really thanks to you guys.

02:59:35.600 --> 02:59:39.480
You know, just a couple of weeks ago, I was in New York City hanging out with some of

02:59:39.480 --> 02:59:43.080
you guys, and I would not be doing that if it wasn't for this little program that we

02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:44.080
have here.

02:59:44.080 --> 02:59:49.400
Our little show, our little secret show that hates shitty Pokestop submissions.

02:59:49.400 --> 02:59:54.640
So just giving thanks to all of you guys who take time out of your week, whether it be

02:59:54.640 --> 02:59:58.080
here live on Sunday nights or at some point throughout the week, maybe while you're working

02:59:58.080 --> 03:00:00.640
or on your commute or what have you to listen to this show.

03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:01.640
Really appreciate that.

03:00:01.640 --> 03:00:02.960
And thank you so much.

03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:07.080
On that note, let's go around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:00:07.080 --> 03:00:10.280
Um, Loki, I guess we'll start with you.

03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:15.980
Hopefully I'll get to work more of my game during my time off this week.

03:00:15.980 --> 03:00:17.400
My final thought is wish me luck.

03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:19.560
I might actually be a Pokemon game.

03:00:19.560 --> 03:00:21.120
I'm making progress to be Pokemon shield.

03:00:21.120 --> 03:00:22.120
It looks like it might happen.

03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:23.120
You are a Pokemon game?

03:00:23.120 --> 03:00:24.120
I thought you said be a Pokemon game.

03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:26.560
I thought for sure that you beat Let's Go, but I guess not.

03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:32.120
No, I only got as far as Pokemon Go Park and I'm not counting Let's Go either because it's

03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:34.040
not a mainline game technically.

03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:35.040
It's kind of a side game.

03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:36.040
Yeah, close.

03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:37.040
I know close.

03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:42.000
Um, so my final thought is, yeah, I want to be Pokemon shield and I forgot to give the

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:45.320
little thing about a five star review wherever you found the show.

03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:49.520
Help us spread the word because, uh, we don't, if, if your friends and your fam and other

03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:52.640
people out there, you know, on the internet aren't here, we can't hear those voices.

03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:53.640
So help us spread the word.

03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:55.440
The auto hosts on Twitch go a long way as well.

03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:00.440
Besides, we're definitely not worth one star because we don't block emergency services.

03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:04.720
We meet, we meet all, should I submit studio and seven as a, no, I'm not going to submit

03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:09.240
it as, because that would be bad because that's, it would also give away my home address.

03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:10.720
That's not a good idea.

03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:11.720
Why would I do that?

03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:16.200
Anyway, you can do it after you move, Oh, then have like a little plaque in the backyard

03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:17.200
historical site.

03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:21.640
No, cause then my frenemy who plays for the other team, it'll be right next to them and

03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:23.520
I'll live on the other side of town.

03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:28.920
I'm not giving my friend to me another pokey pokey stopper, uh, uh, portal.

03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:29.920
Anyway.

03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:32.600
Um, dark soccer, last but not least your turn.

03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:34.760
I got a shitty schedule at work starting in February.

03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:39.680
It's a 5am shift, which would keep me from here anyway.

03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:40.680
So wish me luck.

03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:46.080
I'm going to go petition my case and I already mentioned it to the boss that I can't work

03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:49.120
before eight o'clock and I can't work Sundays.

03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:51.160
So wish me luck.

03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:52.160
Fingers and toes crossed.

03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:56.160
Cause that's going to be rough if, uh, it's a six month stint this time instead of three

03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:57.160
months.

03:01:57.160 --> 03:01:58.160
Oh golly.

03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:01.560
So yeah, I have been very specific about it.

03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:02.560
All right.

03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:04.520
All right.

03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:06.920
Um, well I guess that that we're going to wrap up.

03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:10.920
So have a great holiday, those of you in the States, but no matter where you are, happy

03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:11.960
gaming this week.

03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:12.960
Have a great time.

03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:16.000
And we will see you next time here on orange lounge radio next week.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:19.800
Episode number 800 cause we're old.

03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:24.520
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:30.440
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show.

03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:38.400

See you next week.
