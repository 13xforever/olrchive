00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,320
This week, Toyota decides that its legacy in racing games should not continue to be

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,240
arse and resumes licensing their cars.

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,660
Get your Supra on in Forza Horizon 4 soon.

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,640
This is just one headline from the Week in Gaming News, stay tuned for the rest, starting

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,760
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,520
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,520
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 799 for this November the 24th

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,480
of 2019.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,680
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
Sup.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
Hi, how are you?

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm here.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
Glad to have you here as always.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,080
Thank you for bringing a refill on the coffee supplies tonight, appreciate that.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,200
I thought it was something better than what I grabbed, but I'm glad it tastes pretty good.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Yeah, it was like this, it wasn't like coffee beans, it was like a mix thing that was like

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
mocha mix.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
It was pretty good.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
No, it was not bad.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Coffee powers OLR.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,840
Unless you're Tech Master Loki over there to my side here.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,480
In which case, sugar free Red Bull is what powers Loki.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Sure.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
How are you doing?

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm fine.

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah?

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Good, good.

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,400
All right, we are live on Twitch TV over twitch.tv slash VOG network or VOG network

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,760
for the voice geeks network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,920
nine o'clock Eastern ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,000
I say ish because if he has a long show, if he has a lot to talk about like he did tonight,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,400
he loves his VR stuff.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,120
So today was or this week was a pretty big week in AR, I think we're going to get right

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,360
into that here at the top of the show, but we do tape live of course, right after Bobby

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,840
does at the voice geeks network and we invite you guys to participate along with our chat

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,000
room over at twitch.tv slash VOG network.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,440
But if you're listening on the podcast feed, hey, that's great too.

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,000
We appreciate all the support.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,680
I should say as well tonight is, as you may notice, episode number 799, which means next

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,720
week, which is bound to be a slow news week, which is a, I'm not even sure we should really

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,880
be doing a show next week.

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
We will.

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
We will.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
We're going to be here.

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,480
Because the holiday and the, I say, why would we, because the holiday in the US.

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,460
So for the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, many people travel and go places.

48
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,780
It's a big, uh, you know, eating dinner together type of holiday.

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,500
Um, but, uh, unless you're me, then you go out and eat with, you know, your significant

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
other and your dad.

51
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
That's it.

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,620
This is three of us going out, but do you know where we're going this year?

53
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,020
Actually, we're going to the local Brazilian grill for Thanksgiving.

54
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,740
So in addition, the fire and flame, in addition, Dan and I had an anniversary there once.

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,740
Yeah.

56
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,640
In addition to the meat parade that they have there, they have all the fixes for Thanksgiving.

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,540
So I'm hoping, yeah, I'm hoping to get the giant Turkey on the sword and grilled pineapple.

58
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,540
That's awesome.

59
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
I should have done that.

60
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,800
But then my wife decided to see, we were going to have Thanksgiving without family.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,880
And then one of the family asked and I said, no, because the plan was, we're not having

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,400
Thanksgiving in the family.

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,120
Then one of her family asked and she said, yes.

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,820
You know what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving?

65
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,800
Not cooking, letting someone else do it.

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,940
I have to do a bunch of baking because like I was like, they're like, Oh, they want us

67
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,020
to bring some like, okay, I'll make some roast potatoes and I'll make my cranberry

68
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
sauce.

69
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
Dan's like, they want you to bake.

70
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
I'm like...

71
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,020
So they're open on Thanksgiving?

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
Yeah.

73
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,380
Oh, a lot of restaurants open on Thanksgiving.

74
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,440
And a big thank you to the staff for doing that because I know we see a lot of crap this

75
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,180
time of year about retail workers working on Thanksgiving, which, you know, it's, I

76
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,700
don't, I just, I don't like shopping during, I don't like shopping at all this weekend

77
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,240
because it's, it's, it's parking lots.

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,260
Parking lots are hell on earth.

79
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
I'm not doing it.

80
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,500
So, you know, and I realized there's the whole controversy with, with workers and everything,

81
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,780
but the reality is there are a lot of people that work on Thanksgiving.

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,020
Emergency personnel, people who work at gas stations.

83
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,260
I just don't think people should be working like during Thanksgiving lunch.

84
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,260
Yeah.

85
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,100
So hopefully, hopefully they have a nice way to split it up or something.

86
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,720
Um, but, uh, yeah.

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,340
So thank you to all the restaurant people out there and folks that do work Thanksgiving.

88
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,380
They don't want to be, I think though, I remember one year we asked the server like, Oh, are

89
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,380
you sad?

90
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,100
You have to, you know, be, well, I think we said it more tastefully than that, but we're

91
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,740
kind of like, Oh, how do you feel about working here Thanksgiving?

92
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,540
And they were like, I don't mind it because the tips are great today.

93
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,100
So not everybody, not everybody.

94
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,780
So hopefully, hopefully many folks out there get to do it by choice and aren't forced to,

95
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,220
or at least those that are forced to have a way to still enjoy the holiday however you

96
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,220
like.

97
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,620
Anyway, maybe enjoying the holiday for you is a marathon video game session where you

98
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,700
finally get to catch up on your backlog.

99
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Show of hands.

100
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,460
Who's binging a Pokemon sword or shield, Death Stranding, any of the other new releases that

101
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,520
came out in the past week or so, uh, or the past month, past year.

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,340
How many of you guys are going to binge those this weekend?

103
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,180
My advice, go outside.

104
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,300
Well, you could, you could do both.

105
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Yes.

106
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Take it with you.

107
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
You're on a switch.

108
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,300
That's true.

109
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Why aren't you playing a switch?

110
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
That's right.

111
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
I can go play Pokemon shield at the park.

112
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Why not?

113
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,580
Uh, anyway, you know, that thing's going to be on me all the time when animal crossing

114
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,580
comes out.

115
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,580
Yeah, it's true.

116
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
It's true.

117
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,460
Anyway, uh, let's start off the show tonight with our kickoff topic.

118
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm talking about a game that sadly will not be portable, uh, because the technology

119
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,680
is not really there to make a setup like this go portable, but, um, Loki, do you want to

120
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
start us off?

121
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,680
You're talking about, uh, what just got announced this week?

122
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,460
So did this, did the ceiling open up and did microphones fall from the snow?

123
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,520
Because this is not the same, not the same.

124
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,240
So we got a brand new half life, um, trailer for a game called half life.

125
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,080
Um, Alex wanted to say Alexa, but I didn't.

126
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,160
So half life Alex and it's going to be a brand new VR game that's coming out, um, in March

127
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
of next year and it looks pretty cool.

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,120
It takes place between the first and second half life games and yeah, I mean, that's all

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
I know.

130
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,600
I'm a terrible person because I've never played a half life game despite, well, they just

131
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,240
sit, uh, idly collecting dust with the rest of my backlog that's in, um, my scene library.

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,680
And yes, I would like to say that, well, now we've got the Thanksgiving break, maybe I

133
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,920
can go play as this, but I know better that I'm never going to do that.

134
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,720
So, um, I'll play it someday.

135
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Yeah, I must've missed.

136
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Go ahead.

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,040
It's not enough to make me want to play it because it's VR.

138
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I won't play it.

139
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,640
Well, I'll totally play it for VR, but like, um, I don't know.

140
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Um, I, I have not really gotten into half life, the half life series myself.

141
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,480
Um, I'm kind of in your boat, Loki.

142
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,920
Like I have some of the games, especially cause the orange box, I actually know I did

143
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,880
play.

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,760
When the orange box came out, I remember trying to play half life, but I didn't really get

145
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,320
like absorbed into it, but my husband loves half life and I'm sure you all are very curious

146
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
for Alan's thoughts.

147
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,440
We will get those thoughts later in the program.

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
He's out on an errand right now.

149
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
He'll be back around seven o'clock.

150
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,040
So I, he's the resident half-life Stan, uh, here in this house, we will get his thoughts

151
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
a little later in the show.

152
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,920
However, I can still appreciate for what it's worth.

153
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,120
I was very taken with how good it looked like I thought the graphics, well, it's the new

154
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
source engine.

155
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Yeah, exactly.

156
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,080
And I think that's a big part of it is because, you know, we haven't had a new official valve

157
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
game in a long time, like a long time.

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
I should say, I should say like a mainline valve game, cause I know you could throw the

159
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Dota card game thing at me, or, you know, the fact that they've been working on the,

160
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,600
the VR, uh, you know, uh, the, the palette of games that comes with HTC Vive and so forth,

161
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
those experiences.

162
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,040
Um, but I mean like, uh, like a mainline fricking game, you know, uh, I don't think there, there's

163
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,840
really been one of those since what, like Dota two would probably be the closest or

164
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,480
even maybe portal to those kids for a long time.

165
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't remember what came out last was a Dota two or was it there?

166
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:02,440
They did like a VR mini experience thing for the, um, well, yeah, that's what I was saying

167
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,600
is that the VR thing for the HTC Vive, but I don't count that because that's essentially,

168
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,360
it's not like a mainline game.

169
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
You know what I mean?

170
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
That's it.

171
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
But I'm glad that source two is out finally.

172
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,440
Cause then other people that want to make games in that can maybe now mod stuff into

173
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
it.

174
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,000
I feel like what's probably taken a long time for valve to make a new like main game, if

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,920
you will, is the fact that it's the, it's the source engine that they've been working

176
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
on.

177
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,280
And, and now, you know, I presumably, I don't think we've had it confirmed unless one of

178
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,440
you guys knows different, but, uh, presumably this half-life Alex is running on some semblance,

179
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,960
excuse me, of a source engine part three, um, which three or two or two, I don't know

180
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
anymore.

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,560
Uh, they go, they don't go to three.

182
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
That's how you know.

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Okay.

184
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
The newest source engine.

185
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Excuse me.

186
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,360
Uh, it's going to be source engine Alex when it goes to three.

187
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,160
But I got to say it looked really good and honest to God, my gut reaction was, man, I

188
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,080
wish I could play this with a mouse and keyboard cause it looks like a really nice game, but

189
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't know if it's going to be enough for me to jump to VR on PC.

190
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,680
Like I like VR.

191
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,440
Um, I have PlayStation VR and I like some of the things I've checked out with that,

192
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,280
but I'm not sure for one game in a series I'm kind of on if I want to jump into PC VR,

193
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,720
especially because I feel like the way technology is progressing, the VR is just getting like

194
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,960
better and better.

195
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
I don't know.

196
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm a little bit torn.

197
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I guess.

198
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,160
I mean, you could just probably borrow my Oculus rift.

199
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,040
I mean, well, if you're offering now we're talking, there's a way to enjoy it without

200
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,800
having to drop all that money on a, you know, PC, it's just sitting in a box right now.

201
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,720
I mean, I eventually plan on bringing it out again, but it's just, it's sitting in a box

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
right now.

203
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Cause it's really the only space I have to play.

204
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,440
The rift is in the kitchen and yeah, it's not always convenient to do that.

205
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,280
But anyway, from looking at the trailer, honestly, that was my gut reaction was like, Hey, this

206
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,160
game looks like really good.

207
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,840
Like if this is the engine that valve is working on now, I hope they're going to use this to

208
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,320
make, can we get another orange box, another orange box, please?

209
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,240
Well, or make another portal, make another left for dead, make another, or if they are

210
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,520
insistent on not ever counting to three with one of their franchises, making a new experience

211
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,920
that uses the engine, I think would be really cool.

212
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,600
License that shit out to other people to make your games.

213
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
So that was, that was my honest to God reaction to the trailer.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
I was like, neat, too bad.

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not going to spend the money to play this, but dang, if that's where valve is at right

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,520
now, I hope they turn out some more games with that.

217
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
That's honest to God.

218
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,640
Well, why would you work on an engine if you're not going to use it?

219
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,360
I mean, they're getting the very least license it out to other companies to make games where

220
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,480
why develop an engine if you're gonna make one game for it?

221
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,680
You would hope, but at the same time that EA engine can go, what is it?

222
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Frostbite?

223
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
What is it?

224
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
What is it?

225
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Yeah, but they use it for every single goddamn game that they have.

226
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
It needs to die in a fire.

227
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,680
It doesn't need to die in a fire, it's just they should stop forcing everybody to use

228
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
it.

229
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
It looks pretty good for Dragon Age Inquisition.

230
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,400
Yeah, but like you've heard the horror stories about how some games trying to work with that,

231
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,640
like, you know, that engine is part of the reason why Mass Effect Andromeda came up way

232
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,960
short of what they really wanted to do.

233
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,360
Like Mass Effect Andromeda was supposed to be like Mass Effect No Man's Sky, but it was,

234
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,040
I mean, if rumors are to be believed, but you can tell that Mass Effect Andromeda, like

235
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,080
it's disjointed.

236
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,160
And I think that's why, I mean, this narrative would certainly explain why.

237
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,680
If it's like Mass Effect No Man's Sky, those sex scenes are going to be some fucking weird

238
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
shit.

239
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
That's all I guess.

240
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,280
I don't know what it's doing.

241
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
All right.

242
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,360
Let me look at some comments in our chat.

243
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,680
Kaijuto in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says they could have skipped Half-Life

244
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,720
and went for a portal VR.

245
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,520
That would have been so freaky.

246
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,840
I worry about like, you know, already we know Dark Soccer is not the biggest fan of VR because

247
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,940
she gets motion sick pretty easy.

248
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,200
And when I think of a game like Portal in VR, I'm going like, I don't, I would get motion

249
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
sick.

250
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
They had a game.

251
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
They had what wasn't VR.

252
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,200
It was a version of Portal that used the motion controllers.

253
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,560
So that's what Bobby's talking about.

254
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,440
Valve actually did license a portal VR experience.

255
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,560
Oh, well also they, they had the, I want to say it was for the PlayStation three, uh,

256
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,120
was a DLC or something like that that used the PlayStation move controllers.

257
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,800
Maybe they had something similar with that on the PC as well, but there was something

258
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
that did that.

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,640
It was kind of, um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat, the break man in chat says, Alex

260
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,240
looks so good.

261
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,480
It makes me drool.

262
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,120
Uh, is that a problem?

263
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,140
No, you are free to like what you like.

264
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,600
And I'm sure there's a lot of people that are very excited about this.

265
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm not saying I'm not excited.

266
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm more excited for the engine than I am the game.

267
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,160
If that makes sense.

268
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,340
That's that's where I'm at.

269
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,640
And so, and to your point, it looks good.

270
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
Yeah, it looks good.

271
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,320
That's why I'm like, Ooh, I wonder what else they're going to do in this.

272
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,280
I wonder if they're going to make keyboard and mouse, you know, more traditional games

273
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,200
for this or, or what else is going to be possible with this.

274
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,740
But I also completely understand like, whereas I am of the mindset where I'm like, damn,

275
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,580
I would love to play this if it was keyboard and mouse.

276
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,900
And I'm sure some type of hacker is going to make that happen where you, I mean, but

277
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,260
not to say it's going to be any fun that way, because I'm sure there's going to be certain,

278
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,860
you know, kind of like how the Wii U shows off the Wii U, the, the touch pad and how

279
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,260
the Wii games, you know, I think there's going to be things in it that aren't going to work

280
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,820
per se on keyboard and mouse.

281
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,420
So even though a hacker might hack it to run on a monitor, like, is it gonna be the same?

282
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Probably not.

283
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,540
Get very soon to a place you get stuck, unless hackers work on bypasses or something that's

284
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,260
probably going to take too much effort, honestly, that probably isn't worth their time.

285
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,020
But anyway, I completely understand why Valve, because they have entered this VR space with

286
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:53,860
almost said Oculus Rift with HTC Vive, whatever one of them, Valve has entered that space.

287
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,920
I understand, you know, they've got to back that up by throwing the weight of one of their

288
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,720
mighty franchises behind it, and really doing what they can to get it moving, you know,

289
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,680
get the sales moving, get people excited about VR.

290
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
So this is what they're doing.

291
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,400
They're doing the first Half-Life game in Lord knows how long since whenever the orange

292
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,160
box came out, which was probably 14, 13, 14 years ago at this point, maybe even further

293
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,320
back than that.

294
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,800
This show was going when it came out.

295
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,360
I remember that because, well, right, it was Xbox 360.

296
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:33,120
So it's, I think it was 2005, no, 2005 was still the Xbox 2007, maybe, okay, that was

297
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,000
around the launch of the PlayStation three, and it wasn't that podcast switch to being

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,160
about all games and not just music based games.

299
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm pretty sure it sounds about right.

300
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,080
Like fall of 2017.

301
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
That sounds, or you mean 2007.

302
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm sorry, 2007.

303
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,880
But that's still 12 years ago, you know, it's a long, long time since the, you know, the

304
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
orange box.

305
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,360
We're selling it.

306
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,400
The break man in chat says orange box.

307
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Great game, bad name.

308
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,360
I wonder if that's what people say about this podcast.

309
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,600
Bobby Black Wolf either went to Wiki or just knows off the top of his head, October, 2007.

310
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
So you're close.

311
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Right.

312
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Yeah.

313
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
So there you go.

314
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,400
Y Y R says, how would you even hack in keyboard and mouse controls for something like use

315
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
your hands to clear the shelf?

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah.

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,760
In VR, that's where I think it would get stuck a little bit, but then Bobby follows that

318
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
up.

319
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Use mouse to look at object, hold E, move mouse to move object.

320
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,580
Like they could do it, but will a hacker want to go to that kind of effort?

321
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
I don't know.

322
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,640
And to be honest, like if valve is building this through VR, then they want you to experience

323
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
it in VR.

324
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,560
And they're building like, it's not just going to be a normal, just do it like, just do it

325
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,080
like they do with the, um, there's a, like, I forget what the spell is in elder scrolls

326
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,440
Skyrim, but there's a spell where you can pull objects towards you.

327
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Just do it like that.

328
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,480
Just look in the general direction of something, just pull it through the, um, now I will say

329
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
this because this was an interesting little debate I saw in discord, which I think was

330
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,480
actually a Bobby black Wolf's channel, but I'm going to steal it because it was still

331
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,280
our discord over at vog network.com slash discord.

332
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,200
There's a lot of talk about the hands and the way that the hands look in the trailer.

333
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,360
Uh, and then what we've seen so far, because the hands are kind of disembodied, you don't

334
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
actually see arms.

335
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,560
You just see these floating hands and some people thought that was a little weird.

336
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,720
I kind of think it looks like, I don't think it looks weird either.

337
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,400
I think it looks like pretty much any Wii game I ever played ever had, like that would

338
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,840
try to be somewhat realistic, had the disembodied hands as well.

339
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
I don't think it's a big deal.

340
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:41,680
Like I get, I get where the mindset is because everything we do in gaming is one step closer

341
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,560
to the holiday, right?

342
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,380
Everything we do in gaming is one step closer to the holiday.

343
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,260
So if you want the holodeck, then you ought to be able to see your hands, right?

344
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:53,220
But I also understand, and to Bobby's credit on his show, and he even used Twitch to give

345
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,420
the full thing, like this is why you don't see hands because the game can, like the way

346
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,180
VR is today, it cannot track your hands.

347
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,820
It doesn't know if you're turning just your wrist or if you're turning your entire elbow.

348
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,420
Like the game doesn't know that unless they were selling these full body tracking suits.

349
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,940
So the technology's there, but like is the technology in every home?

350
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
God, no.

351
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,580
The technology is only the type of thing you see in those commercials where dudes are running

352
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,120
on treadmills and you see the neon lights all over in that place.

353
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
That's where that technology exists.

354
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,140
It's not in people's homes yet.

355
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,220
Will it be in people's homes in 10 years?

356
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Maybe.

357
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,040
Decade challenge.

358
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,500
What my video games look like today and what they look like in 2029.

359
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Who knows?

360
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,300
But for now, we just have the disembodied hands, but I don't, I don't think it looks

361
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,300
bad.

362
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
No, who cares?

363
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
I don't.

364
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,980
In fact, I kind of actually, that's what modders are for.

365
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,380
If you really want to mod in stupid elbows and go right ahead.

366
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
Yeah.

367
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,740
So, um, you know, well, I kind of liked the fact that they're see-through because you

368
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,740
know, especially since the game is all about the visuals, like, you know, if my big old,

369
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,620
my big old hands were in the shot, I want it to go.

370
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,620
I want it to go the opposite.

371
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,260
I want them to mod it in so that instead of your hands being there, it's just feet.

372
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,820
It's just your feet.

373
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,100
I want to see a mod called 45 where your hands are there.

374
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,940
They're just very tiny.

375
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,940
Very tiny.

376
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,700
It's like the tiniest hands, like the big head mode, but like giant head, tiny hands.

377
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
All right.

378
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,740
Anyway, one time I had to one big joke.

379
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Easy joke.

380
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
I had to take the swing.

381
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,220
You just couldn't see my hands when I did the swing.

382
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,220
All right.

383
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Anyway.

384
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,420
Um, I would rather though just not play a throw up game.

385
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,300
You'd rather not play what?

386
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
A throw up game.

387
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Oh.

388
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,260
That's what VR games are to me, they're throw up games.

389
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:53,660
So well, let me ask you this, since you aren't a big VR person and I know that, um, what,

390
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,260
what would you do if the next, like, cause you are a big fan of the portal series.

391
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,020
Like I know Half Life, you're kind of ambivalent on like, you know, like Loki, like myself,

392
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,260
but what if the next portal game was VR?

393
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
I won't play it.

394
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
You're not going to play it.

395
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
Not at all.

396
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,780
Do you want to watch play throughs or, or would you just kind of be like, I'm out playing

397
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,100
at watching it played on a smaller screen with stuff around it may not make me a sick.

398
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,980
That's why I watched the Duncan Rompa, um, thing and it was okay.

399
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:27,340
Um, but I just, I don't want to, I, if it were on my head, I would be sick.

400
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,340
It would screw with my eyes almost anytime I get a migraine and it just screws with my

401
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
depth perception.

402
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,060
I cannot do it.

403
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,940
It's not a, it's not at this point.

404
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,460
I won't do it because I don't want the consequences.

405
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Okay.

406
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,740
So it's people say, Oh, I can't do it.

407
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,340
Well, I can, I physically can put it on my head and watch it, but there will be consequences

408
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,660
and the consequences aren't worth it.

409
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,100
I remember you've done some minor VR things when you kind of like knew a lot about it

410
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
in advance.

411
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,940
Remember there was the last gamer X that we went to.

412
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,640
I like that one little thing cause it didn't make me so sick, but then like something like

413
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,600
five minutes after taking it off of my head, my head started to hurt and my eyes were like

414
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,300
doing that weird kind of after image thing.

415
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,940
So I mean, it was fun.

416
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
I enjoyed it.

417
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,800
It was a great experience and it was a neat little game.

418
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,680
What about something like Beat Saber that you're kind of like, nothing's really moving.

419
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,540
It's still trying to do a 3d environment that my eyes are trying to translate.

420
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,600
And even for me, like I like VR, I appreciate VR, but like, remember I was trying to play

421
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
Skyrim in VR.

422
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,440
And I say trying cause I didn't get all the way through it, but I played a pretty good

423
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
chunk of it.

424
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,440
My problem was I could play for maybe like 45 minute clumps.

425
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,060
And then like when I was getting to about 45 minutes, I was going, all right, I need

426
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
a break.

427
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,760
You know, I need to take this off my head and have a little bit of a break, which is

428
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
probably a good thing.

429
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,800
You're not supposed to do with any game hours and hours long session without taking a break.

430
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,740
I saw someone play Minecraft for 24 hours in VR.

431
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,680
That was, Oh God, that's no, that sounds terrible.

432
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,040
Was he taking breaks?

433
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
He did sleep.

434
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Okay.

435
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Well, he did play total.

436
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Yeah.

437
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
So.

438
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
All right.

439
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Anyway.

440
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,800
Uh, and Bobby, Bobby reaffirming with as much as a VR fan and advocate as he is, he says,

441
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,740
I'm won't ever try to convince dark soccer to do more VR.

442
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,560
She tried it and felt ill effects.

443
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,320
I'd rather her be healthy than play anything in VR.

444
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,100
I look at it as a green eggs and ham kind of thing.

445
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,120
You know, this is the whole story trying to convince him of the dude likes it, but the

446
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,320
same thing you can't officially say that you don't like something until you've tried it.

447
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,100
And like I said, I enjoyed the stuff that I've done.

448
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,580
It's just not worth it to me.

449
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,400
So you get it for other people.

450
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
You just don't get it for yourself.

451
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Yeah.

452
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,040
Other people, if you have fun with it, do it.

453
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Great.

454
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Good for you.

455
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Huzzah.

456
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,740
You know, while you've got the thing on your head, I'll just go run off with all of your

457
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,280
coffee and yay.

458
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,080
All right.

459
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Anyway.

460
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,680
And keep in mind, I had a virtual boy dear Lord.

461
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,200
Well that's kind of different.

462
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,160
I mean, for what it's worth, I can already see like where things are going because here

463
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:09,240
we are getting closer and closer to March, 2020, March, 2020 is March, 2020 is going

464
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,760
to be a hell of a gaming month.

465
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,560
And I can tell you what's going to happen.

466
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,080
Dark soccer is going to be over here.

467
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,000
She's going to be playing her animal crossing brand new Loki or excuse me.

468
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,920
Bobby Black Wolf is going to be all about this half-life Alex thing and talking all

469
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,000
about it on his show in the VR myself, I will be consumed with the final fantasy seven remake

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
and I'm going to be playing the shit out of that.

471
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,640
And Loki will still not be working on his game.

472
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,720
I work on my game every week.

473
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,680
I will have, you know, if you give me proof that you finished it right before midnight

474
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,920
on the first of the year, I'll buy you a piece of, I don't need you to buy me a pizza.

475
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
They're like five bucks.

476
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,640
I bought a pizza today.

477
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll make you a pizza.

478
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Handmade everything.

479
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Okay.

480
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,480
So what I only made that joke cause a it's easy and B I don't know what your wife will

481
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,960
do because she wants to hold on.

482
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,920
I don't know what in March, 2020 is like calling you.

483
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,680
Oh, nothing right now, but, uh, April, 2020 is cyber cyberpunk.

484
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,120
So I I'm down with that, but, uh, cyberpunk, but I don't know more.

485
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm sure there's something, you know?

486
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Yeah.

487
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,740
Here's hope of first saints row announcement.

488
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
Come on.

489
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,520
I was game awards right around the corner.

490
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,000
Actually it did not make the show roll tonight, but there was a brief cause it was all the

491
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
story was, was based.

492
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,600
I almost put it in rapid fire, but, um, I didn't, uh, it was basically like saints row

493
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,560
announcement is brewing for next year.

494
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,600
Well they're working on, they just felt like, I don't know if we talked about it before,

495
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,780
but I'll mention now since we brought it up, um, they're working on, they found the source

496
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,400
code for saints row too.

497
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,840
They thought that they had lost it for the longest time and they finally found it again.

498
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,680
And so now they're able to go back and fix all the bugs that were in saints row too.

499
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:03,520
And so now, um, they're just going through and just remastering that whole thing basically

500
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,940
making it run better, which I am totally for.

501
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,260
And it's going to be a free update if you have saints row too.

502
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,800
So, um, more power to them, but like just that whole team that came out of, you know,

503
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,160
the gentleman of the row and stuff, and now they're officially supported like modders

504
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
for that.

505
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,400
And actually I think he's on the development staff just, I, and I can't remember his goddamn

506
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,720
screen name, but, um, just, uh, I'm very excited about that cause I do love saints

507
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
row too.

508
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
All right.

509
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,000
This is moving away from the half life story.

510
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's fine.

511
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,520
At least they got the three, but, but then after that, you know, but then four was basically

512
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
a mod for three.

513
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,080
It was, yeah, it was cheap.

514
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
It's all right.

515
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
It's an okay game.

516
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,800
I'm willing to go back to saying it's an Oak.

517
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:55,200
It's not terrible game and you know, the, the gat one was okay.

518
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,640
Really three fucked up by getting ready to get, and then they kind of tried to retcon

519
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,520
that and now they've struck on the whole thing with leave gotten there.

520
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
All right.

521
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,320
Let's move on to our gaming weeks since we're, we were clearly not talking about half life

522
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Alex anymore.

523
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,520
Uh, the types of video games we have been playing this week, dark soccer, how was your

524
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
gaming week?

525
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,080
Um, I started Pokemon sword because I want to surf etched.

526
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,680
I fall in love with my Pika Corgi, which I always forget the name of every yamper yamper.

527
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Okay.

528
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,920
I have a hard time when I give them nicknames because I forget what the fuck they're called

529
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,840
if I give them a nickname.

530
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,360
Although I've come up with nicknames for them in my head and Dan's been watching me play

531
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,720
and he and I have just been laughing at shit.

532
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,320
I don't give my nicknames for the record.

533
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,560
In fact, there's actually an option where you can turn that question off and I did turn

534
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,200
it off because I never renamed.

535
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,640
I named Pika Corgi and I named my starter.

536
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,920
I started off with the fire bunny who looks like a score bunny score bunny.

537
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,280
I started off with score bunny who now looks like an angry youth with his hoodie.

538
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,840
Um, actually looks like a Naruto character now, whatever he's called.

539
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,600
Flame foot rabbit.

540
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,280
I don't remember the evolutions left on my head.

541
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,720
I named him Hikaru because I thought it fit and Dan's just been calling him Hikaru.

542
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,520
He's like, what's up with your Hikaru bunny?

543
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm like, he's, he's cool, dude.

544
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,120
Um, so I've been enjoying it.

545
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
How much XP did you get?

546
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Over 9,000.

547
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Whatever.

548
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
That's like, that's Dragon Ball.

549
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,400
That's like Vegeta, but any who's, I've been enjoying the game.

550
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
It's been cute.

551
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,360
I'm just on my way to the first gym.

552
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,360
I mean like I just got through the caves and like there's, there's some fierce bitches

553
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
in there.

554
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
I need to, I've just been doing like crazy leveling.

555
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Like every time hop comes up, I'm like, dude, you don't want to step to this.

556
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,040
And I'm like, I have just beaten that ass all over the place and I think his brother

557
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
is stupid.

558
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Seriously.

559
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,620
Like, can you be any more full of yourself with your stupid, ugly shorts and your white

560
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,620
tights?

561
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,360
I mean, seriously, dude, you are a fucking champion.

562
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,120
You could afford some fashion sense.

563
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,240
Did you love how like the very first town you go into the very like first store you're

564
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,240
going to see is like a fashion outlet and it's like, let's play dress.

565
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,360
You can spend all your money.

566
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,000
You spent most of my money on clothes on dress up.

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,520
And then I was basically like looking for trainer battles just so I could save up money

568
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,900
to change my character's look.

569
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
So I changed her hair.

570
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,400
She's red head.

571
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,000
It's it's like their hazel does not look like hazel, at least not like my hazel, but I have

572
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,720
a lot of blue as well.

573
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,420
So I really couldn't pick like the right color for like I spent the longest trying to match

574
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,700
my eye color and I ended up going with green instead because it went better with the red.

575
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,960
I'm pissed you can't have facial hair on your character.

576
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,840
I mean, you are a prepubescent child.

577
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
So what?

578
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Sure.

579
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,100
Let's go with realism there.

580
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,400
But the giant fucking long cat.

581
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
That's fine.

582
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,200
That's I can have rainbows in my eyes.

583
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,800
My eyes are literally that is kind of cool.

584
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,680
I went for a little bit more.

585
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
You know what?

586
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,080
I because I'm you know, it's like I'm going to my hair, I'll do the bun or whatever.

587
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
So it's cute.

588
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,440
And I wear the jaunty beret.

589
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm laughing, though, at how they're kind of screwing up British slang, like they're

590
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,900
just throwing it out all over the fucking place.

591
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,440
And it's just like, I don't really think that's how people talk there.

592
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,640
I know what you're basing it off of, but that's a little bit that's like that's fan

593
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,200
fiction level of bad British speak.

594
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,560
That's what I'm saying there.

595
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,720
So other than that, I've been having a great time, like who's in my party?

596
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,320
I like whatever that thing is that carries a log around, not the log.

597
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
That's the koala thing.

598
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm talking about the the fighting Pokemon with the big yeah, I know what the four by

599
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
four.

600
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Yeah.

601
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Yeah.

602
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,080
I just want to I would cosplay that and just carry around a four by four and that Pokemon.

603
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,240
Did you name that Pokemon splatter house?

604
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I didn't get one yet.

605
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,480
You haven't gotten here yet, but at some point in the game, you're going to meet a character

606
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,280
named Opal.

607
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,080
That is like cosplay dream right there.

608
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,720
Opal is fucking fierce.

609
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
I like the goth girl.

610
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,560
Oh, wait, is Opal in your game?

611
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
No.

612
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Yeah.

613
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Opal is in both games.

614
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
I like the goth girl.

615
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Some gym leaders aren't in both games.

616
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
The goth girl.

617
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Yeah.

618
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Marnie.

619
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Yeah.

620
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
She's cool.

621
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm like, that's like my aesthetic.

622
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Why didn't I do that?

623
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,600
I hate the one guy who's like, I'm better than everybody because the chairman picked

624
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
me baby.

625
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
I think.

626
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah.

627
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,080
I'm like, um, dude, you need to, um, you know, use an enema.

628
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,280
You need like an industrial size enema where they have to hang you from your feet.

629
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
You need a colonic.

630
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
That's it.

631
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
You need a colonic.

632
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,440
So what you're saying is like a fire hose imminent because he is so full of shit and

633
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,960
up his own ass.

634
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Congratulations.

635
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,600
You get to drink from the fire hose the other way.

636
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,320
You found the marble in the oatmeal.

637
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,840
Anyway, there's so many people that don't get these references.

638
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
It's weird, Al.

639
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
They should know it.

640
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,440
But anyway, um, but at any rate, that's like, I just been coming up with like all of this.

641
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm just, I do nothing but talk shit about the characters when I play the game.

642
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,520
And Dan is just like talking shit about them with me.

643
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,600
So cause you know, normally if he's playing something, um, I'm his navigator.

644
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Like they're prepubescent.

645
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,020
Jamie, do you always make fun of children?

646
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
He's tall.

647
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
So he's at least pubescent.

648
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,500
So anyway, because normally when Dan plays something, I'm his navigator, I say, Hey,

649
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
did you see that?

650
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,180
And Dan will look out for like shiny things for me.

651
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,660
And look, that's a sparkle thing.

652
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,100
And he apparently really like zigzag zoon.

653
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
He calls...

654
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,780
Who they changed for the gala region.

655
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,700
Yeah, it's like white and white, like black and white.

656
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
It's not bad.

657
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
I was like, that doesn't look like...

658
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,180
And then he like went up looking at, well, when you're on the last thing, you should

659
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,100
have a Gyarados and you should have this and this and Dan's like started like being

660
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,100
my coach.

661
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,440
Like he, he's my trainer coach.

662
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,440
I really wish I could change the trainer outfits because they're fucking terrible.

663
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
You can later.

664
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Good.

665
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Because they're fucking terrible.

666
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Yeah.

667
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,800
Um, and at any rate though, it's just like, I'm having fun, but I'm really having fun

668
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
shit talking it.

669
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,360
Now, what number did you pick for your uniform?

670
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,040
Did you pick 666, 69 or 420?

671
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
808.

672
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
Okay.

673
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:57,200
It just like my two, my favorite number is eight and I like most multiples of two.

674
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,600
I do not like six as much.

675
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,440
And it's for me, it actually is very much an ass.

676
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,640
We think I've been this way since I was little, I like things in twos, fours and eights.

677
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,120
So I also love the number zero because it's nothing.

678
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,300
It's an infinite number.

679
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,160
It's absolute nothing.

680
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,320
So I'd picked my favorite combination of numbers, 808.

681
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:21,600
808 makes me think Bob because 8008 is boob on a calculator.

682
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
You know what?

683
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,600
When I forget to name, uh, what to name a hard drive, I call it Bob five, three, one

684
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
8008.

685
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I have a hard drive named Bob.

686
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:40,000
The magic number five, three, one, eight, oh, wait, anyway, if that's, if that's it

687
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,160
for your gaming week and besides, yeah, it has to be, uh, three digits, but no, I wanted,

688
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I wanted 808.

689
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,160
It works and I'm enjoying, it's fun.

690
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,520
It's the first time I've played a Pokemon game that I've actually really enjoyed myself

691
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
in a while.

692
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
All right.

693
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Anything else for your gaming week?

694
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:04,120
Um, idle pouring, um, uh, Pokemon go, Harry Potter.

695
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,080
Um, I did get, um, what the golf.

696
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,280
So I am just when I get all this shit out of the way, it's just re I've got a lot of

697
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
baking to do.

698
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,160
I'm hardly gonna have time to play anything, but it'll, it'll be good.

699
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,920
Um, I'll, I'll be playing more stuff once the stupid idiot holidays are over and it's

700
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,280
not fucking Christmas yet.

701
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,760
So put your shit away.

702
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,720
No, no, uh, putting up Christmas until the day after Thanksgiving.

703
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
And then it's Hanukkah.

704
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,680
I already got latke mix and then I realized I had four more boxes of latke mix.

705
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,760
I think we still have latke mix from last year.

706
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,400
So I'm going to be coming over here.

707
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,140
Do not bring new latke mix.

708
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
We have plenty.

709
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
I'll cook all of it.

710
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,120
You'll just have a pile of latkes.

711
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
All right.

712
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
All right.

713
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,800
Uh, Loki, did you play a lot of games this week?

714
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,600
No, I did not.

715
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,120
I played a little bit of Minecraft earth, so I've just been going through that.

716
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,200
I did a few more of the adventures the other day, um, and I've had some different ones.

717
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,000
So there's one that's actually like a red stone puzzle, which was kind of neat.

718
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,160
Um, I just kept feeling though, cause especially after that one where I'm like just digging

719
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,920
in the hole after I killed the skeletons and then all of a sudden skeletons come out of

720
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,720
the side because they spawned up top for no reason.

721
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,680
Uh, I'm still worried every time I do one of these things that there's skeletons are

722
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,360
going to come and just shoot me with some arrows and kill me.

723
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,640
And then I'm going to lose everything that I just got.

724
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,280
So that's kind of annoying, but, uh, it's all right.

725
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,140
I didn't play it all week long because I'm kind of getting bored with it already cause

726
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,260
there's not a lot to do.

727
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,460
They have been updating it though.

728
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,640
So I noticed that there's now, um, seeds in there, so I guess you can plant those just

729
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,840
like you can in a normal game.

730
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,280
And then they have dyes now that they've added in.

731
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,320
And so they're updating and it's just, um, still can't do anything with meat.

732
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,200
Have a bunch of meat I'm sitting on, but I don't know.

733
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,280
And then of course, you know, I was fighting the one skeleton and they're pissing me off.

734
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,760
So I threw some TNT down there and blew them up and that worked out pretty well.

735
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:05,560
I played a little Pokemon Go and, uh, worked on my game some, I started working on the

736
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,440
procedural generation stuff on that.

737
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,160
So I have to, uh, develop something that I want to do for, uh, procedural maze generation

738
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,320
to get the level structure right.

739
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,360
And then once I get that done, then it's going to be random room generation and random, uh,

740
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,200
spawn wave generation.

741
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,800
So that's what I've been working on.

742
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
And what else?

743
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,600
Uh, I'm sure I play a little bit of what the golf in there as well and yeah, that's it.

744
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
All right.

745
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,280
Um, my gaming week, um, a lot of the same old, same olds, uh, continuing on Final Fantasy

746
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,120
14, of course, uh, was helping a friend of mine reach level 80 this week.

747
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
So that's exciting.

748
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,200
Uh, and then, um, I was playing all the GPS games, all of them playing a little bit of

749
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,440
Pokemon Go, probably that one, the least, uh, just because I didn't bother with the

750
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
team rocket event today.

751
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,800
I just haven't, I've really missed a lot of that.

752
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,960
And I, oh, there was an event today, there was an event today and there's a whole, like

753
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,200
you're supposed to fight Giovanni to get the shadow, uh, Articuno, I think it is.

754
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,360
And you know, all, but I'm just kinda like, I, I I'm kinda cutting that part out.

755
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,200
It's like, I don't, I don't have the time to go run around and find those and whatever,

756
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,660
because I'm too busy playing the other GPS games.

757
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,380
So I play, um, the Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, there's been an event going on there.

758
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,680
So I've been, you know, kind of, you know, getting the traces, uh, and then I really

759
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,260
went hard on Ingress this last week because, uh, there was the double AP, uh, event that

760
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,940
happened in Ingress and it just ended, uh, on Friday.

761
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,500
So, but I made the most of it.

762
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,780
I was out doing little bits of fielding every day.

763
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,060
And have you leveled back up to 16 again, not all the way to 16, I'm back to level 14.

764
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,180
So I just dinged 14 during the double AP.

765
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,180
Have they still figured out what you get for doing that?

766
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,220
No, they haven't, which is getting more and more frustrating.

767
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,060
Like, has it been like a year since they announced you can do it?

768
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,580
Yeah, Ingress is in a really rough place right now.

769
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
It's it's hard.

770
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,500
And you know, it's, you're watching the development team, like, you know, they're on the forums

771
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,980
and stuff saying, wow, we're trying, but I, if I feel like they don't have enough resources,

772
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,320
like it's very obvious, Pokemon goes the cash cow, that's where all the resources go.

773
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,740
And there's probably like a team of six people in the corner that are like the Ingress team

774
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
and God bless them.

775
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,060
I don't know what they can, but it's just not enough to stay on top of the very vocal,

776
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,540
very loud player base.

777
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,260
So you know what they need to do now?

778
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,300
So release another goddamn AR game.

779
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Yeah, right.

780
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,300
Oh, which yeah.

781
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,180
Also, I know that was announced.

782
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,700
So Niantic is making a Catan game.

783
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Yeah.

784
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,780
That's the next game they're doing is Catan.

785
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,300
I don't remember the subtitle, but it is Catan World Explorers, Catan World Explorers.

786
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,540
So it is basically the world's largest game of Settlers of Catan played on the real world,

787
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,140
which actually like as much as I, you know, every time Niantic has announced something

788
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,100
new, I've kind of done this, like, what the fuck?

789
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,820
Like when, when they announced Pokemon Go as their next thing, you know, after, because

790
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:53,060
I had played Niantic, or excuse me, I had played Ingress, I knew of Niantic for many

791
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
years.

792
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,860
So when they announced that Pokemon Go is their next thing, I was like, what the fuck?

793
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:02,020
Like, you know, but it turned out to be a rough start, but then the game got really

794
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
good.

795
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Right.

796
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,700
And, you know, Harry Potter Wizards Unite isn't really a night.

797
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,660
It's more a Warner Brothers game, but you know, it's happy as whatever.

798
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,300
So that kind of, you know, it exists.

799
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,300
It's fine.

800
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,740
I think, I think that actually, I would say the Harry Potter game, as much as I don't

801
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,000
think the traces are as exciting as like catching the cute Pokemon, I would say the Harry Potter

802
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,460
game has done a very good job of like communicating with their audience, admitting when they make

803
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,900
fuck ups, being very good about what's coming out to the game, making regular updates to

804
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
the game.

805
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,860
In Harry Potter, if you weren't aware, that just released like three days ago.

806
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
I haven't played Harry.

807
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,340
I think I installed Harry Potter, but for those of you that may still have it lurking

808
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,580
on your phone, you can now send gifts to people, which is great because that helps with the

809
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,220
spell energy issue.

810
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,020
So if somebody goes to an inn, they can send you a gift that's like two spell energy, which

811
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,460
doesn't sound like a lot, but you can open 10 gifts a day.

812
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,620
That's like 20 spell energy at something to work with.

813
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,420
So it's kind of neat.

814
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,460
Helps a little bit with that kind of like how Pokemon gifting kind of helps with being

815
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,220
able to send like Pokeballs and stuff to people.

816
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,540
I just, I just, I don't know, like, cause you know, I know that they're struggling with

817
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,140
making updates to stuff and it's like really adding a fourth one is a good idea at this

818
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
point.

819
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Yeah.

820
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,980
So anyway, um, yeah, I, I, I'm curious to see what the Catan thing works out.

821
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:25,100
I just, I feel like Ingress is not in a great place and if Niantic overall does not show

822
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,740
that game some TLC, I mean, they, I, they really, really botched the transition to Prime.

823
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,100
There's no nice way to put it.

824
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,140
They promised parody that they didn't deliver on.

825
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,320
And I think, you know, when I say parody, the features might be there, but what's not

826
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,100
there is the speed and the convenience.

827
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,420
And I think that's, what's throwing a lot of the player base off.

828
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,800
Like I, there's a lot that I like about Prime, don't get me wrong, but like, I don't like

829
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,100
the fact that it takes like, it takes easily three times as long to start up as the other

830
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,180
Ingress, uh, the original client did.

831
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,940
And heaven forbid if you switched to something in the background and then you got to go back

832
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,120
to Prime and then it's got to start all over again.

833
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,540
So it's just, it's really irritating.

834
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,360
Also, there's still a pay to win stuff in there too, which is kinda, and it's just,

835
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,700
you know, it's been the same fucking game for how many years.

836
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,740
Um, it would be nice if they'd mix it up a little bit and maybe this week you're competing

837
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,500
for unique portals or this week is about banners or, you know, something different, you know,

838
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,860
like, and not just throwing the same field in the same part of town over and over and

839
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,660
over again to win a cycle.

840
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,020
You know, it's just that aspect of the game is getting really boring.

841
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,860
So anyway, that's why I kind of quit playing.

842
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,860
I know.

843
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,860
It's just, they need more.

844
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,860
I think that people, cause especially as the game has been losing a lot of its regular

845
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,460
players because of the parody thing, it would just be nice if there was more that you could

846
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,500
do kind of as an individual, if that makes sense.

847
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Yeah.

848
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
I don't know.

849
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,660
Like I know a lot of people that have just made it an individual game at this point.

850
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,300
Like it's just, Oh, I'm going to go get the banners or I'm just, you know, micro fielding

851
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,180
this little park or whatever it is, you know, it's just kind of, I don't know, anyway.

852
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,140
Other games I've been playing this week because what I've been playing a lot, a lot, a lot

853
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
is the same game I talked about last week.

854
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,580
That's Pokemon Shield.

855
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,760
I've been playing enough Pokemon Shield where I am further in Pokemon Shield than I've ever

856
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,660
gotten in a Pokemon game ever.

857
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,660
I am six gym badges in and I think the furthest I ever got, I think I got four or five gym

858
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,320
badges in Sun and Moon.

859
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:25,840
So I'm up to six badges in Pokemon Shield and I think I'm going to see it through to

860
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
the end.

861
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,240
I really do.

862
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,460
Because there's just so much about this particular gen that I'm liking.

863
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,960
And I got to say, I think one of the biggest things for me are those Dynamax raids.

864
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,400
Like they're so cool.

865
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,040
And what I love about it is that it gives an alternative for how to level your characters

866
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,400
as opposed to just grinding.

867
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,720
Like I don't feel like I have to go grind, grind, grind, kill two Pokemon, run back and

868
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
heal.

869
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Kill two more Pokemon, run back and heal.

870
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,840
Like I don't feel like I have to do that.

871
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:57,960
I can just do some Dynamax raids, get some candy and level up my Pokemon that way and

872
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,000
then focus on the gym battles, which the gym battles are really well done.

873
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,720
I love the gym battles in this series.

874
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,380
Like the music is great.

875
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,200
The fact that they incorporate this whole stadium into it is awesome.

876
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,040
The Dynamaxing during the gym battles is really cool.

877
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,640
Like they did such a bang up job with the presentation in that regard.

878
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,160
And I think also honestly for me, and I know I'm the opposite of a lot of people, a lot

879
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,720
of people love that convenience of gaming on the go.

880
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,440
Me, I love playing video games on my TV, big, lying on my couch, you know, and I have it

881
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,640
all on the big noise and stuff.

882
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
I love playing on my TV.

883
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,800
And I think just having that all on my TV, even though ironically right now the Switch

884
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
is right here in front of me and I could play it right here during the show if I wanted

885
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,700
to, although I'm trying to focus on doing a show, I love being able to dock it and play

886
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
on the TV.

887
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,940
Switch is just a great platform for it.

888
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,260
So yeah, I'm trying to make my way to the seventh gym right now.

889
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,720
Just kind of got sidetracked with some rating as I usually do, because now I'm having to

890
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,300
sub in the right Pokemon.

891
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,080
So the next gym I'm going to is a dark type gym.

892
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,220
So I need some fighting Pokemon.

893
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:08,340
I mean, I can have, what is it, bug, fighting, or there's one other typing I'm forgetting

894
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
in the moment.

895
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,700
I'm sure somebody in chat is screaming it.

896
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:17,700
But I have my little Ninjask, which is my final swipe character, because it's the only

897
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
one I have that has final swipe.

898
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,840
And she also does a bug move.

899
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
So I have that.

900
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,260
But then I had to sub in my party.

901
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,040
Now I have a Bewear, because I have one of those little pink bears, so they're a fighting

902
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
type.

903
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,920
And then a Hitmonlee I have in my party as well, so another fighting type.

904
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,340
So I have those to go to the next gym with.

905
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,420
But you know what else is kind of nice?

906
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:46,940
I like the big open wild area, even though it runs like shit on the Switch when you're

907
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,640
online and the weather effects and everything, like the frame rate gets really bad.

908
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,020
It's one of those things where it's like, this is not impressive Nintendo technology

909
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,500
right here.

910
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,780
But as a game concept, I like it actually, because it kind of sets this precedent early

911
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,260
on that it's like, hey, you're not going to be able to catch everything.

912
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,460
And if you do miss things, they're probably here in this gigantic wild area.

913
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,520
So go forth and play the story.

914
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,020
You can always come back here and catch all these Pokemon at the end.

915
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,700
That's like the feeling I get, which to be fair, most Pokemon games, you can just play

916
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,760
straight through the story and then go back and get all the Pokemon you missed.

917
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,360
But there's something about that kind of setup where I just, I don't feel the need to catch

918
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,900
every Pokemon on every route along the way.

919
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,940
And I can just focus on trying to get through the story, leveling the right Pokemon in my

920
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,640
party to do it in that aspect of the game.

921
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,820
And it's worked for me.

922
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,540
And I've gotten further in this game than I ever have in a Pokemon game.

923
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,180
So I think that goes and just the quality of life stuff, man, having access to the Pokemon

924
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,100
boxes anywhere without having to be at a computer and things like that, like it goes a long

925
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100
way.

926
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,540
Like they've done, they've done a really good job with the mainframe basically of this Pokemon

927
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,540
game.

928
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,580
I understand the whole DEXIT thing still bothers a lot of people.

929
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,420
I think that would be one of those things where like, it would be the whipped cream

930
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,700
and cherry on top if, when you beat this game, then all of the Pokemon's ever showed

931
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,260
up in the game, but it's not.

932
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,340
And that's okay.

933
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,220
It's still a damn good piece of pie.

934
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,740
You know, it's always, there's always a chance for updates later on.

935
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,220
I'm not going to hedge my bets on it.

936
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,940
In fact, I think they've been pretty clear in coming out and saying, don't count on it.

937
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,380
And that's, that's, that's for the third version, that's going to have both sword and shield

938
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,780
together and Pokemon gun, Pokemon gun, or I think that the popular and most likely would

939
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,900
be Pokemon armor.

940
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,020
So, but we'll see.

941
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
I don't, I don't know.

942
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,580
I mean, I, I don't know, like, and I kind of want to see him do another Pokemon game,

943
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,660
but then you're like, gen nine will be like four years away.

944
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,660
So I don't know.

945
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,660
We'll see.

946
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,780
But I do a remake of two, let's go, whatever.

947
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,220
Yeah, I would see more.

948
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,220
Okay.

949
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,320
So Kaijuna says, I still haven't beat my copies of ultra sun and moon.

950
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,420
So yeah, this is another thing that tends to happen.

951
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,820
So you get ultra sun and moon, you had black two and white two, right?

952
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,380
There was never a, what are those?

953
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,820
I mean, sequels in the same universe, same universe, same rosters, basically.

954
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,420
They're just different stories, but I could see where maybe there will be a sword to,

955
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,360
or, you know, ancient sword and ancient sealed or whatever they're, I don't know.

956
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,220
They could do a lot of things with it, but I could see something where they could put

957
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,540
out a sword and shield sequel that will expand on the decks, I suppose.

958
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,220
But I don't think the decks thing is like a deal breaker at the end of the day.

959
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,860
Like I can see why people are like hissy about it, but I also see a lot of criticisms

960
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,880
that are like, this Pokemon game sucks because it's the shortest one.

961
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,100
But then I'm like, okay.

962
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,820
But when I think about how many hours of Pokemon red and blue and yellow are in a fucking cave

963
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,700
running into random encounters over and over that you just want to run from anyway, because

964
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,980
you're trying to get to this next area and like how much of it is just grinding and grinding.

965
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,140
Like I kind of think the comparison is a little unfair because I think those numbers in the

966
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:10,100
older Pokemon games are a little bit artificially raised because it's grinding.

967
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,420
I know that's a hot take some of you aren't going to like, but that's the reality.

968
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,820
Like I feel like, for me, my reality, and I feel like in Pokemon sword and shield, like

969
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,380
I'm always moving.

970
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,620
I'm moving in this story.

971
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,780
I'm progressing.

972
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,220
I'm not having to just sit there and grind shit.

973
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,660
And even if I am doing like the Dynamax raids, it's kind of fun and different and online

974
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,660
and stuff.

975
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,900
So anyway, I do feel like the Dynamax raids was something that they took from Pokemon

976
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,140
Go.

977
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,420
And it's like, it's a great addition to the game.

978
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,620
So it's amazing how the games are kind of helping each other like that.

979
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,500
So anyway, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf says I would rather play a 10 hour game where I'm always

980
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,780
moving forward than a 60 hour game with 50 hours of grinding.

981
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,780
Yes.

982
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,460
Print that, put it on the back of the box.

983
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,460
That is how I feel.

984
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,460
Absolutely.

985
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,460
Let's see.

986
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,460
Other comments here.

987
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,900
Act Def says it is Pokemon, but most people have the dumb idea that it's only looking

988
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,340
at your phone and throwing balls at everything that pops up.

989
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,740
Pokemon Go has raid battles, has community events, it has PVP and other stuff.

990
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,780
Yeah, I guess a Go topic came up in chat.

991
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:19,360
Yeah, I love Pokemon Go as well, but it's a different Pokemon experience.

992
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,620
That's the interesting thing about this franchise is it's been imagined in all these different

993
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,620
ways.

994
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,700
I mean, Pokemon Puzzle League, am I right?

995
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,580
That's another way that the Pokemon franchise has been imagined.

996
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,580
So anyway.

997
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,580
All right.

998
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,620
I don't think I have anything else to share for my gaming week.

999
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,020
So that's it.

1000
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,020
I guess we will move on.

1001
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,260
We're going to get to the headlines for the week and talk about what is going on in the

1002
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,260
gaming world.

1003
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,020
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

1004
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,020
Yes.

1005
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:57,620
It's rumored that Amazon is going to enter the cloud streaming service for games next

1006
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,620
year.

1007
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,380
So, of course, Amazon has the Amazon Web Service.

1008
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:10,660
That's a pretty big source for a lot of web infrastructure and basically really powerful

1009
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,340
for something like this.

1010
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,860
And it only makes sense that they would try to leverage that, especially with their other

1011
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:22,940
streaming services that they have and Prime to try to get that all integrated.

1012
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:28,140
I could see almost like now that they own Twitch integration with that, much like you

1013
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,220
have with YouTube integration with Google Stadia.

1014
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:40,060
My question would be is what are they going to do to try to differentiate themselves from

1015
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:46,740
what Google's done and maybe being that they would be launching at least a year from now,

1016
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,940
looking at what they can do differently so that they don't kind of flop like Stadia is?

1017
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,940
Well, Amazon.

1018
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:58,500
Well, I think it's too early to call Stadia a flop, not to derail the topic at hand, but

1019
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,680
I think and I will say this coming up later in the show, our voiceover guy, Jason, since

1020
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,420
none of us picked up Stadia early, but Jason, our voiceover guy did.

1021
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,900
So he has a nice little package you put together for the break tonight that he's going to talk

1022
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,340
about his impressions on Stadia.

1023
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,700
So I'm really excited to hear it because I actually haven't heard the whole thing myself.

1024
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,180
I only heard like the first minute when I was setting up for the show tonight, but I

1025
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,340
didn't have time to listen to the whole thing.

1026
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,500
So I'm excited to hear his impressions of Stadia, but I think it's too early to call

1027
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:32,100
Stadia a flop because even though right now the early adopters of Stadia had to buy this

1028
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,300
whole thing, remember that Stadia's vision is to be a free thing.

1029
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,680
It is something that you'll be able to open up your Chromebook and you just launch Chrome

1030
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,100
and you can run Stadia within the browser.

1031
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,980
I think that's going to be the true test of, is there a demand for something like this

1032
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,620
when they open it up to the wider market?

1033
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:52,700
I think right now, honestly, truly people paid the beta test it.

1034
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,340
So I hope you guys are enjoying that beta test.

1035
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,340
That's what being an early adopter is.

1036
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,700
But the problem I see with this though right now is that it's not really something I think

1037
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:08,620
like, you know, games pass is like a better option than Stadia is because it doesn't make

1038
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,620
sense.

1039
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,100
Like, Oh, I get it's a cloud streaming service, but you got to buy everything.

1040
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,800
And a lot of this stuff is really old and it's just, I got you the pricing model is

1041
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,800
it doesn't make any sense.

1042
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,600
Like if they have like, Hey, you pay $10 a month and you get access to all of these games

1043
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,620
in this library and you could stream them all and play them more like a PlayStation

1044
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,880
now, then that would make more sense to me.

1045
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,760
But the way that they've done it right now, not really making any sense.

1046
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,720
Well, let me steer the car back to the topic of hands as we are talking about Amazon potentially

1047
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,720
entering this space.

1048
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,680
We all know that Amazon has their Amazon prime, that they've leveraged all these different

1049
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,920
services that Amazon has onto this Amazon prime.

1050
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,300
It would seem logical, though nothing is certain until they announce something, it would seem

1051
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,440
logical that if Amazon were to enter this space, it's very possible they could tie it

1052
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,800
to a prime membership, or at least maybe some games you would buy, but there will be some

1053
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,680
things that would be included as part of your prime membership.

1054
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,680
Because that is, you know, Amazon makes a lot of money on that prime.

1055
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,440
Or if you have your Twitch library that you could stream stuff.

1056
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
Potentially.

1057
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
I mean, we don't know.

1058
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
There's so much to be determined.

1059
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,600
We do know, and sometimes forget, Amazon's been working in the gaming space for quite

1060
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
some time.

1061
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,120
They've been working on that, what that MMO that they've been developing is they bought

1062
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,120
that one developer.

1063
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,640
And there was, I remember there was like some videos and things that were put out a while

1064
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,640
ago.

1065
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,760
I don't remember the name of it, but maybe somebody in chat remembers.

1066
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,440
Amazon's working on something big within their own studios.

1067
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,280
It's just that we don't know what the plan is for them to release it.

1068
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,080
Are they just going to release it as something they sell on the Twitch app?

1069
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,560
I don't know, but this would be a pretty big, if Amazon does want to enter the space, they

1070
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,280
may have a bang up MMO exclusive game that they want to put in that.

1071
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,800
So who knows?

1072
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,800
New World.

1073
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Thank you, Quest Buster.

1074
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,200
New World is the MMO that they're working on.

1075
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,920
So there you go.

1076
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,640
And then Lumberyard, says Bobby Black Wolf.

1077
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,360
But is that the engine?

1078
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,360
That's their engine.

1079
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,320
I thought that they had, I wasn't sure if they were still working on it because I thought

1080
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:08,360
that they were doing some other stuff for, I guess there's some games, I see Star Citizen

1081
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,160
uses Lumberyard and Crucible and New World.

1082
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,880
So certainly, I mean, you know, I know some people don't like to talk about rumors and

1083
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,360
things, but I think this certainly, I mean, the things that aren't a rumor, we know that

1084
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,840
Amazon has been working on gaming.

1085
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,800
They just haven't done anything as far as releasing it yet.

1086
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Amazon owns Twitch.

1087
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,700
They bought Twitch for a reason.

1088
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,680
They have a really great gaming community within Twitch.

1089
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,100
If they were to launch something like this and tie it to Twitch, it would probably get

1090
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,040
some eyes on it because of the fact that they're behind Twitch.

1091
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,440
You know, those things are facts.

1092
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:48,160
So you feel like that, oh, there's this interesting little hole in the puzzle where something

1093
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,920
could nicely fit.

1094
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,000
And this does seem like a logical, I feel like five years ago on the show, the talk

1095
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,240
was Amazon's going to put out a console.

1096
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,240
And then that died.

1097
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
You remember the rumors?

1098
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,120
Amazon's going to put out a console because I knew there was, uh, they were built it into

1099
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,320
fire or whatever the fire stick and that stuff.

1100
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,100
I mean, they could, but I don't, I don't think, I don't think Amazon's going to put out a

1101
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,100
console at this point.

1102
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,560
I think it's this, I think now it's, oh, this is where things are going is the cloud service.

1103
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:21,600
Hey, AWS, we got a big cloud that we operate and can deliver that type of bandwidth.

1104
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,960
Let's do it.

1105
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,440
But Amazon is probably taking a damn good look at what's happening with Stadia right

1106
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,760
now and thinking about a lot of that because I, they would be fools over at Amazon to not

1107
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,560
see all this complaining about bandwidth that people are having about Stadia right now,

1108
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,380
which continues to be kind of the biggest complaint.

1109
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,840
So an Amazon system really is going to have to answer that question.

1110
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,640
What are they going to do about bandwidth?

1111
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,640
Who knows?

1112
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,960
And I don't, I don't know if it's an easy answer.

1113
00:53:50,960 --> 00:54:00,240
So, so anyway, Mr. Smoosh smells, a dark soccer is a dinner and he's putting on a show.

1114
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,640
Oh, he's, he's, I think stalking off to check his own.

1115
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
Yeah.

1116
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,460
What he doesn't, he was asleep when the food dispenser went off earlier.

1117
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,960
So he's going to be in for a real treat when he walks over there.

1118
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,840
And I'm going to have to start a new Instagram for Midna anyway, because like, I don't even

1119
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,520
remember the email I signed up for it with.

1120
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,520
Oh no.

1121
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,240
I changed it once because I couldn't remember the initial one and then I remembered the

1122
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,120
initial one and all this shit.

1123
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,320
So there's going to be a new Midna Instagram.

1124
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,320
Fun.

1125
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,640
All right.

1126
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,740
So anyway, I guess there's not a lot else to say on the Amazon cloud thing right now

1127
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:39,120
until we know that what they're doing or what they're planning, but it does, I feel like

1128
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,160
this is the direction they're moving in and I'm curious to see what they unveil maybe

1129
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,160
next year.

1130
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,280
Well, and that's going to also depend on a lot of what, you know, they're doing with

1131
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,760
the Microsoft X cloud stuff as well and where that goes.

1132
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,720
And I think they're just gonna kind of look at what works, what doesn't work, and then

1133
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,720
kind of go from there.

1134
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,800
And that's what everybody seems to be doing.

1135
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:06,080
But launching early, do you have that problem that you don't get to learn from other people

1136
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:12,840
because you're, you're leading the charge however well you're doing it, I guess.

1137
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
All right.

1138
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,640
Well, moving on to our next story, which is about again, Pokemon sword and shield, some

1139
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,720
of the big names in gaming this week as that did recently release.

1140
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,180
And of course, you all know by now one of the biggest controversies in Pokemon sword

1141
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,400
and shield is the fact that many of the previous Pokemon in the series were removed from the

1142
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,560
game, even though the Pokedex is somewhere in the realm of just over 400, that would

1143
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,560
still be about half the Pokemon did not make the cut in Pokemon sword and shield.

1144
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:45,140
But that hasn't stopped folks from hacking and modding and doing what they do to try

1145
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,040
to bring some of the Pokemon back into the game.

1146
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:53,420
So what's interesting, apparently using older models from other games, one hacker actually

1147
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:58,700
brought Omastar, which was cut, that's a gen one Pokemon that kind of looks like a snail

1148
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,120
starfish hybrid thing.

1149
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,180
And it was cut, it's not in Pokemon sword and shield, but somebody was able to kind

1150
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:10,980
of hack it to actually put it in Pokemon sword and shield and it kind of works.

1151
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,900
But I guess some of the entrance animations are a little borked.

1152
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,860
So there's actually a YouTube out there and I didn't have time to rip it for the show

1153
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,540
tonight, but you can actually see that it kind of does a fight and it works okay.

1154
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:28,760
So people were able to add at least one Pokemon back into the game, I guess, but yeah, I mean,

1155
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,140
that seems just more of like a challenge to me and it's honestly, Omastar is not that

1156
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,520
great a Pokemon and it just seems like kind of a, eh.

1157
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,500
It's neat that hackers and modders have accomplished that, neat.

1158
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,480
And it does go to show that maybe Game Freak Nintendo should consider some type of addition

1159
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,820
to add the older Pokemon back into the game, but at the same time, I can, you know, and

1160
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:55,380
I got into this last week and I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll just summarize.

1161
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,600
Game Freak may have made some strategical cuts to try to update the competitive side

1162
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,800
of Pokemon.

1163
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,600
Maybe there's a reason they wanted to throw away all the old legendaries, because anytime

1164
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,580
you watch a Pokemon match, it's all those legendaries going up against each other.

1165
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:13,120
So maybe they wanted to re- It's the third game that they're gonna put all of them just

1166
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
in that game.

1167
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,120
Oh, we'll see.

1168
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,880
Anyway, now did this whole controversy slow down the sales?

1169
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,180
Did people put their money where their mouth was and not buy the new Pokemon as a result?

1170
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,680
And the answer is probably not.

1171
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,460
I mean, I'm sure there's some people out there that are like, I sure didn't, but the sales

1172
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,580
numbers are coming in.

1173
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:38,560
Nintendo announced that over 6 million units between Sword and Shield, and I'm sure five

1174
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,000
million of them were Shield and one million of them were Sword based on what I see on

1175
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
my friends list.

1176
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,600
That's no shade, it's just I see way more people playing Shield than Sword.

1177
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,600
But anyway, Nintendo announces 6 million units of the game have been sold worldwide, 2 million

1178
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:58,480
of them in the US during the first two days, meaning it's the highest grossing Pokemon

1179
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,580
launch ever.

1180
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:06,300
So that should hopefully be some good news for the folks at Game Freak that have had

1181
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:12,180
to put up with a lot of social media online Twitter bullshit leading up to its release.

1182
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:17,800
And quite frankly, and again, I'm probably gonna take a little shit for my hot take opinion,

1183
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,280
but I'm still gonna put it out there.

1184
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,900
I think this just furthers the proof that a lot of what you see on Twitter is just echo

1185
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,700
chamber noisy bullshit that people never follow through on.

1186
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,940
I shouldn't say never, rarely follow through on.

1187
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,940
That's Twitter.

1188
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,060
But you can craft Twitter into a very lovely echo chamber.

1189
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,560
I've met a lot of great people on Twitter, I've made some great friendships on Twitter,

1190
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,460
and know many people around the world from Twitter, but that's because I block a lot

1191
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,360
of the annoying shit.

1192
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:49,300
So I think the people pouring themselves into a tizzy and calling the games fails, the results

1193
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,220
are in and biggest launch ever.

1194
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,420
So I'm a big fan of muting people.

1195
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,420
Yeah.

1196
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,260
Oh, I like to block I understand why people do the muting.

1197
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,340
I like to I like you to know you've been blocked.

1198
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,860
I don't want to but it's different for me because if it's especially if it's a guy,

1199
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,340
I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing that I blocked him.

1200
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,580
Yeah, I've heard that before.

1201
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,580
Yeah.

1202
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,580
I understand.

1203
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,740
Have you ever visited those profiles were in the about information?

1204
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,100
It says blocked by so and so and it's like you're proud of that.

1205
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,700
Like, I don't know.

1206
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:22,180
Like the people that I've blocked on Twitter deserved it.

1207
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:30,000
Like, you want people that I don't know, I just block everybody that adds me as a follower.

1208
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You block everybody?

1209
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,620
No, no, no, I bought I've been blocking a lot because I've been getting a lot of the

1210
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:40,900
these guys who like to post naked pictures of themselves following me for some reason.

1211
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:46,120
And no offense, but like, I just don't want to keep having to like, and not even just

1212
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:51,260
that, just even like some that my other followers or people that I follow seem to like their

1213
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,160
photos, and then they get thrown into my feed.

1214
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,440
And if I'm browsing on my phone or at work or something like that, that might be bad.

1215
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,060
So I preemptively block them.

1216
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,060
Do you know how?

1217
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,320
I mean, and you've I know you've expressed you've had this problem too, but do you know

1218
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,600
how much gay porn finds its way into my feed?

1219
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,860
And like, I don't follow triple X accounts.

1220
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,000
There's nothing wrong with it.

1221
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,440
It's just that, you know, sometimes I'm looking on my phone at work and I don't need to see

1222
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,260
that on my Twitter feed, but Twitter will show the things that your friends liked.

1223
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:27,340
And some of y'all out there are thirsty, which again, I understand it's fine.

1224
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,340
There's nothing wrong.

1225
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:33,580
We all get in those moods, but like, Twitter stopped putting it in my feed.

1226
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,580
There's nothing wrong.

1227
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:39,040
It's like, you know, I, I, I, I'm curious who's following me and I see the profile picture

1228
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,100
and I can't really tell.

1229
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,020
So I go to their profile and there's butthole there.

1230
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,540
So I'm like, well, I'm going to have to block you.

1231
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,180
And I'd have to do the same thing if it was a female butthole.

1232
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,980
But it's just like, I've seen titties to titties pop up on my feed to for the same.

1233
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,940
I follow straight dudes to the, you know, it's just lesbians that like that stuff.

1234
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,860
And it's just, it's just, I can't, I've got to keep my feed somewhat clean.

1235
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:05,380
You know, maybe I, if I have some time one of these days, I can put it in a separate

1236
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,300
like don't have like lists or some shit now.

1237
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,620
And actually, I think you can do categories now too.

1238
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,140
So you can do all that when I have the free time, which will never happen.

1239
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,240
Maybe I can do that kind of crap.

1240
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,100
But right now I got to block that shit.

1241
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,040
So oh, I live by the list thing.

1242
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:23,300
I the only there's a handful of accounts that I stay current on and it's thanks to the list

1243
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,300
thing.

1244
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,940
But the problem with lists is that you can't block retweets from your list.

1245
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:32,920
So I had to remove somebody from my list that I really like and I really want to follow

1246
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,140
because over three quarters of their timeline are retweets.

1247
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,860
I just wish they had like options like, I don't want to see retweets from this person.

1248
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,860
Yes.

1249
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,860
My God.

1250
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:41,860
Anyway.

1251
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:42,860
All right.

1252
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,860
That's enough.

1253
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,860
Turn into Twitter rant.

1254
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:45,860
Who knew?

1255
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,860
Anyway, let's talk more about Pokemon.

1256
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:51,100
Dark Sakura, you have another little interesting tidbit.

1257
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,680
Yes, I do.

1258
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:58,180
So you know, people have a lot of multiple devices that are plugged in, you know, to

1259
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,860
their TVs that may have some interaction interaction.

1260
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:08,420
Well right now, Pokemon Sword and Shield are causing some problems with Roku devices.

1261
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:14,000
It's their Y-Com feature, the way it searches for the Internet for other players, is sending

1262
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,080
out data packets that make the Roku go what and it gets stuck in a boot loop.

1263
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,360
So right now the only way to fix it is turn on airplane mode on the switch or move the

1264
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,740
switch in Roku to different wireless networks.

1265
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:32,980
Roku is actually working on fixing it, but it's not really the fault of Pokemon.

1266
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,300
It's something having to do with Roku.

1267
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,300
So hopefully they'll get that fixed up, but it's not the first time I've heard of stuff

1268
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,300
like that happening.

1269
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,820
That is such a strange thing.

1270
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,060
It has to be like some signal that it's using or something.

1271
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:49,780
I do know like the switch in general, one thing I like about it is that when I just

1272
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:54,820
when I hit my controller to turn on the switch, if it's docked, my TV turns on as well.

1273
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,500
Like it sends that there's some type of smart signal or something it sends to the TV that

1274
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,580
makes your TV turn on.

1275
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:01,980
And I really think that's cool.

1276
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:11,620
But yeah, like it's weird that maybe that signal is interfering with these other things

1277
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,620
as well.

1278
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,700
So I don't know anyway.

1279
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,700
Let's move on.

1280
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,300
Loki, what else is happening in the gaming world?

1281
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,860
We had some big news this week, right?

1282
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:28,820
Yeah, so they have the nominees for the Death Stranding Awards starring Jeff Keighley.

1283
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:34,220
Basically it's the Game Awards and Death Stranding, of course, is getting nominations, which we

1284
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:42,860
can kind of discuss how that's a little kind of sketchy being that Jeff Keighley is in

1285
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,860
the game.

1286
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:49,180
I mean, if it wins Game of the Year, it's kind of I don't know.

1287
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:53,700
But I mean, it's his damn award show, so I guess he can do whatever he wants.

1288
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,620
I don't always say the nicest things about a lot of gaming journalists, because I think

1289
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,580
a lot of them are drunk on power.

1290
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,580
Not all of them.

1291
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,780
I've met some really humble, really awesome people.

1292
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:07,340
So again, I don't want you to think I'm talking about you, just if you do happen to be one.

1293
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:10,620
But you've probably met these same people that I'm talking about that are just drunk

1294
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,860
with power on that type of stuff.

1295
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:17,460
And I think Jeff, especially the ones that have really made it big or really mainstream

1296
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:21,600
and so forth, I think he's a pretty respectable guy.

1297
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,580
I think he made a big mistake in agreeing to be in the game Death Stranding.

1298
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:32,980
And I do think he should maybe acknowledge that, especially if this game does end up

1299
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,340
cleaning up some awards.

1300
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:40,020
He may need to acknowledge that as the guy who's running this, producing this premier

1301
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:46,200
Game Award show, it is a little bit of a problem that he is showing up in a game and everybody

1302
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,020
knows how tight he is with Hideo Kojima.

1303
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:54,160
And I'm sure, and I'm confident, this was not a rigged process.

1304
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,480
I'm sure the journalists did their thing in the nomination process the same way they've

1305
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
done in the years past.

1306
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,680
I'm sure everything was done the same way as it always has been.

1307
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,400
It's the perception.

1308
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,280
The perception is there that it's worse.

1309
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,280
And you know what?

1310
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,560
He should really, he can't remove himself in the game at this point, or even stop the

1311
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,560
award show.

1312
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,560
And I don't think he should do either of those things.

1313
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,120
I do think he should say, hey, I learned something from this and I realized I crossed

1314
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,500
a line that if I want this award show to be taken seriously in the future, I probably

1315
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,120
shouldn't cross that again.

1316
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:29,120
So don't look for me to do any cameos in any future games.

1317
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,120
Right.

1318
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,520
So, so let's see, let's talk about the nomination.

1319
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:38,920
So Game of the Year, as mentioned, Death Stranding Control, The Outer Worlds, Resident Evil 2,

1320
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:45,640
Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Action Game, they have Apex Legends,

1321
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:53,040
Astral Chain, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Devil May Cry 5, Gears 5, and Metro Exodus.

1322
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,720
Let's see, we can, Action Adventure, Borderlands 3, Control, Death Stranding, Legends, All

1323
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,800
the Links Awakening, Resident Evil 2, and Sekiro.

1324
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,440
Could you read the awards nominees for best art direction, please, because there's something

1325
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
I want to point out in that category.

1326
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,600
Yes, actually, I was just getting there.

1327
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:21,400
Art direction, Control, Death Stranding, Grease, The Legend of Zelda, Links Awakening, Sayonara

1328
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,640
Wild Hearts.

1329
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,760
I just wanted to interrupt here real quick.

1330
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,480
What did I say when I was reviewing Sayonara Wild Hearts here on this show?

1331
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,600
Does anyone remember what I said on that when I was talking about the game?

1332
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,600
It purred.

1333
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Yeah.

1334
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:41,320
Specifically, this game will get nominated for best art direction at award shows at the

1335
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
end of the year.

1336
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,320
Thank you.

1337
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,480
But I mean, anybody who's played the game could tell you that.

1338
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,680
They have a shit ton of esports nominations.

1339
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:58,440
I didn't even realize that they had all that, event, coach, player, host, content creators

1340
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,520
of the year, they've got stuff like that.

1341
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,000
I have no idea who those people are.

1342
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,840
I wanted to talk about indie games real quick, though.

1343
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,880
Can I say quickly on the esports thing?

1344
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,840
Because I definitely noticed it seemed like a lot of that was increased.

1345
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,560
And I think maybe some of that is to try to bring more eyes to the show.

1346
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:18,840
I think it is an element of the gaming community, whether you personally follow it or not.

1347
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,840
I don't follow a lot of esports.

1348
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,960
I completely understand.

1349
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,080
But I get it.

1350
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,160
I get that the Overwatch League is something that's growing and growing and so forth.

1351
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,640
So I get it.

1352
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,540
It's not particularly the categories I personally have any interest in, but okay.

1353
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,660
So it's just weird to see so much more of it this year than in years past.

1354
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,660
But anyway.

1355
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,660
Go ahead.

1356
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:38,660
And then, let's see.

1357
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:39,660
I was going to...

1358
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:40,660
Where was that?

1359
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,660
Let's see.

1360
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,660
They had mobile and...

1361
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,660
So mobile game I wanted to mention.

1362
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:48,660
They had Call of Duty Mobile, Grindstone, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Sky Children of Light,

1363
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,240
and What the Golf.

1364
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,000
And then independent game, of course.

1365
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,620
We know who's going to win independent game here, I mean, come on.

1366
01:07:55,620 --> 01:08:00,820
Baba's You, Disco Elysium, Katana Zero, Outer Wilds, and Untitled Goose Game.

1367
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:05,340
I'm surprised Untitled Goose Game did not get more nominations, actually.

1368
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,340
Well they also got...

1369
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,380
I would have thought Untitled Goose Game would have been a dark horse for Game of the Year,

1370
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,380
honestly.

1371
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,380
They had...

1372
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,380
They have this...

1373
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,500
I don't know why the category is called Fresh Indie Game.

1374
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,000
It sounds like Indie Studio, but it's...

1375
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,580
They had House House, Untitled Goose Game, Mega Crit, Slay the Spire, Mobius Digital,

1376
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:28,220
Outer Wilds, Dead Toast Entertainment, my friend Pedro, Nomada Studio, Gris, and ZA

1377
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,380
slash UM, Disco Elysium.

1378
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:35,820
I know, there's a ton of damn categories, I'm not going to read them all here.

1379
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:41,900
Family Game category, or better known as its Nintendo category, Luigi's Mansion, 3 Ring

1380
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,900
Fit Adventure, Super Mario Maker 2, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, and Yoshi's Craft

1381
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,540
of World.

1382
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,100
Don't get me wrong, Nintendo does good family games, but I would like to think that there's

1383
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:57,500
other people out there that have made some family games that, like, really?

1384
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,460
This is all we have is just from Nintendo?

1385
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,460
I don't know.

1386
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,520
Like, wasn't there, like, an, um...

1387
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,520
Was that this year?

1388
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,520
I can't remember.

1389
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,500
Wasn't there, like, one of the robots games that Sony made or something like that that

1390
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,900
was pretty good for VR?

1391
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,020
I don't know.

1392
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,020
I would like to see...

1393
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:17,700
I would like to see more than just Nintendo in that category, and I think last year is

1394
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,700
the same way.

1395
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,700
Okay.

1396
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:24,540
Real quick, go back and read the Game of the Year nominees for us, please.

1397
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,220
You know what I'm going to ask after this.

1398
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:32,700
Game of the Year, Control, Death Stranding, The Outer Worlds, Resident Evil 2, Sekiro,

1399
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,940
Shadows Die Twice, and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

1400
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:40,540
Now, I realize not everybody's had time to play all those games, but certainly you've

1401
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,780
had enough time to follow some of the buzz on these different games, and you kind of

1402
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:48,060
know the perception and what the gaming community kind of views with these types of games.

1403
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,860
So that being said, who do you think out of this group takes the award?

1404
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:52,860
The Outer Worlds.

1405
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,860
Wow.

1406
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,860
You're the...

1407
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:55,860
I wouldn't have thought...

1408
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,020
Why would you say The Outer Worlds?

1409
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,700
Because it's actually a pretty decent game.

1410
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:04,100
It's of a quality of one of the older Fallout games.

1411
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,140
I have not heard anything really negative about it.

1412
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,660
Death Stranding, I've heard all sorts of...

1413
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:15,280
It just seems very like this is kind of a Kojima passion project thing, and it just

1414
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:21,940
makes no sense, and the gameplay's not really there, but the story's okay.

1415
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:25,180
Control has a pretty good story, and the gameplay's pretty good in that one, so that could be

1416
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,380
one that I could see.

1417
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,380
Sekiro.

1418
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,380
Sekiro.

1419
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:31,260
I don't care.

1420
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,260
I'm gonna pronounce it wrong.

1421
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,260
You said it right the first time.

1422
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,260
Whatever.

1423
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,940
That one seems like that might be a pretty good one.

1424
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:41,260
The gameplay in that was supposed to be pretty good, and I think, if I remember correctly,

1425
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,940
that's kind of like the Dark Souls type game.

1426
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,980
Smash Brothers Ultimate's just Smash Brothers.

1427
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,820
I mean, I guess you could see some omniscience there.

1428
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:51,060
I would see that more of like a family game.

1429
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,940
It might win that category.

1430
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,140
Resident Evil 2.

1431
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,380
Dude, it's a fucking remake.

1432
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,260
I just don't really care.

1433
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:01,980
I mean, it might do all right, but I think Outer Worlds will take it, unless it's really

1434
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,820
rigged and Industrial will take it.

1435
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,820
Dark Sakura, thoughts?

1436
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:10,020
I'm leaning to Death Stranding because everyone is up Kojima's ass, just saying.

1437
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:15,200
Other than that, though, my second for that would have been Sekiro, just because it's

1438
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,940
been out longer, more people have played it, it's got a really great storyline, it's pretty,

1439
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,220
and it's hard as shit.

1440
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,180
I actually think Smash Brothers is going to take it, and I think it's going to leave a

1441
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,180
lot of people asking why the fuck wasn't this nominated last year, and the reason why is

1442
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:33,180
because of the way the release windows work, and I think it is going to cause some questions

1443
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:37,460
about, hmm, maybe the strange eligibility window for this ought to be revisited.

1444
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:42,460
However, I think Smash Brothers takes it because I think there is going to be blowback on Death

1445
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,940
Stranding because of the Kili thing, I really do.

1446
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:50,700
And I don't think the game, I mean, I want to play it and form my own opinions, but the

1447
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,140
game doesn't seem to be reviewing at the level where I thought it would have.

1448
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,020
So I'm not sure it's going to take the big prize for that reason.

1449
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:03,300
I think, ultimately, the users vote on these, right, because you can go vote on them online, right?

1450
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,820
And that's another reason why Smash Brothers takes it in the end.

1451
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:11,300
I think that game is too goddamn popular to not win, and it's not like it's not deserving.

1452
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,420
I mean, they've continued to deliver on that game over and over again throughout the year

1453
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:18,360
with the DLC and so forth, so I mean, it certainly deserves it.

1454
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,200
I think just a lot of people are going to be asking, why didn't it win last year?

1455
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,800
It should have won last year.

1456
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,680
And it was a December release, if I remember right, right?

1457
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,280
So it's the eligibility window is a little weird.

1458
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,800
Yeah, I think it came out.

1459
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,800
Yeah.

1460
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:35,160
It's just like when the Oscar nominations come out, if Jordan Peele's Us gets nominated

1461
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,520
for movie of the year, which it very well might, I think people are going to be asking,

1462
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,840
wait a minute, what the fuck?

1463
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,240
Wasn't that last year's movie?

1464
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,240
No, came out in like February.

1465
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,280
So you know, sometimes the eligibility windows are a little weird.

1466
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:52,400
I do think there is a sleeper candidate in control.

1467
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,680
That one I hear is a pretty good game.

1468
01:12:53,680 --> 01:13:01,760
I think if the critics were voting and not the gamers, I think there would, like if this

1469
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,120
were the Oscars, where just industry people were voting, I have this really funky feeling

1470
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,440
control would win.

1471
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,600
Because you know, again, I haven't played it, so it's hard for me to wrap my head around,

1472
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,760
but it's on my radar, it's on my list of games I really want to play.

1473
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,360
Because everybody that has played it has really good things to say about it.

1474
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:25,440
And like just, you know, the studio that put it out puts all these other winners out and

1475
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,440
so forth.

1476
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:32,720
So it's got a really, I feel like a cultish almost kind of following to that game in a

1477
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,720
way.

1478
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,920
So I feel like control is kind of a sleeper candidate there.

1479
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:41,520
But I just think, especially being the only Nintendo one in there, I think there's no

1480
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,520
way Smash Brothers doesn't win.

1481
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,080
If Link's Awakening also got a Game of the Year nod, then it would be a tougher call.

1482
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,720
But I think there's no way that Smash Brothers, especially with the fans voting, I think Smash

1483
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,720
Brothers has it in the bag.

1484
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,720
I don't know.

1485
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,720
But that's me.

1486
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,120
So anyway, the other, you know, the other thing, the one other thing I'll say is interesting

1487
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,240
about the game awards.

1488
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:08,140
There was an award for community or something or like on what was it ongoing game, something

1489
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,240
about like ongoing life of the game.

1490
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,760
Let's see, community support.

1491
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,760
That's it.

1492
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,160
Tell me, tell us the candidates in this category.

1493
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:25,480
So community support, Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Final Fantasy XIV, Fortnite, and Tom Clancy's

1494
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,240
Rainbow Six Siege.

1495
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:32,480
And this I believe is the category for like continued support of the game post launch

1496
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,680
basically and talking with the community and basically like hyping up the products and

1497
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,680
things like that.

1498
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,680
Right.

1499
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,760
And like, you know, continuing support for the game after it's out.

1500
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:47,640
Yeah, I, I mean, Final Fantasy XIV should get that.

1501
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,280
I have a feeling they had their best expansion this year.

1502
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,640
I have a feeling Fortnite will get it, but users, Apex Legends better not fucking get

1503
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,640
it.

1504
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,640
Users vote?

1505
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,640
Oh, no, wait, wait.

1506
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
No, I'm sorry.

1507
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,640
I'm thinking Anthem.

1508
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,640
Sorry.

1509
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,640
Sorry.

1510
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,640
Getting those confused.

1511
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,640
Apex Legends.

1512
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,640
That might not be so bad.

1513
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,640
Yeah, no, Apex won't be bad at all.

1514
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,480
And Apex arguably could deserve it, but I think it'll be Fortnite because again, users

1515
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,520
vote on it.

1516
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:18,840
So, um, uh, but read that list one more time because I want you guys to listen.

1517
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,520
Who's not here?

1518
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:29,120
Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Final Fantasy XIV, Fortnite and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.

1519
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:35,600
Who's not here in that lineup that is really stunning in, in, in my opinion, when it comes

1520
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,560
to this community thing, like I'm actually stunned and shocked.

1521
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,680
Who's not in that list.

1522
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,680
Who's not in that list.

1523
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,760
World of Warcraft.

1524
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,080
How about any Blizzard product?

1525
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,080
Overwatch.

1526
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,320
Because fuck them.

1527
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,440
For me, Overwatch is the glaring admission there.

1528
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:58,200
And is that punishment for what's happened the past couple months?

1529
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:03,400
I don't know, but I, I have to, I am stunned that Overwatch was not in that category.

1530
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,360
They're banned from being awarded.

1531
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,880
You know, I don't even see now that I'm looking at this.

1532
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,880
Uh, well, the Overwatch is nominated for esports game of the year, which I think it won last

1533
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,880
year.

1534
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:18,920
That like, for me saying it's stunning for it to not be in the community category, it

1535
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:26,200
would have been goddamn like fucking like, uh, uh, uh, uh, stop the presses, like interrupt

1536
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,960
special news announcement time.

1537
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:34,000
Tom Brokaw here with a special news report, uh, that would not be in the esports category.

1538
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Come on.

1539
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,800
Especially with like everything Overwatch league has accomplished in the past year.

1540
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,740
That's a real, would have been a real interesting one.

1541
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,120
So a multiplayer game.

1542
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:49,320
We have apex legends, Borderlands three, call of duty, modern warfare, Tetris 99, and Tom

1543
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,480
Clancy's the division two.

1544
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,280
So interesting.

1545
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,060
Anyway, I just, I, is something I noticed cause yeah, I get the Warcraft could be another

1546
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,880
one too with the, especially with wow classic having launched, but I was just, you know,

1547
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,360
as a final fantasy 14 fan, there was definitely a part of me that was like, yay, they're getting

1548
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:10,000
acknowledged and rewarded because their latest expansion is the best they've ever been.

1549
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,800
So good for them.

1550
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:17,280
They have a good, I'm sorry, just one last one, uh, scored music, cadence of Hyrule,

1551
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,280
Death Stranding, Devil May Cry 5, Kingdom Hearts 3, and Sayonara Wild Hearts.

1552
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,280
That's a pretty good category.

1553
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,280
That's a pretty good category.

1554
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,280
It really is.

1555
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,280
So, all right.

1556
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,280
All right.

1557
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,840
Anyway, uh, SG100 Matt does want to say, I mean to play devil's advocate, Overwatch hasn't

1558
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,620
really done much this year.

1559
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,280
Last year they were doing more with the game.

1560
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,740
This past year, it felt kind of the same, um, but I mean, there's still, still continuing

1561
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:42,720
support with new heroes and stuff, but, and the, the special events, but maybe because

1562
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,600
the special events are kind of recycled cause Overwatch 2 is on the horizon.

1563
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,600
I don't know.

1564
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,360
I just, I noticed it wasn't there a little bit surprised.

1565
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
That's all.

1566
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,400
Anyway, moving on.

1567
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,920
Let's talk about, uh, since obviously Kojima is taking up a lot of the talk when it comes

1568
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,740
to the game awards, I think it's worth talking about this.

1569
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,420
What is Kojima going to do next?

1570
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:04,780
Um, because I don't think it's going to necessarily be Death Stranding 2.

1571
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,500
You know what he said he wants to do?

1572
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,460
Well, I think that's what I'm about to talk about.

1573
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,880
So, uh, what he said he wanted to talk about on Twitter.

1574
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:17,300
So he wrote a tweet, um, that he said, uh, this is the tweet as to make the scariest

1575
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:22,700
horror game, I'll watch the scary movies in order to awaken my horror soul.

1576
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:28,260
The I is the Thai horror movie I rent when making PT.

1577
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,300
This freaky ass movie.

1578
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:35,380
Notice he calls it PT and not Silent Hills.

1579
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,980
Just just, it's just interesting that he didn't, it was, that whole thing was supposed to be

1580
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,460
Silent Hills, but he called it PT maybe because that's all it ever ended up being.

1581
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,460
I don't know.

1582
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:47,940
But anyway, number one, interesting observation, uh, Thai horror movie I rent when making PT,

1583
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,020
but was too scary to finish watching.

1584
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,080
The package is scary, so I rented the disc only.

1585
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,740
Will I be able to finish watching?

1586
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:55,740
You've seen this Dark Soccer?

1587
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,740
I don't know anything about it.

1588
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,580
I tell, I probably wouldn't like it.

1589
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,700
I started watching it movies, fucking creepy as fuck.

1590
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:07,380
It's like this, this, uh, violent planner has like a cornea transplant.

1591
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:12,940
Um, and, uh, uh, she starts seeing like multiple images of people dying.

1592
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,420
It's really fucking creepy movie.

1593
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,820
And they remade it with Jessica Alba.

1594
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,940
Oh, it's that one.

1595
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:18,940
Yeah.

1596
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:22,700
Oh, I heard, cause I heard when the Jessica Alba one came out, people were razzing it

1597
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,300
being like, this ain't shit compared to the original.

1598
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,300
So yeah.

1599
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:27,860
Anyway, interesting.

1600
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,860
Yeah.

1601
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,740
If you ever want to watch it, I'll, I'll, I'll pick it up again.

1602
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,580
I am perfectly content.

1603
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,700
This is like you and the VR thing.

1604
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,020
I am perfectly content hearing your take on it.

1605
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,300
I much prefer Asian horror.

1606
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,300
Sure.

1607
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:46,540
Although I will say that I'm still kind of about Train to Busan, but that is a good movie.

1608
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,540
I will say this, you know what I do want to see?

1609
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,500
Cause I've never, I have heard nothing but great things about it.

1610
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,260
Um, going over to, I think it's South Korean film Parasite.

1611
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:56,980
Yeah.

1612
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:57,980
I want to see that.

1613
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:58,980
That's one I haven't seen.

1614
01:19:58,980 --> 01:19:59,980
It's on my list.

1615
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,580
I'm hearing lots of stuff about that.

1616
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:02,860
So anyway, I hope I'm right.

1617
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,580
I hope I didn't credit that to the wrong country.

1618
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,860
I just, I think it was, but I'll double, I'll double check it.

1619
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,220
But have you, have you, well, you saw Ju-On, right?

1620
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,060
Or did you see the original or did you see Grudge?

1621
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:15,340
I think he made me watch the original Grudge at some point.

1622
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:19,500
I need to have you watch Black Ghost and White Ghost cause they're a little bit more suspenseful.

1623
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,820
They're not really gross or super scary.

1624
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,820
To me, they weren't super scary.

1625
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,980
But if you just want to sit and laugh the whole time, watch, um, Kayako versus, not

1626
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,740
that one, Sadako 3D, which was like Sadako from the Ring.

1627
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:32,740
It's a terrible movie.

1628
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,180
Actually, Kayako versus Sadako is also hilariously bad.

1629
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:38,300
Swongtong in chat says, I watched Suicide Club last week.

1630
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,300
That messed me up.

1631
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,500
Suicide Club Club is a fucked up movie anyway.

1632
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,020
Dark Sakura made me watch that or somebody made me watch that.

1633
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,020
I have two copies of it.

1634
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,020
I think you did.

1635
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,020
Like Loki, somebody made me watch that.

1636
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,020
I got a copy of it.

1637
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,020
Yeah.

1638
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,020
I was like, ugh.

1639
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,020
Copy.

1640
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,020
You know, they did, um, Battle Royale on Blu-ray.

1641
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:55,740
I was just about to ask, why, why was Battle Royale all of a sudden floating around Facebook

1642
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,740
this week?

1643
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:00,740
Is it because it was the anniversary of, of, um, the movie's release.

1644
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:04,540
And so like I did, What's Your Face doing the China to get exploded.

1645
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,540
Okay.

1646
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:08,580
You know, why don't they have a battle royale battle royale game?

1647
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,020
Would that be inappropriate?

1648
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,580
They recreated, they, they actually stole that idea for, um, a Marvel series about a

1649
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:19,420
two years ago, a year ago, two years ago where they were kidnapping different teenage superheroes,

1650
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:25,220
including like some of the runaways and Jubilee and all them and put them in like a battle

1651
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,020
royale, like full on deathmatch.

1652
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:31,900
So I fell down a Wiki rabbit hole and I was trying to look into why did they never remake

1653
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,900
battle royale?

1654
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:36,300
Because surely somebody wanted to remake it for a us audience.

1655
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,060
And sure enough, they were trying to do that at one point.

1656
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:43,060
Um, even despite the controversies about, you know, the things that happen in schools

1657
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:46,060
and stuff, you know, there was, there was a particular way they were going to frame

1658
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,060
it.

1659
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,080
Um, and let's be real.

1660
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:52,200
It's not like seeing teenagers get cut up in horror movies is anything new.

1661
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,560
Hello, any Freddie or Jason movie or Halloween that ever existed, right?

1662
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,880
Well, the hunger games games, even though she said she never read battle royale, I watched

1663
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,880
the movies.

1664
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,980
It's very reminiscent.

1665
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:04,340
And that's, that's kind of where the story ultimately ends up is the reason why they

1666
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:08,480
have not remade the movie is because the hunger games happened and we had Lord of the flies.

1667
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:13,880
And he said the, the guy who owns the rights said, no matter what we did, if we were to

1668
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:18,040
release battle royale here in America, everybody would say it's a rip off of the hunger games.

1669
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,080
Even though it came first, but he's like, you and I both know the world doesn't work

1670
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,080
like that.

1671
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,160
Yeah, but it doesn't.

1672
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:27,120
It's just like when beat mania came out and everybody, the ex play fucking called it a

1673
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,880
guitar hero rip off or whatever.

1674
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,080
It's like, wait, wait, you ignorant fuck.

1675
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,040
But so what though?

1676
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,040
Like doesn't matter.

1677
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,120
So what if someone calls it a rip off of hunger games?

1678
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,640
Who cares what people say about a movie doesn't mean it's going to be bad.

1679
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,440
Doesn't mean people won't go see it.

1680
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,840
There's plenty of things there, you know, based off of other things, make it even more

1681
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
gory or something.

1682
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,840
Also, I think I shit a lot already kind of spawned off because of the hunger games.

1683
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,080
Like what was the other big teenage book movie they started doing the maze runners, the maze

1684
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:03,800
runner or is that it was in.

1685
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:09,080
There's also, uh, there was the other one that was by the same author that did like

1686
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:15,160
the, um, which I can't remember what it's called now.

1687
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,360
Um, yeah, they had, they've had a few other ones.

1688
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,960
There was, um, I don't, they all suck.

1689
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,960
That's what it was.

1690
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:26,600
Uh, but yeah, there's been several books of that genre that have been made into movies

1691
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,600
and stuff.

1692
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,600
So what's it matter?

1693
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,600
Early days.

1694
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:37,120
I mean, even, let me just, oh, and also battle royale two was crappy, hilariously crappy

1695
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,120
divergent.

1696
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,160
Oh, divergent.

1697
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,160
Divergent isn't the same.

1698
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,160
Tiger Claw got me.

1699
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,160
That's what I was thinking of.

1700
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,960
But it's a completely different kind of genre.

1701
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,040
Yeah, but those movies exist because of the hunger games because they were looking for

1702
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,040
the next young adult.

1703
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,040
They want young adult shit.

1704
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,040
Yeah.

1705
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,800
But you know, I mean, if they wanted to do like a battle royale rip off, they could do

1706
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,440
like a supernatural thing to it.

1707
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,440
That's the problem.

1708
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,580
See the reason why I'll tell you why they haven't made a, um, new or a remake of battle

1709
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:02,580
royale.

1710
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:03,580
The running man.

1711
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,580
There's another one like that, by the way.

1712
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:05,580
Ooh, yes.

1713
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:06,580
They should do a remake of that.

1714
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:10,940
The reason why they can't do a remake of battle royale is because they can't stretch it out

1715
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:15,220
to be a franchise and milk that shit for as much fucking money as they can.

1716
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,220
That is the real reason.

1717
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,220
They tried in Japan.

1718
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,220
We saw it happen.

1719
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,220
Let me bring it back to the comics.

1720
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,620
We're going to bring it back to the topic that started this whole tangent.

1721
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:22,620
No, that's okay.

1722
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:26,060
And that is Kojima taking on horror games potentially because you know, he basically

1723
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:29,160
is saying in that tweet, I'm trying to put myself in a horror game mood.

1724
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,060
So it's, I mean, he didn't say it like that, but it's read the subtext.

1725
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:38,060
That's not the thing I thought he was going to talk about because he, the rumor was saying

1726
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,820
the next thing Kojima productions were going to do was a movie.

1727
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:45,740
Oh, there was the, Oh, so maybe what if he did a horror movie?

1728
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:51,860
That seems likely, or what if he put the studios like CG, you know, cause you could do a whole,

1729
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:56,420
I mean, especially as good as Death Stranding looked and how beautifully everything moved.

1730
01:24:56,420 --> 01:25:01,580
Imagine if, well, in another, just earlier than that, uh, Detroit was the same way.

1731
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,420
It was all mocap acting.

1732
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:10,660
You could do a movie all in mocap CG like that, which would give you a lot more, say,

1733
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:13,300
less special, special effects.

1734
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,300
You know what I mean?

1735
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:17,340
Things that actually seem more immersive in their environment.

1736
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,340
What if he's doing that?

1737
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,340
Who knows?

1738
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,860
Uh, only Kojima knows.

1739
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:26,200
So we can, we can only look for the hints, uh, within the tweets in the time being.

1740
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,200
That's all we can do.

1741
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,420
Next franchise to be released, the audition.

1742
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:32,060
Let's move on and talk about other movies.

1743
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,600
You don't know what the audition is.

1744
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,600
I don't think.

1745
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,100
I don't think so.

1746
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:41,300
It's this woman auditions a man to be, or she's pretending to be the audition, but she's

1747
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:44,860
like trying him to be her husband and then it's kind of like borderline fake snuff film

1748
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,860
type thing.

1749
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,860
It's really, it's creepy.

1750
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:47,860
Anyway.

1751
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,860
Yeah.

1752
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:49,860
And I haven't watched it.

1753
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,860
How about something family friendly?

1754
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:51,860
Okay.

1755
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:52,860
How about Sonic?

1756
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:53,860
Okay.

1757
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,140
So again, Sanic.

1758
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:00,020
So you know how much they were saying that the redesign costs the company, right?

1759
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:03,860
When the, the, the rumor was something like 35 million or something like that.

1760
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:09,780
Well, there is a source close to the production quotes, quote, quote, um, uh, that was released

1761
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:14,900
through IndieWire that said that it was actually less than 5 million for Paramount.

1762
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:19,380
Um, a reason being, and actually the reason why this makes a lot of sense is because apparently

1763
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:23,980
when the first trailer came out, the only, uh, the effects that were finished was the

1764
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:24,980
stuff in the trailer.

1765
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:28,980
So keep in mind how much VFX costs for design and render.

1766
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:35,980
Um, on top of that too, they did, now they did have to rework the, um, you know, the

1767
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:40,420
character design, reanimate, stuff like that, but that's going to be a lot less, especially

1768
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,300
if most of the rig is already done.

1769
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,220
The body really looks about the same.

1770
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,380
It's re-rigging the face, right?

1771
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,660
And if they didn't have to add effects to it, going in afterwards to add the effects

1772
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:52,140
would really put it much, much lower.

1773
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:57,900
They didn't have as much work to do, especially if that redesign was, uh, redesign was done

1774
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,620
a lot earlier than we saw it happen.

1775
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:04,140
So, and you know, it could be possible because this happens a lot.

1776
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:09,660
I mean, in 3d design, in web design, in anything, you know, anytime you design a character,

1777
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:12,620
you're going to have mock-ups.

1778
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:16,300
How many times have you looked at a beta version of the game and seeing that a character looks

1779
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,300
completely different?

1780
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,820
What about that pirate game that turned into Banjo Kazooie?

1781
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:20,820
Right?

1782
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,820
Right.

1783
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:26,060
So, I mean, and there's still like erroneous data for some of those models that are in

1784
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:27,060
games.

1785
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,060
The same thing happens with movies, especially when you're dealing with CG, you're going

1786
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,140
to have test mock-ups.

1787
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:39,300
So it could very well be that they may have already had that design already done.

1788
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:43,740
You know, I think even if it had been 35 million, even I know it was five, but even if it had

1789
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:48,240
been 35 million, I think it would have still been worth the investment because this movie,

1790
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,440
you know, and it's funny because we just were talking about how Twitter and internet noise

1791
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:56,880
doesn't always really matter at the end of the day, but at the same time, something felt

1792
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,320
very different and legit about the Sonic movie talk.

1793
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,720
And I really think this movie would have just straight up bombed.

1794
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,160
There would have been so, like even myself, maybe, and maybe this is why I'm like, oh,

1795
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:10,040
this is going to turn around because even myself, like based on that first movie trailer,

1796
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,080
I was like, this is going to be bad.

1797
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,360
I don't, I'm not going to see this.

1798
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,360
Forget it.

1799
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,360
I'll just wait.

1800
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,360
And what comes on Blu-ray.

1801
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,480
I mean, it's a trailer.

1802
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,760
Even I'm kind of like, well, I think I've had something to go with, I'll probably go

1803
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,760
check it out.

1804
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,760
Why not?

1805
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,520
And I think there's a lot of people that now were like, Sonic, oh yes, that is the character

1806
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,200
I remember from my childhood.

1807
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,040
I think that, I think it's going to make up that 35 million or 5 million, whatever it

1808
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,040
is in box office.

1809
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,040
There's another point to this too.

1810
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:37,600
And these are a couple of deleted tweets by one of their VFX designers, um, named, uh,

1811
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,640
actually a motion capture animator, Stu Whitten, um, at Stu underscore FX on Twitter.

1812
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,120
Um, and this was on November 12th.

1813
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:51,960
Oh, one said pretty much went back to our original design, LOL, see, number two, mad

1814
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,520
props to our character lab in Vancouver team.

1815
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,280
And he had a link on there, but these were deleted.

1816
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,960
So apparently this design, like I said, was already done.

1817
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,960
Hmm.

1818
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,800
So very interesting.

1819
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,920
It doesn't surprise me.

1820
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,760
I had a feeling that it was already done.

1821
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:13,820
Um, tiger claw and chat says it has a lot to live up to considering the success detective

1822
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:18,420
Pikachu had, um, that's pretty true as well, you know, detective Pikachu did pretty damn

1823
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,420
well.

1824
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:23,860
Um, and I did go see that in the theater actually, and it was a super fucking cute movie.

1825
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:31,500
So, um, yeah, I mean, I have to say, uh, in the pre trailer, the first trailer era, when

1826
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:36,220
tiger claw would post all these things on Sonic, I would, I would want to be like, dude,

1827
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:37,340
stop trying to make fetch happen.

1828
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:41,100
This movie's destined for failure, but now I'm like, all right, I get where your hype

1829
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,100
is.

1830
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:48,100
I may not be leading that hype train, but I'm like, okay, I see why people are excited.

1831
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,100
I get it.

1832
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,940
It looks, it looks kind of neat.

1833
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:54,580
So all right, anyhow, let's move on.

1834
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:59,020
Let's talk about, uh, potentially the future of gaming in our next story.

1835
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,020
Loki.

1836
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,020
All right.

1837
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,260
Uh, so obviously we're waiting, um, with beta breath about the announcement of the PlayStation

1838
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:10,060
five and wondering what the hell is Sony going to offer with that?

1839
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:15,620
Well, we get a little bit of a glimpse with a brand new patent for their controller.

1840
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:21,460
Now the controller looks pretty similar to the dual shock for, um, just some minor tweaks

1841
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,460
with how it is.

1842
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:30,380
One thing that is noticed on the redesign is that the light bar seems to be missing.

1843
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:34,340
Um, it doesn't seem to be in that picture, at least from what I can see.

1844
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:40,220
Still has the touch pad available, um, on top there, but maybe that'll be a touch screen.

1845
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,220
Who knows?

1846
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:45,660
But right now, um, not a whole lot that we can see other than, I guess, being that there

1847
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:50,300
is no light bar there, I guess that kind of makes sense because I'm assuming there may

1848
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:53,980
not be a camera, although there would have to be a camera because you'd have to, how

1849
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,740
would you get PlayStation VR to work?

1850
01:30:55,740 --> 01:31:00,020
So the VR needs one, well, unless they're going to change how that works, but I don't

1851
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,020
know what that would be.

1852
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,020
I don't know what that would be.

1853
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,020
Can do that.

1854
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:04,020
So we'll see.

1855
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,020
Um, but yeah, it looks pretty similar.

1856
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:11,820
Maybe they just decided, I mean, what games use that light bar for control with a camera

1857
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:16,420
that can't just be subbed in for the move, which is kind of required to use VR anyway.

1858
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:19,500
Like that, that the controller light bar hasn't been used on any recent games.

1859
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,660
I mean, I think it's pretty and I think it makes a neat ambient effect.

1860
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,660
Don't get me wrong.

1861
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:27,380
Yeah, they use it for like indicators and stuff like that sometimes, but it's not like

1862
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:28,380
anything meaningful.

1863
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,740
And there's also that tiny little light strip in the, in the touch pad that you could kind

1864
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:35,180
of use that for, um, maybe instead of having that whole backlight.

1865
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:39,180
So, but, and then, and also just because this is a patent doesn't mean it's going to show

1866
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,100
the exact design of that.

1867
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,140
Maybe they'll tweak that and have it in there.

1868
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,140
Who knows?

1869
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,620
Um, but it looks pretty similar.

1870
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:50,100
I mean the same layout and everything, they're not moving the six around or anything like

1871
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,100
that.

1872
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:55,860
I mean, it's, if you were to tell me that's a DualShock 4, I'd probably believe you.

1873
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,740
So for the most part, it just kind of looks like they're just sticking with what's worked

1874
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:02,820
in the last generation, which seems plenty like a good idea to me.

1875
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:06,540
I guess there's no, we're not expecting any big change with like, oh, they're saying like

1876
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:07,540
the share button showed up.

1877
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,420
Maybe like similar, they're going to have haptic feedback or whatever in the triggers.

1878
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,380
And so that was something that they were talking about before.

1879
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:17,600
And that's something that the Xbox One X sort of has a little bit of rumble in the triggers

1880
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,600
as well.

1881
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,300
So, uh, be curious to see what that's like, but like you're playing horizon and you go

1882
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,780
to like fire the bow and it's going to kind of do that haptic feedback to make it really

1883
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:29,260
feel like you're pulling the bowstring back or something like that.

1884
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,260
Yeah.

1885
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:31,260
Yeah.

1886
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,260
So that can be neat.

1887
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,260
Yeah.

1888
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,260
All right.

1889
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,260
Well, we'll see.

1890
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:39,260
And again, we don't really know until it is officially unveiled by PlayStation.

1891
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,460
All right.

1892
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,780
Moving on to talking about sales, sales, sales, because you know, there are going to be a

1893
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:48,060
shit ton of sales on Black Friday.

1894
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,060
They're going to be online.

1895
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,060
They're going to be in stores.

1896
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,060
They're going to be everywhere.

1897
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:55,940
I'm sure some of you more thrifty, uh, gamers out there already have your eyes on what might

1898
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,380
you pick up on Black Friday.

1899
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:01,500
Sadly, you know what I'm not seeing on Black Friday sales, Death Stranding.

1900
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,780
I was hoping, I was hoping I might be able to get a deal on it if I waited, but it looks

1901
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,100
like that's not happening.

1902
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:09,140
So maybe, I don't think it is at this point.

1903
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:14,320
Uh, but you can already get in on some of the PlayStation four Black Friday deals, uh,

1904
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:18,740
which include, uh, I guess the PlayStation VR is coming way down and this is a big one

1905
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:26,940
$199 as opposed to $300, uh, the game bundle that has the VR headset, the camera and five

1906
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:32,360
games, including Astrobot Rescue Mission, Skyrim VR, Resident Evil 7, Everybody's Golf

1907
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,020
and PlayStation VR worlds.

1908
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,440
That's pretty damn good for $200.

1909
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,500
So I expect that may, uh, that may get some people on board with that.

1910
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,500
We'll see.

1911
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:44,780
Um, also $200 for just a straight up PlayStation four.

1912
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:48,860
If you don't have PS4 yet, if you haven't jumped into the, uh, latest generation, or

1913
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:52,420
maybe, you know, you've been Xbox this whole time, you haven't, uh, picked up PS4 for whatever

1914
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:57,500
reason, $200 for a one terabyte PlayStation four that comes with Last of Us, God of War

1915
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:02,220
and Horizon Zero Dawn, a PlayStation four pro for $300.

1916
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:07,060
So that's, um, pretty darn, you know, those are some big, deep cuts, but you would expect

1917
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:12,100
those types of, uh, deep cuts, uh, this, you know, especially right before PlayStation

1918
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:13,580
five is coming out.

1919
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:18,540
Um, also, uh, Death Stranding is going to be free with a PlayStation four bundle, a

1920
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,700
certain one, uh, that you can pick up.

1921
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:25,260
So there's lots of deals and that's just the official PlayStation deals.

1922
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:31,100
But I know everywhere, every, uh, company is having different sales of their own.

1923
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:35,940
Uh, Loki, I can't help but notice you have a cheap ass gamer who I know they live off

1924
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:36,940
this stuff.

1925
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:39,140
So anything that caught your eye over there?

1926
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,740
Uh, not really.

1927
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,700
I was just kind of taking a look to see what they had.

1928
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:47,340
Yeah, they had, I haven't pulled it up, but they had on their Twitter, uh, link to an

1929
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:52,340
Excel, it's not an Excel spreadsheet, it's a Google docs, a spreadsheet or whatever that

1930
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:55,820
they've got, um, breaking down the different deals.

1931
01:34:55,820 --> 01:35:00,060
I actually visited that the other day because I wanted to see if Death Stranding was on

1932
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,060
it.

1933
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:02,060
Yeah.

1934
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:05,780
And I don't see Death Stranding on any of these, but there's lots of other stuff that's

1935
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,780
on here.

1936
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:08,020
I mean, it's worth checking out.

1937
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:09,020
Oh yeah.

1938
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:12,260
This is the time to catch up if there's anything else, you know, not from November this year.

1939
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:15,460
Uh, you know, cause we all know Pokemon sword and shield ain't getting discounted.

1940
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,540
So, you know, if there's anything not from this month that you want to pick up from the

1941
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,860
year, you know, Black Friday is going to be a great time to do it.

1942
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:26,100
Uh, and you know, I think some places won't reveal their deals until what Black Friday

1943
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,860
or Cyber Monday will be another one.

1944
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:28,860
Right?

1945
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:29,860
Yeah, that would be another one.

1946
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:32,820
Um, just trying to see what other stuff they have.

1947
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:36,220
I'm gonna wait for like, and obviously we'll have a steam sale pretty soon.

1948
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:38,780
So I'd be curious to see what they have on there.

1949
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:40,500
I made my purchase this week.

1950
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,600
So I've, what'd you pick up?

1951
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:48,180
I picked up, um, it was a game that I played and I had talked about a little bit on my

1952
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,420
Twitter as well.

1953
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:54,440
I had played this at one of our Sac Indie arcades couple of years ago, I think in 2017.

1954
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:59,980
And it's a local dev who's out of Oakland who put out a game called black future 88.

1955
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:02,780
It's a rogue light and it's fucking amazing.

1956
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:05,300
And it's just like some indie guy that put this out.

1957
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:08,300
So it's out on switch and steam.

1958
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,300
So go check it out.

1959
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:13,780
It's like, they have a 10% off right now, so it's like 17 99, uh, while I are wants

1960
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:19,240
to recommend the recently released Contra and Castlevania collections currently 10 bucks

1961
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,460
down from 20.

1962
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:24,700
You had me for a second there when you said, Contra is like the new one and then you let

1963
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,900
the collections like, Oh, okay.

1964
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:27,900
Okay.

1965
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,620
But that back when the concert games were good, right?

1966
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:30,620
Right.

1967
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,620
Like new Contra.

1968
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,620
No.

1969
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,620
Um, let's see.

1970
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:36,140
Oh, quest buster says dragon quest builders two is 25 bucks.

1971
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,140
That's pretty good.

1972
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:41,980
Matt says Amazon is usually quiet until week of, but most of the time in lockstep with

1973
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:42,980
other retailers, prizes.

1974
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:47,540
They came out with something today, uh, cause I know TVs, that was the thing that caught

1975
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:48,540
my eye.

1976
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:53,080
Cause you guys know I still don't have a 4k TV cause I, I made the dumb mistake of buying

1977
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,300
a TV like the year before 4k became affordable.

1978
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:58,220
So I'm, I missed the fuck out.

1979
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:03,860
But now I'm starting to look at it going, Ooh, tempting, super tempting cause I kind

1980
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:09,580
of want 4k gaming and I have a PS4 pro and other things is more 4k.

1981
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,580
So I'm thinking about it.

1982
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,580
I think about it.

1983
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,580
Yeah.

1984
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:13,580
We'll see.

1985
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:17,460
But it's, it's also like, but you could also be saving that money for like buying a house,

1986
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:19,460
but we'll see.

1987
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:20,460
All right.

1988
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,460
Um, let's move on.

1989
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:26,980
Let's move on to a time before, uh, you know, before games, before black Friday was really

1990
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:32,540
like this holiday in and of itself, a simpler time when it was, when it was proper and easy

1991
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:34,020
to make a game based on poultry.

1992
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,020
Yes.

1993
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:38,620
So we're going to go back to a classic time with the classic game of the week segment

1994
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:42,460
where every week dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1995
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,660
Hey, you guys should check this game out.

1996
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:48,560
Or maybe not so much sometimes a game that you should check out, but this game is kind

1997
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,560
of stupid.

1998
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,560
Isn't this game topical?

1999
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,560
Yeah.

2000
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,560
So what'd you pick?

2001
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:58,620
Well, I think it's a game called Ego mania and like I, for the longest time I always

2002
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:01,340
thought it was a Turkey cause it doesn't look like a Turkey, but it's supposed to be a chicken

2003
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:05,220
It's that's a, that is a fucking Turkey.

2004
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:07,340
That's a fucking Turkey across the top of the screen.

2005
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:13,460
That is a ugly ass Atari, 2,600 Turkey actually looks like a very well run, you know, rendered

2006
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:17,620
Turkey for the 2,600, but still, and can I say something about the guy playing this gate?

2007
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:21,420
Cause I watched the four minutes or whatever I took of this video earlier.

2008
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,540
Whoever's playing this sucks sucks.

2009
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:29,540
I don't think he gets past like six eggs ever.

2010
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:33,060
Here is another video, but it was actually a guy recording it on the TV cause it's for

2011
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:37,140
a world record getting a fucking world record in Ego mania.

2012
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,740
Like this is stupid.

2013
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:41,140
If I had an Ego mania, I'd want it to be about waffles.

2014
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,140
Okay.

2015
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:46,180
So the first thing everybody's yelling in chat, which was the first thing I yelled,

2016
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,180
isn't this just kaboom?

2017
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:48,180
Yeah.

2018
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:54,980
So at any rate, um, it was done, uh, and it came out in January, 1993 by us games for

2019
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:56,460
the Atari 2,600.

2020
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:03,860
And it was similar in design to kaboom, which is itself derived from the arcade game avalanche.

2021
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:08,380
You know, one could make the argument that that's big bird at the top of the screen because

2022
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,380
it'd be all yellow.

2023
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:13,460
No, but it's the sad big bird from when they put them in the circus and the yellow.

2024
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:15,020
So it'd be like half sad.

2025
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:16,020
He's half sad.

2026
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,500
I'd be sad if I was in this game too.

2027
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,060
This game is fucking ugly.

2028
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:20,060
Dark soccer.

2029
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,060
I should watch follow that bird.

2030
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,940
Well, the only reason I picked it cause it's a fucking Turkey.

2031
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:28,740
You don't know the classic games of the week are not always winners and we need to know

2032
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,740
about the shit.

2033
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:30,940
So we don't repeat our mistakes.

2034
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:31,940
That's true.

2035
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:37,900
And this does come from a time and an era where games like this caused the entire industry

2036
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,900
to crash.

2037
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,100
I bet that I don't think this is as bad as ET.

2038
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,620
I used to play this game.

2039
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:43,940
I remember this game.

2040
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:45,820
Oh my God.

2041
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:46,980
I bet that's what I want.

2042
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:47,980
That's cookie monster.

2043
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:48,980
Hold on.

2044
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:49,980
Hold on a sec.

2045
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:50,980
Look at, look at the picture.

2046
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:51,980
Look.

2047
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,180
No, I'm looking at it right now.

2048
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:54,420
I played this game.

2049
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,420
Okay.

2050
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,420
I remember this game.

2051
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:57,420
Wow.

2052
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:58,420
Why didn't you play kaboom?

2053
01:39:58,420 --> 01:39:59,420
The good game.

2054
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:00,420
That's the same thing.

2055
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:01,420
I don't remember.

2056
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:02,420
Hopefully I can get this to show up.

2057
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:03,420
Oh, nevermind.

2058
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,420
You're showing the video.

2059
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:05,420
I'll send it in chat anyway.

2060
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:06,420
But anyway.

2061
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,420
Ecomania.

2062
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:08,420
It's a stupid, stupid ass game.

2063
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:09,420
Anyway.

2064
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,180
So doesn't the chicken make like clucking noises as it's going around?

2065
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:15,620
If I remember correctly, it's an Atari 2,600.

2066
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:20,300
So it probably made unless there's a port to like another console maintain.

2067
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:21,760
It's a Turkey.

2068
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,120
So anyway.

2069
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,440
So you basically have to catch eggs in a bowl and it's supposed to be a bear catching it

2070
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,440
by the way.

2071
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,440
Who's walking through honey.

2072
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,840
Cause you see how he's sinking down a little bit.

2073
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:31,840
Yeah.

2074
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:32,840
He's it's barren.

2075
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,960
Oh, 420 is the points.

2076
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,360
But I thought, I thought the bottom was all yolk from the cracked eggs.

2077
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:44,360
They kept dropping cause the guy playing sucks, but you see it's going down.

2078
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:51,160
Oh no, he drowns in the egg yolk, egg full of protein.

2079
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,160
Yeah.

2080
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,480
This little bow legged ass bear though.

2081
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,640
So maybe it, maybe it is.

2082
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,640
All right.

2083
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,640
Let me look at it.

2084
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,640
Let me wait till an egg falls on the ground.

2085
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,640
No, he's just stupid.

2086
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:05,600
Um, anyway, so, um, you have to catch eggs in a bowl on top of your head.

2087
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,480
I mean, it's the, the, you actually have two difficulties.

2088
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,720
You have an easier one where you get a bigger, a larger hat for catching.

2089
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,720
It's an upside down hat.

2090
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,720
It looks like a bowl.

2091
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,720
Fuck ever.

2092
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,720
Anyway.

2093
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,280
Um, so yeah.

2094
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:22,120
It's not like it has a plot cause it's an Atari 2,600 game.

2095
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:30,000
So electronic games in June 20, uh, 20, 1983 said it was quote, delightful in a game that

2096
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,160
improved on Kaboom.

2097
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:37,000
And it said that was, and I'm going to quote this again, a fully animated delight that

2098
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:45,080
might even eclipse its inspiration with state of the art graphics on the 2,600 the fuck.

2099
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:51,200
It also, um, there was another game actually from 1982 inspired by avalanche called chicken.

2100
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:55,320
Pretty much the same, same shit, but it actually looks like a chicken.

2101
01:41:55,320 --> 01:42:01,080
I feel like the story behind this game is that big bird is deciding to poop eggs all

2102
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,160
over his friend cookie monster.

2103
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:12,320
Big bird cannot cause big bird's a dude and I mean big bird does not have the egg producing

2104
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,920
internal bits.

2105
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,360
Well big bird was really a bird anyway.

2106
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,360
Forget it.

2107
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:22,520
I'm not going to try and just, I'm not trying to try and justify this game.

2108
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:27,960
It was designed by Henry will and West Traeger music composed by Todd Marshall.

2109
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,960
Okay.

2110
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,320
I heard the target 2,600 in 1983.

2111
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:35,480
I think I did read that one thing that separates this from kaboom.

2112
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:40,160
So there is one way that this is different from kaboom is that if you actually get all

2113
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:45,080
the eggs in the stage, which this guy never does a spoiler cause he is fucking terrible

2114
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,080
at this game.

2115
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,200
But if you get all the eggs in a stage, is Bobby Black Wolf playing this game?

2116
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,680
No, come on.

2117
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,680
Let's let's be fair.

2118
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:56,880
Bobby Black Wolf would be like way better than stage one is actually playing in big

2119
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,880
hat mode.

2120
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:58,880
Oh my God.

2121
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:06,640
Anyway, but apparently if you catch all of the eggs, you get to throw the eggs back.

2122
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,640
That is the big twist.

2123
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:13,920
Even in kaboom, if you got to throw a bomb back at the bandit, that is the big twist

2124
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,920
in this game.

2125
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:15,920
Apparently.

2126
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,760
So, and Bobby says, Hey, I would be better than this guy.

2127
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,040
No, that's true.

2128
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:30,560
And VG realness says the shade of it all SSJ 100 Matt does a bunch of salt emoji.

2129
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,600
I'm so mean.

2130
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,440
We should have, you know, for our next game jam, we should have terrible ripoffs as the

2131
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,440
theme.

2132
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,440
And then we can do there.

2133
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,440
So that's, that's a good idea.

2134
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:44,920
But actually I will say this tiger claw with a really good thought in our chat, tiger claw

2135
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:51,320
said, maybe it's time for a new category called the classic shitty game of the week.

2136
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:54,480
Well, you know, dark soccer already has next year's theming.

2137
01:43:54,480 --> 01:44:00,320
I can do a shitty game a month, but you already have a monthly thing, but it's still a classic

2138
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,320
game.

2139
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,320
Okay.

2140
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,880
So it would fall under the umbrella of classic game.

2141
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,040
It would just be my category would be, and here's your piece of shit for the month.

2142
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,040
Okay.

2143
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,040
All right.

2144
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,040
All right.

2145
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,040
So do it.

2146
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:14,320
So 2020, we're going to have what was classic pinball, classic pinball, and we're going

2147
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,760
to have pinball 2000 classic shitty game of the week.

2148
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,760
Classic shitty game.

2149
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,760
Oh, this is good.

2150
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,760
This is good.

2151
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:21,760
Cause this will be a chance.

2152
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,560
I mean, we're, we've already, Halo's going to be the first game we've already, you've

2153
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:29,120
already done Halo, but you, and we've already recognized games like miss nude world 96.

2154
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,920
That's not really a shitty game.

2155
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:31,920
It's actually fun.

2156
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:32,920
Yeah, that's true.

2157
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:35,880
The technology in that game, the soundtrack, everybody move your body.

2158
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:41,560
Um, like I would do stuff like, I mean, night trap, night traps gotta be one of them.

2159
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:42,960
I think I might've done night trap.

2160
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:43,960
I think you did too.

2161
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:50,640
Um, I could do stuff like, um, Oh, like WCW thunder, which is one of the games that I

2162
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,640
thought was so bad.

2163
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,640
I took it back.

2164
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:53,640
Oh God.

2165
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,640
It's a good one.

2166
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,640
Oh yeah.

2167
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:56,640
Oh yeah.

2168
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:57,640
Okay.

2169
01:44:57,640 --> 01:44:58,640
I'll do yours.

2170
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,640
I mean, I'll just spoiler alert.

2171
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:06,280
People don't fucking see that happening, which seriously, uh, what was all those games on

2172
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:08,360
the 2,600 that caused the video game to crash?

2173
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:11,680
Like the Chuck wagging pure in a Chuck wagon, like it was garbage.

2174
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,080
Uh, commercials were funny.

2175
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,560
What else on 2,600?

2176
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,120
Not the, no adult games.

2177
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,120
Don't go.

2178
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:19,280
So it's showing things like beat them and eat them.

2179
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,280
Cause that's too easy.

2180
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,280
That's gross.

2181
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,280
Yeah.

2182
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,280
But like, like, you know, there was et there's Pac-Man.

2183
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,280
Yeah.

2184
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:28,040
There's plenty of like, you just do a whole year of shitty 2,600 games and fill it up

2185
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,040
like that.

2186
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,440
Anyway.

2187
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,000
I mean, fuck I might even, I don't know.

2188
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Yeah.

2189
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
By the way, this is a completely off topic.

2190
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
What else is new?

2191
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:43,080
I picked up one of the 1978 punk table tennis consoles that plugs into the little UHF.

2192
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,080
Oh rad.

2193
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,080
Thing.

2194
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,080
Um, I haven't tested it or anything.

2195
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,120
I paid like eight bucks for it, but I picked one up.

2196
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:52,480
Uh, the other thing that you picked up that you have yet to bring up on this show, fail,

2197
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,880
fail, that you sent me a picture of last night.

2198
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,320
Oh, well we don't own it.

2199
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,320
We're borrowing it.

2200
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:58,320
Still it's your house.

2201
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:01,080
I have, um, an Elvira scared stiff in my garage.

2202
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,080
So cool.

2203
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,080
Come play.

2204
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,080
I will.

2205
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,080
I think I might.

2206
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:06,080
Girl.

2207
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,080
Don't threaten me with any time.

2208
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:10,560
Well, you know, um, Wednesday night is our classic gaming shit thing at my house.

2209
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,240
Well, you know what I mean?

2210
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:13,240
It's like we do it.

2211
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:14,240
Um, we do it.

2212
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,240
Wow.

2213
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,240
You hype it up so well.

2214
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:17,240
Well, we, we do this thing.

2215
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,240
Come over and have a shit time at dark soccer's shitty party.

2216
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,240
I'll bake.

2217
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,920
I'm going to be in there baking anyway, so fuck, cause I've got to bake for the sisters

2218
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,840
and have to bake for Thanksgiving and have to bake for Dan's birthday, which is Friday.

2219
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:32,080
So, I mean, what the fuck ever sisters coming over, I want to play pinball with them.

2220
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,080
I don't think so.

2221
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,080
Really?

2222
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,800
Cause I think, well, I mean, I'll invite the sisters, but I doubt they'd want to just play,

2223
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:42,880
you know, Sega Saturn and Nintendo, but at any rate, um, but yeah, we do a classic gaming

2224
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,840
thing on the night before Thanksgiving.

2225
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,480
So you've been over for a couple of those.

2226
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,480
Yeah.

2227
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:48,480
We've been before.

2228
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,080
Just dependent if we remember when we did the smash party.

2229
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:52,080
I do.

2230
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,080
Yeah.

2231
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,080
So we did it.

2232
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,080
One of our smash parties was like that.

2233
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:58,200
VGRealness says the stuff dark soccer bakes looks so damn good.

2234
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,800
Well, maybe dark soccer will have to send a care package.

2235
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,800
Maybe I will.

2236
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,440
Even though Canadian Thanksgiving already happened.

2237
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,440
Well, yeah.

2238
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,440
Okay.

2239
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,440
Okay.

2240
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:07,440
I'll tell you what.

2241
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,480
Message me on the Facebooks.

2242
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,100
I will arrange a bake exchange with you.

2243
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:15,320
If your name is VGRealness or you're opening this up to everybody.

2244
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:16,320
In return for poutine.

2245
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,320
Oh, okay.

2246
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,320
Are you opening this up to everybody or just VGRealness?

2247
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,320
No, just VGRealness.

2248
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,680
Cause VGRealness can get me Canada stuff.

2249
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:22,680
Okay.

2250
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:26,040
Just like freeze pack me some Tim Hortons.

2251
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,960
I want some fucking ketchup chips.

2252
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,560
No, no, no, no.

2253
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,480
I have to look for Canadian stuff I want.

2254
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,480
So, but I will do it.

2255
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,120
Cause we can get all dressed here now.

2256
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,120
I love all dressed.

2257
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:37,120
Oh my God.

2258
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,120
But you know what?

2259
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,120
But you know what?

2260
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:43,520
If you do that, if we can set up a food trade and I will also send you C's candy.

2261
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,520
Okay.

2262
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,520
So anyway.

2263
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,520
All right.

2264
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,520
Moving on.

2265
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,880
We actually, we have a break segment this week.

2266
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:50,880
I'm very excited.

2267
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:54,800
So we're going to take a quick break in studio, but for you guys that are watching along or

2268
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,880
listening along on the podcast, this is great.

2269
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,200
So we haven't talked a lot about Stadia tonight.

2270
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,840
And that's because none of us have played it yet, but you know who has played it is

2271
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,960
our voiceover guy VX Jason XV.

2272
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:12,580
So he has worked very hard on this segment after he got his Stadia to give his impressions

2273
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:13,580
for you guys.

2274
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:16,600
And so I'm very happy to debut it here tonight for you guys.

2275
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:20,480
So I want to say a big preemptive, thank you to Jason for this.

2276
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,740
I'm really excited to have this here on the show tonight.

2277
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:27,560
So without further ado, let's get to Jason's thoughts on Google Stadia.

2278
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:44,080
Tonight, Jason gets more than 13 seconds of airtime.

2279
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,760
I get to chat at you during this break about my feelings on Google Stadia, the next great

2280
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,760
streaming game service.

2281
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,360
What do I think about it?

2282
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:53,560
Find out right now on orange voiceover radio.

2283
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:11,680
Google Stadia, Google's first grade foray into non-mobile gaming Stadia officially released

2284
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:15,560
the week of November 18th, depending on where you live and your circumstances, you likely

2285
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,340
received it someday that week.

2286
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:20,800
My account set up email came out on Wednesday, which I promptly opened and set up waiting

2287
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,720
anxiously for the Stadia package to arrive the next day.

2288
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:25,400
And it did.

2289
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:28,000
The Stadia package arrived on Thursday while I was still working.

2290
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I did open it up, inspect all the contents, take initial notes on all the hardware and

2291
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,960
plugged in the controller to charge it just in case I decided to use it wirelessly.

2292
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:40,200
You receive your color choice of a very typical looking console controller with a slight difference

2293
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,200
in buttons.

2294
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:44,800
A double row of menu buttons on the top of the front face of the controller, a Stadia

2295
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,040
button located in the same place as the PlayStation button on PlayStation style controllers.

2296
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:53,760
It has PlayStation style analog sticks parallel to the bottom, yet Microsoft style face buttons,

2297
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,920
A on bottom, Y on top.

2298
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,120
There is also the requisite physical documentation with the lightest of details, a Chromecast

2299
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:01,800
Ultra and its power brick.

2300
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:05,480
The most noteworthy detail in all of this was that the Chromecast's power brick has

2301
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:08,280
an ethernet port in it, which was neat.

2302
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:11,560
I've since learned this is a standard feature of the Chromecast Ultra, but I've never

2303
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:15,920
used that before I received it in this package, so it's still neat.

2304
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,080
I had a bunch of things to do on Thursday after I was done working, so the bulk of my

2305
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:23,600
review time wasn't particularly extensive, it was only about a little bit over an hour.

2306
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:27,680
As I do with all new systems, I spent the first amount of time going through the menus,

2307
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:33,480
and the first point of contention I faced was that when you use Stadia.com on a PC,

2308
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:35,920
you have no access to the Stadia store.

2309
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,800
Both Stadia.com and playing via the Chromecast tell you to open the app to manage your Stadia

2310
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,880
library or purchase games.

2311
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:48,280
So I pull up my phone and claim the first two free Stadia Pro subscriber games, Samurai

2312
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:52,480
Showdown, naturally the 2019 release, and Destiny 2, the collection.

2313
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:56,520
Given the lack of time I had Thursday night, I opted for Samurai Showdown because I probably

2314
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:00,200
wouldn't even get through character creation in Destiny 2.

2315
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:04,480
Based off how playing Destiny went, I was correct in that assumption.

2316
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,400
Google has a gigantic leg up on content service providers.

2317
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,640
Their history, growth, and optimization for all things networking means that they have

2318
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:14,760
data centers around the world, close to major internet hubs and in some cases even closer

2319
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,200
to consumers.

2320
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:20,360
This capacity is immense for their purposes alone, and grows even larger still since they

2321
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,960
sell it to customers via Google Cloud.

2322
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,640
And then there's the technical proficiency of the tools in use.

2323
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:29,800
Their stewardship of the VP9 codec, the video codec they encode every YouTube video into

2324
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:34,480
among others, means that they have gigantic amounts of source materials and tools to encode,

2325
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,240
stream, and leverage the codec's capability.

2326
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:41,640
I assume Stadia's output is VP9, I don't actually know.

2327
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:45,520
There's been nothing in the Stadia interface that actually reports this, there's no technical

2328
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,880
details right click option that I noticed, and I haven't done the research for it yet.

2329
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:54,280
But if they don't use VP9 for this, I would be very surprised.

2330
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:57,280
So my Stadia controller had already been plugged in and was charging.

2331
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,320
I had to install Chrome in order to access Stadia.com on this PC as I hadn't yet.

2332
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:07,080
And upon starting the Samurai Showdown, I immediately ran into something peculiar.

2333
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:11,360
When you hit a button on any controller in Samurai Showdown for the first time, it displays

2334
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:14,080
the confirmation that the device is in use.

2335
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,960
I had accidentally hit a key on the keyboard, and it said keyboard connected.

2336
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:22,960
And then when I used the Stadia controller, it said player 2's controller is connected.

2337
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:23,960
Player 2.

2338
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:24,960
Hmm.

2339
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,840
And, unsurprisingly, Player 2's controller is not able to navigate the menus, so the

2340
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,680
Stadia controller was doing, effectively, nothing in game.

2341
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:37,760
Okay, I have a lot of accessories plugged into this PC.

2342
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,120
Is it Player 2 because the keyboard was pressed first?

2343
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:43,480
Close the game, log back into it, hit the controller first.

2344
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,480
Nope.

2345
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,120
Still Player 2 controller connected.

2346
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:50,600
Look around at all my obvious things, my VR controllers are shut off, I do have the Xbox

2347
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:53,240
wireless adapter plugged in, might have to remove that.

2348
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,360
Oh, wait a second.

2349
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:58,680
My Xbox One controller didn't land on the dock correctly, so it was still on.

2350
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:02,800
Okay, shut that off, restart the game just because of habits, and now the Stadia controller

2351
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,600
connects for Player 1.

2352
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:05,600
Hooray!

2353
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:12,080
This was an immediate realization that the Stadia controller is seemingly not necessary.

2354
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:19,200
The upfront $129 cost for Stadia now feels excessive, but more on that in a little bit.

2355
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,460
Samurai Showdown played well.

2356
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,960
There were no glaring visual imperfections to speak of.

2357
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:27,840
I could tell a minor fuzzing and shine that I know has to do with re-encoding into lossy

2358
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,480
codex, but only because I'm looking for it.

2359
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,880
Only because I'm really staring at the sharp edge of static lines and text.

2360
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,560
If you want an example of what this is and why it is, I recommend Tom Scott's video

2361
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:44,040
Why Snow and Confetti Ruin YouTube Video Quality.

2362
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,600
The weirdest thing about this is load times in the game.

2363
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:50,080
Between battles, there's still a 3-5 second load time.

2364
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,840
Whenever I think of a server-backed system, I immediately expect the server to be powerful.

2365
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:59,860
More powerful than my PC, more powerful than whatever system I'm using to access it.

2366
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:05,120
The load time is likely no worse than it would be if locally on my PC, and giving every player

2367
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:09,880
a super-powered PC doesn't really scale to the number of players I assume Google hopes

2368
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:13,040
to achieve with this.

2369
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:17,040
The controls for Samurai Showdown felt a little rigid, but I think that's intentional Samurai

2370
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:21,320
Showdown historically has always been a bit more strict, more so than Street Fighter,

2371
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,240
way less floaty than Super Smash Bros.

2372
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,360
But granted, this is also an assumption.

2373
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:30,120
I haven't played Samurai Showdown since the original Neo Geo version, and I was never

2374
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,480
any good at it.

2375
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:35,040
This isn't something that I can compare a feel against, because that varies from game

2376
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:39,880
to game, and again, I don't have enough experience at Samurai Showdown.

2377
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:42,680
This is something that's going to be best determined by something that I'm adequately

2378
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:46,560
experienced with, and as of this writing, the only games that I've played outside of

2379
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:52,880
Stadia in its library are Thumper and Trials Rising, and I'm not really interested in re-buying

2380
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,480
games.

2381
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,320
And that's a pretty big sticking point for me.

2382
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:59,940
I consider the library to be one of Stadia's two elephants in the room.

2383
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:02,320
I don't like the purchasing model.

2384
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:06,280
Google Play should sell these games directly.

2385
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:10,800
This was my biggest complaint about OnLive, because if they fold and I lose my library,

2386
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,800
that hurts.

2387
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,760
And as far as I'm aware, that's exactly what happened.

2388
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:19,000
I didn't lose anything at the time, because they were waiving subscription charges, and

2389
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,720
I just used the 30 minute free trials of all of the games that they offered.

2390
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:25,480
I never bought anything directly through OnLive.

2391
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:29,080
But all of this comes through as being a digital purchaser.

2392
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,480
I've used Steam since its release in 2004.

2393
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:34,660
I can't tell you the last time I bought a boxed PC game.

2394
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:39,720
Since about 2-3 years into the 3DS's life, and this entire generation of gaming consoles,

2395
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:42,000
I have a strictly digital library.

2396
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,280
No Xbox discs.

2397
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,520
No PS4 discs.

2398
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,520
No Switch cartridges.

2399
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:47,040
Okay, that's a lie.

2400
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:51,280
I have a disc of Titanfall for the Xbox One, but that's because I wanted the limited edition

2401
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,440
box and the game came with, but it's still shrink-wrapped.

2402
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:56,960
And I already own the game digitally.

2403
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:00,440
I have a high degree of confidence in Microsoft and Sony staying power.

2404
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:04,520
I had little confidence in OnLive staying power, and I'm on the fence about Google's

2405
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,480
continued support of Stadia, so I'm kinda torn.

2406
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,880
And this doesn't apply to Game Pass nor PS Now.

2407
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,520
Those are both in addition to something you already have.

2408
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,440
For Game Pass, you already have a PC or an Xbox One.

2409
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:20,720
For PS Now, you already have a PlayStation, or a Vita, or a PlayStation TV.

2410
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:22,880
Do those still work if you already own them?

2411
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,620
I don't actually know.

2412
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:29,600
But on that fact, the PlayStation TV, a product, died before PS Now.

2413
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,020
The service did.

2414
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:34,480
Game Pass and PlayStation Now can persist as long as those two companies are still in

2415
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:35,740
the gaming business.

2416
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:38,700
And even if those services go away, there's a fallback.

2417
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:43,580
They still offer their digital library for use on hardware directly.

2418
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,540
So then what is Stadia's fallback?

2419
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,260
I don't know of one that already exists.

2420
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:49,540
I don't know if they've said there will be one.

2421
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:51,700
I do hope one comes.

2422
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:57,020
So going back to the $129 upfront cost, when you sit back and add it up, it's not unreasonable.

2423
01:56:57,020 --> 01:57:03,740
For $129, you get a controller, $40, a Chromecast Ultra, $70, Stadia Pro for three months, which

2424
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:06,540
is a $30 value so far as they've announced so far.

2425
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:09,900
I'm not paying for Stadia Pro until February 2020.

2426
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:12,860
It does seem like Google is taking a bit of a loss here.

2427
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:16,740
I do think that allowing people that already have a game controller and a PC, which is

2428
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:21,580
many people, to pay $10 and just start playing games would have been a great decision on

2429
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:22,780
their part.

2430
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:26,580
After all, the point here is to not need powerful hardware.

2431
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:29,000
Okay, okay, enough about all this.

2432
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,300
Let's play some games.

2433
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,300
Yeah, Samurai Shodown played well.

2434
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,740
I made it through a handful of rounds against CPU opponents.

2435
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:39,140
I dare not play human opponents because I'm not good at fighting games, and I didn't want

2436
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:41,060
to focus my attention on battles.

2437
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:46,380
I wanted to focus my attention on everything else that Stadia is offering about this experience.

2438
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:50,500
My first round of playing was on a Windows PC, ethernet wired directly into my router

2439
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:54,500
using the Stadia controller via Google Chrome, and it held up really well.

2440
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:59,800
As I said, I also played with my Xbox controller, which also worked, albeit without the convenience

2441
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:04,480
features the Stadia controller has for simple game exiting, nor the ability to take quick

2442
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:07,360
screenshots and game clips, and so on and so forth.

2443
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,240
I don't know what more I can say here.

2444
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,520
Stadia held up on my network.

2445
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:11,520
I used Comcast.

2446
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:16,840
It's rated at 85 megabits per second as an average download speed, sub 20 millisecond

2447
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:22,240
latency, all of this to some speed test server that my router uses, and this is also on Amplify

2448
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:23,740
router equipment.

2449
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:29,240
I played a game, and it felt good, which for being on some server somewhere reasonably

2450
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:32,920
geographically close to me, I assume, is a good sign.

2451
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,560
My second round, I played Destiny.

2452
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,680
I have played through the story of Destiny 1.

2453
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:41,460
I enjoy and play a lot of first person shooters, and this is probably more representative.

2454
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:47,200
Not only this, but this was also done on Stadia via the Chromecast, and I did not plug in

2455
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,600
an ethernet cable.

2456
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:53,040
I had slightly lower hopes for this because I know wireless latency, but I was still really

2457
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:54,400
pleased with the result.

2458
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,480
I set up my character.

2459
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:59,960
I did the opening Guardian revival wake up and the initial quest to make it to the city,

2460
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:04,400
and there were one or two points in which the quality stuttered a tiny little bit in

2461
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,360
random moments, not like too much going on on the screen, anything like that.

2462
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:12,080
I didn't notice if this actually impacted my inputs.

2463
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:17,400
It was only notable for output video frame stutter, frame drops actually, and there were

2464
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:21,120
at least two to three occasions where the output video quality dropped.

2465
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:25,920
It was either a bitrate drop or a 4K downgrade to 1080p, maybe both.

2466
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:30,560
I also was not playing this on a 4K TV, so I'm not sure.

2467
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,320
Again, there's no technical indicators on the game screen to tell you anything like

2468
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,720
this, at least as far as I've encountered.

2469
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:41,400
There might be some indicator if the output channel fails outright for some reason, but

2470
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:45,600
that hasn't happened in my admittedly only few hours of playing so far.

2471
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:49,920
The cute part of Stadia, socially speaking, was that the group of Guardians that I crossed

2472
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:53,840
paths with in the opening sequence showed up in my Recent Players section of the iOS

2473
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:54,840
app.

2474
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:55,840
Cute.

2475
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,080
That said, I have not yet played Stadia via my phone nor a tablet.

2476
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:03,200
So Stadia isn't bad, network conditions permitting.

2477
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:08,160
If you have quality internet and network equipment, but lack any other high-powered devices, be

2478
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:13,160
those being a console or a sufficiently powered PC, this could be a huge boon for you.

2479
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:17,160
I don't expect it to be an overwhelming success, because the players that would choose to use

2480
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:21,520
it are a subset of players that will put money into this hobby and don't already have

2481
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:27,120
a console, don't have an up-to-date PC for these modern games, etc.

2482
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,520
But those players definitely exist.

2483
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:32,560
For me, I need to go make some progress in Death Stranding.

2484
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,440
So back to you, Studio N7.

2485
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:39,540
All right.

2486
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:41,680
Thank you so much to Jason for that.

2487
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:49,040
It was neat to hear the thoughts on Google Stadia, especially not just all the bad stuff

2488
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:52,960
or the hang-ups or even just all the good stuff, but I liked that Jason took a deeper

2489
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,200
dive there and was talking a little bit about some of the things under the hood and was

2490
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,800
actually showing the app.

2491
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:02,440
I had no idea that that was a thing, the app would show you who you were actually playing

2492
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,440
with and things like that.

2493
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,440
So that part was kind of neat.

2494
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,560
So thank you.

2495
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,320
And folks in chat, give me some kudos as well.

2496
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:14,720
We have some folks also in chat are noticing that we have a plus one now in Studio.

2497
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:18,120
So Alan has taken a seat and joined us here in Studio.

2498
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:19,120
Hi, Alan.

2499
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,120
How are you?

2500
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,120
Nice to have you back on the show.

2501
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:22,120
Hello.

2502
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,120
Hi.

2503
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:24,120
I'm here against my will.

2504
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:25,120
Now, come on.

2505
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:26,280
Come on.

2506
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:28,000
You make people think I'm so mean.

2507
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:33,000
But no, I had to have you because I think you know about a certain news item that came

2508
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
out this week.

2509
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Yes.

2510
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
And you know, I don't play Half-Life.

2511
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
He doesn't play Half-Life.

2512
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:41,720
So when it comes to the resident Half-Life stand in the house, that would be you.

2513
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,480
So you love Half-Life, right?

2514
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:44,480
I do.

2515
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:48,920
And what is it about the Half-Life games that just you love?

2516
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:57,720
It really was the first FPS to incorporate narrative storytelling into the gameplay without

2517
02:01:57,720 --> 02:01:59,440
use of cutscenes.

2518
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:03,360
Because well, cutscenes back then in the late 90s weren't really a thing to begin with.

2519
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:08,320
I mean, outside of RPGs rather.

2520
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:19,120
So just, it's like, it's really like deep sci-fi without being too convoluted.

2521
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:24,000
It's yeah, I just think gameplay is great.

2522
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Okay.

2523
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,480
So obviously, I think you heard the big news this week about Half-Life.

2524
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,760
They didn't announce Half-Life 3, but they announced a new Half-Life game of some sort,

2525
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:32,760
right?

2526
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:35,640
So I'm sure you have seen all the news on Half-Life, Alex.

2527
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:36,640
Yes.

2528
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,640
So what are your thoughts?

2529
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:41,640
Are we going to have to buy a VR setup?

2530
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:47,660
There's a scene in the show Mad Men where Don Draper is in like an elevator with this

2531
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:49,720
junior associate.

2532
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:57,640
And the junior associates talking to Mr. Draper and he says, you know, buddy, I'm really worried

2533
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,640
about you.

2534
02:02:58,640 --> 02:02:59,640
I worry about you.

2535
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:03,320
And he says, I don't think about you at all.

2536
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,320
That's sort of his retort.

2537
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:08,800
I don't, I feel nothing about this announcement.

2538
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,920
I don't mean that pejoratively.

2539
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:19,080
I've been, I've so absolutely made peace with the fact that I'm not going to get Half-Life

2540
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:23,740
3, that I don't feel, there's like, there's like a hole.

2541
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:26,000
There's a vacuum where my heart should be.

2542
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,120
And I'm like, oh, anyway.

2543
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:30,120
So I'm hungry.

2544
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:32,600
Do you want to go to Chipotle?

2545
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:40,160
It's really, it's sort of like, it's like the dad that leaves when you're three and

2546
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:43,120
you and your mom grew up to be fine.

2547
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:45,240
And then you find out like, oh yeah, he's alive.

2548
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:46,240
He's living in Texas.

2549
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,280
Do you want to go meet him?

2550
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:52,760
And it's like, I don't bear any ill will towards this person, but like, I don't know him.

2551
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:58,760
He's a stranger, you know, like, it's so.

2552
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:03,800
That's really what I'm getting at.

2553
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,800
It looks, it looks well-made.

2554
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:11,640
The biggest thing, it's a relief that knowing that Valve has like an A programming team

2555
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:14,160
that still makes games, that was the revelation.

2556
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:17,820
I was like, it wasn't so much, oh fuck, it's like new Half-Life.

2557
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:23,560
It was more, Valve has a video game that isn't just the maintenance team for Dota and Team

2558
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,560
Fortress 2.

2559
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,000
This is incredible.

2560
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,600
They make blue chip products still.

2561
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:37,460
That's really what I, that was the stunner for me, but I don't care for the fact that

2562
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:48,480
it takes place between Half-Life 1 and 2 or particularly before Half-Life 2.

2563
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:53,080
There was a rumor that at the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 3, Gordon was going to die and then

2564
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:56,960
it's sort of revealed, like the G-Man comes out and reveals that Alex was always like

2565
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:01,200
the chosen one and Gordon was sort of like a means to an end to get her to a certain

2566
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,200
point.

2567
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:09,520
So, I love Alex as one of the best sort of like side NPC characters like ever made.

2568
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:14,880
So Alex is incredible, but yeah, the fact that it's sort of like a weird timeline thing

2569
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,320
that they wedged in, I don't care about VR.

2570
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:21,940
I think that this is going to be the killer app that VR needs for people to pay attention

2571
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:27,320
to it because Beat Saber was, I think, the killer app for a lot of people.

2572
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:29,240
But even then, it's kind of a music game.

2573
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:30,240
There's a novelty to it.

2574
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,620
I think Beat Saber is incredible.

2575
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:35,420
It's a killer app, but it's one killer app.

2576
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:36,420
Yes.

2577
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:44,340
There's still a point of entry with, because like there's the PlayStation VR.

2578
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:50,800
To use like a Vive or the Oculus, you need a computer to go with it that's still pretty

2579
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,800
powerful.

2580
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:54,980
People were saying five years ago that PC gaming was going to be dead.

2581
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:57,480
That turned out to be a complete and utter lie.

2582
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:02,760
PC gaming is a strong, they're porting stuff to PC that's like years and years old just

2583
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:04,340
because they can.

2584
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:12,080
Like you've got Square releasing Saga Frontier 3 or Saga 3 on Switch, but also PC because

2585
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:13,080
why not?

2586
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,080
Well, we did it for Android.

2587
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,080
Might as well.

2588
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:16,080
Yeah.

2589
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:20,240
So PC gaming is as relevant as it's ever been.

2590
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:26,040
The fact that the point of entry with, and also, so like I don't, I'm sure it'll get

2591
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:30,880
cracked so that you don't need a VR device to play it because it's going to run off PC

2592
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:38,040
that then runs through your Oculus or to your Vive, whatever is a Valve compatible VR device.

2593
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:42,240
But like, I don't care about that.

2594
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:49,080
And this also does sort of give credence to the rumor that the reason why Gabe, I'm going

2595
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:55,840
off, like I'll talk like this for the next three hours if you want, is chat enjoying

2596
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:56,840
this?

2597
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,920
Well, I was going to ask you about this because you call it Vive.

2598
02:06:58,920 --> 02:06:59,920
I thought it was Vive.

2599
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:00,920
Vive, whatever.

2600
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:05,020
No, they like your analogy.

2601
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,200
So please keep going.

2602
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:12,920
So I lost, I lost my train of thought.

2603
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:16,140
You're talking about hacker because we got into this earlier in the show is that hackers

2604
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:22,020
are inevitably going to make you able to play this VR game on your keyboard and mouse.

2605
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:23,020
Possibly.

2606
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:24,280
Is that really going to work?

2607
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:27,880
Because certainly the reason why this is in VR is that there's going to be certain things

2608
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:32,300
like you have to do this with your hands or you have to do this certain motion that might

2609
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:34,700
not translate very well into keyboard and mouse.

2610
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:40,580
So not only is somebody going to have to hack it to play on the monitor and keyboard, mouse,

2611
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:44,340
but somebody is going to have to hack the control scheme to get around things that are

2612
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:47,900
going to be very VR specific.

2613
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:55,620
So I'm not really interested in upgrading my PC to support whatever device it is.

2614
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:57,700
I have other things to spend money on.

2615
02:07:57,700 --> 02:08:04,700
I'm glad that Half-Life fans, I think we're all like, I mean, oh, I remember what I was

2616
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:07,060
going to say.

2617
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:13,940
There was a rumor that the reason why Gabe didn't want to do Half-Life 3 is because he

2618
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:19,740
considers Half-Life to be this thing that has to show off the next evolution of gaming

2619
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:23,380
or whatever weird BS like had lost up his ass that he is.

2620
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:27,620
Because with Half-Life 2, it was twofold.

2621
02:08:27,620 --> 02:08:31,980
It was the physics engine that was Source 2, which at the time was revolutionary, and

2622
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:37,020
the physics and weight puzzles that were in Half-Life 2, and then also Half-Life 2 was

2623
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:42,020
their modality of launching Steam.

2624
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:48,900
And Marc Laidlaw basically released the script for Episode 3 because it had been so goddamn

2625
02:08:48,900 --> 02:09:02,380
long that the NDA had run out, so he's like, here's what the script of Episode 3 was.

2626
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:08,060
And I guess Gabe was like, no, I'm not going to make Half-Life 3 unless we have something

2627
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:11,740
worthy of it technology-wise to show off.

2628
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:13,900
That was always a weird rumor.

2629
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:19,420
And the fact that Gabe dined from his ivory tower, yes, here's a little crumb, a little

2630
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,900
morsel of Half-Life content.

2631
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:26,660
The fact that it's attached to what is probably the best big-budget VR title that we're going

2632
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:31,980
to see for a very long time, that sort of gives credence to that theory that Gabe doesn't

2633
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:37,260
want to put Half-Life on things that aren't revolutionary, whatever buzzwordy definition

2634
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:38,260
of that.

2635
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:46,940
My point is that I'm not surprised that we are finally seeing Half-Life content attached

2636
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:51,140
to VR because VR is sort of the thing where the technology's there, it looks great, it

2637
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:52,860
plays great.

2638
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:54,060
People don't care yet.

2639
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:57,900
And is Half-Life Alyx going to make them care?

2640
02:09:57,900 --> 02:10:03,620
It's going to be closer than they ever have been in the past.

2641
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:06,780
I will say the takeaway that I took from the trailer, and not to repeat myself too much

2642
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:10,220
because we already got into this earlier in the show, but for your benefit, I'm not the

2643
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:16,700
big Half-Life fan, you are, I appreciate it, I understand why it's popular and all that.

2644
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:21,420
But I was more taken back like, ooh, this is pretty, are they going to use this engine

2645
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:22,420
to make more games?

2646
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:23,420
Is this the new source?

2647
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:26,660
Is this what my Portal 3 is going to look like?

2648
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:30,420
Is this what my future Valve games are going to look like?

2649
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:34,420
But Half-Life VR, meh, not my thing.

2650
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:39,100
So the fact that it's wedged into the current timeline, it's not a sequel to either Episode

2651
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:47,980
2 or whatever, the fact that it's VR, I'm so pleased to see that the programmers, the

2652
02:10:47,980 --> 02:10:53,180
software developers who work at Valve haven't just been getting a paycheck with no product

2653
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:58,100
for the last, I don't know, what is the last real big blue chip Valve game that they, what

2654
02:10:58,100 --> 02:10:59,100
is Dota, right?

2655
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:00,100
Dota's the last big thing they put out?

2656
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:06,260
Probably Dota 2, unless you were to count the pack-in stuff, the stuff that shows off

2657
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:07,260
the Vive.

2658
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:08,260
Yeah.

2659
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:09,260
Vive, whatever.

2660
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:15,220
The cute little portal, there's a launching game in a warehouse, so there's a little mini

2661
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:16,420
game collection, Wii games.

2662
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:21,900
The fact that the developers at Valve were given an opportunity to program something

2663
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:26,060
big budget and A-list, for me, is an epiphany.

2664
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:33,040
I thought that they gave up eight, nine years ago and they were just letting Steam break

2665
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,120
in billions for them.

2666
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:40,980
So the fact that they just even made a game is great, but I'm not, I don't, again, it's

2667
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:46,900
like there's a vacuum where my heart should be, it's not pejorative, I just, I want, it's

2668
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:48,900
been so long that I want more.

2669
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,460
I don't care about this.

2670
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:52,220
All right.

2671
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:54,980
So there you go, folks.

2672
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:58,340
Are you going to go and revisit the old Half-Life games as you do?

2673
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:01,460
Like once a year, I see you firing up Black Mesa.

2674
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:02,460
Yeah.

2675
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:07,060
They nerve, well, they, they, I played the Zen update for Black Mesa, which came out,

2676
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:08,300
I think, four or five months ago.

2677
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:10,380
If you haven't played it, it's incredible.

2678
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:16,900
I think they've released the chapter after the big head, the, whatever the big headcrab

2679
02:12:16,900 --> 02:12:19,140
boss behemoth is.

2680
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:24,260
So I haven't played that, so there's still Black Mesa content I need to follow up on,

2681
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:30,020
or I may just wait for them to actually put out the whole rest of Zen because there's

2682
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:32,700
only like one or two chapters left and then the game's done.

2683
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:40,540
Um, so yeah, I will revisit Half-Life one and two and Black Mesa at some point, but

2684
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:45,380
Half-Life Alex, I'm sure I'm, of course I'm going to play it at some point, but like 10

2685
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:49,500
years from now, five years from now, borrow his VR, whatever.

2686
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:50,500
It's cool.

2687
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:52,940
I like Alex fine.

2688
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:54,780
It's just, I've, I've moved on.

2689
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:56,420
I've grown as a person.

2690
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:57,860
You waited too long, Gabe.

2691
02:12:57,860 --> 02:12:58,860
I don't care.

2692
02:12:58,860 --> 02:12:59,860
Um, yeah.

2693
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:00,860
All right.

2694
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:08,260
Um, do you have any thoughts, Matt, cause I see you kind of eye in the mic.

2695
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:09,260
No I don't.

2696
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:10,820
I mean, I'll, I'll check it out when it comes out.

2697
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:13,820
I mean, I'm sure it won't be that expensive of a game, so.

2698
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:19,020
So we've derailed a bit from, uh, the, the show role as, as listed on the television

2699
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:20,020
screen.

2700
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:23,500
But I do want to, since we do have Alan here, I want to ask you about one other thing.

2701
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:27,940
So, um, you're not really playing Half-Life at the moment and it doesn't sound like you're

2702
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:32,280
going to be playing Half-Life Alex anytime in the future, but I noticed you have been

2703
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:33,280
playing.

2704
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:34,280
What have you been playing?

2705
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:35,980
I, you know, I got to ask you about this one.

2706
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:37,340
So what have you been playing?

2707
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:39,940
I, we talked about this the last time you had me on the show.

2708
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:40,940
Did we?

2709
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:41,940
Yeah.

2710
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:46,500
Cause I, I told, I said, everyone Google project brutality three and I saw Matt Google it right

2711
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:47,500
here.

2712
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:48,500
Um, it's doom.

2713
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:49,500
Doom mods.

2714
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:52,620
So it's the same thing you talked about weeks ago on the show, I thought you were doing

2715
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:53,620
something new with it.

2716
02:13:53,620 --> 02:13:54,620
You haven't beat it yet?

2717
02:13:54,620 --> 02:13:55,620
Well, no.

2718
02:13:55,620 --> 02:14:03,540
Um, I've been, I, I've, you, it has all of these new enemies and you sort of can control

2719
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:06,980
like what randomization it has for the enemies and weapons.

2720
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:09,940
So I play it and then I bump it up a notch.

2721
02:14:09,940 --> 02:14:14,820
Like I want, I want these really impossible monsters to spawn on level three instead of

2722
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:19,100
level eight and then level eight is going to have like even more terrifying stuff.

2723
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:22,780
So I've just been playing around with the config, the, the, it's, it's an incredible

2724
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:23,780
mod.

2725
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:24,780
There's like dozens of options.

2726
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:26,220
So that's still got my attention.

2727
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:29,260
It's just funny when I kind of peeked my head on it cause we still have that giant green

2728
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:31,260
screen that separates the two sides of the office.

2729
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:33,860
So I peeked my head over on your side of the office, I'm like, you're still playing doom.

2730
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:35,580
Do you know how old that game is?

2731
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:36,580
Yeah.

2732
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:40,100
And then, so you, you, you said, and this is funny, I hope that chat, you enjoy this,

2733
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:42,140
the viewers at home.

2734
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:46,800
You said, so you're still playing doom, but you've modded it to death, right?

2735
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,140
And I said yes.

2736
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:54,420
And then I press the G key and I throw a grenade and he's like, why did you throw a grenade?

2737
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:55,860
You can't throw grenades in doom.

2738
02:14:55,860 --> 02:15:00,220
And I looked at Rob and I said, the words that just came out of your mouth were modded

2739
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:02,460
it to death.

2740
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:03,860
What does that mean?

2741
02:15:03,860 --> 02:15:05,220
You can leave my program.

2742
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:06,220
Yes.

2743
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:09,140
Give the mic to Loki and remove yourself from the stage.

2744
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:10,140
Thank you.

2745
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:11,140
All right.

2746
02:15:11,140 --> 02:15:12,140
Thanks for your thoughts.

2747
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:15,260
They have mods available where you can fuck the enemies in the game because they turn

2748
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:21,980
into hentai women or hentai, there's anything you could possibly do in doom you can do.

2749
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:24,300
So throwing grenades is the least difficult.

2750
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:27,940
In all seriousness, thanks to Alan for letting me put him on the spot with his half-life

2751
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:28,940
impressions.

2752
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:29,940
He did a very good job with that.

2753
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:31,580
So I appreciate it as always.

2754
02:15:31,580 --> 02:15:35,780
For now though, let's get back into what we have coming up with our rapid fire news.

2755
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:36,780
Loki.

2756
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:40,460
I didn't even realize this is how often I play racing games nowadays, but I didn't even

2757
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:46,940
realize that Toyota has been holding out from putting their cars in games.

2758
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:47,940
So that's the thing.

2759
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:53,200
Apparently since 2017, they have not been including their games in racing games.

2760
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:54,420
But now that's going to change.

2761
02:15:54,420 --> 02:16:00,420
Apparently they're going to start putting them back into games starting with Forza.

2762
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:07,660
So there on December 12th, Forza 4 is going to get the 1998 Toyota Supra RZ as part of

2763
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:10,500
the series 17 update.

2764
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:13,260
Interesting indeed.

2765
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:16,540
Someone was asking them about Need for Speed and apparently they said they didn't want

2766
02:16:16,540 --> 02:16:18,380
to promote illegal street racing.

2767
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:19,380
Oh wow.

2768
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:20,380
Dude, come on.

2769
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:21,380
Oh wow.

2770
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:22,620
Like, dude, seriously, really?

2771
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:23,620
It's a video game.

2772
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:24,620
Give me a play.

2773
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:26,860
Like all the other companies are doing it.

2774
02:16:26,860 --> 02:16:27,860
Seriously.

2775
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:28,860
Stupid.

2776
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,860
But, yeah.

2777
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:35,840
Funny enough, since we were just talking about Doom, if you're interested in 90s shooters

2778
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:40,360
like the such, you might want to check out Hellbound, which apparently is going to be

2779
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:41,560
coming out pretty soon.

2780
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:49,200
They have a demo that is available that you can check out and it looks pretty awesome.

2781
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:53,320
Very much a Doomquake vibe going on there.

2782
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:54,920
And that's available on Steam.

2783
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:55,920
Alright.

2784
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,680
Yay demos.

2785
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:02,800
For those of you that are into Pokemon Go, the details have been announced for Community

2786
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,280
Day for December.

2787
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:08,520
So like last year, it's going to be an encore weekend, so you can catch all of the Community

2788
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:12,400
Day Pokemon from prior Community Days in 2019.

2789
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:15,840
So it will be boosted all weekend and then I think there's special events that happen

2790
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:21,800
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. where you get the catch Stardust, the catch XP and half egg distance.

2791
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:26,600
And if I remember right, that's the time when the shinies really show up too, is that same

2792
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:27,760
like three hour period.

2793
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:31,360
So if you really want shinies, that's the time to play the game.

2794
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:35,660
So Community Day weekend, but from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. everything will be boosted.

2795
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:40,760
So you can check that all out on Saturday, December 14th, as well as Sunday, December

2796
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:41,760
15th.

2797
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:42,760
That's pretty cool.

2798
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:47,160
I wish they did stuff like around holidays, like Thanksgiving.

2799
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,920
I think they have something for the day.

2800
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,880
There's a Team Rocket event going on right now and I thought there was something about

2801
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:57,800
you can trade like half Stardust trading and I think you can do two special trades a day

2802
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:00,240
and that's going to start like the Thanksgiving weekend.

2803
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:04,000
And I thought it was really well timed because you're going to have people that are visiting

2804
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,200
from far away, visiting family.

2805
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:10,320
So it's the time where people are going to be like, oh, here's my regional, you know,

2806
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:11,320
you can pick this up.

2807
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,620
That's going to be pretty cool.

2808
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:15,120
So that is coming to the game also.

2809
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:18,160
And I should mention this because a lot of people are excited about this.

2810
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:23,440
Any Pokemon you evolve during that time frame will get the community move from the Community

2811
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:24,440
Day.

2812
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:26,480
So you have a second chance to get the special move.

2813
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:31,960
What's important about this is that that part of it is not just 2019, it's 2018 as well.

2814
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:35,920
So some people have been sitting on a hundred percent Larvatars for a long time waiting

2815
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:39,240
to get a Tyranitar with the special move that's only from Community Day.

2816
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:42,200
So you will have that chance during December Community Day.

2817
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:44,200
So people are very hyped about that.

2818
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:46,320
So all right.

2819
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:51,040
Also we should talk a little bit about Steam Remote Play together because that is now out

2820
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:52,040
of beta.

2821
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:53,040
That is awesome.

2822
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:54,480
And they have a sale going on to promote it.

2823
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:55,480
They do.

2824
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:58,960
If you are not familiar with Steam Remote Play together, it's pretty much PlayStation

2825
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:01,240
4 SharePlay, but it's on Steam.

2826
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:02,700
You can play local multiplayer.

2827
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:07,240
So even if your game doesn't support online, you can do local multiplayer.

2828
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:11,260
And then this also will work with cross platform play.

2829
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:16,480
So I could be on Windows and Dark Soccer could be on Mac and Loki could be on Linux and we

2830
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:17,480
could still all play together.

2831
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:18,480
So that's pretty cool.

2832
02:19:18,480 --> 02:19:20,960
It's still all through like Steam.

2833
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:26,820
Are you saying that super multitasking versus I'm going to actually build a plague?

2834
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:30,080
You may remember we asked Darren about that when he was here announcing it.

2835
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:32,300
And he's not building it with that in mind.

2836
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:36,080
He's building it for, you know, the expos and same room and all that.

2837
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,080
And I think.

2838
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:38,080
But no, no, no.

2839
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:39,080
But this could be.

2840
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:40,080
No, this works with all.

2841
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:41,080
I know.

2842
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,080
I know.

2843
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:46,040
But you if there's any lag, you know how that game can be very unforgiving.

2844
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:49,520
So if any lag comes into it or what have you, you know, like, would you play a music game

2845
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:50,880
over share play?

2846
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:56,680
Well, yeah, so maybe the lag, you know, will it work?

2847
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:57,680
Yes.

2848
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:58,680
Will it work?

2849
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:01,480
Well, to be determined, but will it blend?

2850
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:02,480
Yes.

2851
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:04,400
And unofficially or it's unofficial.

2852
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:07,120
It's not supported by the death, I guess would be a way to say that.

2853
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:08,120
All right.

2854
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:09,720
Anyway, Dark Soccer, you have a few things for us.

2855
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:15,080
Soul Calibur six season two will actually be starting tomorrow, November 25th for us

2856
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:16,080
here on Sunday.

2857
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:23,480
And it has a downloadable character Hilda will be on November 26th, along with the creation

2858
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:28,760
parts set C as stated by Bandai Namco.

2859
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:35,680
It will she's got there actually will be a soul attack and resist impact battle systems.

2860
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:40,840
New stage called Silver Wolves Haven and a training exclusive stage called Grand Labyrinth

2861
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:42,480
Sealed Corridor.

2862
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:44,760
Different UI stuff, too.

2863
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:52,800
And season two will also introduce three other characters, including Haomaru from Samurai

2864
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,800
Showdown.

2865
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:58,840
And let me see if we can get the other two while I'm here.

2866
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:05,560
Cassandra and I don't see who else Cassandra, Haomaru, Hilda.

2867
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:06,560
So, yeah.

2868
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:12,040
And then also in other news, which I'm sure a lot of people were aware of, is that Arc

2869
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:17,120
System Works has a trailer for new Guilty Gear coming out and it's going to be called

2870
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:20,520
Guilty Gear Strive.

2871
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:23,320
I had actually already been looking at that because I was kind of thinking of cosplaying

2872
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:24,320
Mei.

2873
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:25,320
So.

2874
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:32,800
But the trailer came out and it's rebranded a few things around there, brought in some

2875
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:37,920
old school characters like Chip and Mei and Potemkin and Soul Bad Guy, who just has the

2876
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:39,400
best name.

2877
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:49,800
So I'm actually bringing out bringing back from the first Guilty Gear Dr. Baldhead, who

2878
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:51,280
became Faust.

2879
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:54,280
So but I think they're bringing him back as that role.

2880
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:55,280
So that'd be cool.

2881
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:56,280
That's it.

2882
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:57,280
All right.

2883
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:58,280
Cool.

2884
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:01,880
We're going to now travel around the world and check out release dates.

2885
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:04,920
I have a feeling this is going to be a quick segment, at least certainly the U.S. part

2886
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:05,920
of it.

2887
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:06,920
I can't imagine it's going to be hopping.

2888
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:10,720
It is a very Japanese week, ironically.

2889
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:16,760
So the two games we have coming out this week, Cyber Troopers Virtual On Masterpiece 1995

2890
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:24,280
to 2001 on PlayStation 4 and SD Gundam G Generation Cross Rays on PC.

2891
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:25,280
That's it.

2892
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,280
That's it.

2893
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,800
Well, happy Thanksgiving from Japan.

2894
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:28,800
To be expected.

2895
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:33,440
Now, funny, going over to Japan, you still have some releases, because obviously Thanksgiving

2896
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:38,080
is not a factor over there, but we do have some releases this week in Japan, including

2897
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:42,280
on the PlayStation 4 this week, 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.

2898
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:46,340
We also have that same SD Gundam Generation Cross Rays, which is also out in Japan, perhaps

2899
02:22:46,340 --> 02:22:49,720
why it's timed for the world at the same time.

2900
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:55,880
And then we also have Aibea comes out in regular and premium editions this week, as well as

2901
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:58,360
Amamain comes out this week.

2902
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:02,520
And then we get A Plague Tale Innocence and a price reduction just in time for the next

2903
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:04,680
season, Soul Calibur 6.

2904
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:06,720
Price reduction also coming in for Days Gone.

2905
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:10,000
But here's the title of the week.

2906
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,640
Here's the name that got me.

2907
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:18,520
So coming to the PlayStation 4 this week from Maker's 5 or Publishers 5 PB is the game.

2908
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:21,320
Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

2909
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:24,840
Infinite combat.

2910
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:29,520
And so, of course, I had to look like I was like, what the fuck and get this on the battlefield.

2911
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:34,840
Well, I should have known that's an anime based on the popular anime.

2912
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:37,320
Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

2913
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:41,880
Infinite combat will let you play from the perspective of the protagonists and they will

2914
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:44,880
head into dungeons and interact with characters in the dungeons.

2915
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:47,760
So is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

2916
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:52,480
I guess find out when that title releases this week on PlayStation 4 in Japan.

2917
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:57,320
Looking quickly at the Nintendo Switch to see if there's anything I should note here

2918
02:23:57,320 --> 02:24:01,760
because if I clicked the wrong thing and accidentally brought up Nintendo 3DS, which is not looking

2919
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:02,760
great.

2920
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:09,000
But on the Switch, yes, we have that same SD Gundam game is out there too.

2921
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,600
Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?

2922
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:16,680
The only, oh, we have two new ones that aren't on PlayStation, Flowers, which is not to be

2923
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,140
confused with the Journey Flower game.

2924
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:23,720
This is another one that looks like it's based off an anime or manga.

2925
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:29,860
And then Japanese Rail Sim 3D Journey to Kyoto comes out this week.

2926
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:31,040
And that looks really pretty.

2927
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:35,020
It's just like the train on the front cover is going through this very like flowery type

2928
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:36,920
of village and it's a pink train.

2929
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:37,920
So fun.

2930
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,220
There's a Hello Kitty train.

2931
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:40,220
Yeah.

2932
02:24:40,220 --> 02:24:43,260
So if you want to travel on a train from your Nintendo Switch, you can import that lovely

2933
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:45,140
title from Japan.

2934
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:46,700
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

2935
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:47,700
Three games.

2936
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:51,140
I thought I had already mentioned, but apparently I guess they moved the date or something.

2937
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:57,380
The Asterix Novelics game is coming out on November 27th for the big three.

2938
02:24:57,380 --> 02:25:00,820
And then for Switch, we have Black Sad Under the Skin.

2939
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:04,740
This kind of almost like a modern noir from the picture.

2940
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:10,820
And then on the 28th, also Honor and Duty D-Day All Out War Edition.

2941
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:11,820
That's it.

2942
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:12,820
All right.

2943
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:15,220
SSJ100Matt in chat says, this is cracking me up.

2944
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:16,420
I don't know why.

2945
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:21,660
It's a comment about the train sim game that I said, as 200 Matt says, there better be

2946
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:24,340
some train drifting action.

2947
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:27,780
And that makes me laugh because I'm like, that would be actually really funny.

2948
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:30,940
Can you imagine like a high speed train racing game?

2949
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,180
Have you not seen YouTube?

2950
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:33,700
Oh, is that a thing?

2951
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:34,700
It is a thing.

2952
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:36,940
They have a game that is train drifting.

2953
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:37,940
Really?

2954
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:38,940
They do.

2955
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:39,940
It is a real thing.

2956
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:40,940
Okay.

2957
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:41,940
Is the train actually on rails or?

2958
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:42,940
It is on rails.

2959
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:43,940
Wow.

2960
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:45,340
It's a ridiculous game.

2961
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:49,740
They actually did it during one of the AGD queues.

2962
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:53,300
I don't remember the name, but there is, it is a thing.

2963
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:54,300
Okay.

2964
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:55,300
And it is awesome.

2965
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:57,500
I was just thinking how funny it would be if you had a game like Mario Kart, but you

2966
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:02,580
were driving this car that was just like pulling 20 cars behind it.

2967
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:09,020
And so it turns into like Mario Kart and Snake at the same time or Tron light bikes or something

2968
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:10,020
like that.

2969
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:15,300
It's called Densha de lightning stage.

2970
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:17,700
It's in the Densha de Go! series.

2971
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:20,820
And Orange Right just gets a gold star for naming it first in chat.

2972
02:26:20,820 --> 02:26:21,820
There you go.

2973
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:25,460
They did it AGD queue 2018 and it was hilarious.

2974
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:26,940
All right.

2975
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:27,940
Let's move on to the mailbag.

2976
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:30,340
I think we have at least one letter tonight.

2977
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:32,860
Participate at orangelaungerator.com is the place to send emails.

2978
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:33,860
Dark Sakura.

2979
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:35,860
We have two actually.

2980
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:38,460
One of them I can only read partially.

2981
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:42,740
So one, um, uh, it's from Ferto Swagons.

2982
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:45,540
I'm going to be nice.

2983
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:46,540
Hey, OLR.

2984
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:49,100
If you were forced to pick only one game to play for the rest of your life, what game

2985
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:50,660
would you choose?

2986
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:54,020
First of all, I wouldn't choose because I don't have to.

2987
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:55,340
Question really makes no sense to me.

2988
02:26:55,340 --> 02:26:56,700
It's just a fun hypothetical.

2989
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:58,940
These hypotheticals are illogical.

2990
02:26:58,940 --> 02:27:00,340
I don't know.

2991
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:01,340
People want to know.

2992
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:02,340
All right.

2993
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:05,180
Look, I'll answer it because I'm going to be that bitch and be the genie or excuse me,

2994
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:07,900
the one that wishes for more wishes when the genie comes out.

2995
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:11,420
Because the game I would pick would be Little Big Planet.

2996
02:27:11,420 --> 02:27:15,740
I guess namely Little Big Planet 3 because I could get Little Big Planet 1 and 2 because

2997
02:27:15,740 --> 02:27:18,820
I could play other games that people have made.

2998
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:21,620
Mario Maker would be a really good choice in that regard too.

2999
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:26,300
Or I suppose Dreams might be the ultimate game to pick for that.

3000
02:27:26,300 --> 02:27:29,900
So that is my clever little tongue in cheek way around.

3001
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:35,060
I would pick my 20, like 285 in one cartridge for Super Nintendo.

3002
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:36,060
There you go.

3003
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:38,180
See, it's not that hard a question to answer.

3004
02:27:38,180 --> 02:27:44,780
But in all seriousness, even though I kind of joke that that's a way to wish for more

3005
02:27:44,780 --> 02:27:49,500
wishes, at the same time, actually Little Big Planet was a really fucking solid platforming

3006
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:50,740
game that was a lot of fun.

3007
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:55,380
And like Mario Maker, I mean, Super Mario is one of the, it was my favorite game of

3008
02:27:55,380 --> 02:27:56,380
the year.

3009
02:27:56,380 --> 02:28:01,220
And honestly, even without the fact that I'm essentially getting more games in one with

3010
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:05,080
those picks, they would be worthy selections.

3011
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:08,220
I mean, I guess otherwise I'd say, what, Super Metroid, duh.

3012
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:11,700
Loki, do you have a game, one game for the rest of your life?

3013
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:12,700
One game?

3014
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:15,420
If I'm going to pick a game for the rest of my life, it's going to be fucking laser

3015
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:16,420
tag.

3016
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:17,420
Oh, okay.

3017
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:19,700
Except I would have to pick a specific laser tag.

3018
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:24,420
So did you know your laser tag over here is a portal now?

3019
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:26,380
The one that you, the new one that you...

3020
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:27,780
The new laser tag is a portal?

3021
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:29,100
It's a portal.

3022
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:34,460
Why can that be a portal, but the one I suggested back in May is not a fucking anything yet

3023
02:28:34,460 --> 02:28:37,020
because it's sitting there in goddamn limbo.

3024
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:40,380
But that place, it has nothing of fucking significance there.

3025
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,380
I know why.

3026
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:42,380
I know why.

3027
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:46,220
Because the player that submitted it has an Onyx reviewing badge, so like all her stuff

3028
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:47,220
gets upgraded.

3029
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:48,220
God fucking damn it.

3030
02:28:48,220 --> 02:28:49,220
I swear to God.

3031
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:50,220
All right.

3032
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:51,220
Anyway, uh, next email.

3033
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:54,220
Oh, is this the one I can't read?

3034
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:58,740
Um, because it really, it's, well, okay, I'll go ahead and read it.

3035
02:28:58,740 --> 02:28:59,740
Okay.

3036
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:00,740
This is from Robert.

3037
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:03,300
I don't know why it was sent for this, but I'll go ahead and read it.

3038
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:06,140
Um, updating, actually, I'm not going to read it because there's a lot of stuff in here

3039
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:07,140
that's wrong.

3040
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:12,780
Um, because first of all, Mac OS 8 came out about 25 years ago and he's talking about

3041
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:14,340
current operating systems.

3042
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:17,420
So Mac OS 8 doesn't work, doesn't function on anything modern.

3043
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:19,900
So and iOS 10 is three years old.

3044
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:21,420
We're on iOS 13 now.

3045
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:22,420
Okay.

3046
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:23,420
If we're not reading it, then don't read it.

3047
02:29:23,620 --> 02:29:25,620
Is there a part of it that we are going to read?

3048
02:29:25,620 --> 02:29:26,620
Um, no.

3049
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:29,620
Um, I'm just going to basically say, I said, and I replied to him that I was going to acknowledge

3050
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:32,020
that he sent me email and thank you for writing in.

3051
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:33,540
We'll talk about this one privately.

3052
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:34,540
Oh, okay.

3053
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:35,540
Yeah.

3054
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:36,540
That's all.

3055
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:37,540
So that's it.

3056
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:38,940
Well, it's not every day.

3057
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:40,540
Someone gets a personal response from dark soccer.

3058
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:45,100
He got two personal responses because he was sending me, uh, uh, uh, something that should

3059
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:48,940
have gone to another podcast on our network.

3060
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:49,940
Oh, okay.

3061
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:52,220
But it's in a, but I'll just say this right now.

3062
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:57,060
It's inappropriate to send it to our participate inbox instead of reaching out directly to

3063
02:29:57,060 --> 02:30:00,220
contact the proprietor of the podcast or was it negative?

3064
02:30:00,220 --> 02:30:01,220
No, it wasn't.

3065
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:02,220
Oh, okay.

3066
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:04,740
But it's still, we check this box like once a week.

3067
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:05,740
Oh yeah.

3068
02:30:05,740 --> 02:30:06,740
Yeah.

3069
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:07,740
No, it's just your message isn't going to get.

3070
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:08,740
Yeah.

3071
02:30:08,740 --> 02:30:09,740
It's not going to get to them in a timely manner.

3072
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:12,340
And on top of that, again, if it's an important enough message like that, you need to reach

3073
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:15,740
out to the proprietor of that particular podcast.

3074
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:16,740
I'm curious what it is.

3075
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:17,740
I didn't see it.

3076
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:18,740
So I'll tell you what it was later.

3077
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:19,740
All right.

3078
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:20,740
That's fine.

3079
02:30:20,740 --> 02:30:21,740
All right.

3080
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:24,420
Oh, Bobby says he got it too.

3081
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:25,420
That's so interesting.

3082
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:26,420
All right.

3083
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:28,580
Anyway, so again, and I, I just wasn't my message.

3084
02:30:28,580 --> 02:30:29,580
It's inappropriate.

3085
02:30:29,580 --> 02:30:31,140
Go ahead and contact them directly.

3086
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,140
Okay.

3087
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:33,140
All right.

3088
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:34,140
Well, let's move on.

3089
02:30:34,140 --> 02:30:37,140
I think we have some more stories to get to, so we'll start with you.

3090
02:30:37,140 --> 02:30:38,140
Loki.

3091
02:30:38,140 --> 02:30:39,140
What do you have next?

3092
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:40,140
So this is pretty cool.

3093
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:47,340
Someone had taken it upon themselves to port over, um, super Mario land to the super Nintendo.

3094
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:50,700
So they dubbed it new super Mario land.

3095
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:54,340
It is basically recreating the whole game from scratch.

3096
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:55,700
It is not a rom hack.

3097
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:57,740
It is its own thing.

3098
02:30:57,740 --> 02:31:02,080
It actually has four player multiplayer in it as well, and apparently pushes the super

3099
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:06,260
Nintendo to its limits as far as what it's able to do.

3100
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:11,020
Um, what they've done with some of the animation is basically kind of have the crappiest like

3101
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:12,500
20 second clip.

3102
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:14,820
Oh, I had it on top of that.

3103
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:15,820
They're not going to release it.

3104
02:31:15,820 --> 02:31:19,920
That's the annoying part because he did it as a Christmas present.

3105
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:22,000
The thing is, okay.

3106
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,200
The other clip that you're thinking of was like some dude's YouTube and I didn't want

3107
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:27,200
to put the whole thing.

3108
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,200
Yeah.

3109
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,320
So that's the clip you get.

3110
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:38,140
So the thing is that files have their way of making it out to the internet.

3111
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:42,240
So whereas he said he wasn't going to release it on the internet.

3112
02:31:42,240 --> 02:31:43,240
It's on the internet.

3113
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:46,240
He sent it to 30 people.

3114
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:47,240
That's it.

3115
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:51,040
And then one of those 30 put it back on the internet.

3116
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:56,920
So you know, it may have been out there in a place where I found it.

3117
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:03,440
And so I was able to get it and yeah, um, but yeah, it looked really cool.

3118
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:06,600
And it's, I mean, it's just a complete remake of the whole game.

3119
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:11,960
And the fact that he did this just with straight raw assembly and they even have like sound

3120
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:15,480
samples that, you know, it's basically like Mario's voice from like some of the other

3121
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:18,760
games, you know, just ridiculous.

3122
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:24,740
And the art style is done very much like he did or like Donkey Kong Country where it's

3123
02:32:24,740 --> 02:32:26,520
actually he made the renders.

3124
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:32,160
So like they had, they did an interview with him on Nintendo life talking about, um, how

3125
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,160
he did.

3126
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:37,560
And so he actually created the models in blender and then ended up, um, scanning them and putting

3127
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:42,280
them into as sprites into the game.

3128
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:48,120
And it's just, I mean, the amount of work that it would take to do that, it's just ridiculous,

3129
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:49,760
but pretty cool.

3130
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:56,160
All right, well, uh, moving on, we just have a few more stories for you guys and then we're

3131
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,960
going to get to our discord.

3132
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:02,280
So if you guys want to, uh, can participate with the show by calling in tonight, you sure

3133
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:08,020
can by joining our discord, uh, you can join the green room, uh, and we will be, uh, taking

3134
02:33:08,020 --> 02:33:09,020
your calls live on air.

3135
02:33:09,020 --> 02:33:12,160
Of course, if you have questions in chat, you can get those out there too.

3136
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:16,040
I will do my very best to, um, get any questions you guys have for us to discuss here at the

3137
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:19,800
end of the show, but we have a few more stories before we get there, including this one on

3138
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:23,400
Fortnite, uh, a new dungeon crawl mode in Fortnite.

3139
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:29,420
Uh, so specifically Fortnite saved the world, which I was so irritated when I found out

3140
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:33,280
and figured out, Oh, Fortnite saved the world is the one you have to pay for early access

3141
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:34,280
for.

3142
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:38,000
I went and I fucking installed Fortnite again on my computer, just so I could play this

3143
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,000
only to find out.

3144
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,640
You got to pay 40 bucks if you want to access this mode.

3145
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:42,640
And I'm like, fuck that.

3146
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:45,280
I'm not paying 40 bucks for a game I feel kind of on the fence about.

3147
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:48,760
I don't really like, I want to know if the dungeon crawler is good though.

3148
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:49,760
That's the problem.

3149
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:54,120
But anyway, I guess I've ruined the story for myself, but I was just so irritated by,

3150
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:59,720
Oh man, I got, you mean I got to pay for a video game, but anyway, uh, Fortnite saved

3151
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:04,420
the world has a subterranean area to explore in Hexylvania.

3152
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:09,740
You can get new weapons, new loot, uh, and there's new heroes, uh, to battle the monsters

3153
02:34:09,740 --> 02:34:10,740
there.

3154
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:14,500
Uh, which of course will be hiding the ultimate boss because that's how a dungeon crawler

3155
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:15,500
works.

3156
02:34:15,500 --> 02:34:21,580
Uh, Swamp Knight makes made their debut in Fortnite along with Murr Monster Ken.

3157
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:25,480
And then I guess the Mythic Storm Kings, there's all these new characters and there's a new

3158
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:27,340
crossover quest with that.

3159
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:30,620
I was all about trying the dungeon crawler cause I was like, Oh, this might be a fun

3160
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:35,220
mode and something that's a little more like PvE in Fortnite, which is what saved the world

3161
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:36,220
is.

3162
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:38,940
But up save the world is still in early access.

3163
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:42,220
So you have to pay 40 bucks if you want to be able to access it.

3164
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:46,060
Rumor is it's supposed to be on its way out of early access in some point in the near

3165
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:47,060
future.

3166
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:50,700
But I think a lot of people thought it would happen when the black hole event just happened

3167
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:52,700
and it went into, what do they call it?

3168
02:34:52,700 --> 02:34:54,360
Chapter two or something.

3169
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:58,540
So they thought that would be the point that saved the world goes free, but it didn't.

3170
02:34:58,540 --> 02:34:59,540
They're still charging for it.

3171
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,060
Got to make their money.

3172
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:05,860
I'm going to wait for like, I'll try maybe 20 bucks, but I'm not paying 40, especially

3173
02:35:05,860 --> 02:35:07,280
when I don't know much about the mode.

3174
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:11,380
Now at this point, I'm like, all right, I guess I will try to find a YouTuber or a Twitch

3175
02:35:11,380 --> 02:35:14,800
streamer that's playing this part of Fortnite.

3176
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:20,300
I mean, I've watched like Flaco play the hundred match and it looks like he's having fun.

3177
02:35:20,300 --> 02:35:25,060
I'm kind of like, Oh, it's, it's interesting to watch, but just, I, when I play it, I just,

3178
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:26,060
it's terrible.

3179
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:27,060
And I don't know what I'm doing.

3180
02:35:27,060 --> 02:35:31,140
There's no tutorial or maybe there, if there is, I haven't found it cause I installed the

3181
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:35,240
game a long time ago, but, um, yeah, I just, I don't know.

3182
02:35:35,240 --> 02:35:38,260
I can't get into Fortnite the same way everybody else does.

3183
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:42,100
So, all right, anyhow, uh, let's move on.

3184
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:46,220
Uh, and I forgot to advance there to Fortnite save the world, but we just talked about that.

3185
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:50,220
So let's go to, um, another Stadia follow-up dark soccer, right?

3186
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:55,260
So Stadia users have been complaining that on their Chromecast ultra, it's been getting

3187
02:35:55,260 --> 02:36:00,580
extremely hot and it forces the system to shut down mid game without saving their progress.

3188
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:04,700
When Reddit users said that in the middle of the Destiny 2 fight, the Chromecast died

3189
02:36:04,700 --> 02:36:06,780
and lost connectivity to the network.

3190
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:10,660
And then when he went to go and plug it from power, it was incredibly hot.

3191
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:15,100
Um, you know, when people say it's hot, they're supposed to have some sort of heat, you know,

3192
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:17,200
heat protection in any way.

3193
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:21,060
But one of the Google representatives said, this is a quote, we know, um, any sort of

3194
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:22,940
heat on a device can be worrisome.

3195
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:27,800
We confirm there's no thermal overheating issue with the Chromecast ultra.

3196
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:31,380
During normal usage, it can get hot to the touch, but it's working as designed, which

3197
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:32,380
is fine.

3198
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:33,900
You know, we deal with that with computers all the time.

3199
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:34,900
You've got them working.

3200
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:35,900
They're going to get hot.

3201
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:36,900
They're going to be hot to the touch.

3202
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:43,340
You know, don't put your laptop on your fucking lap because heat sinks are in the bottom of

3203
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:44,340
it.

3204
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:45,660
Vents are in the back.

3205
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:48,660
Don't look at me because I know what I'm doing.

3206
02:36:48,660 --> 02:36:53,940
I know we don't have a camera on dark Sakura, but, uh, her laptop is in her lap.

3207
02:36:53,940 --> 02:36:57,520
I wouldn't think it would be necessarily a problem with her laptop.

3208
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:01,140
Mine on the other hand, mine doesn't get that hot.

3209
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:03,620
And on top of that, you'll notice my vents aren't blocked.

3210
02:37:03,620 --> 02:37:04,620
Yeah.

3211
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:07,200
And also you're using it for a very limited amount of time.

3212
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:09,420
You see how often I put it back on the table, right?

3213
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:10,420
I'm just giving you shit.

3214
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:11,420
That's what I do.

3215
02:37:11,420 --> 02:37:14,940
Well, at any rate, of course, people don't believe the official word because they don't

3216
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:16,740
understand technology.

3217
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:23,140
So, um, but people are saying that, yeah, that it's shutting down 10 minutes after overheating.

3218
02:37:23,140 --> 02:37:25,580
And that is not how it's supposed to behave.

3219
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:27,700
I'll tell you that right now.

3220
02:37:27,700 --> 02:37:34,460
Usually if something shuts down, like if I go outside with my phone on 110 degree day

3221
02:37:34,460 --> 02:37:38,580
talking to people on it, I'm going to get the thermal warning on my phone and if I keep

3222
02:37:38,580 --> 02:37:40,420
using it, it will shut down.

3223
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:44,300
If my computer were having a thermal event, I would have a warning pop up and it would

3224
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:45,300
shut down.

3225
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:50,060
These products are built to shut down when they are too hot.

3226
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:53,660
And if it's shutting down and you're getting widespread reports of this, so they're just

3227
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:58,080
talking about the heat and the heat is normal, but getting so hot that it shuts down.

3228
02:37:58,080 --> 02:37:59,080
That is not normal.

3229
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:00,080
So.

3230
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:05,060
Especially in November, you know, like my phone will do that in the summer months.

3231
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:07,060
Our November is 70.

3232
02:38:07,060 --> 02:38:08,060
True.

3233
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:14,920
You know, um, but yeah, and people are like, well, even with all that happening, Stadia

3234
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:17,960
just feels really niche and not important.

3235
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:25,400
So I didn't feel Jason's summary was that negative though, and not Bobby did a summary

3236
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:26,400
on it too.

3237
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:30,600
And you know, I feel like I, I do feel that, I mean, not to say like some of the things

3238
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:35,200
that Jason said, yeah, but it's, that also is more about like the, the, just the setup

3239
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:38,640
of the, the store and the model to begin with is interesting.

3240
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:42,480
But anyway, all right, um, moving on, we have one more story.

3241
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:46,120
This is very sad, but, um, on a respectful note, Loki.

3242
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:47,120
Yeah.

3243
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:55,080
So, um, unfortunately the, uh, creator of, or one of the designers of EverQuest, Brad

3244
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:57,360
McQuaid has passed away.

3245
02:38:57,360 --> 02:39:05,160
So he, um, passed away in his home, um, at the age of 51 and he was basically known in

3246
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:13,600
the community by his alias, um, Aradune and, you know, started his journey through the

3247
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:20,920
game industry back in 89, um, worked on a shareware RPG called Wizard War, which I think

3248
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:27,480
I've, I think I've played that, um, and then of course went to work on, you know, EverQuest

3249
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:28,480
as well.

3250
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:29,480
So that's unfortunate.

3251
02:39:29,480 --> 02:39:30,480
Yeah.

3252
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:32,880
It's a very young age for that to happen.

3253
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:36,040
Um, I know they didn't say why and it's, you know, if the family doesn't want to disclose

3254
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:40,120
that that's not our business, but, um, very, uh, very young and very sad to hear that he

3255
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:41,280
was working on something else.

3256
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:45,640
I know too, that unfortunately, um, he will not get to see through to completion, but,

3257
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:51,240
um, I know like EverQuest in particular, you know, uh, it was such an important game of

3258
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:52,840
the MMO genre.

3259
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:58,000
I did not get sucked into EverQuest personally, but I darn well recognize that without EverQuest,

3260
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:02,040
we wouldn't have certainly like Final Fantasy 11 was very EverQuest inspired.

3261
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:05,360
Uh, and we would probably not have things the same way, like we have with like World

3262
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:09,600
of Warcraft and some of the other more modern MMOs that we have, you know, today.

3263
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:12,200
Um, so this game really paved the way for that.

3264
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:15,080
And certainly, you know, Brad's, um, vision was a huge part of that.

3265
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:20,260
Um, I will also give a shout out, um, to, uh, Bobby, cause I know he did play a lot

3266
02:40:20,260 --> 02:40:21,260
more EverQuest.

3267
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:23,220
He had a very touching tribute on his show tonight.

3268
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:27,420
So I mean, if he weren't already listening, um, at five o'clock, uh, when his show was

3269
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:31,020
on earlier, excuse me, five Pacific eight Eastern, when his show was on earlier, um,

3270
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:34,300
then you will definitely want to check out that podcast feed when it is released.

3271
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:36,100
So, um, rest in peace.

3272
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:40,980
Uh, always hard to hear about the game designers, you know, that did such big things, especially

3273
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:41,980
at such a young age.

3274
02:40:41,980 --> 02:40:43,900
That's the, that's the hardest part of that.

3275
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:44,900
So, yeah.

3276
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:45,900
All right.

3277
02:40:45,900 --> 02:40:48,060
Um, well, let's move on.

3278
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:52,380
So hopefully on a happier note, I want to get to our round table and invite, uh, some

3279
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:54,900
of the, uh, calls and all that good stuff.

3280
02:40:54,900 --> 02:40:57,140
And we do have one caller that's on the line.

3281
02:40:57,140 --> 02:40:59,660
So let's get to it and bring them on the show.

3282
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:00,660
Hello.

3283
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:01,660
You're on orange launch radio.

3284
02:41:01,660 --> 02:41:02,660
Who's this?

3285
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:03,660
Hey, this is Def.

3286
02:41:03,660 --> 02:41:04,660
Hey Def.

3287
02:41:04,660 --> 02:41:05,660
It's good to hear from you.

3288
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:06,660
What's on your mind tonight?

3289
02:41:06,660 --> 02:41:11,940
Well, I was going to write an email about this because it was from last week, but I

3290
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:12,940
forgot.

3291
02:41:12,940 --> 02:41:13,940
So whatever.

3292
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:16,900
What's on your mind about it?

3293
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:18,900
I want to talk about Wayfarer.

3294
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:20,900
Oh sure.

3295
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:22,940
The Niantic, a point of interest submission.

3296
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:23,940
Oh boy.

3297
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:25,940
Can we talk about what I've seen?

3298
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:27,460
Have you seen my Twitter feed?

3299
02:41:27,460 --> 02:41:28,460
I've seen.

3300
02:41:28,460 --> 02:41:31,260
I just, I just decided to go all in this week.

3301
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:32,260
I have seen.

3302
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:33,260
Okay.

3303
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:35,580
So if you aren't already aware, we did talk about this last week, so I'll try not to repeat

3304
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:36,660
myself too much.

3305
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:42,020
But the Niantic point of interest system, which was exclusive to Ingress, uh, but affected

3306
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:47,700
Pokemon go and Harry Potter, it opened up to Pokemon go players of level 40 last week.

3307
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:52,900
And I sat here and I complained on the show, Oh God, we're going to get all this bullshit

3308
02:41:52,900 --> 02:41:56,460
that's getting submitted because people are going to think, Oh, I want a Poke stop on

3309
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,560
my couch.

3310
02:41:57,560 --> 02:42:00,220
And people are going to love that because it's more Poke stops.

3311
02:42:00,220 --> 02:42:01,780
Whereas I'm like, hold on.

3312
02:42:01,780 --> 02:42:07,000
What you do affects a variety of games and you do not want player versus player battles

3313
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:10,340
happening on your lawn or whatever bullshit's being submitted.

3314
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:11,740
But anyway, that was my take.

3315
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:14,660
What's your take Def?

3316
02:42:14,660 --> 02:42:21,620
And I pretty much agree on at least the most part because yeah, there's people that have

3317
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:23,740
like gems on their house.

3318
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:31,580
I personally know that and, and it's like really, really tough to like do raids or something

3319
02:42:31,580 --> 02:42:38,580
like that on those places because yeah, because it's not necessarily the best, but it, they're

3320
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:41,020
actually like, okay, submissions.

3321
02:42:41,020 --> 02:42:45,420
There were, there are legit, they're, they're not like, Oh, they're in sight in a house

3322
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:51,360
or they're like, uh, manipulated what like you were talking about, uh, last week I think.

3323
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:58,160
And I think also Matt, uh, showed some, uh, some of the pictures, uh, of someone getting

3324
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:01,040
like, uh, a statue or something.

3325
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:07,480
And yeah, I was like, yeah, and most people here also have the same idea because if, if,

3326
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:13,480
if something like it's populated here in Mexico, it's like, we can sit the murals.

3327
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:18,560
We have a lot of religious murals here and they're, they're legit.

3328
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:24,040
They're okay by the Wayfarer standards, but it like there's tons of people like saying,

3329
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:29,880
Oh, I'm going to make one in my house so I can get a Pokestop or I can get a portal even.

3330
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:32,520
But I'm like, no, you shouldn't do that.

3331
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:37,720
If you're going to do something like that, think more like in an open space and in a

3332
02:43:37,720 --> 02:43:46,200
place that needs the Pokestop is if there's already, uh, like already enough POIs on your

3333
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:49,520
place or near your place, you don't need more.

3334
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:55,440
And that's also like my stance on that, but at the same time and, and sometimes because

3335
02:43:55,440 --> 02:44:01,960
of, of how the rating works and especially in places that, that don't have probably that

3336
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:07,380
commodities, especially like talking about safe, safe, uh, safe places that don't have

3337
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:09,960
like a proper sidewalk here.

3338
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:16,840
I, uh, and the place I live, there, there are streets that don't have even like a proper

3339
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:17,840
street.

3340
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:19,400
They're, they're just dirt.

3341
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:21,200
So they don't have a sidewalk.

3342
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:25,960
They don't have like a proper place for pedestrians.

3343
02:44:25,960 --> 02:44:32,960
But uh, if I check that in the Pokestop or the POI, it's in a place that I know that

3344
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:36,400
people can traverse a walking there.

3345
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:43,720
I'm gonna submit it like a safe place because I know it's actually a place that people actually

3346
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:44,720
walk on.

3347
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:49,020
So yeah, yeah, that's tough because if you don't know the place and, and that's, that's

3348
02:44:49,020 --> 02:44:56,020
also like one of the things, uh, I'm probably like, again, some of the people like that,

3349
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:59,920
that actually review here is that, Oh, it is not on a safe place.

3350
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:01,280
No, but you don't know that place.

3351
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:07,280
If you know the place, you know, that all you know, that actually people go there and,

3352
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:08,960
and do what pedestrian stuff.

3353
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,080
So yeah.

3354
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:11,080
Some of the advice.

3355
02:45:11,080 --> 02:45:14,480
So this week is what has happened since when I was talking about this last week is that

3356
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:17,960
I'm seeing more of the Pokemon Go submissions come through this week.

3357
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:20,280
And let me tell you some of my pet peeves.

3358
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:23,400
And I think some of the people listening to the show probably know that, but I'm at like,

3359
02:45:23,400 --> 02:45:26,420
for what it's worth, I'm going to put this out there for the greater population.

3360
02:45:26,420 --> 02:45:31,040
These are some things that are going to instantly make me like, like hate your submission.

3361
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:32,600
Number one on the list.

3362
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:39,500
If your justification says in the justification, we need a pokey stop here because don't stop

3363
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:44,200
talking because what's happened, I've already deducted a star in my mind.

3364
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,680
I'm not supposed to do that.

3365
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:47,300
I'm going to admit I'm not supposed to do that.

3366
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:51,560
But in my mind, when you say we need a pokey stop here, you're not submitting this because

3367
02:45:51,560 --> 02:45:52,960
it's a place of interest.

3368
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:55,760
You're not submitting this for the reasons you're supposed to be submitting a portal.

3369
02:45:55,760 --> 02:46:02,060
You're submitting it because this is convenient for your walk or your life or your way of

3370
02:46:02,060 --> 02:46:03,600
playing the game.

3371
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:08,240
And so when I see that in the justification, I'm looking for reasons to deny it.

3372
02:46:08,240 --> 02:46:11,480
I'm not going to say I always do it because there was one that came through that said,

3373
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:13,000
we need a pokey stop here.

3374
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,760
And I was like, it's actually like, it was like a war memorial or something.

3375
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:20,360
And I was like, it was like in a post office and I'm like, I hate this.

3376
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:24,640
I hate that I have to approve this, but it actually does meet the standards and it's

3377
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:26,360
a super safe place to be.

3378
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:27,360
So I'm going to approve it.

3379
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:29,440
But like, I was looking for a reason to deny it.

3380
02:46:29,440 --> 02:46:31,240
Like I really was.

3381
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:36,520
So you know, and you might hate me for saying that, but at the same time, I hate that you're

3382
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:38,480
submitting something not for the right reasons.

3383
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:41,520
So deal.

3384
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:46,580
And the other thing that like, just, oh my God, I've seen some real brazen stuff.

3385
02:46:46,580 --> 02:46:51,200
Like people submitting the lawn at the apartment complex, calling it a dog park.

3386
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:54,640
People submitting a restaurant just because we don't have a pokey stop in the strip mall

3387
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:56,000
and we should have one.

3388
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,440
And I'm just like, well, you're not getting one because this doesn't meet the criteria.

3389
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:01,420
So try again.

3390
02:47:01,420 --> 02:47:06,080
I will say though, like, you know, I do think not to say all the Pokemon submissions are

3391
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:07,080
shit.

3392
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:10,400
I think some of them have been pretty decent.

3393
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:14,720
I tend to be a little more, it's interesting Act F because I tend to be a little more forgiving

3394
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:19,620
when I see that the submission is in Mexico or Puerto Rico, because I know those places

3395
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:22,140
are hurting for more points of interest.

3396
02:47:22,140 --> 02:47:26,920
So I tend to be a little more lenient, but like I got one the other day that was exercise

3397
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:29,720
equipment at a park and like, it's fine.

3398
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:33,020
It meets standards and I approved it, but I know it's going to get denied because the

3399
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:37,220
picture was terrible and it made it look like it was the play structure that was already

3400
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:38,660
a portal.

3401
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:40,620
So it's not going to go through.

3402
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:46,340
I approved it because I'm like, it's pretty much, it's a park, it's Mexico and it does

3403
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:48,020
meet all the standards.

3404
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:51,260
Like I'm fine with this being a submission, but it's not going to, I can tell you it's

3405
02:47:51,260 --> 02:47:52,340
not going to go through.

3406
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:54,580
So be aware of the pictures that you're taking.

3407
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:57,500
That is super important.

3408
02:47:57,500 --> 02:48:00,100
And the last thing I would say is that don't submit shit.

3409
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:03,140
You don't want 30 people there for any x-rayed for.

3410
02:48:03,140 --> 02:48:09,200
I saw somebody submit a tree in their backyard called a hundred year old tree.

3411
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:14,180
First off, if you do not have an official sign that has the seal of the city or county

3412
02:48:14,180 --> 02:48:19,420
on it, that denotes it as a historic tree, that it's a fucking tree and a natural feature

3413
02:48:19,420 --> 02:48:20,420
is not a portal.

3414
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:24,260
So it's getting denied, especially when that fucking portal is in your backyard, no matter

3415
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:30,040
if you say it's on a walking trail, who's walking trail, bitch, yours, no, no pokey

3416
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:31,040
stop for you.

3417
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:32,420
Shut it down.

3418
02:48:32,420 --> 02:48:35,020
So anyway.

3419
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:38,740
And yeah, I have seen those kinds of submissions.

3420
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:48,740
One of the first ones I reviewed there was a rock, a simple rock with a Pokeball bag

3421
02:48:48,740 --> 02:48:51,580
or like a backpack on over it.

3422
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:55,340
I'm like, really, really?

3423
02:48:55,340 --> 02:49:01,380
And you have seen, I have tweeted you some of the findings I have encountered this week.

3424
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:05,580
So yeah, but I have others.

3425
02:49:05,580 --> 02:49:06,980
I have to read this comment from chat.

3426
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:11,260
Matt says some Pokemon go players are strange.

3427
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:15,260
There's a subset of folks that seem to think that Niantic owes them something and they

3428
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:16,980
should make anything a stop.

3429
02:49:16,980 --> 02:49:21,260
Well, guess what, bitch Niantic ain't reviewing your portals.

3430
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:23,260
They outsource that to the player base.

3431
02:49:23,260 --> 02:49:29,600
You know, who's reviewing your portals me and I don't owe you shit.

3432
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:34,780
So take your stop and shove it.

3433
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:35,780
And that's really true.

3434
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:46,340
We were basically doing the job that Niantic isn't doing, but at least in that sense, we're

3435
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:51,060
like taking proper precautions and stances on that.

3436
02:49:51,060 --> 02:49:57,020
So at least that's something I actually like about this, that we are the players are taking

3437
02:49:57,020 --> 02:50:04,740
care of this because yeah, even in my own community, me and some other players, even

3438
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:12,180
Ingress players, we're trying to teach the other players that are submitting like, oh,

3439
02:50:12,180 --> 02:50:20,060
you should do this, especially like you said in the part that you need to tell why this

3440
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:22,340
should be a POI.

3441
02:50:22,340 --> 02:50:28,860
We're telling people do not tell that it should be a Poke stop, tell why it's important for

3442
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:33,860
the community, tell why the history behind the POI.

3443
02:50:33,860 --> 02:50:38,780
So yeah, we're trying to tell people about that, the pictures, the photos, all that.

3444
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:42,180
You can document this.

3445
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:47,020
I can't speak for the entire Ingress player base that is already in Wayfarer and has been

3446
02:50:47,020 --> 02:50:51,900
using Wayfarer for some time and probably needs to also support your submission to actually

3447
02:50:51,900 --> 02:50:53,100
become a thing.

3448
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:58,620
But I can speak for a large chunk of the base that I've talked to that is in there in Ingress,

3449
02:50:59,580 --> 02:51:04,020
they all feel what I just said earlier, that if you put in there, this should be a Poke

3450
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:08,940
stop because we're already going, nope, you're not following the rules.

3451
02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:10,940
You're not submitting this for the betterment of the game.

3452
02:51:10,940 --> 02:51:15,700
You're submitting it for the betterment of yourself and you're already going to be an

3453
02:51:15,700 --> 02:51:16,700
uphill battle.

3454
02:51:16,700 --> 02:51:24,380
Quite literally, the second one I reviewed just now is the back of a building, Thunderdome

3455
02:51:24,380 --> 02:51:25,380
rear entrance.

3456
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:30,660
The Thunderdome is the location where trainers and masters converse on catching recent Pokemon.

3457
02:51:30,660 --> 02:51:32,220
It is a sidewalk.

3458
02:51:32,220 --> 02:51:35,300
First off, it broke through.

3459
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:40,220
You can deny it right there with the reason description because you cannot say in your

3460
02:51:40,220 --> 02:51:43,740
description, Pokemon, Ingress, portal.

3461
02:51:43,740 --> 02:51:47,620
I realized some things have snuck through like, you know, under the old rules when the

3462
02:51:47,620 --> 02:51:52,220
player base wasn't doing it and Google was doing it themselves, some things snuck through.

3463
02:51:52,220 --> 02:51:54,220
That's why you have like shapers.

3464
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:56,740
Sometimes you see reference to shapers or XM.

3465
02:51:56,740 --> 02:51:58,620
Those are Ingress terms.

3466
02:51:58,620 --> 02:52:02,320
But for now, when the player base is reviewing, just based on that description, they name

3467
02:52:02,320 --> 02:52:03,940
check the game.

3468
02:52:03,940 --> 02:52:05,140
That's not a point of interest.

3469
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:07,260
So rejected based on description.

3470
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:09,660
I don't even have to look at where it is or the picture itself.

3471
02:52:09,660 --> 02:52:12,100
The description is bad enough.

3472
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:19,140
And I have seen that the like churches, temples, like stuff like that, that people say in the

3473
02:52:19,140 --> 02:52:23,420
description, oh, people come here to pray, to get shinies.

3474
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:27,220
And I'm like, really, people, really?

3475
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:28,920
One star.

3476
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:34,260
One star because you're submitting something with a Pokemon reference and you are forgetting

3477
02:52:34,260 --> 02:52:37,460
that you're not submitting just for Pokemon Go.

3478
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:40,500
That's what I need the player base of Pokemon Go to understand.

3479
02:52:40,500 --> 02:52:42,300
And I love both games.

3480
02:52:42,300 --> 02:52:45,700
I am max level in Ingress and max level in Pokemon.

3481
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:49,740
So I can speak with some sense of authority for the Pokemon group too.

3482
02:52:49,740 --> 02:52:55,540
And I just, I need them to realize what they're submitting is not just for their game.

3483
02:52:55,540 --> 02:53:01,820
And yeah, then one more thing about this, there's a video on YouTube from Pokemon Go

3484
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:09,460
YouTuber Trainer Tips that explains really, really well how Wayfarer works like in both

3485
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:13,660
points of view from the submitter and also like a reviewer.

3486
02:53:13,660 --> 02:53:19,220
So I suggest people that probably don't understand that much about Wayfarer and want to get into

3487
02:53:19,220 --> 02:53:24,260
it and are submitting like focus stop portals and all this stuff that check that video.

3488
02:53:24,260 --> 02:53:25,260
It's really informative.

3489
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:28,100
But again, I don't want to keep this overly negative.

3490
02:53:28,100 --> 02:53:31,420
There are some positive things that I'm seeing, you know, and especially like, you know, I

3491
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:34,860
saw one the other day that was like, this park has been here for three years.

3492
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:36,980
And this is just a justification, not the description.

3493
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:40,020
This park has been here for three years and it's still not in the game.

3494
02:53:40,020 --> 02:53:42,240
And I'm looking and I'm like, yep, it's a park.

3495
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:43,240
It should be in the game.

3496
02:53:43,320 --> 02:53:46,120
Okay, you can have your stop because it meets the criteria.

3497
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:49,280
It was a sign at a park that really should be there.

3498
02:53:49,280 --> 02:53:51,480
And those are the, that's the type of stuff I love.

3499
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:54,680
Things that like parks and historical places, universities.

3500
02:53:54,680 --> 02:53:56,880
I'm pretty, you know, pretty good about that stuff too.

3501
02:53:56,880 --> 02:54:00,000
Places where people should be gathering anyway.

3502
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:05,680
You know, the wonderful thing about these games, it's getting people to use public parks.

3503
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:09,800
You know, I realize some cities have had issues with that, but they're stupid.

3504
02:54:09,800 --> 02:54:12,720
For the most part, I think a lot of cities are really happy about it.

3505
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:17,480
Like, you know, I see food truck events that are like, come to our food truck event and,

3506
02:54:17,480 --> 02:54:20,560
you know, we have pokey stops here you can play, you know, and so forth.

3507
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:23,120
So anyway, anyway.

3508
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:28,980
And yeah, and I also feel like for rural players, because obviously they don't have like that

3509
02:54:28,980 --> 02:54:37,400
many POIs, but at least I'm seeing more people like, especially here locally from the outskirts

3510
02:54:37,400 --> 02:54:44,520
and places that like are small towns, basically, that are getting submissions and all that

3511
02:54:44,520 --> 02:54:45,520
stuff.

3512
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:54,840
And I'm pretty much, of course, if it's a legit one, if it's a sorry for approval, I

3513
02:54:54,840 --> 02:55:01,080
usually give those five stars, even if it has like a kind of shady description.

3514
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:07,040
But sometimes it's people, and I know my people, I know my Mexican people.

3515
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:08,040
So yeah, basically.

3516
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:09,040
I'm sorry.

3517
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:10,040
I'm sorry.

3518
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:14,400
While you were talking, I brought up something that SJ100 Matt put in chat.

3519
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:17,420
And this is a piece of work, for God's sake.

3520
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:21,680
So it's a picture of a fire hydrant that's been painted, and it's called American flag

3521
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:22,920
fire hydrant.

3522
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:26,960
This fire hydrant was painted to resemble an American flag after the events of 9-11

3523
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:28,600
in 2001.

3524
02:55:28,600 --> 02:55:32,260
I believe that this pokey stop nomination is important because it stands as a symbol

3525
02:55:32,260 --> 02:55:36,620
in a local community to help us remember what happened on September 11th, 2001, as

3526
02:55:36,620 --> 02:55:38,980
well as what and who we lost.

3527
02:55:38,980 --> 02:55:41,300
Through remembrance, we get stronger as people.

3528
02:55:41,300 --> 02:55:42,300
Never forget.

3529
02:55:42,300 --> 02:55:43,300
Okay.

3530
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:44,300
It's a fucking fire hydrant.

3531
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:48,400
It's a fucking fire hydrant, one star obstructs emergency services.

3532
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:51,980
And quite frankly, sir or madam, how dare you?

3533
02:55:51,980 --> 02:55:57,220
Because you're trying to leverage this tragedy so you can have a fucking pokey stop?

3534
02:55:57,220 --> 02:55:58,740
And what the fuck?

3535
02:55:58,740 --> 02:56:03,100
Just even apart from that, not the first time fire hydrants have been placed and painted

3536
02:56:03,100 --> 02:56:04,100
as the flag.

3537
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:06,220
There was one in the 80s when I was a kid.

3538
02:56:06,220 --> 02:56:07,860
Which is, and you know, that's-

3539
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:12,060
And I think it's actually illegal, it has to be done by city ordinance.

3540
02:56:12,060 --> 02:56:16,340
Well, one star obstructs emergency services, and you might be thinking, we don't have to

3541
02:56:16,340 --> 02:56:19,580
be standing on the hydrant to access it.

3542
02:56:19,580 --> 02:56:23,340
You aren't thinking of all the games because in Ingress, sometimes you have to stand on

3543
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:26,540
the center of the portal if you want to remove shields with ultra strikes.

3544
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:29,260
Your submission blocks emergency services, one star.

3545
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:30,260
Yep.

3546
02:56:30,260 --> 02:56:31,260
Basically, yeah.

3547
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:32,260
So anyway.

3548
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:37,220
And then SGA-100 Matt says also Staten Island, just saying.

3549
02:56:37,220 --> 02:56:40,300
We should have the Niantic Wayfarer review podcast.

3550
02:56:40,300 --> 02:56:45,980
Actually, okay, so I'm trying to talk to one of my Ingress buddies to convince her to do

3551
02:56:45,980 --> 02:56:46,980
something.

3552
02:56:46,980 --> 02:56:47,980
But anyway.

3553
02:56:47,980 --> 02:56:48,980
That would be hilarious.

3554
02:56:48,980 --> 02:56:49,980
I know.

3555
02:56:49,980 --> 02:56:50,980
It's a panel.

3556
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:51,980
We vote you out.

3557
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:52,980
Anyway.

3558
02:56:52,980 --> 02:56:54,860
All right.

3559
02:56:54,860 --> 02:56:55,860
Thank you so much, ActAft.

3560
02:56:55,860 --> 02:56:56,860
I'm gonna let you go.

3561
02:56:56,860 --> 02:56:57,860
So we wrap up the show.

3562
02:56:57,860 --> 02:56:58,860
But great conversation.

3563
02:56:58,860 --> 02:57:00,580
Nothing gets me riled up like a shitty pokestop.

3564
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:02,660
Hey, thanks for having me.

3565
02:57:02,660 --> 02:57:03,660
Like always.

3566
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:04,660
All right.

3567
02:57:04,660 --> 02:57:05,660
Take care, buddy.

3568
02:57:05,660 --> 02:57:06,660
You too.

3569
02:57:06,660 --> 02:57:07,660
All right.

3570
02:57:07,660 --> 02:57:08,660
All right.

3571
02:57:08,660 --> 02:57:09,660
I think we're at the point of the show where it's time for us to wrap up.

3572
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:11,020
And Les, do we have any last minute stories?

3573
02:57:11,020 --> 02:57:12,020
I don't know.

3574
02:57:12,020 --> 02:57:14,060
I saw something and I actually downloaded it.

3575
02:57:14,060 --> 02:57:17,580
I didn't look too much more into it where someone did like this.

3576
02:57:17,580 --> 02:57:22,900
I mean, it really just looks like it was done in like some like maybe Unreal Engine or something,

3577
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:24,240
some real life world.

3578
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:26,720
But it's like a free running Mario game.

3579
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:31,920
And it looks like one of the more recent, you know, 3D models and new 3D Goombas and

3580
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:34,880
everything all in this just like overworld place.

3581
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:36,240
And I forgot the name of it.

3582
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:37,240
I downloaded it earlier.

3583
02:57:37,240 --> 02:57:39,240
And if I could remember more about it, but I found it on Twitter.

3584
02:57:39,240 --> 02:57:41,360
I'll have to see if I can find it again.

3585
02:57:41,360 --> 02:57:42,360
But it's out there.

3586
02:57:42,360 --> 02:57:46,280
It's just weird because it's got like realistic shading, even though it's like Mario.

3587
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:49,040
Just normal old Mario and Goombas.

3588
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:52,040
I didn't really see a point to it, but I'm like, oh, waste of time.

3589
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:56,840
I got into this YouTube, well, I just want to mention this because I got into this like

3590
02:57:56,840 --> 02:58:03,320
YouTube, I don't know, rabbit hole earlier about the IAAPA.

3591
02:58:03,320 --> 02:58:09,000
So that's a it's a convention for amusement parks and amusement park innovations and stuff

3592
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:10,000
like that.

3593
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:14,240
And one of the videos they showed on there was somebody playing a game that looked like

3594
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:22,960
on a Tron light cycle VR, but the game itself looked much like Wipeout or F-Zero.

3595
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:24,920
That is a perfect combination of things right there.

3596
02:58:24,920 --> 02:58:26,440
It is a good combination of things.

3597
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:27,440
I like that.

3598
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:28,440
All right.

3599
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:31,280
Well, we're about to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

3600
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:36,100
But I do want to say happy Thanksgiving holiday to those of you here in the States that are

3601
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:38,480
celebrating Thanksgiving this week.

3602
02:58:38,480 --> 02:58:42,480
But you know, around the world, thanks to everybody that listens to and supports the

3603
02:58:42,480 --> 02:58:43,480
show.

3604
02:58:43,720 --> 02:58:45,320
I do appreciate you guys.

3605
02:58:45,320 --> 02:58:48,400
And you know, you may have noticed tonight is episode number seven hundred and ninety

3606
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:52,400
nine, which means next week will be episode number eight hundred of our show.

3607
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:53,400
Believe it or not.

3608
02:58:53,400 --> 02:58:58,000
Any of you who are friends with my husband on the Facebook, just saying ask him to be

3609
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:59,520
on the show.

3610
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:02,900
So we're hoping we're going to have a good time and a good show to mark eight hundred

3611
02:59:02,900 --> 02:59:04,440
episodes of the show.

3612
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:08,600
But I think it's an appropriate time of year to really give thanks to all of you that turn

3613
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:13,240
to tune into the show, whether it be here on Twitch as we record it live or if you're

3614
02:59:13,240 --> 02:59:17,040
listening on the podcast feed every week, you are just as important as well.

3615
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:20,000
And we hope you do feel you have a voice at the table if you ever want to send us an email

3616
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,960
or a tweet or anything like that.

3617
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:25,360
We would not have the motivation to keep going because of you guys.

3618
02:59:25,360 --> 02:59:28,960
Longevity does not always translate into mainstream success.

3619
02:59:28,960 --> 02:59:33,660
However, I feel like there's been many success stories out of this show.

3620
02:59:33,660 --> 02:59:35,600
And that is really thanks to you guys.

3621
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:39,480
You know, just a couple of weeks ago, I was in New York City hanging out with some of

3622
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:43,080
you guys, and I would not be doing that if it wasn't for this little program that we

3623
02:59:43,080 --> 02:59:44,080
have here.

3624
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:49,400
Our little show, our little secret show that hates shitty Pokestop submissions.

3625
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:54,640
So just giving thanks to all of you guys who take time out of your week, whether it be

3626
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:58,080
here live on Sunday nights or at some point throughout the week, maybe while you're working

3627
02:59:58,080 --> 03:00:00,640
or on your commute or what have you to listen to this show.

3628
03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:01,640
Really appreciate that.

3629
03:00:01,640 --> 03:00:02,960
And thank you so much.

3630
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:07,080
On that note, let's go around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3631
03:00:07,080 --> 03:00:10,280
Um, Loki, I guess we'll start with you.

3632
03:00:10,280 --> 03:00:15,980
Hopefully I'll get to work more of my game during my time off this week.

3633
03:00:15,980 --> 03:00:17,400
My final thought is wish me luck.

3634
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:19,560
I might actually be a Pokemon game.

3635
03:00:19,560 --> 03:00:21,120
I'm making progress to be Pokemon shield.

3636
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:22,120
It looks like it might happen.

3637
03:00:22,120 --> 03:00:23,120
You are a Pokemon game?

3638
03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:24,120
I thought you said be a Pokemon game.

3639
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:26,560
I thought for sure that you beat Let's Go, but I guess not.

3640
03:00:26,560 --> 03:00:32,120
No, I only got as far as Pokemon Go Park and I'm not counting Let's Go either because it's

3641
03:00:32,120 --> 03:00:34,040
not a mainline game technically.

3642
03:00:34,040 --> 03:00:35,040
It's kind of a side game.

3643
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:36,040
Yeah, close.

3644
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:37,040
I know close.

3645
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:42,000
Um, so my final thought is, yeah, I want to be Pokemon shield and I forgot to give the

3646
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:45,320
little thing about a five star review wherever you found the show.

3647
03:00:45,320 --> 03:00:49,520
Help us spread the word because, uh, we don't, if, if your friends and your fam and other

3648
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:52,640
people out there, you know, on the internet aren't here, we can't hear those voices.

3649
03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:53,640
So help us spread the word.

3650
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:55,440
The auto hosts on Twitch go a long way as well.

3651
03:00:55,440 --> 03:01:00,440
Besides, we're definitely not worth one star because we don't block emergency services.

3652
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:04,720
We meet, we meet all, should I submit studio and seven as a, no, I'm not going to submit

3653
03:01:04,720 --> 03:01:09,240
it as, because that would be bad because that's, it would also give away my home address.

3654
03:01:09,240 --> 03:01:10,720
That's not a good idea.

3655
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:11,720
Why would I do that?

3656
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:16,200
Anyway, you can do it after you move, Oh, then have like a little plaque in the backyard

3657
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:17,200
historical site.

3658
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:21,640
No, cause then my frenemy who plays for the other team, it'll be right next to them and

3659
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:23,520
I'll live on the other side of town.

3660
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:28,920
I'm not giving my friend to me another pokey pokey stopper, uh, uh, portal.

3661
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:29,920
Anyway.

3662
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:32,600
Um, dark soccer, last but not least your turn.

3663
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:34,760
I got a shitty schedule at work starting in February.

3664
03:01:34,760 --> 03:01:39,680
It's a 5am shift, which would keep me from here anyway.

3665
03:01:39,680 --> 03:01:40,680
So wish me luck.

3666
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:46,080
I'm going to go petition my case and I already mentioned it to the boss that I can't work

3667
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:49,120
before eight o'clock and I can't work Sundays.

3668
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:51,160
So wish me luck.

3669
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:52,160
Fingers and toes crossed.

3670
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:56,160
Cause that's going to be rough if, uh, it's a six month stint this time instead of three

3671
03:01:56,160 --> 03:01:57,160
months.

3672
03:01:57,160 --> 03:01:58,160
Oh golly.

3673
03:01:58,160 --> 03:02:01,560
So yeah, I have been very specific about it.

3674
03:02:01,560 --> 03:02:02,560
All right.

3675
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:04,520
All right.

3676
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:06,920
Um, well I guess that that we're going to wrap up.

3677
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:10,920
So have a great holiday, those of you in the States, but no matter where you are, happy

3678
03:02:10,920 --> 03:02:11,960
gaming this week.

3679
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:12,960
Have a great time.

3680
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:16,000
And we will see you next time here on orange lounge radio next week.

3681
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:19,800
Episode number 800 cause we're old.

3682
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:24,520
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

3683
03:02:24,520 --> 03:02:30,440
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show.
