00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And how are you feeling?

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not drugged out of my brain anymore

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Did you go back and listen to all the crazy things you said last week?

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, I'm just kidding

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't listen to myself

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Anyway, well hopefully the time off work and so forth while you're recuperating

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Great time to watch a lot of random YouTubes and play some games

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Actually it's time to build a website, rebuild a website

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And yell at my computer while I'm playing The Sims

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fair enough

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Also say hello to TechMasterLoki

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hi, how are you?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm fine

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You and I are both dressed up in button up shirts today

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We just got off work

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's very formal

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a formal, it's a black tie

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And DarkSakura is dressed up too

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is what I wear to work

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You should see this wig she's got on

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's amazing and she's got makeup

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm just kidding

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Which is actually funny because I'm not wearing hardly any makeup

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I'm wearing a black flannel, a Captain Marvel t-shirt and leggings

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm about as unformal, I look like the 90s, really

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Revenge of the 90s

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Except I have better eyebrows

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I like the Captain Marvel shirt though, it's cute

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, I paid four bucks for it at Target

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A whole four dollars? No, that's a good deal

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've been all about the clearance racks and thrifting lately

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Treasure hunting

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're not live tonight

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is kind of an extra episode that we're doing

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We're taping, as I mentioned, Tuesday during the week

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In advance of our usual Sunday night slot

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because as I've mentioned on a previous episode of the show

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm going to be out of town this weekend

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
On a trip I planned like six months ago

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Before all the other stuff that knocked us off the air

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
For a couple weeks previously came up

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So we just wanted to make sure we at least kind of recorded something for you guys

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That make it a habit to show up on Sunday nights live

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And of course download us as part of your podcast rotation and all that

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So we're doing a little bit of a special bonus episode tonight

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Very free form, very unlike some of our usual episodes of Orange On Radio

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So if it's your first episode of Orange On Radio

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This may not be the best one to represent

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's just your appetizer

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's kind of like the appetizer

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's just a little bit of the three hour plus show

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This last show we just did two days ago was three hours plus

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It was like a three hour fifteen minute show

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So tonight probably won't be as long

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because there simply just isn't as much to talk about

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
However, I am looking forward to a little later on in the show

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We're going to be welcoming our good buddy and pal and friend

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Game maker, independent game maker YYR is going to join us

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
For a little bit of a chat

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And I am told he's going to break an exclusive here about his games on the show tonight

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So that is very exciting

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So we'll talk about that

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So at least we still have a little excitement building here

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
On our special little mini edition of Orange On Radio

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
For those of you that are watching on Sunday night

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Where we usually do tape live every Sunday night

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
At six o'clock pacific, nine o'clock eastern

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
For those of you that are there

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can still chat along with the show

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And your comments will show up for at least two more days

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Until twitch pulls the plug on all that

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Which I don't, I have to be honest

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I do love twitch or we wouldn't be using them as a platform to stream

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But I don't understand why they got to get rid of that

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Maybe it's a resource hog

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Maybe for most channels it's just something really horribly underutilized

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But I'm going to miss it

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to miss the chat on the video on demand

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So this is your last chance

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Pour one out for the chat

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But in fact right now in chat

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Push F to pay respects

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For the video on demand

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That way I'll know who is here

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I even saw an article that

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The pay F for respects is five years old today

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right it's celebrating a birthday

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That meme is five years old

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh my gosh we're all getting older

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know what quick aside

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because we never get on tangents here on Orange On Radio

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was at work today and talking with a co-worker

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And the subject of the classic 70s, late 70s, early 80s

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Television program Mork and Mindy came up

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And my co-worker who is a few years younger than I am

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Had no idea who Mork and Mindy was

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And like I had to explain like you know like Robin Williams

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Big TV, Nanu Nanu, nope

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No idea who Mork and Mindy was

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh come on everyone knows Pam Dauber

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I know and it was Robin Williams

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And then even my other co-worker who totally knew the show

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Was like and who is the gal that played Mindy

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What was her name

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm like Pam Dauber

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What else was she in

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
She was in that movie Stay Tuned with John Ritter

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She was also, wasn't she in

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't remember what else Pam Dauber was in

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No she was in a TV movie

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I know about this because she was playing

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Someone who was meant to be Lisa Dalby

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Who was the woman who worked for a year in the 70s

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
As an actual geiko in Kyoto

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
As in what they call geisha in Kyoto

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Who worked for a year as a geiko

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She was there working on her like her doctorate thesis

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think on kimono and geiko culture

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So but I saw that movie I knew she was in it

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well who knew listening to Orange Lawn's radio this week

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'd learned something about Pam Dauber

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And wasn't she in that 80s series

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
She wasn't in My Sister Sam was she

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know can somebody pull up her wikipedia

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm looking

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But you remember that show right My Sister Sam

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh yeah I think that was her

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah I do remember that

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Was that the show

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The girl also died

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was like was that the show

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah it was Pam Dauber and Rebecca Schaefer

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Rebecca Schaefer was the one that had the stalker that shot her

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I know it's really tragic and not something I'm trying to make light of

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But that was I mean for those that were like

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Those of you that are like in your early 40s or late 30s

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Probably remember hearing about that when you were a kid

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That there was this popular show on TV

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And the actress unfortunately yeah

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Cause that changed like stalking laws and stuff

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like that was a big big deal when that happened I remember

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So okay

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I didn't realize that Pam Dauber actually screen tested for the role of Tabitha

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Which was the spinoff of Bewitched

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Huh how bout that

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Wow

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Alright the classic actress of the week

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right here on Orange Lounge Radio

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't realize that she was married to Mark Harmon

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But yeah she was um

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
She did a couple other shows

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And actually worked with Robin Williams

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
On one of his comedy shows called The Crazy Ones

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Has she done anything in the past 10 years

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That was in 2014

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh The Crazy Ones was that last TV show he had before

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He died the one with Sarah Michelle Gellar

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah interesting

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay anyway

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Alright the Pam Dauber show

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Alright let's

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well I'm just saying I'm looking at on here

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She actually did some voice acting too

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Any video games?

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well it was 101 Dalmatians the series

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So there's no way to tie Pam Dauber to video gaming

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
She's on the show Dream On remember that

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Completely on a tangent I do remember Dream On

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Alright enough enough

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay sorry I just I just I just think it's it's kind of funny

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think it's

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She has a lot of movies

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I haven't thought about her in many years

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Alright let's talk about some early gaming headlines

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Again I do want to give this disclaimer

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We're taping this about 5 days in advance of when it's airing

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A whole lot of shit could go down during the week

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So we're just gonna take a look at some of the early headlines from the week

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And give you our thoughts

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So Dark Sakura I know you've pulled a few things for us

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Um yeah

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Alright what do you want to talk about?

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well how about some Sony shenanigans

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because I don't know

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We we talk about things like this happening

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't want to get so mad

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But this one might actually be a travesty

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Smooshy agrees

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes Mr. Smoosh is very much commenting on the case at hand

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Anyway the servers for Sing Star are gonna close on January 31st

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I know all those copies of Sing Star out in circulation

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Which actually I think it was a pretty good seller

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I wasn't into it but eh

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But at any rate they did make a post about it publicly online

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That all online functionality, network features, song purchases

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Will be disabled immediately as of 11.59pm on January 31st 2020

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And it will go on all Playstation platforms

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But offline features will still be available

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The thing in particular to keep your eyes on

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Is that for PS4 users you will be able to re-download any songs

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That you have downloaded and deleted previously

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But that will not be possible on PS3

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You will need to download all of your digital purchases

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Prior to the server shutdown

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then after that the deleted content will be completely irretrievable

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's being replaced with a game called Sing Smoosh

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Which is actually going on in the background right now

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well I kinda like Sing Star

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you have Sing Star Abba?

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I do, I have Sing Star Abba

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Download all your shit

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well I don't have to download Sing Star Abba because that's all on the disc

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So if I'm hearing you right

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The disc version of Sing Star Abba should work

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And there was also Sing Star Queen

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Which I think I have as well

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So Sing Star Queen, Sing Star Abba

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And then there was the random Sing Star 1, 2, and 3

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They had all of that

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then you could download a bunch of songs online

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Which I did

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I remember having house parties

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We downloaded a bunch of stuff on Sing Star

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because I had those microphones

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And then around the Playstation 4 era

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
They kinda changed it more to like a stand alone thing

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Where you just have the Sing Star app basically

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And you can sing, there's like an app you get for your phone

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And you use your phone as the mic

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Which is a smart way to do it

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So you don't have to worry about those blue and red plug in mics anymore

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But that means if the servers are going down

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You won't be able to download any new songs now

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well to be specific what people will still be able to do

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Is access all the songs on the discs

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Play party mode

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Track and record your high scores offline

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Take in store videos and snapshots to the hard drive

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And create song playlists

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But things like the challenges

249
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Scoreboards, user generated content

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Will no longer be available online

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You can't share your media to Facebook, Twitter, PSN

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Sing Star communities or any of that

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And of course you will not be able to unlock

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The channel surfer, concert debut, star in my eyes

255
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Or Sing Star trophies

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah there's a lot of stuff that's gonna be locked away

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Because I seem to remember

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What was the Sony initiative called

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Was it called Play Create Share or something like that

260
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Was that the Sony thing

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I wanna say Sing Star was a big part of that

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because LittleBigPlanet was a huge part of that

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
When it first came out too

264
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But Sing Star has all that online stuff

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And again this, Sing Star was out in an era

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Right before, maybe like when YouTube

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Was kinda still like first coming out

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Was still kinda new

269
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Like people knew YouTube and got linked YouTubes

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Kelly's shoes existed on YouTube at the time

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So there was something to go visit there

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But it wasn't like it is now

273
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And like something like Twitch

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wasn't really what it is now

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You know where there's the immediate like sharing of things

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Or you know even something like

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Justin TV, Twitch's predecessor was still kinda

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think still in its very much like its formative years

279
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So Sing Star was really like a place to really like share

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Like here's my singing you know

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
For good and for bad

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So it's kinda sad to see it go

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I guess it would make sense

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That perhaps licensing issues

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Are now coming into play

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I mean we would be like

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It could be like a

288
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You know whatever licenses are coming due

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah I mean but it would be like

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I mean Sing Star ABBA was a PlayStation 3

291
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I wanna say a game like Sing Star ABBA

292
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Was almost 10 years ago at this point

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You know so

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I remember how excited you were

295
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well hell yeah

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The video game all about ABBA

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you kidding?

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They don't often make dedicated video games

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
To groups I adore

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Wasn't Tiara here when we played that

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Like Spice World was the only other one I can think of

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm trying to look

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Cause I actually have off camera

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
A bunch of PlayStation 3 games

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm curious of

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I think my copies of Sing Star are in the other room though

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because I think I pulled those discs

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
To do something with the PlayStation 4 version

309
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't think the PlayStation 4 version reads them

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But it definitely knew

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like I had bought these certain songs

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Online previously

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And so like

314
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I do have a PlayStation 4 copy of the client

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I should go through and see if there's any

317
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Other songs I wanna grab

318
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Before it all goes away forever

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But I feel like

320
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
They kinda

321
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They didn't really do a lot of updates

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
To that library starting a couple years ago

323
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It is a library I've spent

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A bit of money on

326
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I mean I would say over the years

327
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I probably dropped like 40 bucks

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
On additional songs

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I know it sounds like a lot

330
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But

331
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You know

332
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Again you have parties

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it's very easy to sign into the store

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And people are like

335
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I wanna sing that one

336
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think even

337
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Your wife

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Loki

339
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I wanna say at one of these parties

340
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Convince me to download Whitney Houston songs

341
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That sounds like her

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Right?

343
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm almost

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Vaguely remember something

346
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm almost positive

347
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I had a birthday party

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Way way way back when

349
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
When we used to do the show in the garage

350
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
At the house that I lived at

351
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Then

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe

353
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think I had a party way back then

354
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I think we played Sing Star

355
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And I wanna say

356
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Your wife made me download

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I Wanna Dance With Somebody

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
By Whitney

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Which is not a bad selection

360
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm not upset with it

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That sounds like her

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah right

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't know why I associate your wife

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
With Whitney Houston

365
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But I do

366
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's a very easy association

367
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The Bodyguard really is

368
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You know the number one thing

369
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah

370
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I wish that was a play on Broadway

371
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I could go see

372
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Wanna go

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The Bodyguard?

374
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah The Bodyguard

375
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The Bodyguard's a play you know

376
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Did you?

377
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We saw the musical

378
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh that's right

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You saw the one with Deborah Cox right?

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How'd you guys like it?

382
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was pretty good actually

383
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sad it's not on Broadway still

384
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Did I say on this show what I'm gonna go see

385
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm gonna go see Moulin Rouge

386
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And I'm gonna go see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway

387
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Cause it just started the preview performances like this past weekend

388
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Cool

389
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So I'm gonna get to see it in like its first couple weeks of existence

390
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm being a total Broadway hipster right now

391
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But I'm really excited so

392
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah

393
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Anyway

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
By the time you guys hear this

395
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Actually at the time you guys are watching this on Twitch

396
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I will be in the second act of Moulin Rouge

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So I'm really excited

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Anyway

399
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I can no longer download the Elephant Love medley to sing on SingStar from Moulin Rouge

400
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So rest in peace SingStar thanks for the memories

401
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Anyway

402
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Anything else StarSaga?

403
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No not in regard to SingStar

404
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What about any other stories you wanna talk about?

405
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
A couple of things

406
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay

407
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So there has been another video game related death

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But due to being too into the game I guess

409
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There was a teenager in Thailand who was found dead after a marathon gaming session

410
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
His name is Piawet Harikun

411
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I guess I pronounced that right

412
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Was discovered on I guess yesterday in his home in Thailand

413
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
After playing a bunch of multiplayer games

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And they said that he died from a stroke

415
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He was discovered near his computer chair in his bedroom

416
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The desk was covered with food containers and the curtains were drawn

417
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And his father discovered him

418
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And apparently yeah they said that they're trying to use that to bring bigger alertness

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I guess to the use of video games and people with addictive personalities

420
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Because I don't think video games themselves are addictive

421
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I think it's addictive personalities the same way that people

422
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because the same type of response like to gambling and things like that

423
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Almost anything consumable can be addictive

424
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Not like though with a drug where it does create

425
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Like I'm addicted to these Tootsie Roll vanilla things

426
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But that's part of a chemical reaction

427
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Addiction on games and gambling is a different kind of chemical reaction

428
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I gotcha

429
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So you know that same dopamine response

430
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Whereas I don't consider that a consumable

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I consider that going to be more something who is more easily stimulated by that sort of response

432
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Is going to want to keep doing it

433
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And it's interesting that you kind of put games and gambling in the same category

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Because I think a lot of the issues we've been hearing about in the past few years with the loot box concerns

435
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Are kind of falling in a very similar thing

436
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Is that you know it's getting a little too close to gambling

437
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And hits kind of a lot of those same nerves for people

438
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well and on top of that I mean you know the World Health Organization

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Has included video game addiction to its list of international classifications of diseases

440
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I like though how it's phrased

441
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The disorder is characterized by impaired control over gaming

442
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
An increased priority given to play video games over other daily activities

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Usually lasting for at least 12 months to be diagnosed

444
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And that is very much like how gambling is classified

445
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Or how workout addiction

446
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You know of workout addiction right?

447
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Sure

448
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Sometimes it's things like steroids and stuff in regards to those

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Although again I think there are different types of addiction

450
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Runners

451
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

452
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Runners

453
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh yeah

454
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And interesting you kind of bring up the ICD coding of the issue

455
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because you know the industry switched ICD coding standards

456
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
2015 I think was the big year

457
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So they were running on an older version

458
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They switched to a newer version that was already being used in places like Europe and stuff

459
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But this new kind of coding

460
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So even though it's like wow they actually have coding for video game addiction

461
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They switched to a system that allows them to code for almost anything

462
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Like there's an ICD code out there for subsequent

463
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No I think the craziest one because this was my old world

464
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That I can be a little more open about now because it's not my world anymore

465
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There used to be a code for piece of a UFO flying on you for a subsequent time

466
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Like they have all sorts of things classified

467
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I know

468
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Unidentified flying object

469
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Doesn't necessarily mean an alien

470
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No

471
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Something fell out of the sky

472
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Somebody's cheap ass drone

473
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah somebody's drone

474
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's right a drone would be a UFO in that

475
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That would actually be a perfect example of that

476
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Weather balloons Rob weather balloons

477
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah that could be too

478
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So anyway

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So don't redo it too much that they've actually given it an ICD coding

480
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Almost anything that can end up in a doctor's office

481
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
They have the capacity to give an ICD-10 code to now

482
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Well then and last but not least

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You know I hate to be like the pooper on here

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But New Zealand is banning a video game that's glorifying mass shootings

485
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I think it might be that same one that we talked about before

486
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
They didn't mention it by name so I guess not to give any

487
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What sort of attention to the game itself

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Sure

489
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But there is a you know they had the Christchurch mass shooting

490
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Where they were 51 Muslims were murdered in a mosque

491
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Wasn't that the one that was streamed online

492
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It was streamed on Facebook

493
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Gross yeah

494
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
With a gunman with semi-automatic weapons

495
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Who went into two mosques on March 15th and killed 51 people and wounded more

496
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They were talking about the release of this game and advertisement of this game

497
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Because it has one play from the perspective of a white supremacist

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So the game is banned outright in New Zealand

499
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
With further urging internationally to ban the game

500
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Interesting

501
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You know and I know this was the same incident that led them to pass gun reform

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Like within a weekend right

503
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I remember a lot of people were pointing at that

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Because you know and I'm trying to walk a real fine line

505
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Because we could have a three hour show about the politics of this issue

506
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And yeah and that whole thing

507
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I have to ask this question as much of a slippery slope as it is into a complete political spin-off

508
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But with this disgusting as a subject matter about like white supremacy and all that is

509
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Are we going down a slippery slope if we start to ban these sorts of things

510
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Because like for me it starts to get down like kind of like

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Do you remember when the Supreme Court intervened on that Schwarzenegger law

512
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Like who is to define what is obscene and what is not obscene

513
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Or in that case what is a violent game and what is not

514
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Because there was no like official rating

515
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So I think and you guys have to forgive me because I don't have all the references in front of me

516
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But I want to say where that law ended up getting tripped up

517
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Was because there is no

518
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's too vague

519
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's too vague on what is a violent game

520
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So I guess my kind of my kind of thought is here

521
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And New Zealand can do whatever they want

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And Australia has banned games before

523
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We know like Mortal Kombat been banned

524
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They also banned assault weapons

525
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Right

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Much earlier on

527
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So are we I'm trying to keep the question kind of simple

528
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Without going too far down the rabbit hole

529
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But is it a slippery slope to start banning video games

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious

531
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Say that again sorry

532
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious

533
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So I don't like to think in terms like that

534
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I think there is such a thing as setting precedence

535
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But America is so stupid when it comes to violence anyway

536
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They'll ban sex before they ban violence

537
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Which is absolutely ridiculous

538
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't know it's

539
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah it's tough

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm not saying there's necessarily an easy answer here

541
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Maybe this is one of those things we just have to think

542
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
America is stupid about it

543
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And it's one of those things we have to think about

544
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Like what is the correct response to something like this

545
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
How do we you know

546
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I guess for me it's more like

547
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
How do we teach people or demonstrate to people

548
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That this is something that's effective

549
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
This is something that you know when

550
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And I don't even know the game in question

551
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So I can't even like say XYZ game is offensive

552
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Because I haven't seen it

553
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And I don't really care to hearing about this

554
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But maybe that's the whole thing

555
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Is that because I know it involves these types of things

556
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm like that's disgusting

557
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't need to play it

558
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
For example I don't go to see those Saw movies

559
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't like those Saw movies right

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because I know they're gross

561
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I know they show people getting shot

562
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
They don't know what they're doing

563
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I know they're gross

564
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I know they show people getting chopped up

565
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
In the little bitty pieces and stuff

566
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So when I hear that a new Saw movie is coming out

567
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm like there's a movie I don't need to see

568
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Right

569
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So that's how I approach it

570
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Now maybe Loki goes and buys popcorn

571
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And goes to opening night

572
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Fine he can go do whatever he wants

573
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I've missed too many Saw movies

574
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Unfortunately I'm too far behind in the Saw series

575
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
My own husband loves those gory things

576
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He watches those compilations on YouTube

577
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I should watch them again though

578
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The lore behind it is kind of great

579
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Have fun

580
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think they're gross

581
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The overreaching thing about it

582
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Is that it's a matter of the mental fortitude

583
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Of the person who is indulging in the genre

584
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's a different thing if it's set as

585
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I think it's when you get into the specifics of it

586
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You know that

587
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
First of all serial killers in the United States

588
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Are actually a very very small small like

589
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
3% of mass murders are considered serial killings

590
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
If you look at it

591
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know

592
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So you're not

593
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You're going to be really unlikely to have

594
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That level of psychotic going around killing people

595
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Just saying

596
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You know

597
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Whereas with a mass shooting

598
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
At least in America

599
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You are more likely to see something like that happening

600
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
As opposed to a serial killer

601
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You know as opposed to

602
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You know

603
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And yeah both of them are fictionalized accounts

604
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But the other one is

605
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
A lot more in

606
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
An influenceable realm

607
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Does that make sense?

608
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah

609
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Especially when it's picking a very specific type of issue

610
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Where it is a white supremacist

611
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Which right now our political environment

612
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Is absolutely encouraging of that type of mind state

613
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And secondly

614
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Secondly

615
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Where we live in a place where

616
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Weapons like that are super easy to obtain

617
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And people can televise their murder sprees

618
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This

619
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's getting when it hits too close to reality

620
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That is when you know that it's an influenceable item

621
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Because it is likely to happen

622
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It has happened

623
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And it will happen

624
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Whereas you're probably not going to get somebody

625
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You know

626
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
On an intercom

627
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You know telling people to cut your leg off

628
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's just not really going to happen

629
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Unless you pay money to do an escape room in L.A.

630
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Or where is that place?

631
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Vegas

632
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I always see ads for it

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Like that is the number one thing I do not want to do in my life

634
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Is it a saw?

635
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's a saw themed escape room

636
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But that one's not actually going to still cut your leg off

637
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
No but they'll pretend

638
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't even like to pretend

639
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
When it comes to that

640
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't even like to pretend

641
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I wouldn't play

642
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Remember when they did the video games

643
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And they were showing them at E3

644
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I wouldn't even play the games

645
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I was like I don't need to be a part of it

646
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
There's 5,000 other games here at E3

647
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't need to play that one

648
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Right?

649
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Anyway

650
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'll be perfectly honest

651
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I mean the things

652
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm not the biggest advocate of any censorship at all

653
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah

654
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But that would be something that I would absolutely censor

655
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Because as far as the terms of I think obscenity laws

656
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It would number one be something that would be considered a non-artistic work

657
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
They say it's satire

658
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But it really strikes too close of a nerve for it to even

659
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I think they're just using satire as a way to protect themselves

660
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
When truly it's not

661
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
That would be one thing I would be in favor of

662
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I mean honestly I would also like to see weapons banned as well

663
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Funny that Australia had one big mass murder

664
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And it was gone

665
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
New Zealand

666
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Big mass murder

667
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Now it's gone

668
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I have to be honest

669
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I think it's okay to say I'm not sure how I feel about this right now

670
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because I think that if we are to say that video games are truly art

671
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
There should be a way to put this in a museum and say

672
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Wow what a disgusting reflection of a disgusting place society was at in the year 2019

673
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And so our kids can look back on that and go wow

674
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I hope we don't make these same mistakes

675
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't know there's a part of me that sort of thinks that

676
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But I don't know

677
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I look at preserving the code for it but still not making it publicly accessible

678
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You know just like I believe that civil war items belong in a museum

679
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But I don't think we should have fucking statues everywhere to the losers

680
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And guess what southern girls saying this

681
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh confederacy lost

682
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Get over it

683
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The Nazis lost

684
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Get the fuck over it

685
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I do believe that the memorabilia should be allowed in museums lest we forget

686
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
As well because there are people out there and you know this

687
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That will say oh that didn't happen right

688
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
There's people out there say that didn't happen

689
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So by putting it in a museum it's like it's proof that no it did

690
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And it better not happen again

691
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Anyway

692
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Anyway long long discussion

693
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But beyond that but I'm gonna leave it at that

694
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I would really be curious what you guys think

695
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I hope our chat room is lighting up because I can go read it

696
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Also you can always email us participate at orangeontreaty.com

697
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You can also comment on our episodes as we post them at vognetwork.com

698
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So I think that was everything Dark Sakura had for the news

699
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We're gonna go over to Loki and myself

700
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
However I do want to take a quick tangent

701
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I know it's a little further down on the list there

702
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But we actually have waiting on the phone I believe

703
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
YYR is joining us via discord

704
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Are you there?

705
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Rob this isn't fair

706
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What isn't fair?

707
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
How can I possibly follow a deep impactful discussion about white supremacy

708
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Serial killers, weapons, and the delicate balance of free speech

709
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Versus the well deserved condemnation of hate speech

710
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
With bungee ferret tossing of course

711
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah about that

712
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Sometimes video games are distractions from the horrors of the real world

713
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And video games can be fun and frivolous

714
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And why you've made some very fun and frivolous games yourself

715
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I've done my best

716
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So how have you been?

717
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I know we've talked a little bit on the show

718
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You have become a father within the past year and a half-ish right?

719
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That's right

720
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So I know understandably that's been monopolizing a little bit of your time

721
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Oh absolutely

722
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Have you been able to dedicate any time to taking a look at the old game library

723
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And seeing what fantasy game you want to make come true next?

724
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Actually over the last few months I've decided to spend some time actually playing games

725
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
More specifically one game

726
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I actually spent a lot of time with Forza Horizon 4

727
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Good choice though, good choice that's a good one

728
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But it's like every week they put up a new playlist with all these different activities to complete

729
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And some of them are multiplayer challenges that have you playing games against other teams

730
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Team games against computer drivatars

731
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And just all kinds of fun things to do

732
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Games is a service yo

733
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Well except that this service didn't cost any extra money

734
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And there's no like fake currency to waste money on

735
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And heck the thing is available on Game Pass now

736
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So anyone can try it

737
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But of course you know that was time

738
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And so I actually didn't get a lot done over the last few months

739
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So I do very much apologize to anybody who was waiting for the new sharpshooter that I mentioned

740
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Which is like 90% done

741
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It just needs a few more things and then it's ready to release

742
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah but you know that last 10% is the hardest part

743
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I've said the same myself

744
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I know that's who I stole it from you or Bobby one of the two or both

745
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Or both

746
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And the new BFT that's definitely delayed to I have no idea when next year

747
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But I actually have some fairly exciting news that I want to share

748
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Okay and you know what I treat your games like any other

749
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
If the delay is to serve to make the game a great product at the end of the day

750
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Then a delay is worth it so I'm going to applaud YYR for delaying his games

751
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And not rushing them

752
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's all applaud hello let's celebrate that

753
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Woohoo

754
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So this is a short story about magfest actually

755
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh it sounds like you want to tell a story too don't you

756
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Aw hey your child and my cat should have a show

757
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Well they both have a limited vocabulary so I'm not sure what the final entertainment value would be

758
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh you want to grab the microphone that's a very good idea except it's not really

759
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Thank you for your input darling

760
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Alright now go put her in kitty jail

761
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
She's playing with her pom pom balls

762
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Some of which are shiny

763
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Anyway yes so magfest 2018 which was actually about two years ago

764
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I put super multitasking in to the showcase or attempted to

765
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It was not accepted but what they have there is something called the quick play table

766
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And if your game doesn't get a full slot you're encouraged our spot at the quick play table

767
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And you can do it multiple times throughout the weekend and you can show your game there

768
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And you know for anyone who wants to come up to the table and play

769
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So two years ago I was lucky enough to get a room in the Gaylord right in the same hotel as magfest

770
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And so I had my equipment with me so I said well you know what why not

771
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So I showed it I took the last slot on I think Friday initially

772
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I asked the staff who were stuck there for 24 hours because they have to monitor everything

773
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So if I have the last slot of the day can I just leave my stuff here overnight

774
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And they said well as long as you get it out before the first slot the following morning sure

775
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And I said okay and I left my stuff there the whole night and set an alarm so I would be down early in the morning

776
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And sure enough when I got back I found that the staff had been enjoying the heck out of the game

777
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
For a good amount of time overnight so I ran it overnight Saturday night too

778
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And then I discover when I get back that there's like a nine minute record some like on just seemingly impossibly high

779
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Survival record on there and I'm like what happened and they said oh yeah we played as a team we gathered around the controller

780
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So they really enjoyed this game they went so far as to cheat at your game to feel better about themselves

781
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So anyway so as far as the selection process you're encouraged to you know not submit the same game twice

782
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Or at the least not submit the same game in the same state twice because that counts against you in the submission process

783
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But nonetheless I haven't shown it a convention in a while I haven't this year I didn't last year

784
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So I'm like you know maybe I'll just submit super multitasking for the heck of it for the 2020 showcase

785
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But I did so with the promise that there would be some new features coming if it was accepted

786
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And well I don't know what happened but I got accepted to the 2020 MAGFest showcase

787
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Good for you congratulations pretty cool

788
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Thank you so now of course I have to deliver on my promises so I am ready to announce

789
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And mind you I always intended on releasing three versions of multitasking in total

790
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The first was the 2016 XBL-IG version which is now gone

791
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The second was super multitasking on Steam which came out early 2018

792
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And the final version which I was originally going to call the very unoriginal ultra multitasking

793
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Is now going to be known as super multitasking versus ultimate

794
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I love it you're going the Street Fighter route you got to put turbo in there at something maybe there'll be an unlock code

795
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
For matching service featuring true kiss destination

796
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yes featuring dreams come true also

797
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But no the the reason I'm calling it versus ultimate is because of well both words have significance

798
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Not only is it going to be the ultimate challenge but well there's the surprise that I'll save for a couple minutes from now

799
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The first major change is the original game had four slots the screen was split into four slots

800
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You had your left stick your right stick your face buttons and then everything on the top of the controller

801
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,000
For people who hate themselves we can now split the top of the controller into individual slots for the triggers and the bumpers

802
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And now you have five slots

803
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You're a madman

804
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So now so if I'm if I'm I'm hearing this right so for those that have played super multitasking

805
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I wish I'd had time today to grab b-roll but check it out on Steam I guess or check out the YouTube trailer

806
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Just look up super multitasking right now it's four games going on at once this new version will allow you to do five because four wasn't enough

807
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
First for some people obviously

808
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Of course though if you're just getting your feet wet if you're just starting to play you can also do the opposite and lower it down to three slots

809
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Completely eliminating the bumpers and the triggers and making things maybe a little easier

810
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Although the challenge mode is going to challenge your thought that maybe three slots is definitely easier

811
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'll find a way to test that theory

812
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Have you considered a one slot mode for Bobby Blackwolf?

813
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Well that would defeat the purpose of the game wouldn't it?

814
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I guess it would

815
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's just tasking

816
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Bobby Blackwolf gets to play tasking

817
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Solo tasking

818
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Solo tasking

819
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Maybe as a joke that's actually kind of funny

820
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I would die if you put his name on it like I don't know if legally you can

821
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But I would die if you called it Bobby Blackwolf's tasking

822
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Well if he gives it his consent then I don't see why not

823
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Alright Bobby you know who to tweet alright

824
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So the challenge mode is going to be greatly expanded

825
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Before it was just a single list of 42 challenges

826
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Now we're going to separate it into multiple courses

827
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
They'll be the original 42 challenges and super multitasking

828
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That'll be one course

829
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But now they're going to be multiple like they'll be a three slot course

830
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
A five slot course

831
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
A hell course which is just going to be the worst thing ever

832
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Like there's going to be a lot of new missions and they're also going to be able to be more complex

833
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Let's put that quote on the back of the box by the creator quote the worst thing ever

834
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's actually yeah you know maybe I'll put that on the Steam page

835
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay great

836
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But yeah right now the challenge is they're set up a certain way

837
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
At most one game plays in each slot and then when that game ends that's it

838
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We're going to throw that out the window and allow more complex missions that have

839
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
A second game starting in a slot once the first one is finished or more

840
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So they're not just going to all last 20 seconds like before

841
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They're going to be some that are deeper dives so please look forward to that

842
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh boy

843
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Speedrunners will have more ways to impact or make mistakes

844
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So that's I want to add some depth

845
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You know some someone might have pointed at the existing game and said well it's fun

846
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But it doesn't really look like there's a whole lot to do. I want to I want to attack that

847
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And then of course there will be new mini games

848
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Some of them will be difficult versions of the games that are there now

849
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Like an alternate version of the paddle the pong game where you have to control paddles on both the top and bottom

850
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Rather than just on the bottom. So this way you can miss the ball in two different ways. Oh my god

851
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, this is gonna be wow. This is really gonna be a mindfuck, but I'm excited

852
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And then some some mini games are gonna be completely new

853
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm really gonna try to find a good way to make an intuitive mini game where you're typing a text on a cell phone

854
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Just so that I can pair that with the driving game

855
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That's great. You could take the swipe thing

856
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You know, I mean you don't have to if you just with the yes something like controller

857
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You could just do like a swipe thing. It doesn't have to actually hit each letter. Oh, I love that

858
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You're gonna pair the pair texting game with the driving game. It has to be done. I love it

859
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It just has to be done and then finally the last major addition that I'm gonna be making to this game is a two-player

860
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
versus mode

861
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Now it's something that people were asking for and we finally figured out a good way to do this

862
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So basically what's gonna happen is they're gonna be variants of the mini games

863
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Like let's take the pong game again as an example

864
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So instead of just being a paddle and hitting the ball against a wall

865
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
There's gonna be a red paddle on the bottom and a blue paddle on top

866
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You're gonna be, you know, controlling whichever color you are and the ball is gonna slowly get faster

867
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And whoever messes up first the opponent gets a point

868
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
There's gonna be the tennis game and you know what you've probably seen

869
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Have you seen the the battle mode and pop in music?

870
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's been a long time but yes, I do vaguely remember, yeah

871
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Some versions, I don't know if it's all versions but at least some versions of pop in music

872
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
They've had it where, you know, you're playing the game, you're playing the game against an opponent

873
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The main game and then all of a sudden this mini game appears along the bottom of the screen

874
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Where you're hitting a ball back and forth

875
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And you have to take one of your buttons, you know, the extra button that you're not using

876
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Because each player only has to hit three lanes in pop in music's battle mode

877
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And then you're hitting that button to hit the ball back and forth

878
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And whoever misses, they get some terrible mod applied to their lanes for a few seconds

879
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Which causes them to completely mess up

880
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So it's gonna be like that but, you know, four of them on the screen at once

881
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay, I'm into it, this sounds really, you know what's also interesting about this

882
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't know if you've thought about this YY or maybe you have

883
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But you know Steam not that long ago or I think they just announced they're gonna do that whole thing

884
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Where you can do any game multiplayer over the internet kind of akin to PlayStation 4's SharePlay

885
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So theoretically, I imagine you're building this with same room in mind

886
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Especially with some of the specific timings that go into this

887
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But technically I could play this with a friend of mine online

888
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I just hope you've got a good connection

889
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, I was gonna say it might not be

890
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I can understand why maybe you're not gonna emphasize that

891
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because the timing probably has to be very specific on that

892
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And it is still kind of a beta-e early feature

893
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Well, I mean it's gonna be meant for local play

894
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
If there's any lag, one player's gonna be at a big disadvantage

895
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
True

896
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But yeah, I'm really hoping that people have a really great time with this

897
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You know, you'll set it to play to five or whatever

898
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And then whoever gets five points first wins the game

899
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And then you do it again

900
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And then you purse a little and then you do it again

901
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And then you throw your controller and maybe do it again if it still works

902
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Well I'm really excited for you YYR

903
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And you know I love the concept behind multitasking, super multitasking

904
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And now super multitasking versus ultimate, right?

905
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, I have no idea when this will be done

906
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
However, what I can tell you is that at the least the versus mode

907
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The five slot mode's already in the game

908
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And the versus mode I'm working on now

909
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You'll be able to try all these new features at MAGFest if you are there

910
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Sadly, I am not there this year

911
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I may be able to return in 2021

912
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
As you know, and I say you as in the listeners and everybody

913
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I started a new job

914
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
New job

915
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
A little quick for me to make MAGFest happen

916
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But the nice thing is with this new job

917
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I am better taken care of when it comes to time away to go to nerd expos

918
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Than I maybe was before

919
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So things like MAGFest and some of the things I've had to cut back on the past couple of years

920
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Are now again a possibility

921
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So nothing's off the table when we move into

922
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
As we get it past, probably once we get into summer next year

923
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I may show up at more places

924
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So MAGFest 2021 is something that's not out of the picture

925
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That's exciting. Maybe VOD could have a greater presence there on the whole

926
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I will have to talk to Mr. Blackwolf about that because I would really love that

927
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Nice

928
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And I mean the last thing

929
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I don't know yet if I'm allowed to sell anything at the booth

930
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I would love to be able to sell the game there because it's out

931
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But if I am able to sell stuff there and you mention OLR

932
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I will give you my best possible deal

933
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh and you know I totally didn't mention this

934
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
If you already own Super Multitasking

935
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
By the time these features are released

936
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You will be upgraded to Super Multitasking vs. Ultimate for free

937
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look at you, good guy YYR

938
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
How about that?

939
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Free upgrade, congratulations

940
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That is great

941
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
For everybody else the price is going to go up a few dollars

942
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
If you haven't bought it yet

943
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So maybe that's a hot tip for OLR listeners

944
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Hot tip, get it now

945
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Before he jacks up the price

946
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Because I mean this is my best concept

947
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
There's going to be a lot of effort put into this

948
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Into these upgrades too

949
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So I really want to deliver the best possible package with this game

950
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And then possibly look to port it to consoles afterward

951
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Well I am wishing you all the luck in the world while you are

952
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And I think one reason why this game does well at expos

953
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I think it's one thing to talk about the game and do this

954
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
People do not really understand how addictive

955
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Because it is a game you play in very short bursts

956
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Kind of like a warrior type of thing

957
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But it can also because of that be very subject to the whole

958
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Just one more turn type of thing

959
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Like I've got to break the two minute mark

960
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It turns into that sort of addicting thing really fast

961
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And I think once people get their hands on it

962
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
They really kind of realize like oh this is addicting

963
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
This is very addicting

964
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And so the fact that you are making it bigger, badder and better

965
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And maybe simpler for Bobby Black Wolf

966
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Is very exciting

967
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Thank you

968
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That's great, well congratulations OLR

969
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I mean certainly congratulations on getting the spot back at MAGFest

970
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I hope we get pictures and video and all that good stuff

971
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And I hope it goes so well that you come back in 2021

972
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
With your other projects that you're working on

973
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm really hoping to

974
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I'm really hoping that once this is done

975
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I can actually start porting the new platforms

976
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And creating a couple of new IPs that I have already planned out

977
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's like there's so much that's just waiting on me

978
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Finishing up all these existing projects

979
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I've got way too many

980
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Well at least you've finished several games

981
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Unlike some people I know

982
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Congratulations

983
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I haven't forgotten about Vecturds

984
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Appreciate it, appreciate it

985
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That makes me happy

986
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It warms the cold dark recesses of my shriveled heart

987
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Alright

988
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
YYR I am going to let you go for now

989
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But thank you so much and best of luck to you

990
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And I can't wait to hear how MAGFest goes in a couple months for you

991
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I can't either

992
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Take care my friend

993
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Thank you as always for trusting OLR

994
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
If there's one game maker that'll break the news here on OLR

995
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's YYR, we appreciate it

996
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Hey

997
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
You have me as an exclusive

998
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Even if the major sites are looking to get me on

999
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The biggest podcasts in the world

1000
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'll be like nope, OLR gets me first

1001
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That warms my cold black heart

1002
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Big hug for you my friend

1003
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Now I have to go get famous

1004
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Alright, take care my friend

1005
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Now get to programming

1006
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Alright, see you later

1007
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I will

1008
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Alright, bye

1009
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Bye

1010
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Always good to hear from our pal YYR

1011
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I love that he's kind of like reinvigorating

1012
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I guess if you will super multitasking

1013
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because I really do think like it's the type of game that

1014
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm really surprised kind of didn't go viral the first time around

1015
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But it's sometimes you just got to catch that spark

1016
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You know what I mean?

1017
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So having the additional visibility at MAGFest

1018
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And this time around he's going to be able to say

1019
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Not like it's coming soon

1020
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Or oh he's going to be able to say

1021
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh you can buy it right now

1022
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Like right here

1023
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And that I think is really going to help him out

1024
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
For sure

1025
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah because I was there I think the year before

1026
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
When he first showed the game

1027
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And so he could only say

1028
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Can you upvote me on Greenlight

1029
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Can you upvote me

1030
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But now that he actually has this

1031
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You can buy this game you're playing right here

1032
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Or at least even if the versus ultimate isn't out at that point

1033
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
At least you can still play the basic version

1034
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
This game can be yours if the price is right

1035
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That's right, exactly right

1036
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Exactly right

1037
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So wishing YYR all the success out there

1038
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And again if you want to check out Super Multitasking

1039
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
If you're newer to OLR

1040
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Because we were talking ears off about this game

1041
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
When it first came out

1042
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It is available on Steam

1043
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
The Super Multitasking he's referencing

1044
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You can play it on Steam right now

1045
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So go check it out in the Steam store

1046
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
There's no Epic or Origin

1047
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Or any of those GOG wars going on

1048
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It is only on Steam

1049
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Because I know he got there through the Greenlight process

1050
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Before they pulled it

1051
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
They don't have Greenlight anymore right?

1052
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
No they don't

1053
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
They just throw your crap up there

1054
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Throw whatever crap you want up there

1055
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay let's get back into some news

1056
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So we had taken care of the stories Dark Soccer was going to talk about

1057
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Although I do have some kind of unrelated news

1058
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Alright sure why not

1059
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Kathy Griffin was sainted by the San Francisco Sisters

1060
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh I didn't know that was a procedure that you could do

1061
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Did she have a show there tonight?

1062
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I don't know but she just was very recently sainted

1063
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
She had a show there coming up

1064
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And I wanted to go but I couldn't

1065
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I was like oh it's the same day as something else

1066
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But anyway

1067
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So she is now Saint Kathy of the acerbic profundity

1068
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Herder of Hussies, defender of D-listers

1069
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And probably not a member of ISIS

1070
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Oh probably not

1071
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Anyway back to gaming headlines

1072
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Loki

1073
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about Smash Brothers

1074
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So there's a new version coming out soon

1075
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And there's a brand new update

1076
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
On Intended Direct that's coming

1077
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So we have Ultimate

1078
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Which will have happened by the time people hear this

1079
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yes it would have happened already

1080
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And as you probably have now heard

1081
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
There's no new announcement

1082
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Sorry it's just talking about Terry

1083
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Well they might be playing Terry Bogard

1084
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I mean aren't we anticipating that Terry Bogard will be unlocked after the direct problem

1085
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Most likely

1086
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I don't know

1087
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But they're going to at least show what Terry Bogard does

1088
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So that's kind of cool

1089
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And of course along with the vault

1090
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
The version 6 updates they have

1091
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Of course there's the vault shopper set that's been announced

1092
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's going to be made available to Switch Online members

1093
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And that includes 5000G and 3 classic tickets for no cost

1094
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
If you happen to have Switch Online

1095
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Which if you're playing Smash you probably do anyways

1096
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And then they have fighter adjustments

1097
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And some other features that will be detailed

1098
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm assuming during the direct

1099
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And then along with Smash

1100
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It is now the number one selling fighting game in history

1101
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh wow

1102
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
In one year

1103
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So yeah it sold 15.71 million units as of September 30th

1104
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Wow that's really

1105
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Especially when you consider that they had a version that was on Wii and 3DS

1106
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But I guess maybe you still count those separately

1107
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Or excuse me Wii U and 3DS

1108
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But I guess maybe you still have to count those separately

1109
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I just think it just didn't sell as well

1110
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Because there weren't as many systems out there maybe

1111
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You're right that's probably the case

1112
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah

1113
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Apparently though they're still saying though

1114
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
If you counted

1115
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
If you count the SNES classic mini

1116
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Then Street Fighter 2 would hold the record still with 20 million units

1117
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I was just about to ask

1118
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But wasn't Street Fighter 2 everywhere

1119
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
But we just had the story

1120
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And luckily this time I can remember what we just talked about

1121
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Because it really was just the day before yesterday

1122
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But we just had that story that Dark Soccer was talking about on the last show

1123
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
About how the Switch has now outsold the Super Nintendo

1124
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So even though it feels like

1125
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Oh my god Street Fighter 2 was everywhere

1126
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
On the Super Nintendo when it came out

1127
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Well the reality is

1128
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
There wasn't as many Super Nintendos as there are Switches

1129
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
That's how this has now been able to get out there more

1130
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It's pretty cool

1131
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And then in other news

1132
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Nintendo is saying that they're open to more remakes on the Switch

1133
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So much like we had with Zelda Link's Awakening

1134
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
They're looking at possibly doing some other games in a similar fashion

1135
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And this came out of an investor Q&A

1136
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
They're saying there's a possibility to bring back titles that have been previously developed for handheld consoles

1137
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
However

1138
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Within Nintendo rather than re-releasing past handheld games

1139
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Because of the Nintendo Switch Lite's release

1140
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:25,000
We are discussing more what sorts of new games can we create for an entire Nintendo Switch family

1141
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Within that we also are considering past titles

1142
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But regarding what sorts of discussions are being held in detail

1143
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
There's nothing I can say at the present

1144
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I have a nomination to put forward

1145
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
If we want to bring back classic handheld franchises

1146
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Well we just heard Brain Age

1147
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
We had that about a month ago

1148
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That Brain Age was coming back

1149
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I would put forward Clubhouse Games

1150
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Remember that one on 3DS?

1151
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I thought that game was so cool

1152
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And it didn't really seem to

1153
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It didn't end up being like a Nintendo thing that really stuck around

1154
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
But I'm really surprised

1155
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I would have thought Clubhouse Games would have been a bigger deal

1156
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So it's an old 3DS title

1157
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Maybe it was the regular DS

1158
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It was the regular DS

1159
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Oh god

1160
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So you gotta go way back

1161
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It was the regular DS

1162
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It was like parlor games

1163
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Mini collection of parlor games

1164
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It was really well done

1165
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And with the DS stylus

1166
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And that you could do things that were pretty cool

1167
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So we haven't really talked about Minecraft Earth recently

1168
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But I think they're just about the release over here at some point

1169
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
They just, as of October 31st

1170
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Released in South Korea, Canada and the Philippines

1171
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Just today, the UK

1172
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So we're getting bigger territories

1173
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Are these the full releases or just betas?

1174
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Full release

1175
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Oh shoot, okay

1176
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So we're, I mean they've been releasing all sorts of territories

1177
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Australia's had it for a little bit

1178
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So they're getting bigger, bigger territories

1179
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I mean the UK is pretty big

1180
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So maybe soon?

1181
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah, maybe

1182
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
It looks like weekly has been what they've been putting that stuff on

1183
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Again, by the time you guys hear this, it might be a thing

1184
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah, so that'd be pretty cool

1185
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And last but not least

1186
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
There's rumors that Microsoft may be purchasing, or set to purchase

1187
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
The developers of Yooka-Laylee

1188
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Oh, that would make sense

1189
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah, interesting

1190
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Like, who's the, like how, on a rumor scale of 1 to 10

1191
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
They're saying that there's, you know

1192
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
There's the Xbox XO 19 celebration

1193
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That takes place in London on November 14th

1194
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That would be a good place to announce something like that

1195
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Alright, so keep your eye on that one

1196
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah

1197
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Alright, interesting

1198
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I have a few headlines for you guys

1199
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Actually, a lot of these have to do with like other, like streaming updates

1200
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And streaming news

1201
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
YouTube being one of them

1202
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Of course, YouTube is a streaming platform as well

1203
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
If you weren't already aware

1204
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
YouTube is now rolling out something

1205
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You know, because like on Twitch and Mixer

1206
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
We just talked in the last episode about subscriptions on Mixer

1207
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You know, so how is YouTube trying to get a little bit more into the monetization game

1208
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Allowing creators to make a little more coin

1209
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Subscriptions are a thing on YouTube as well

1210
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And I guess they have like super chat

1211
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Which means you get a comment that's pinned at the top of a chat

1212
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Kind of like, I guess it'd be similar to like a highlighted message

1213
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Which is the, you could

1214
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You probably noticed it's there on VoG network

1215
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Like, when we heard it open

1216
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Bobby and I were just kind of like

1217
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah, might as well just open and see what happens

1218
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It's not something you really, it's like the more you watch

1219
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The more little virtual coins you get

1220
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah, I saw that

1221
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's Mixer's biddies

1222
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Or no, not biddies

1223
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
What do they call them on Mixer?

1224
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Sparks

1225
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's the Sparks from Mixer

1226
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Twitch kind of has their own system of that now

1227
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So we just kind of turned it on

1228
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But we haven't really, really given it thought

1229
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
On how to best use it

1230
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But I have noticed people have started highlighting their messages

1231
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So this is kind of a similar thing you can do on YouTube

1232
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Well now another thing you're going to be able to do

1233
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Is animated stickers

1234
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So it's a little different from emojis

1235
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Because I guess they're big

1236
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
They're like super stickers

1237
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And they've rolled them out to creators in over 60 countries

1238
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
When you are doing streams or video premieres

1239
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
You can buy a sticker

1240
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And drop it in the chat

1241
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And a streamer will get a cut of that sticker

1242
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
A creator can moderate the super stickers

1243
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
There are eight sticker packs

1244
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Five of which are animated

1245
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And so there will be different packs in different languages

1246
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Like English, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese

1247
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And you have to have super chats enabled on your stream

1248
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
To be able to enable super stickers

1249
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Because YouTube has the various criterias that you can monetize

1250
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And all that stuff, different levels

1251
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So kind of interesting but I've got to admit

1252
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Stickers? I don't know

1253
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I mean if you're trying to get noticed by a big YouTube streamer

1254
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Maybe, I don't know

1255
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
But ok, I mean they've got to think of ways to monetize

1256
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I've got to admit, one reason why I think Twitch is a great platform

1257
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Is because it's really easy to monetize on Twitch

1258
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It used to be easy to monetize on YouTube

1259
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But it no longer is

1260
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So it's pretty easy to monetize on Twitch

1261
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And so that's why I think a lot of people kind of go that way

1262
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Not that you're going to make a fortune broadcasting on Twitch

1263
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I mean we all still have day jobs, hello

1264
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But you know you make a nice amount of money

1265
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
To maybe offset the cost of buying microphones

1266
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And doing a show and all that stuff

1267
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So it's kind of neat

1268
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And mic stands

1269
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That's right and mic stands which yes is in our future

1270
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Because I was actually listening to a recent episode

1271
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And I'm like oh my god every time Dark Soccer I pick up a mic

1272
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You can kind of hear it

1273
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So depending on how you guys listen to the show

1274
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I've been trying not to pick up the mic that much

1275
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I know we are going to address that issue

1276
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's just one of those like you know

1277
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Making it better one step at a time

1278
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But yeah mic stands

1279
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Even if they're like handheld mic stands

1280
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Even if we had like handheld mic stands

1281
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It would not make all the rattling that it does now

1282
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'm doing some investigation

1283
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Okay please do

1284
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Alright speaking of YouTube and all that stuff

1285
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Another Twitch streamer has announced that they are leaving

1286
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But they're going to YouTube this time

1287
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So what we've had two big streamers leave Twitch for Mixer

1288
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And now we have

1289
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Courage, CooRage

1290
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I don't know it's Courage but the R is capitalized

1291
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I don't usually get into the celebrity streamer culture a lot

1292
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So I don't know who these folks are

1293
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Do you?

1294
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Nope no idea

1295
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Well he's a big

1296
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And I'm not trying to shade him I just don't know him

1297
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I don't know her

1298
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But his real name is Jack Dunlop

1299
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But he goes by Courage online

1300
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And he is going to be going exclusively to YouTube

1301
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
He has 2.1 million Twitch followers

1302
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And already 1.9 million subscribers on YouTube

1303
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I think there are a lot of Twitch streamers that kind of double dip on YouTube a little bit

1304
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
By the way go check out our YouTube channel at VOG Network

1305
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So that part's not completely unheard of

1306
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
But yeah now he's going to go over there pretty much exclusively

1307
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So that's going to be very interesting

1308
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And it does

1309
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Folks are saying that YouTube as opposed to Mixer

1310
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Maybe makes a little more sense for this particular streamer

1311
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Because he said he wants to go beyond gaming

1312
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Like he wants to do cooking and ASMR

1313
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Although this could be like tongue and cheek type of announcements

1314
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But maybe he's looking to go a little bit beyond just gaming

1315
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Interesting

1316
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Very interesting because I'm really surprised

1317
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And I got to say this

1318
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I am really surprised at this point

1319
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That Twitch has not tried to take on YouTube a little more

1320
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Like I realize that Twitch is broad in its categories

1321
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
We have the things like competitive eating and ASMR and all that stuff

1322
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But I'm really surprised that they

1323
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That they're almost scaling back on some of the video on demand features

1324
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Like we're losing the live commenting

1325
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
We're losing the premiere stuff

1326
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Like that they're almost scaling back on that

1327
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
When I would have thought that Amazon would have really made it

1328
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Because they own Twitch right

1329
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Amazon would have really made a play to take on YouTube

1330
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And try to meet YouTube in that space

1331
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I'm kind of surprised they haven't done that

1332
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Maybe it's just me

1333
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
But maybe the audience has not shown it's there

1334
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It would be nice to have an alternative for YouTube

1335
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It would be very nice to have an alternative for YouTube

1336
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Maybe Twitch doesn't want to have to

1337
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Or Amazon in general doesn't want to have to police that

1338
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You know there's a lot of the dark side of YouTube

1339
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We've heard a lot about

1340
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And maybe Amazon's just like you know what

1341
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We'd rather not deal with it

1342
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Twitch community's pretty cool

1343
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
They're already not

1344
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
They're already kind of having difficulties policing Twitch stuff as it is

1345
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I guess that's true

1346
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It is getting more and more difficult the bigger and bigger it's getting

1347
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And like you know I know Dark Soccer brought up that really unfortunate shooting incident

1348
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And I don't mean to go to a horrible place

1349
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
But the reality is like I know more recently

1350
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It wasn't that one but there was another one that very recently

1351
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Was streamed on Twitch

1352
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And so you know that's not Twitch's fault per se

1353
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
You know but certainly they don't want to be involved with that shit

1354
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
They don't like having their name put out there

1355
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Next to gross content like that

1356
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
So you know it's going to be interesting

1357
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Anyway a little tangent but just something that kind of surprised me

1358
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
One more article that does not have to do with streaming

1359
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
But it does have to do with movies

1360
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
We're going to bring up Hideo Kojima again

1361
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
By the time you guys hear this

1362
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You will be sick of me

1363
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Death Stranding will be out

1364
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And I'm so curious to see how the

1365
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
We've seen the reviews

1366
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
But now I want to see how the general population takes to that game

1367
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I'm only about a week away from my live hate playthrough

1368
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Of Death Stranding

1369
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And that's going to be the title of the stream

1370
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Hate playing Kojima's latest art school project

1371
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Excited

1372
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Anyway

1373
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But in being interviewed by the BBC about Death Stranding

1374
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Because obviously Hideo Kojima is out there doing the circuit and the press and all that

1375
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Kojima mentioned that Kojima Productions

1376
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The studio he runs

1377
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Is going to venture into filmmaking

1378
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Which I don't know if this is a rumor or what

1379
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But when you hear that Death Stranding has a two hour cut scene at the end of the game

1380
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Maybe not too surprising to hear

1381
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That Kojima is interested in getting into filmmaking

1382
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I thought that was the same as Mel Gursault 4 had a really long cut scene at the end of the game too

1383
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
He's kind of already making films

1384
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But it's interesting

1385
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I mean

1386
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
For all the crap that people are giving Death Stranding for being a walking simulator

1387
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Or whatever, what the game is

1388
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Maybe this is causing people to really think

1389
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
What would Death Stranding be like as a movie?

1390
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Who knows?

1391
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I mean we won't really know until more of us get our hands on the game

1392
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But what's Kojima going to be capable of in a movie space or a more traditional film space?

1393
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
He certainly has plenty of friends in Hollywood to help him make it happen right?

1394
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So it's going to be interesting to see what happens if he were to get into that

1395
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So yeah

1396
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Excited to see if they actually really do go that way in the near future

1397
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Who knows?

1398
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So would Kojima announce a film at E3?

1399
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Or how would that work?

1400
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
He'd probably get his buddy Jeff Keighley to help him out

1401
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I imagine that's how that would work

1402
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Yeah that would be the game awards type of thing

1403
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Yeah right?

1404
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So anyway

1405
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It would depend if his project is based on a game or not

1406
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Can you imagine if they made Metal Gear Solid a more traditional movie?

1407
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
You know?

1408
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
If they just took some of the concepts from Metal Gear Solid and made a 90 minute film out of it

1409
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Could be interesting

1410
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I don't know

1411
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Wasn't that already Metal Gear Solid 4?

1412
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Perhaps

1413
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I think that is on record of having the longest number of

1414
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
The longest length of cutscenes total

1415
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I hate Death Stranding is almost out

1416
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Alright

1417
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Well you know Kojima wanted to go into filmmaking to begin with anyway

1418
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So

1419
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Yeah

1420
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So maybe this is one way

1421
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Maybe he's going through that midlife crisis right now

1422
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Where he's like I gotta do that thing I always wanted to do when I was younger

1423
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And never got around to doing

1424
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And now I have all these holl-

1425
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'm friends with Conan O'Brien I can do what I want

1426
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
No it might sound like I'm shading Hideo Kojima

1427
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
But I'm really not

1428
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I actually think like a movie would be

1429
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I'd watch it

1430
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Hell yeah I would

1431
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Like he's a good storyteller so why not

1432
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It's only 90 minutes maybe 2 hours

1433
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Ok maybe a Kojima movie is going to be like Titanic length

1434
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Like 3 and a half hours

1435
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
But I'd still watch it right

1436
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Alright anyway

1437
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Let's travel around the room

1438
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That's all we have for news

1439
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Again these are early headlines

1440
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Huge news could have broke Thursday or Friday

1441
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Unfortunately the magic of radio is not that strong

1442
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
For us to have heard it in advance

1443
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
But you know we'll talk about

1444
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
If there's anything really big that breaks

1445
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
We will talk about it on our next live episode of OLR

1446
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Which will be next Sunday when we return

1447
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Which by the way is also starting to shoulder up

1448
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
On the big Bamani holiday of 19 November and 20 November

1449
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I believe the show is on the 10th

1450
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Or no excuse me 10th was we're missing

1451
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
17th is when the next show will be

1452
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So we're starting to saddle up against that

1453
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah

1454
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Bamani holiday so anyway

1455
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Alright let's travel around and just catch up with our hosts

1456
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I know it's only a couple days into the week

1457
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
But I don't know if you guys have anything

1458
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Any personal tidbits you want to get out

1459
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Or what kind of video games you have been playing

1460
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
With what little time we've had

1461
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Darsakha I know you were mentioning a little bit of The Sims

1462
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
While you've been recovering

1463
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Yeah I'm still on Sims 4

1464
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That's really about it

1465
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Just because I don't really have much attention span

1466
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
For anything with everything else I've got going on

1467
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And honestly instead of playing Sims 4

1468
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I really should be working on that website

1469
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
And getting an email migration finished

1470
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But I'm still just sore and itchy

1471
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Yeah but even when you're working on a big project like that

1472
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Taking a 30 minute game break can sometimes be

1473
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Sims is not a 30 minute game break

1474
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Fair, fair

1475
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I started playing last night around midnight

1476
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And it was 4 in the morning when I quit

1477
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And the only reason I quit is because the game crashed

1478
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Because I would save the game

1479
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Did you say I played a little bit of Sims?

1480
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That is a little bit

1481
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
That is a little bit of Sims

1482
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Because basically I have to gear myself up for it

1483
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And not make any plans

1484
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Cancel the Friday night plans

1485
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Order a pizza

1486
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Dim the lights

1487
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's Sims night

1488
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Hey that's me and Civilization

1489
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So you know what

1490
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
There's always going to be some game

1491
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Build the pool, remove the stairs

1492
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That doesn't work anymore

1493
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I will find creative ways to make that work dammit

1494
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And actually though

1495
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
With the next household that I'm doing

1496
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I'm actually building the current version

1497
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Of the full house

1498
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Because the full plans

1499
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Yeah but I want to build it with the current design

1500
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
There's actually pictures of it

1501
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's really really cute inside

1502
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Like the actual house in San Francisco

1503
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So not what you see on TV

1504
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Because obviously what you saw on TV is not the actual house

1505
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I mean honestly it's a really gorgeous house

1506
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
But I'm thinking about doing that

1507
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
But I'm going to have it

1508
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm going to have a witch

1509
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
A vampire and a ghost

1510
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Live in the house

1511
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Because I can't have a werewolf

1512
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Like in being human

1513
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So I'm going to try to recreate that

1514
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Thing and see how it lasts

1515
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
If my ghost doesn't want to move off

1516
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Dark Sakura I hate to break this to you

1517
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But Halloween is over

1518
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Halloween

1519
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Is not just a holiday

1520
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
It's a way of life

1521
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Listen this is how you do it

1522
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Okay because I was

1523
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
She is Jack Skellington

1524
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
By the way I know my cheat codes to pick what type of

1525
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Ghost I get and how they died

1526
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Like my kids were talking about the neighbors having their

1527
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Halloween decorations still up

1528
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm like it's fine all they have to do is put Christmas

1529
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Hats on everything or Santa hats

1530
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And then it's Christmas stuff

1531
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
You can just put hats on everything

1532
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And then you can just keep it up all your own

1533
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
They have one of those witches that looks like it's

1534
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Flown into the door those are hilarious

1535
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I never see those

1536
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Just put a Santa hat on that witch

1537
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
They have the feet sticking out of the ground

1538
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Of course of course

1539
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And then they have this weird skeleton like

1540
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Grim reaper thing that's always

1541
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I tell the kids that it's always staring at them

1542
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
And then one time somehow it triggered from

1543
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
20 feet away so that freaked them out

1544
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Good times

1545
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
You could just go eco and just put a real skeleton in your yard

1546
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Right

1547
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Humans are

1548
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Are uh

1549
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
What's the word I'm thinking of

1550
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Biodegradable

1551
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh yeah well you think your garage haunted house

1552
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Is cool Karen? Well at my house we've got

1553
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The bodies exhibited

1554
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Anyway

1555
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Alright moving on

1556
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Loki what about you? What's going on with you?

1557
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I've just been playing more of

1558
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
What the golf?

1559
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And I've like

1560
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
They have the way it works is like they have

1561
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Different labs so it's like different themed

1562
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Courses or whatever they're in there but there's like a

1563
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Ton of levels it's ridiculous and then each

1564
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Level has like a par or

1565
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Like a slightly more challenging level than

1566
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Another challenging level on top of it

1567
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And they have homages to a bunch of stuff

1568
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
There's homages to like Mario

1569
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Brothers um I'm playing through

1570
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
One right now that's an homage to Portal

1571
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Um that was pretty cool and then

1572
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Um

1573
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yeah so I've been just doing lots of that

1574
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I'm probably gonna work some more on my game

1575
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm starting to like

1576
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Feel that like frustration that

1577
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Haven't progressed very far recently

1578
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Because I've been trying to get my

1579
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Respawn stuff to work correctly

1580
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And it

1581
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Hasn't been because

1582
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
And I don't know why like

1583
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I was trying to focus on doing the most

1584
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Simplest thing possible but

1585
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Because it's sort of modeled after

1586
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Smash TV all the enemies spawn

1587
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Through doors so they have to walk through a

1588
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Door and trying to program a

1589
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Door to only work at certain times

1590
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
When like say the player is on the other

1591
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Side of the door and I need to open

1592
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
But also not have the player be able to

1593
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Jump back through the door

1594
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It's a pain in the ass

1595
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
So I've been stuck

1596
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
With door logic and stuff

1597
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Trying to get like one way walls

1598
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
To work and stuff and

1599
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
In many creative ways to

1600
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Do that and always finding a way to

1601
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Somehow break it

1602
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So

1603
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I may just say fuck the doors eventually

1604
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And just spawn into the level like

1605
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I don't care anymore just whatever

1606
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I just want this to be done but

1607
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Stay tuned for Loki's second game fuck the doors

1608
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Alright

1609
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
My week obviously I've been

1610
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Preparing for my trip to New York this weekend

1611
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Which I'm very excited about but now I'm like

1612
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I'm not going to be able to do everything

1613
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That we want to do like their text messaging

1614
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Today about everything they want to do I'm like we don't have that kind of time

1615
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And it's like trying to fit in

1616
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
People and stuff too I'm just like oh my gosh

1617
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It's going to be a busy busy weekend but I am

1618
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Looking forward to it

1619
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But early in the week I'm

1620
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Still playing Final Fantasy 14

1621
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It's kind of a thing I get on and regularly do with my friends

1622
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
My Machinist is almost 18

1623
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So I'll finally have a healer, a tank

1624
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And a DPS at 80

1625
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Since my Gunbreaker and my Astrologian are already

1626
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
80 my Machinist will soon be there too

1627
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Which has been a lot of fun to play

1628
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And I'm still continuing on in Bloodstained

1629
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I made quite a bit more progress last night

1630
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I got past the second boss

1631
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Which is funny because for all the difficulty

1632
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
The first boss in that game gave me

1633
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I one shotted the second boss

1634
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It is all about that drill weapon which we talked about last week

1635
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Dark Sakura that Dan

1636
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I guess used a lot too

1637
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
That drill made that second boss cake

1638
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So yeah

1639
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Pro tip get that shard

1640
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
From one of those guys that has the drill as soon as you can

1641
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Because it makes things easier

1642
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Anyway that's really it

1643
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
For my gaming week so far

1644
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So with that let's go to Twitter

1645
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Because we did open up Twitter

1646
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
For your questions

1647
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And we want to get to some of those questions

1648
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
That you guys sent us

1649
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
So let's get to some of these

1650
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So we had some tweets and our first tweet

1651
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
With a question comes from

1652
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Superhulk1999

1653
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Who asked us

1654
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Will the new consoles come with enough

1655
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
SSD hard drive space

1656
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Like at least

1657
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
8 terabytes or more

1658
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And that's signed Mike B

1659
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So thanks for the question Mike B

1660
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
What do you think?

1661
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It seems like when companies release new consoles

1662
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Maybe there isn't always enough storage

1663
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Right away especially for where the generation

1664
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Ends up by the end of its life

1665
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah I don't think there's gonna be

1666
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Maybe I would see one or two terabyte

1667
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Hard drives in these consoles

1668
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I would like more

1669
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Especially when you look at like say

1670
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Red Dead Redemption 2 which just came out on PC

1671
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That's a 121 gigabyte download

1672
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And because everything

1673
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Works perfectly when you download it

1674
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
As they're downloading it

1675
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Or they preloaded it early

1676
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And they go to decrypt it or whatever

1677
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It redownloaded it

1678
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh shit

1679
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Good job

1680
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Game sizes especially

1681
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
They're pushing 4K and everything

1682
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And pushing better graphics

1683
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
That's higher resolution textures

1684
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
More uncompressed stuff

1685
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
That's gonna fill up really fast

1686
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah

1687
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So I think what their solution's

1688
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Gonna be is probably allowing

1689
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
External storage again

1690
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And so they'll be on you to buy an external

1691
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
5 terabyte drive or something like that

1692
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
To load your shit on

1693
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But that's

1694
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
That's unfortunate and in order to keep the cost down

1695
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
That's what they're gonna have to do is cut back on storage

1696
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So I would hope that one to two terabytes

1697
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Would be the kind of norm but

1698
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah I would think as game companies

1699
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Are pushing more and more and more to digital

1700
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You know and the digital downloads and so forth

1701
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
They've gotta have more space

1702
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But I think these companies could get away with a

1703
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
1 or 2 terabyte drive a solid state drive

1704
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Well but solid state drives

1705
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Don't really go that high

1706
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Like you know the tweeter says 8 terabytes

1707
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
But the simple mac

1708
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Mac to fatter?

1709
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Fact of the matter

1710
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Yes the fact of the matter is

1711
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
The solid state drives are usually much

1712
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Smaller than your like you know

1713
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I have a 3 terabyte drive in my computer

1714
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But it's not solid state

1715
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Cause most solid state drives you can buy at Fry's

1716
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Like they don't go much past like 500 gigs

1717
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Maybe you can get a terabyte

1718
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah but maybe they can like

1719
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Decide how they want to store that data

1720
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
So that they can put the stuff that they need

1721
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Faster on the solid state drive

1722
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
And you know maybe cash in the other stuff

1723
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
From like your larger drive

1724
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I don't know

1725
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I think it would be more important for

1726
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Expansion to be easy

1727
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Like you know for all the shit that Nintendo

1728
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Is not having any room on its console

1729
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
At least it's very easy to buy a new card

1730
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And expand it right

1731
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
You know in the Playstation 4 you can expand

1732
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
You know fairly easy and so forth so

1733
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I think as long as you can expand on whatever they give you

1734
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Relatively easy it'll be less of a problem

1735
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
One other thing to consider

1736
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I think is that gaming is going

1737
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
To go more and more into the cloud

1738
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Right cause that's a big thing as we talk about

1739
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Project xCloud we know Sony

1740
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Has been getting some interesting partners

1741
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
When it comes to cloud gaming

1742
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Well maybe that space

1743
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Won't be as important as we think

1744
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Because there will be stuff

1745
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
In the cloud which is just

1746
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
On the internet but you know

1747
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
That's the term everybody uses in the cloud

1748
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So it'll be interesting to see maybe the effects that that

1749
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Has on space

1750
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
But I will bet the first printing

1751
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Will not be nearly enough so let's just

1752
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Hope that they allow it to be expandable

1753
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So we have a foodie question next

1754
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So this is from Redertainment

1755
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Who tweets orange lounge

1756
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Foodio I'm looking for

1757
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Recipe app suggestions

1758
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
IOS preferably free

1759
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
No dietary restrictions

1760
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I already have the joy of cooking

1761
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
How to cook everything and

1762
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Mia lime

1763
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
So I haven't a clue

1764
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
There was one called Pepper for a while

1765
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But I don't know that it was free

1766
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
He said no website it's all

1767
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
App right? Yeah he just said app

1768
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well I mean cause you can go

1769
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
On websites like I have Epicurious

1770
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And Bon Appetit

1771
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And all of that

1772
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Yeah and technically if I'm not mistaken

1773
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
In Safari you just click a couple buttons

1774
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And you can turn any website into like an app

1775
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Button basically so it runs like

1776
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It is an app kinda

1777
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Well and on top of that I'm actually

1778
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
In the middle of compiling all of the recipes

1779
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
That I like to use

1780
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
As a PDF

1781
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
To put into Apple Books just for myself

1782
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But I just did a quick search

1783
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
On the app store right now there's NYT

1784
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Which is New York Times recipes

1785
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
There's Yummly, Tasty

1786
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Which I actually use Tasty that's the one

1787
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Done by Buzzfeed

1788
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I was gonna say I think Redotainment is looking for suggestions

1789
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And so but you've used

1790
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I've used them before

1791
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Cause I gotta admit

1792
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Epicurious has an app

1793
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I'm terrible with recipes

1794
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Like Alan is truly the one

1795
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Who cooks between the two of us

1796
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I know how to do chicken on the form and grill

1797
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But that's

1798
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
The extent of my knowledge

1799
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I would

1800
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So Yummly is good but their

1801
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Website is pretty terrible

1802
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Their videos because they've

1803
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Done some very dangerous things

1804
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
On their videos before

1805
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But I mean Epicurious I've always been really good

1806
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I made my first cake with an Epicurious recipe

1807
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I did it from their website

1808
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
But apparently they have an app

1809
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And I think I'm gonna get the New York Times

1810
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Cooking one myself

1811
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Cause that one looks pretty good

1812
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I do a lot of baking lately

1813
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Alright

1814
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Getting into another tweet

1815
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
This one isn't awkward at all

1816
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
This comes to us from

1817
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You all know who that is right?

1818
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
That is GrandpaWarcraft

1819
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Or Captain Matt from the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast

1820
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Who tweeted us

1821
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
This lovely gem of a question

1822
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Why did you dump GrandpaWarcraft

1823
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
In 2009?

1824
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
He would've made a good boyfriend

1825
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Now

1826
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It's a completely awkward thing to tweet me

1827
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
When you know I'm married

1828
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And I know he's saying that only tongue in cheek

1829
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I wouldn't have read that on air

1830
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
He just wasn't being a sass master

1831
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Because that's what he does

1832
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
He drinks and he sasses

1833
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Sometimes you know

1834
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
This has happened to everybody

1835
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
At some point in their life

1836
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
They go out on a date and they go

1837
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
This person is going to be a great friend

1838
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Right?

1839
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And we are great friends

1840
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
We did a podcast together for so many years

1841
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I live in his old house

1842
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And the reality is

1843
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
If you had been my boyfriend

1844
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You'd be dead by now

1845
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Alright

1846
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Womp womp

1847
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I had to give him an answer

1848
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
He'd enjoy

1849
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
We're going on the

1850
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Star Trek Cruise together very soon

1851
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
So I hope

1852
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I'm going to print out this tweet and frame it

1853
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And hang it in my cabin

1854
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Matt

1855
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And just remember it's 7 days and nights

1856
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
At sea with me and my husband

1857
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Alright

1858
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Moving on

1859
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Girl

1860
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Look

1861
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
If he's going to be awkward

1862
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I'm going to make it more awkward

1863
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Awkwarder?

1864
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Alright one more question

1865
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Coming from Flaco Jones

1866
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
A more serious topic

1867
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Yeah come break our show again Flaco we miss you

1868
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Alright

1869
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Flaco Jones asks

1870
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Not sure if you got into this last week

1871
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But I noticed a lot of debate

1872
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
About Death Stranding

1873
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Being good but not fun

1874
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
In some reviewers opinions

1875
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
My question is

1876
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Do games have to be fun?

1877
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
If all games have to be fun

1878
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
No matter what

1879
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Doesn't that prove that games

1880
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Can't be art

1881
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
There's a difference between fun

1882
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And enjoyment

1883
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
You know? Like you can

1884
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Enjoy something but not exactly

1885
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Have the most amount of fun looking at it

1886
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Right? Like

1887
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Like looking at

1888
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
A painting. Like looking at Bosch

1889
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
One of my favorite ever paintings

1890
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
In the universe is

1891
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch

1892
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It's the same one that's got

1893
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Like the person

1894
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
With the chicken head

1895
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
And the ass bent over with people coming out of it

1896
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And the egg and all the weirdness

1897
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Because Bosch was an interesting fella

1898
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
But I wouldn't say

1899
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
That's a fun painting

1900
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
It's not like something that's comfortable to look at

1901
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
But it's enjoyable

1902
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Makes sense?

1903
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Yeah and I would say too that like

1904
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
You know sometimes it's not necessarily about fun

1905
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I mean yes

1906
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Video games should be fun

1907
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
It should be something that makes you feel good

1908
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But at the same time

1909
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I think it's more about emotion

1910
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Because art invokes emotion

1911
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Art invokes response right?

1912
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
The biggest insult an artist

1913
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Can see with their work

1914
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Is for it to evoke nothing

1915
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
But I would say like movies

1916
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
We compare games to movies a lot

1917
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And going out to the movies

1918
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Is fun right?

1919
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But then I think about the time I went and saw

1920
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The movie Dancer in the Dark starring

1921
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Dancer in the Dark

1922
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And I cried so hard

1923
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And so much that I was like scream crying

1924
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
At the end of the movie

1925
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And my shirt was like halfway soaked

1926
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I don't know if I would call that experience

1927
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Fun

1928
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But does that mean Dancer in the Dark is not art?

1929
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah

1930
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So I kind of think there's like a similar sort of thing here

1931
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's not necessarily that I went to the movie

1932
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And I realized Dancer in the Dark

1933
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Is a bit of an obscure pick

1934
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
But pick a sad movie that you've seen

1935
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I see the grudge

1936
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Any kind of Japanese horror movie

1937
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
That doesn't necessarily have a happy ending

1938
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Cause like American movies are all about

1939
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Happy endings and shit

1940
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
What about like a serious movie

1941
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Like a Schindler's List

1942
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
A Saving Private Ryan

1943
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You know movies that are

1944
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Kind of about some very serious heavy

1945
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Topics

1946
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
But it's kind of like you get

1947
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And I don't think I would call either of those movies

1948
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Fun

1949
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I mean I go they're bad

1950
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Or I had a bad time or I regret seeing them

1951
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
There's a difference between enjoyment

1952
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
And having fun

1953
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I look at fun as a kind of a positive

1954
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Mirthful sort of thing

1955
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
But to enjoy just means that you get

1956
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Some sort of satisfaction out of it

1957
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Right

1958
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
There's also something to consider

1959
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
This might actually be true of some games

1960
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I say that about Dancer in the Dark

1961
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I don't know if I would watch that movie

1962
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Again

1963
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
There's other movies out there

1964
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I know I'm trying to think of something

1965
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I wouldn't say that Everybody's Gone under the Rapture

1966
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Was fun

1967
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
But it's enjoyable and provocative

1968
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Like and there's certain games where I'm like

1969
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I'm glad I played that

1970
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And I'm really glad I experienced that

1971
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
But I'm probably never going to play that again

1972
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Yeah I don't think I can go play it again

1973
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
You know just

1974
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I had

1975
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I was playing it

1976
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I played it on stream

1977
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I kind of

1978
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Part of me was just I played it privately

1979
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Because I did have just a response

1980
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Where I had to you know once I was off camera

1981
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I was like oh my god

1982
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Oh my god and I had already seen you play it

1983
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
It's a heavy game and again

1984
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I think so many people slept on this game

1985
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Because I got smacked with a walking simulator

1986
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Type of thing

1987
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Maybe that is a great

1988
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Because Death Stranding keeps getting labeled with this

1989
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Walking simulator and all this thing

1990
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Like that was a game where everybody's gone

1991
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And I remember the rapture got that whole thing about

1992
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Where's the game? What are you doing? What's the game?

1993
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
A game

1994
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It's a narrative

1995
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I don't look at it as a game

1996
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I look at it as an interactive narrative

1997
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And honestly those are the kinds of games

1998
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I've personally been getting more into lately

1999
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Are those kinds

2000
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Other than building houses and watching my sims die

2001
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
But I like the ones

2002
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Where you're living the story

2003
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
You're seeing it unfold

2004
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Like To the Moon was another good one

2005
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I think the game

2006
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
In Everybody's Gone to the Rapture was the exploration

2007
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Because you didn't necessarily do things

2008
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
In the same order

2009
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
There is a way you can play that game

2010
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Where you can beat it in like 15 minutes

2011
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
If you just skip everything basically

2012
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
But I don't think you'd get the same thing

2013
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Out of that necessarily

2014
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
It's going and exploring and getting all the little

2015
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
All the little

2016
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Unlocks, bits of story and the memories

2017
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That you unlock

2018
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Are part of the reward system

2019
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
That you earned for doing your effort

2020
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
An example akin to that

2021
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Is something like Lost Odyssey

2022
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
You remember that classic Xbox 360 game

2023
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
That really just was Final Fantasy

2024
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Under a different name pretty much

2025
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
But part of Lost Odyssey was that the main character was immortal

2026
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
It's not a spoiler, it's established in the opening

2027
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Is that the main character is immortal

2028
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And you get these books

2029
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Throughout the story

2030
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
As you're playing a video game

2031
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You sit there and you read a book

2032
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Skyrim and Oblivion do this too

2033
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
There's books in there

2034
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And some people go, meh, reading

2035
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And just throw away the book, right Logie?

2036
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Yes

2037
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
But other people, especially in I think Lost Odyssey

2038
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Because if you actually go

2039
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And you read those books

2040
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's like, holy shit

2041
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Some of those stories

2042
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Have almost a stronger

2043
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Emotional impact than the game

2044
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So isn't it weird

2045
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
That we're talking about an art form

2046
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Embedded in another art form

2047
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Emotional response embedded within another

2048
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Emotional response

2049
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Or what about lore hunters in series

2050
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Like, you know, because

2051
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
When I was playing WoW

2052
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I mean, the biggest thing that I got enjoyment out of

2053
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Was lore hunting

2054
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Was reading the books and seeing the things

2055
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And then, of course, breaking the game with my demon hunter

2056
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And there's some people that will play MMOs

2057
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And I'm sometimes guilty of this

2058
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
They'll just, oh, quest text, meh

2059
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
They skip it, it's like, what am I supposed to do in this quest, right?

2060
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
But you're right, there's a whole rich world

2061
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
In that, if you want to experience that

2062
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Anyway, I think we might be getting a little bit lost

2063
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
From the original question that was asked

2064
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
But I think we are kind of giving some examples

2065
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Is that there's also, like, different

2066
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
There's different ways to have fun

2067
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Yeah

2068
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
And sometimes that exploration

2069
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That sort of is the fun

2070
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And I think Death Stranding, if what I'm hearing about it

2071
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Is true, and again, I'm not going to know this

2072
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Till the next episode when I get to play it for myself

2073
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
There might be a part of Death Stranding

2074
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
That's kind of like everybody's gone to the rapture

2075
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Where it's like, you could just focus on the game part

2076
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Which maybe is not going to be the most

2077
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Maybe it is just going to be walking and tricky balancing

2078
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
But if you allow yourself to get immersed

2079
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
In that story and that universe around it

2080
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Then potentially

2081
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
There might be more fulfillment out of that

2082
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And you might be left with a more rewarding sense out of that

2083
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I'm looking forward to the story aspects of it

2084
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Yeah

2085
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
You know, and

2086
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
That's why, like, for example, Breath of the Wild

2087
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Yeah, very

2088
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
It could look like a very simple story

2089
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
On the surface, but when you're

2090
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
But I like seeing the way the societies are built

2091
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And the language behind it

2092
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And seeing how they've built the world

2093
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
The world that something exists in

2094
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
To me is more of the game than the game

2095
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Isn't it interesting, Dark Sakura

2096
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
How, like, you and I

2097
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Especially, like, in the early

2098
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Reveals of this Death Stranding thing

2099
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
We're both kind of like, what?

2100
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Okay, where's the game, right?

2101
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
We're both kind of, like, sitting here going, come on

2102
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Right? But now it's like,

2103
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Now that we know more and more about it

2104
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
It's kind of like, I have this morbid curiosity

2105
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But I'm more fascinated with this than ever

2106
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Yeah, and I mean

2107
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And you know me, I'm attracted to kind of the

2108
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Offshoot weirdo kind of storylines

2109
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Anyway

2110
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
But it's like, I'll put it this way

2111
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I have learned a whole

2112
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
In-game written language before

2113
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I mean, I've forgotten it since then

2114
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Because this was in high school

2115
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
But I mean, my friends and I used to write

2116
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Each other codes in

2117
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And in other, you know, kind of

2118
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
In-game languages

2119
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
In a game that we've played before

2120
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You know, so having just

2121
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
That richness to it

2122
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And I really think this is going to be a very rich

2123
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Universe with the work that's put into it

2124
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And the people behind it

2125
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So, yeah

2126
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Yeah, so we'll see

2127
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Great question, Flocko

2128
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Made a great conversation

2129
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Out of it, so

2130
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Love to have those here on the show

2131
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Sadly, that's all the questions we got

2132
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But, you know, the last time

2133
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
We got probably twice as many

2134
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
But we also had twice as much

2135
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
So, that's alright

2136
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
We're gonna try to really grow the family

2137
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Here at OLR as we move into our 800th

2138
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Episode and so forth, try to get the word out

2139
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
God, that many

2140
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
What are we gonna do when we hit a thousand?

2141
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
That's still

2142
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
A thousand would be

2143
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
A good four years away

2144
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You know, I just like, I'm saying when

2145
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Because I think it's gonna happen

2146
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
There's a, okay, real block

2147
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
There's that honest part of me that's like, are we gonna

2148
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Hit a thousand? I'm like, oh my god

2149
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Four more years of this, but then I'm like

2150
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Didn't we think we were gonna hit 500?

2151
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
We never thought we'd hit 500 and here we still are

2152
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
So it's like, it's one of those things where it's like

2153
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I don't know what I'd do with myself

2154
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Maybe I'm not having fun, but I'm enjoying the ride

2155
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
So if you're not having fun, is this art?

2156
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Is this art?

2157
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm choking some emotions

2158
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I mean, and not just to go back

2159
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
On the nostalgic, you know, thing before

2160
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
But look at what all of us have done

2161
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Every single one of us

2162
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
In this room have gotten married

2163
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Yeah

2164
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
One of us has spawned

2165
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
One of us has prevented spawning

2166
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
We have

2167
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Animals

2168
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
We have lost people close to us

2169
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Yes

2170
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
We have gained people that we don't want to be close to us

2171
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And lost them

2172
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And lost them

2173
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
In a different sense

2174
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
We have changed jobs

2175
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Yeah, all of us have changed jobs

2176
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
All at some point in this room have been fun employed

2177
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Rob

2178
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
No

2179
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
No, you have not

2180
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I have not been fun employed

2181
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I was super fun employed though and that was great

2182
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Except I like money

2183
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
You know, we adult harder than we used to

2184
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
But

2185
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
That's not fun, but it's enjoyable

2186
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
But I'm just saying, it's like

2187
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
No, for sure

2188
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I don't see any point in giving up

2189
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
No, you're right, you're right

2190
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
We will continue to do this until

2191
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
One of two things

2192
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Either we can't

2193
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
We're not able to get in the same room

2194
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And do this anymore on Sunday nights

2195
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Rob has a full hip replacement

2196
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Yeah, I mean, well

2197
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
We physically can't

2198
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
That might be one reason we don't do it anymore

2199
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Or we just kind of decide

2200
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I think we've said everything we have to say

2201
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
No, that'll never happen

2202
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
See, that's where I'm kind of at

2203
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Well, we've kind of

2204
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
That is never going to happen

2205
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
We still find new things to say

2206
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I don't know, here's

2207
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Let me ask this honest question

2208
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I'm going to reward those that have stuck around

2209
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
With a bonus episode this deep in

2210
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
With some real deep content here

2211
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Oh, yeah

2212
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Do you think your emotions

2213
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
And your feelings about gaming

2214
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Are as strong as they were

2215
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
When OLR first started

2216
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Probably more so

2217
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I mean, I wouldn't say that I am the gamer

2218
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I was

2219
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
You know, ten years ago

2220
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Fifteen years ago, etc.

2221
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
You know, I like to think that I've

2222
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I've

2223
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Grown

2224
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
As a gamer

2225
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And grown into different tastes

2226
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
You know, but

2227
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I think that

2228
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
As I've grown and matured through it

2229
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I've got different attitudes

2230
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And when I see people

2231
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Who are now in the position that I was

2232
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
When we started

2233
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I feel like I've got more to contribute

2234
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
So, I mean, does that make sense?

2235
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
No, no, totally, for sure

2236
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I don't know, like

2237
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I have to admit there's a part of me that's having

2238
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
A harder and harder time staying on top

2239
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Of everything that's going on in gaming

2240
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And I don't know if that's because of my

2241
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Tendency to just kind of use MMOs

2242
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
As my gaming crutch or what have you

2243
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Where I'm just kind of like, this is my comfort zone

2244
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
This is my place and the thing that I do

2245
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
But I feel like it's been harder

2246
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
As the years go on to really stay on top

2247
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Of everything that's going on in gaming

2248
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And I don't know if this is also like a sign of getting older

2249
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
But there's also some times where you kind of look at

2250
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Like these things that

2251
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
The big discussions and debate that gamers are having

2252
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Where you kind of go like, I don't know if I

2253
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Get that, or I don't know if I

2254
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Understand why people

2255
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Are having that type of reaction

2256
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I think it's necessarily like

2257
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Before, like I know when we first

2258
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
That's where you respond, okay boomer

2259
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Just kidding, GenX

2260
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
GenX, it's GenX

2261
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Thank you

2262
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I think right now it's just

2263
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
We've kind of grown with

2264
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Before, like I thought I had to

2265
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Get everything to be able to talk about everything

2266
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
And then it's just like

2267
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It's like, look how much money I've wasted on

2268
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Like all these systems I didn't play

2269
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
It's like, okay, we'll just scale back

2270
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
With what you get

2271
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
And not necessarily

2272
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Purchase every single game that comes out

2273
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Yeah, I still do catch myself

2274
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Doing that, like I have several

2275
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Games that are like big titles that I have

2276
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Not touched at all, like Kingdom Hearts 3

2277
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Just the other day

2278
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I'm like, oh yeah, I do have that game, don't I?

2279
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So like, I have this whole library

2280
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Of stuff I haven't touched, but I'll pick stuff up

2281
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Because I feel like I want it

2282
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
But that's going to be the same thing

2283
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I think when the next-gen systems come out

2284
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It's just like, I'm not going to buy

2285
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Both of those systems

2286
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I will see what happens

2287
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
But I don't know

2288
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I don't feel the need to do that

2289
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Even right now, I haven't played my PlayStation 4 in months

2290
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So

2291
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I don't know

2292
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I mean, we'll see

2293
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It's time, really, a lot of it

2294
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
We don't have as much time as we used to

2295
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Dedicate the stuff like that

2296
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
You have to balance it between everything else

2297
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
So, yeah

2298
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I don't know

2299
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Anyway, the other thing

2300
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I'll piggyback on what you were saying to our Sakura

2301
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
About just having

2302
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
This place to do the show

2303
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And everything that has transformed in our lives

2304
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
While the show has gone on

2305
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I think there's something to be said as well

2306
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
About the way we've watched our audience

2307
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Grow with us

2308
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And the things that our audience has done

2309
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
We have seen folks from our audience

2310
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Go on to do their own shows

2311
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And to do their own live streaming

2312
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And broadcasting and getting their voices

2313
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Truly out there

2314
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
And in many ways, and I really mean this when I say it

2315
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
There is truly no greater compliment

2316
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
To what we've done

2317
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Here at OLR than the fact that

2318
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Some of you

2319
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Feel empowered to do the same

2320
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Yeah

2321
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And I think that alone has made this adventure

2322
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Worth it

2323
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I sound like it's over, but it's not

2324
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The road thus far

2325
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
We're entitled to a little rumination

2326
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Sure, of course

2327
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
We're fucking old

2328
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
What happens when you talk to the old player character

2329
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
In the video games?

2330
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Well, let me tell you about it

2331
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Let me spin you a tale

2332
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Girl

2333
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
You know, I think that also

2334
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I mean, just go back and listen

2335
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
To even a hundred episodes back

2336
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
We're always

2337
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
You know, I think that in some cases

2338
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The people who have stayed with us

2339
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Have our own personal struggles that we've had

2340
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
On the show

2341
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
That I think

2342
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
That maybe even outside of just the realm of gaming

2343
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
You know, we're people

2344
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And if anything that we might have experienced

2345
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Will help other people

2346
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Then I'm fine sharing those experiences

2347
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
With people

2348
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah, for sure

2349
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
That's why I talk about my health openly

2350
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
That's why I talk about

2351
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Real life stuff openly

2352
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Because it's not

2353
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
The games that you're playing can also be a reflection

2354
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Of where you are mentally

2355
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
For sure

2356
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
You made me think about

2357
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
The greatest

2358
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Feeling, the greatest reward

2359
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
The greatest thing I've probably ever felt

2360
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
From doing this show

2361
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
When you talk about being open with your life

2362
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And being your authentic self here on air

2363
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
The emails I've gotten

2364
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Where they were like

2365
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I think it's a little different now in the year 2019

2366
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
But this show's been around for 17 years

2367
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
In the earlier years of the show

2368
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Especially when we were first a podcast

2369
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
2006, 2007, right?

2370
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
When I got that email that said

2371
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Rob, you being your authentic self

2372
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And being a quote unquote

2373
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Normal gay guy

2374
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
But that's, you know

2375
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
When people are in their feelings

2376
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I totally get why somebody phrases it that way

2377
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
You being a normal gay guy

2378
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Out and open and a gaming fan like me

2379
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It helped me

2380
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
To accept that this was a part of myself

2381
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Just thinking about it

2382
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
There is no

2383
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
There is no greater reward, period

2384
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And I think

2385
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Just with our dynamic on here

2386
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
The three of us

2387
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
We actually

2388
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Kind of represent a different demographic

2389
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Each of us

2390
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
That can interact together

2391
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I think that's what's kept this show going

2392
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
As long as it has

2393
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
There's been nights

2394
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
We can get into it

2395
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Very passionate opinions

2396
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And I'm sure we've said things that maybe even

2397
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Piss some of our listeners off

2398
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But at the end of the day

2399
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
They kind of come back because

2400
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It's that bar where you go where everybody knows your name

2401
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
That whole thing, right?

2402
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
It's like this, we have a strong friendship here

2403
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Where it's like, we're going to have passion

2404
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
We're going to have opinions

2405
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
We're going to have those things

2406
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
But at the end of the day

2407
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
We're all cut from the same nerd cloth

2408
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I guess

2409
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I'm just the poorly sewn one

2410
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I'm the amateur cosplayer

2411
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Of the group now

2412
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Fuzzy wuzzy feelings

2413
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
That was deep

2414
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Someone fart before I get, you know

2415
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Well I will say you know that Loki

2416
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Followed up the tweet that Flocko

2417
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Wrote putting fun plus

2418
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Art equals

2419
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Fart

2420
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
So there you go

2421
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
We hope you found this episode

2422
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
This bonus episode of Orange Laundry

2423
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Is a big gigantic fart

2424
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
That's fun plus art

2425
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Thank you for sticking with us

2426
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Through this bonus episode

2427
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Through however many episodes you've listened to Orange Laundry

2428
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
One other thing I wanted to say real quick

2429
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Sorry not to go back to the deep stuff

2430
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I think we've been talking behind the scenes

2431
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
About trying to do some creative

2432
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Kicks in the butt

2433
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
For episode 800

2434
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
We kind of always ask ourselves

2435
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
How do we celebrate 17 years?

2436
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
How do we celebrate another year?

2437
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
How do we celebrate another hundred episodes

2438
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
When you've been doing it like this long right?

2439
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And I think like a creative kick in the butt

2440
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And I don't want to over promise and under deliver

2441
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So that's why I'm trying to like really bite my tongue

2442
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
On like what we want to do

2443
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
You trash your hotel room and hire hookers

2444
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
No but I think when we like creatively

2445
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Kind of go back to the show and go

2446
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
What can we, what can we like

2447
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Tune up behind the scenes

2448
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
What we want to do different, what we want to do better

2449
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
What makeover do we want to give ourselves

2450
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I think it's a nice little like invigoration

2451
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Last one right? When we took the show

2452
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
And moved it to Twitch

2453
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
It was a big like creative kick in the ass

2454
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
You know and it's

2455
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It kind of keeps you going just that much longer

2456
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So I think

2457
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I look forward to 800 episodes for that reason

2458
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Because like how are we going to kick ourselves in the butt

2459
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Now to keep moving

2460
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
So our show is old enough to vote

2461
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Next year

2462
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Just in time for the next election

2463
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Fuck don't get me started on that

2464
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Alright then with that

2465
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I will shut it down tonight

2466
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
We've been going for quite a bit for a pre-recorded show

2467
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So it's almost 9 o'clock here

2468
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And I know everybody has their lives to get back to

2469
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
But it would not be an episode of Orange Laundry

2470
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Now keep in mind this was a bonus episode technically

2471
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
We're not going to number this one

2472
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
So there was no classic game of the week

2473
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
We didn't do some of our regular segments

2474
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
All of that stuff will come back next week

2475
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
In a normal episode of Orange Laundry

2476
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
But we will go around and get everybody's

2477
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Final thoughts still

2478
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
DarkSakura, your final thought for us

2479
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I'm kind of hungry

2480
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
We've kind of gone during the dinner time hours

2481
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Doing this show

2482
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So I don't blame you for that feeling

2483
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Loki, your final thought

2484
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
So I've been following

2485
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Salt and Straw which is an ice cream place

2486
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
That they have by Disneyland

2487
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And they have monthly flavors

2488
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
That they put out

2489
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
They have five different flavors that are based on

2490
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Thanksgiving

2491
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
One of them is salted caramel Thanksgiving turkey

2492
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
It's salted caramel with crispy

2493
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Turkey skin

2494
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
You lost me at caramel

2495
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Okay, my final thought is

2496
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
You inspired me to do one

2497
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Last thing here because I have something you have to try

2498
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Uh oh

2499
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Uh oh

2500
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Okay

2501
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Uh oh, Rob just got

2502
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Giggly and went and grabbed something

2503
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Oh fuck, are these leis?

2504
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
No, worse

2505
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Okay, so these are from Trader Joe's

2506
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
They're kettle chips

2507
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Turkey and stuffing

2508
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I need to try this

2509
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Loki, if you will

2510
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I ate one, I thought it was fucking nasty

2511
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
But I'm not huge on Thanksgiving food

2512
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Here you go, Darth Zarya

2513
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It definitely smells like stuffing

2514
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
You can thank Alan for bringing these

2515
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
There you go, Pikachu

2516
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
What do you think?

2517
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
It tastes like gravy a little bit

2518
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
This is fucking yummy

2519
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
If Alan doesn't like them

2520
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I'm giving you the bag

2521
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's alright

2522
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I don't like them

2523
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
It's got a weird aftertaste

2524
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
You know what, when leis had that

2525
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Biscuit and gravy flavor, the first time I had that

2526
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I was like, this is fucking gross

2527
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
But then it was like

2528
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
One of those, I'm hungry and it's the only option

2529
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I ate it again, I'm like, these aren't that bad

2530
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I like to shout down a little bit

2531
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
These remind me though

2532
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Because I'm definitely getting that turkey

2533
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And the stuffing

2534
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I really like it

2535
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
That's redundant

2536
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
But you know I also like those

2537
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Soy and butter chips

2538
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Oh yeah

2539
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Those are really good

2540
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Alright, well it started and it ended with food

2541
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
