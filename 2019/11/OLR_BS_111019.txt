Orange Lounge Radio
There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
Orange Lounge Radio
And how are you feeling?
I'm not drugged out of my brain anymore
Did you go back and listen to all the crazy things you said last week?
No
No, I'm just kidding
I don't listen to myself
Anyway, well hopefully the time off work and so forth while you're recuperating
Great time to watch a lot of random YouTubes and play some games
Actually it's time to build a website, rebuild a website
And yell at my computer while I'm playing The Sims
Fair enough
Also say hello to TechMasterLoki
Hello
Hi, how are you?
I'm fine
You and I are both dressed up in button up shirts today
We just got off work
It's very formal
It's a formal, it's a black tie
And DarkSakura is dressed up too
This is what I wear to work
You should see this wig she's got on
It's amazing and she's got makeup
I'm just kidding
Which is actually funny because I'm not wearing hardly any makeup
And I'm wearing a black flannel, a Captain Marvel t-shirt and leggings
I'm about as unformal, I look like the 90s, really
Revenge of the 90s
Except I have better eyebrows
I like the Captain Marvel shirt though, it's cute
Yeah, I paid four bucks for it at Target
A whole four dollars? No, that's a good deal
I've been all about the clearance racks and thrifting lately
Treasure hunting
We're not live tonight
This is kind of an extra episode that we're doing
We're taping, as I mentioned, Tuesday during the week
In advance of our usual Sunday night slot
Because as I've mentioned on a previous episode of the show
I'm going to be out of town this weekend
On a trip I planned like six months ago
Before all the other stuff that knocked us off the air
For a couple weeks previously came up
So we just wanted to make sure we at least kind of recorded something for you guys
That make it a habit to show up on Sunday nights live
And of course download us as part of your podcast rotation and all that
So we're doing a little bit of a special bonus episode tonight
Very free form, very unlike some of our usual episodes of Orange On Radio
So if it's your first episode of Orange On Radio
This may not be the best one to represent
It's just your appetizer
Yeah, that's a good way to put it
It's kind of like the appetizer
It's just a little bit of the three hour plus show
This last show we just did two days ago was three hours plus
It was like a three hour fifteen minute show
So tonight probably won't be as long
Because there simply just isn't as much to talk about
However, I am looking forward to a little later on in the show
We're going to be welcoming our good buddy and pal and friend
Game maker, independent game maker YYR is going to join us
For a little bit of a chat
And I am told he's going to break an exclusive here about his games on the show tonight
So that is very exciting
So we'll talk about that
So at least we still have a little excitement building here
On our special little mini edition of Orange On Radio
For those of you that are watching on Sunday night
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network
Where we usually do tape live every Sunday night
At six o'clock pacific, nine o'clock eastern
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
For those of you that are there
You can still chat along with the show
And your comments will show up for at least two more days
Until twitch pulls the plug on all that
Which I don't, I have to be honest
I do love twitch or we wouldn't be using them as a platform to stream
But I don't understand why they got to get rid of that
Maybe it's a resource hog
Maybe for most channels it's just something really horribly underutilized
But I'm going to miss it
I'm going to miss the chat on the video on demand
So this is your last chance
Pour one out for the chat
But in fact right now in chat
Push F to pay respects
For the video on demand
That way I'll know who is here
I even saw an article that
The pay F for respects is five years old today
That's right it's celebrating a birthday
That meme is five years old
Oh my gosh we're all getting older
You know what quick aside
Because we never get on tangents here on Orange On Radio
I was at work today and talking with a co-worker
And the subject of the classic 70s, late 70s, early 80s
Television program Mork and Mindy came up
And my co-worker who is a few years younger than I am
Had no idea who Mork and Mindy was
And like I had to explain like you know like Robin Williams
Big TV, Nanu Nanu, nope
No idea who Mork and Mindy was
Oh come on everyone knows Pam Dauber
I know and it was Robin Williams
And then even my other co-worker who totally knew the show
Was like and who is the gal that played Mindy
What was her name
I'm like Pam Dauber
What else was she in
She was in that movie Stay Tuned with John Ritter
She was also, wasn't she in
I don't remember what else Pam Dauber was in
No she was in a TV movie
And I know about this because she was playing
Someone who was meant to be Lisa Dalby
Who was the woman who worked for a year in the 70s
As an actual geiko in Kyoto
As in what they call geisha in Kyoto
Who worked for a year as a geiko
She was there working on her like her doctorate thesis
I think on kimono and geiko culture
So but I saw that movie I knew she was in it
Well who knew listening to Orange Lawn's radio this week
I'd learned something about Pam Dauber
And wasn't she in that 80s series
She wasn't in My Sister Sam was she
I don't know can somebody pull up her wikipedia
I'm looking
But you remember that show right My Sister Sam
Oh yeah I think that was her
Yeah I do remember that
Was that the show
The girl also died
I was like was that the show
Yeah it was Pam Dauber and Rebecca Schaefer
Rebecca Schaefer was the one that had the stalker that shot her
I know it's really tragic and not something I'm trying to make light of
But that was I mean for those that were like
Those of you that are like in your early 40s or late 30s
Probably remember hearing about that when you were a kid
That there was this popular show on TV
And the actress unfortunately yeah
Cause that changed like stalking laws and stuff
Like that was a big big deal when that happened I remember
So okay
I didn't realize that Pam Dauber actually screen tested for the role of Tabitha
Which was the spinoff of Bewitched
Huh how bout that
Wow
Alright the classic actress of the week
Right here on Orange Lounge Radio
I didn't realize that she was married to Mark Harmon
But yeah she was um
She did a couple other shows
And actually worked with Robin Williams
On one of his comedy shows called The Crazy Ones
Has she done anything in the past 10 years
That was in 2014
Oh The Crazy Ones was that last TV show he had before
He died the one with Sarah Michelle Gellar
Yeah interesting
Okay anyway
Alright the Pam Dauber show
Alright let's
Well I'm just saying I'm looking at on here
She actually did some voice acting too
Any video games?
Well it was 101 Dalmatians the series
So there's no way to tie Pam Dauber to video gaming
She's on the show Dream On remember that
Completely on a tangent I do remember Dream On
Alright enough enough
Okay sorry I just I just I just think it's it's kind of funny
I think it's
She has a lot of movies
I haven't thought about her in many years
Alright let's talk about some early gaming headlines
Again I do want to give this disclaimer
We're taping this about 5 days in advance of when it's airing
A whole lot of shit could go down during the week
So we're just gonna take a look at some of the early headlines from the week
And give you our thoughts
So Dark Sakura I know you've pulled a few things for us
Um yeah
Alright what do you want to talk about?
Well how about some Sony shenanigans
Because I don't know
We we talk about things like this happening
I don't want to get so mad
But this one might actually be a travesty
Smooshy agrees
Yes Mr. Smoosh is very much commenting on the case at hand
Anyway the servers for Sing Star are gonna close on January 31st
I know all those copies of Sing Star out in circulation
Which actually I think it was a pretty good seller
I wasn't into it but eh
But at any rate they did make a post about it publicly online
That all online functionality, network features, song purchases
Will be disabled immediately as of 11.59pm on January 31st 2020
And it will go on all Playstation platforms
But offline features will still be available
The thing in particular to keep your eyes on
Is that for PS4 users you will be able to re-download any songs
That you have downloaded and deleted previously
But that will not be possible on PS3
You will need to download all of your digital purchases
Prior to the server shutdown
And then after that the deleted content will be completely irretrievable
It's being replaced with a game called Sing Smoosh
Which is actually going on in the background right now
Well I kinda like Sing Star
Do you have Sing Star Abba?
I do, I have Sing Star Abba
Download all your shit
Well I don't have to download Sing Star Abba because that's all on the disc
So if I'm hearing you right
The disc version of Sing Star Abba should work
And there was also Sing Star Queen
Which I think I have as well
So Sing Star Queen, Sing Star Abba
And then there was the random Sing Star 1, 2, and 3
They had all of that
And then you could download a bunch of songs online
Which I did
I remember having house parties
We downloaded a bunch of stuff on Sing Star
Because I had those microphones
And then around the Playstation 4 era
They kinda changed it more to like a stand alone thing
Where you just have the Sing Star app basically
And you can sing, there's like an app you get for your phone
And you use your phone as the mic
Which is a smart way to do it
So you don't have to worry about those blue and red plug in mics anymore
But that means if the servers are going down
You won't be able to download any new songs now
Well to be specific what people will still be able to do
Is access all the songs on the discs
Play party mode
Track and record your high scores offline
Take in store videos and snapshots to the hard drive
And create song playlists
But things like the challenges
Scoreboards, user generated content
Will no longer be available online
You can't share your media to Facebook, Twitter, PSN
Sing Star communities or any of that
And of course you will not be able to unlock
The channel surfer, concert debut, star in my eyes
Or Sing Star trophies
Yeah there's a lot of stuff that's gonna be locked away
Because I seem to remember
What was the Sony initiative called
Was it called Play Create Share or something like that
Was that the Sony thing
And I wanna say Sing Star was a big part of that
Because LittleBigPlanet was a huge part of that
When it first came out too
But Sing Star has all that online stuff
And again this, Sing Star was out in an era
Right before, maybe like when YouTube
Was kinda still like first coming out
Was still kinda new
Like people knew YouTube and got linked YouTubes
Kelly's shoes existed on YouTube at the time
So there was something to go visit there
But it wasn't like it is now
And like something like Twitch
Wasn't really what it is now
You know where there's the immediate like sharing of things
Or you know even something like
Justin TV, Twitch's predecessor was still kinda
I think still in its very much like its formative years
So Sing Star was really like a place to really like share
Like here's my singing you know
For good and for bad
So it's kinda sad to see it go
But I guess it would make sense
That perhaps licensing issues
Are now coming into play
I mean we would be like
It could be like a
You know whatever licenses are coming due
Yeah I mean but it would be like
I mean Sing Star ABBA was a PlayStation 3
I wanna say a game like Sing Star ABBA
Was almost 10 years ago at this point
You know so
I remember how excited you were
Well hell yeah
The video game all about ABBA
Are you kidding?
They don't often make dedicated video games
To groups I adore
Wasn't Tiara here when we played that
Like Spice World was the only other one I can think of
I'm trying to look
Cause I actually have off camera
A bunch of PlayStation 3 games
I'm curious of
I think my copies of Sing Star are in the other room though
Because I think I pulled those discs
To do something with the PlayStation 4 version
I don't think the PlayStation 4 version reads them
But it definitely knew
Like I had bought these certain songs
Online previously
And so like
I do have a PlayStation 4 copy of the client
So
I should go through and see if there's any
Other songs I wanna grab
Before it all goes away forever
But I feel like
They kinda
They didn't really do a lot of updates
To that library starting a couple years ago
But
It is a library I've spent
A bit of money on
I mean I would say over the years
I probably dropped like 40 bucks
On additional songs
I know it sounds like a lot
But
You know
Again you have parties
And it's very easy to sign into the store
And people are like
I wanna sing that one
I think even
Your wife
Loki
I wanna say at one of these parties
Convince me to download Whitney Houston songs
That sounds like her
Right?
I don't
I'm almost
Vaguely remember something
I'm almost positive
I had a birthday party
Way way way back when
When we used to do the show in the garage
At the house that I lived at
Then
Maybe
I think I had a party way back then
And I think we played Sing Star
And I wanna say
Your wife made me download
I Wanna Dance With Somebody
By Whitney
Which is not a bad selection
I'm not upset with it
That sounds like her
Yeah right
I don't know why I associate your wife
With Whitney Houston
But I do
It's a very easy association
The Bodyguard really is
You know the number one thing
Yeah
I wish that was a play on Broadway
I could go see
Wanna go
The Bodyguard?
Yeah The Bodyguard
The Bodyguard's a play you know
Did you?
We saw the musical
Oh that's right
You saw the one with Deborah Cox right?
Yes
How'd you guys like it?
It was pretty good actually
I'm sad it's not on Broadway still
Did I say on this show what I'm gonna go see
I'm gonna go see Moulin Rouge
And I'm gonna go see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway
Cause it just started the preview performances like this past weekend
Cool
So I'm gonna get to see it in like its first couple weeks of existence
I'm being a total Broadway hipster right now
But I'm really excited so
Yeah
Anyway
By the time you guys hear this
Actually at the time you guys are watching this on Twitch
I will be in the second act of Moulin Rouge
So I'm really excited
Anyway
And I can no longer download the Elephant Love medley to sing on SingStar from Moulin Rouge
So rest in peace SingStar thanks for the memories
Anyway
Anything else StarSaga?
No not in regard to SingStar
What about any other stories you wanna talk about?
A couple of things
Okay
So there has been another video game related death
But due to being too into the game I guess
There was a teenager in Thailand who was found dead after a marathon gaming session
His name is Piawet Harikun
I guess I pronounced that right
Was discovered on I guess yesterday in his home in Thailand
After playing a bunch of multiplayer games
And they said that he died from a stroke
He was discovered near his computer chair in his bedroom
The desk was covered with food containers and the curtains were drawn
And his father discovered him
And apparently yeah they said that they're trying to use that to bring bigger alertness
I guess to the use of video games and people with addictive personalities
Because I don't think video games themselves are addictive
I think it's addictive personalities the same way that people
Because the same type of response like to gambling and things like that
Almost anything consumable can be addictive
Not like though with a drug where it does create
Like I'm addicted to these Tootsie Roll vanilla things
But that's part of a chemical reaction
Addiction on games and gambling is a different kind of chemical reaction
I gotcha
So you know that same dopamine response
Whereas I don't consider that a consumable
I consider that going to be more something who is more easily stimulated by that sort of response
Is going to want to keep doing it
And it's interesting that you kind of put games and gambling in the same category
Because I think a lot of the issues we've been hearing about in the past few years with the loot box concerns
Are kind of falling in a very similar thing
Is that you know it's getting a little too close to gambling
And hits kind of a lot of those same nerves for people
Well and on top of that I mean you know the World Health Organization
Has included video game addiction to its list of international classifications of diseases
I like though how it's phrased
The disorder is characterized by impaired control over gaming
An increased priority given to play video games over other daily activities
Usually lasting for at least 12 months to be diagnosed
And that is very much like how gambling is classified
Or how workout addiction
You know of workout addiction right?
Sure
Sometimes it's things like steroids and stuff in regards to those
Although again I think there are different types of addiction
Runners
What?
Runners
Oh yeah
And interesting you kind of bring up the ICD coding of the issue
Because you know the industry switched ICD coding standards
2015 I think was the big year
So they were running on an older version
They switched to a newer version that was already being used in places like Europe and stuff
But this new kind of coding
So even though it's like wow they actually have coding for video game addiction
They switched to a system that allows them to code for almost anything
Like there's an ICD code out there for subsequent
No I think the craziest one because this was my old world
That I can be a little more open about now because it's not my world anymore
There used to be a code for piece of a UFO flying on you for a subsequent time
Like they have all sorts of things classified
I know
Unidentified flying object
Doesn't necessarily mean an alien
No
Something fell out of the sky
Somebody's cheap ass drone
Yeah somebody's drone
That's right a drone would be a UFO in that
That would actually be a perfect example of that
Weather balloons Rob weather balloons
Yeah that could be too
So anyway
So don't redo it too much that they've actually given it an ICD coding
Almost anything that can end up in a doctor's office
They have the capacity to give an ICD-10 code to now
Well then and last but not least
You know I hate to be like the pooper on here
But New Zealand is banning a video game that's glorifying mass shootings
I think it might be that same one that we talked about before
They didn't mention it by name so I guess not to give any
What sort of attention to the game itself
Sure
But there is a you know they had the Christchurch mass shooting
Where they were 51 Muslims were murdered in a mosque
Wasn't that the one that was streamed online
It was streamed on Facebook
Gross yeah
With a gunman with semi-automatic weapons
Who went into two mosques on March 15th and killed 51 people and wounded more
They were talking about the release of this game and advertisement of this game
Because it has one play from the perspective of a white supremacist
So the game is banned outright in New Zealand
With further urging internationally to ban the game
Interesting
You know and I know this was the same incident that led them to pass gun reform
Like within a weekend right
And I remember a lot of people were pointing at that
Because you know and I'm trying to walk a real fine line
Because we could have a three hour show about the politics of this issue
And yeah and that whole thing
I have to ask this question as much of a slippery slope as it is into a complete political spin-off
But with this disgusting as a subject matter about like white supremacy and all that is
Are we going down a slippery slope if we start to ban these sorts of things
Because like for me it starts to get down like kind of like
Do you remember when the Supreme Court intervened on that Schwarzenegger law
Like who is to define what is obscene and what is not obscene
Or in that case what is a violent game and what is not
Because there was no like official rating
So I think and you guys have to forgive me because I don't have all the references in front of me
But I want to say where that law ended up getting tripped up
Was because there is no
It's too vague
It's too vague on what is a violent game
So I guess my kind of my kind of thought is here
And New Zealand can do whatever they want
And Australia has banned games before
We know like Mortal Kombat been banned
They also banned assault weapons
Right
Much earlier on
So are we I'm trying to keep the question kind of simple
Without going too far down the rabbit hole
But is it a slippery slope to start banning video games
Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious
Say that again sorry
Slippery slope arguments are inherently fallacious
So I don't like to think in terms like that
I think there is such a thing as setting precedence
But America is so stupid when it comes to violence anyway
They'll ban sex before they ban violence
Which is absolutely ridiculous
I don't know it's
Yeah it's tough
I'm not saying there's necessarily an easy answer here
Maybe this is one of those things we just have to think
America is stupid about it
And it's one of those things we have to think about
Like what is the correct response to something like this
How do we you know
I guess for me it's more like
How do we teach people or demonstrate to people
That this is something that's effective
This is something that you know when
And I don't even know the game in question
So I can't even like say XYZ game is offensive
Because I haven't seen it
And I don't really care to hearing about this
But maybe that's the whole thing
Is that because I know it involves these types of things
I'm like that's disgusting
I don't need to play it
For example I don't go to see those Saw movies
I don't like those Saw movies right
Because I know they're gross
I know they show people getting shot
They don't know what they're doing
I know they're gross
I know they show people getting chopped up
In the little bitty pieces and stuff
So when I hear that a new Saw movie is coming out
I'm like there's a movie I don't need to see
Right
So that's how I approach it
Now maybe Loki goes and buys popcorn
And goes to opening night
Fine he can go do whatever he wants
I've missed too many Saw movies
Unfortunately I'm too far behind in the Saw series
My own husband loves those gory things
He watches those compilations on YouTube
I should watch them again though
The lore behind it is kind of great
Have fun
I think they're gross
The overreaching thing about it
Is that it's a matter of the mental fortitude
Of the person who is indulging in the genre
It's a different thing if it's set as
I think it's when you get into the specifics of it
You know that
First of all serial killers in the United States
Are actually a very very small small like
3% of mass murders are considered serial killings
If you look at it
You know
So you're not
You're going to be really unlikely to have
That level of psychotic going around killing people
Just saying
You know
Whereas with a mass shooting
At least in America
You are more likely to see something like that happening
As opposed to a serial killer
You know as opposed to
You know
And yeah both of them are fictionalized accounts
But the other one is
A lot more in
An influenceable realm
Does that make sense?
Yeah
Especially when it's picking a very specific type of issue
Where it is a white supremacist
Which right now our political environment
Is absolutely encouraging of that type of mind state
And secondly
Secondly
Where we live in a place where
Weapons like that are super easy to obtain
And people can televise their murder sprees
This
It's getting when it hits too close to reality
That is when you know that it's an influenceable item
Because it is likely to happen
It has happened
And it will happen
Whereas you're probably not going to get somebody
You know
On an intercom
You know telling people to cut your leg off
That's just not really going to happen
Unless you pay money to do an escape room in L.A.
Or where is that place?
Vegas
I always see ads for it
Like that is the number one thing I do not want to do in my life
Is it a saw?
It's a saw themed escape room
But that one's not actually going to still cut your leg off
No but they'll pretend
I don't even like to pretend
When it comes to that
I don't even like to pretend
I wouldn't play
Remember when they did the video games
And they were showing them at E3
I wouldn't even play the games
I was like I don't need to be a part of it
There's 5,000 other games here at E3
I don't need to play that one
Right?
Anyway
I'll be perfectly honest
I mean the things
I'm not the biggest advocate of any censorship at all
Yeah
But that would be something that I would absolutely censor
Because as far as the terms of I think obscenity laws
It would number one be something that would be considered a non-artistic work
They say it's satire
But it really strikes too close of a nerve for it to even
I think they're just using satire as a way to protect themselves
When truly it's not
That would be one thing I would be in favor of
I mean honestly I would also like to see weapons banned as well
Funny that Australia had one big mass murder
And it was gone
New Zealand
Big mass murder
Now it's gone
I have to be honest
I think it's okay to say I'm not sure how I feel about this right now
Because I think that if we are to say that video games are truly art
There should be a way to put this in a museum and say
Wow what a disgusting reflection of a disgusting place society was at in the year 2019
And so our kids can look back on that and go wow
I hope we don't make these same mistakes
I don't know there's a part of me that sort of thinks that
But I don't know
I look at preserving the code for it but still not making it publicly accessible
You know just like I believe that civil war items belong in a museum
But I don't think we should have fucking statues everywhere to the losers
And guess what southern girls saying this
Oh confederacy lost
Get over it
The Nazis lost
Get the fuck over it
I do believe that the memorabilia should be allowed in museums lest we forget
As well because there are people out there and you know this
That will say oh that didn't happen right
There's people out there say that didn't happen
So by putting it in a museum it's like it's proof that no it did
And it better not happen again
Anyway
Anyway long long discussion
But beyond that but I'm gonna leave it at that
I would really be curious what you guys think
I hope our chat room is lighting up because I can go read it
Also you can always email us participate at orangeontreaty.com
You can also comment on our episodes as we post them at vognetwork.com
So I think that was everything Dark Sakura had for the news
We're gonna go over to Loki and myself
However I do want to take a quick tangent
I know it's a little further down on the list there
But we actually have waiting on the phone I believe
YYR is joining us via discord
Are you there?
Rob this isn't fair
What isn't fair?
How can I possibly follow a deep impactful discussion about white supremacy
Serial killers, weapons, and the delicate balance of free speech
Versus the well deserved condemnation of hate speech
With bungee ferret tossing of course
Yeah about that
Sometimes video games are distractions from the horrors of the real world
And video games can be fun and frivolous
And why you've made some very fun and frivolous games yourself
I've done my best
So how have you been?
I know we've talked a little bit on the show
You have become a father within the past year and a half-ish right?
That's right
So I know understandably that's been monopolizing a little bit of your time
Oh absolutely
Have you been able to dedicate any time to taking a look at the old game library
And seeing what fantasy game you want to make come true next?
Actually over the last few months I've decided to spend some time actually playing games
More specifically one game
I actually spent a lot of time with Forza Horizon 4
Good choice though, good choice that's a good one
But it's like every week they put up a new playlist with all these different activities to complete
And some of them are multiplayer challenges that have you playing games against other teams
Team games against computer drivatars
And just all kinds of fun things to do
Games is a service yo
Well except that this service didn't cost any extra money
And there's no like fake currency to waste money on
And heck the thing is available on Game Pass now
So anyone can try it
But of course you know that was time
And so I actually didn't get a lot done over the last few months
So I do very much apologize to anybody who was waiting for the new sharpshooter that I mentioned
Which is like 90% done
It just needs a few more things and then it's ready to release
Yeah but you know that last 10% is the hardest part
I've said the same myself
I know that's who I stole it from you or Bobby one of the two or both
Or both
And the new BFT that's definitely delayed to I have no idea when next year
But I actually have some fairly exciting news that I want to share
Okay and you know what I treat your games like any other
If the delay is to serve to make the game a great product at the end of the day
Then a delay is worth it so I'm going to applaud YYR for delaying his games
And not rushing them
Let's all applaud hello let's celebrate that
Woohoo
So this is a short story about magfest actually
Oh it sounds like you want to tell a story too don't you
Aw hey your child and my cat should have a show
Well they both have a limited vocabulary so I'm not sure what the final entertainment value would be
Oh you want to grab the microphone that's a very good idea except it's not really
Thank you for your input darling
Alright now go put her in kitty jail
She's playing with her pom pom balls
Some of which are shiny
Anyway yes so magfest 2018 which was actually about two years ago
I put super multitasking in to the showcase or attempted to
It was not accepted but what they have there is something called the quick play table
And if your game doesn't get a full slot you're encouraged our spot at the quick play table
And you can do it multiple times throughout the weekend and you can show your game there
And you know for anyone who wants to come up to the table and play
So two years ago I was lucky enough to get a room in the Gaylord right in the same hotel as magfest
And so I had my equipment with me so I said well you know what why not
So I showed it I took the last slot on I think Friday initially
And I asked the staff who were stuck there for 24 hours because they have to monitor everything
So if I have the last slot of the day can I just leave my stuff here overnight
And they said well as long as you get it out before the first slot the following morning sure
And I said okay and I left my stuff there the whole night and set an alarm so I would be down early in the morning
And sure enough when I got back I found that the staff had been enjoying the heck out of the game
For a good amount of time overnight so I ran it overnight Saturday night too
And then I discover when I get back that there's like a nine minute record some like on just seemingly impossibly high
Survival record on there and I'm like what happened and they said oh yeah we played as a team we gathered around the controller
So they really enjoyed this game they went so far as to cheat at your game to feel better about themselves
So anyway so as far as the selection process you're encouraged to you know not submit the same game twice
Or at the least not submit the same game in the same state twice because that counts against you in the submission process
But nonetheless I haven't shown it a convention in a while I haven't this year I didn't last year
So I'm like you know maybe I'll just submit super multitasking for the heck of it for the 2020 showcase
But I did so with the promise that there would be some new features coming if it was accepted
And well I don't know what happened but I got accepted to the 2020 MAGFest showcase
Good for you congratulations pretty cool
Thank you so now of course I have to deliver on my promises so I am ready to announce
And mind you I always intended on releasing three versions of multitasking in total
The first was the 2016 XBL-IG version which is now gone
The second was super multitasking on Steam which came out early 2018
And the final version which I was originally going to call the very unoriginal ultra multitasking
Is now going to be known as super multitasking versus ultimate
I love it you're going the Street Fighter route you got to put turbo in there at something maybe there'll be an unlock code
For matching service featuring true kiss destination
Yes featuring dreams come true also
But no the the reason I'm calling it versus ultimate is because of well both words have significance
Not only is it going to be the ultimate challenge but well there's the surprise that I'll save for a couple minutes from now
The first major change is the original game had four slots the screen was split into four slots
You had your left stick your right stick your face buttons and then everything on the top of the controller
For people who hate themselves we can now split the top of the controller into individual slots for the triggers and the bumpers
And now you have five slots
You're a madman
So now so if I'm if I'm I'm hearing this right so for those that have played super multitasking
I wish I'd had time today to grab b-roll but check it out on Steam I guess or check out the YouTube trailer
Just look up super multitasking right now it's four games going on at once this new version will allow you to do five because four wasn't enough
First for some people obviously
Of course though if you're just getting your feet wet if you're just starting to play you can also do the opposite and lower it down to three slots
Completely eliminating the bumpers and the triggers and making things maybe a little easier
Although the challenge mode is going to challenge your thought that maybe three slots is definitely easier
I'll find a way to test that theory
Have you considered a one slot mode for Bobby Blackwolf?
Well that would defeat the purpose of the game wouldn't it?
I guess it would
It's just tasking
Bobby Blackwolf gets to play tasking
Solo tasking
Solo tasking
Maybe as a joke that's actually kind of funny
I would die if you put his name on it like I don't know if legally you can
But I would die if you called it Bobby Blackwolf's tasking
Well if he gives it his consent then I don't see why not
Alright Bobby you know who to tweet alright
So the challenge mode is going to be greatly expanded
Before it was just a single list of 42 challenges
Now we're going to separate it into multiple courses
They'll be the original 42 challenges and super multitasking
That'll be one course
But now they're going to be multiple like they'll be a three slot course
A five slot course
A hell course which is just going to be the worst thing ever
Like there's going to be a lot of new missions and they're also going to be able to be more complex
Let's put that quote on the back of the box by the creator quote the worst thing ever
That's actually yeah you know maybe I'll put that on the Steam page
Okay great
But yeah right now the challenge is they're set up a certain way
At most one game plays in each slot and then when that game ends that's it
We're going to throw that out the window and allow more complex missions that have
A second game starting in a slot once the first one is finished or more
So they're not just going to all last 20 seconds like before
They're going to be some that are deeper dives so please look forward to that
Oh boy
Speedrunners will have more ways to impact or make mistakes
So that's I want to add some depth
You know some someone might have pointed at the existing game and said well it's fun
But it doesn't really look like there's a whole lot to do. I want to I want to attack that
And then of course there will be new mini games
Some of them will be difficult versions of the games that are there now
Like an alternate version of the paddle the pong game where you have to control paddles on both the top and bottom
Rather than just on the bottom. So this way you can miss the ball in two different ways. Oh my god
Oh, this is gonna be wow. This is really gonna be a mindfuck, but I'm excited
And then some some mini games are gonna be completely new
I'm really gonna try to find a good way to make an intuitive mini game where you're typing a text on a cell phone
Just so that I can pair that with the driving game
That's great. You could take the swipe thing
You know, I mean you don't have to if you just with the yes something like controller
You could just do like a swipe thing. It doesn't have to actually hit each letter. Oh, I love that
You're gonna pair the pair texting game with the driving game. It has to be done. I love it
It just has to be done and then finally the last major addition that I'm gonna be making to this game is a two-player
versus mode
Now it's something that people were asking for and we finally figured out a good way to do this
So basically what's gonna happen is they're gonna be variants of the mini games
Like let's take the pong game again as an example
So instead of just being a paddle and hitting the ball against a wall
There's gonna be a red paddle on the bottom and a blue paddle on top
You're gonna be, you know, controlling whichever color you are and the ball is gonna slowly get faster
And whoever messes up first the opponent gets a point
There's gonna be the tennis game and you know what you've probably seen
Have you seen the the battle mode and pop in music?
It's been a long time but yes, I do vaguely remember, yeah
Some versions, I don't know if it's all versions but at least some versions of pop in music
They've had it where, you know, you're playing the game, you're playing the game against an opponent
The main game and then all of a sudden this mini game appears along the bottom of the screen
Where you're hitting a ball back and forth
And you have to take one of your buttons, you know, the extra button that you're not using
Because each player only has to hit three lanes in pop in music's battle mode
And then you're hitting that button to hit the ball back and forth
And whoever misses, they get some terrible mod applied to their lanes for a few seconds
Which causes them to completely mess up
So it's gonna be like that but, you know, four of them on the screen at once
Okay, I'm into it, this sounds really, you know what's also interesting about this
I don't know if you've thought about this YY or maybe you have
But you know Steam not that long ago or I think they just announced they're gonna do that whole thing
Where you can do any game multiplayer over the internet kind of akin to PlayStation 4's SharePlay
So theoretically, I imagine you're building this with same room in mind
Especially with some of the specific timings that go into this
But technically I could play this with a friend of mine online
I just hope you've got a good connection
Yeah, I was gonna say it might not be
I can understand why maybe you're not gonna emphasize that
Because the timing probably has to be very specific on that
And it is still kind of a beta-e early feature
Well, I mean it's gonna be meant for local play
If there's any lag, one player's gonna be at a big disadvantage
True
But yeah, I'm really hoping that people have a really great time with this
You know, you'll set it to play to five or whatever
And then whoever gets five points first wins the game
And then you do it again
And then you purse a little and then you do it again
And then you throw your controller and maybe do it again if it still works
Well I'm really excited for you YYR
And you know I love the concept behind multitasking, super multitasking
And now super multitasking versus ultimate, right?
Yeah, I have no idea when this will be done
However, what I can tell you is that at the least the versus mode
The five slot mode's already in the game
And the versus mode I'm working on now
You'll be able to try all these new features at MAGFest if you are there
Sadly, I am not there this year
I may be able to return in 2021
As you know, and I say you as in the listeners and everybody
I started a new job
New job
A little quick for me to make MAGFest happen
But the nice thing is with this new job
I am better taken care of when it comes to time away to go to nerd expos
Than I maybe was before
So things like MAGFest and some of the things I've had to cut back on the past couple of years
Are now again a possibility
So nothing's off the table when we move into
As we get it past, probably once we get into summer next year
I may show up at more places
So MAGFest 2021 is something that's not out of the picture
That's exciting. Maybe VOD could have a greater presence there on the whole
I will have to talk to Mr. Blackwolf about that because I would really love that
Nice
And I mean the last thing
I don't know yet if I'm allowed to sell anything at the booth
I would love to be able to sell the game there because it's out
But if I am able to sell stuff there and you mention OLR
I will give you my best possible deal
Oh and you know I totally didn't mention this
If you already own Super Multitasking
By the time these features are released
You will be upgraded to Super Multitasking vs. Ultimate for free
Look at you, good guy YYR
How about that?
Free upgrade, congratulations
That is great
For everybody else the price is going to go up a few dollars
If you haven't bought it yet
So maybe that's a hot tip for OLR listeners
Hot tip, get it now
Before he jacks up the price
Because I mean this is my best concept
There's going to be a lot of effort put into this
Into these upgrades too
So I really want to deliver the best possible package with this game
And then possibly look to port it to consoles afterward
Well I am wishing you all the luck in the world while you are
And I think one reason why this game does well at expos
I think it's one thing to talk about the game and do this
People do not really understand how addictive
Because it is a game you play in very short bursts
Kind of like a warrior type of thing
But it can also because of that be very subject to the whole
Just one more turn type of thing
Like I've got to break the two minute mark
It turns into that sort of addicting thing really fast
And I think once people get their hands on it
They really kind of realize like oh this is addicting
This is very addicting
And so the fact that you are making it bigger, badder and better
And maybe simpler for Bobby Black Wolf
Is very exciting
Thank you
That's great, well congratulations OLR
I mean certainly congratulations on getting the spot back at MAGFest
I hope we get pictures and video and all that good stuff
And I hope it goes so well that you come back in 2021
With your other projects that you're working on
I'm really hoping to
I'm really hoping that once this is done
I can actually start porting the new platforms
And creating a couple of new IPs that I have already planned out
It's like there's so much that's just waiting on me
Finishing up all these existing projects
I've got way too many
Well at least you've finished several games
Unlike some people I know
Congratulations
I haven't forgotten about Vecturds
Appreciate it, appreciate it
That makes me happy
It warms the cold dark recesses of my shriveled heart
Alright
YYR I am going to let you go for now
But thank you so much and best of luck to you
And I can't wait to hear how MAGFest goes in a couple months for you
I can't either
Take care my friend
Thank you as always for trusting OLR
If there's one game maker that'll break the news here on OLR
It's YYR, we appreciate it
Hey
You have me as an exclusive
Even if the major sites are looking to get me on
The biggest podcasts in the world
I'll be like nope, OLR gets me first
That warms my cold black heart
Big hug for you my friend
Now I have to go get famous
Alright, take care my friend
Now get to programming
Alright, see you later
I will
Alright, bye
Bye
Always good to hear from our pal YYR
I love that he's kind of like reinvigorating
I guess if you will super multitasking
Because I really do think like it's the type of game that
I'm really surprised kind of didn't go viral the first time around
But it's sometimes you just got to catch that spark
You know what I mean?
So having the additional visibility at MAGFest
And this time around he's going to be able to say
Not like it's coming soon
Or oh he's going to be able to say
Oh you can buy it right now
Like right here
And that I think is really going to help him out
For sure
Yeah because I was there I think the year before
When he first showed the game
And so he could only say
Can you upvote me on Greenlight
Can you upvote me
But now that he actually has this
You can buy this game you're playing right here
Or at least even if the versus ultimate isn't out at that point
At least you can still play the basic version
This game can be yours if the price is right
That's right, exactly right
Exactly right
So wishing YYR all the success out there
And again if you want to check out Super Multitasking
If you're newer to OLR
Because we were talking ears off about this game
When it first came out
It is available on Steam
The Super Multitasking he's referencing
You can play it on Steam right now
So go check it out in the Steam store
There's no Epic or Origin
Or any of those GOG wars going on
It is only on Steam
Because I know he got there through the Greenlight process
Before they pulled it
They don't have Greenlight anymore right?
No they don't
They just throw your crap up there
Throw whatever crap you want up there
Okay let's get back into some news
So we had taken care of the stories Dark Soccer was going to talk about
Although I do have some kind of unrelated news
Alright sure why not
Kathy Griffin was sainted by the San Francisco Sisters
Oh I didn't know that was a procedure that you could do
Did she have a show there tonight?
I don't know but she just was very recently sainted
She had a show there coming up
And I wanted to go but I couldn't
I was like oh it's the same day as something else
But anyway
So she is now Saint Kathy of the acerbic profundity
Herder of Hussies, defender of D-listers
And probably not a member of ISIS
Oh probably not
Anyway back to gaming headlines
Loki
Alright so let's talk a little bit about Smash Brothers
So there's a new version coming out soon
And there's a brand new update
On Intended Direct that's coming
So we have Ultimate
Which will have happened by the time people hear this
Yes it would have happened already
And as you probably have now heard
There's no new announcement
Sorry it's just talking about Terry
Well they might be playing Terry Bogard
I mean aren't we anticipating that Terry Bogard will be unlocked after the direct problem
Most likely
I don't know
But they're going to at least show what Terry Bogard does
So that's kind of cool
And of course along with the vault
The version 6 updates they have
Of course there's the vault shopper set that's been announced
That's going to be made available to Switch Online members
And that includes 5000G and 3 classic tickets for no cost
If you happen to have Switch Online
Which if you're playing Smash you probably do anyways
And then they have fighter adjustments
And some other features that will be detailed
I'm assuming during the direct
And then along with Smash
It is now the number one selling fighting game in history
Oh wow
In one year
So yeah it sold 15.71 million units as of September 30th
Wow that's really
Especially when you consider that they had a version that was on Wii and 3DS
But I guess maybe you still count those separately
Or excuse me Wii U and 3DS
But I guess maybe you still have to count those separately
I just think it just didn't sell as well
Because there weren't as many systems out there maybe
You're right that's probably the case
Yeah
Apparently though they're still saying though
If you counted
If you count the SNES classic mini
Then Street Fighter 2 would hold the record still with 20 million units
I was just about to ask
But wasn't Street Fighter 2 everywhere
But we just had the story
And luckily this time I can remember what we just talked about
Because it really was just the day before yesterday
But we just had that story that Dark Soccer was talking about on the last show
About how the Switch has now outsold the Super Nintendo
So even though it feels like
Oh my god Street Fighter 2 was everywhere
On the Super Nintendo when it came out
Well the reality is
There wasn't as many Super Nintendos as there are Switches
That's how this has now been able to get out there more
It's pretty cool
And then in other news
Nintendo is saying that they're open to more remakes on the Switch
So much like we had with Zelda Link's Awakening
They're looking at possibly doing some other games in a similar fashion
And this came out of an investor Q&A
They're saying there's a possibility to bring back titles that have been previously developed for handheld consoles
However
Within Nintendo rather than re-releasing past handheld games
Because of the Nintendo Switch Lite's release
We are discussing more what sorts of new games can we create for an entire Nintendo Switch family
Within that we also are considering past titles
But regarding what sorts of discussions are being held in detail
There's nothing I can say at the present
I have a nomination to put forward
If we want to bring back classic handheld franchises
Well we just heard Brain Age
We had that about a month ago
That Brain Age was coming back
I would put forward Clubhouse Games
Remember that one on 3DS?
I thought that game was so cool
And it didn't really seem to
It didn't end up being like a Nintendo thing that really stuck around
But I'm really surprised
I would have thought Clubhouse Games would have been a bigger deal
So it's an old 3DS title
Maybe it was the regular DS
It was the regular DS
Oh god
So you gotta go way back
It was the regular DS
It was like parlor games
Mini collection of parlor games
It was really well done
And with the DS stylus
And that you could do things that were pretty cool
So we haven't really talked about Minecraft Earth recently
But I think they're just about the release over here at some point
They just, as of October 31st
Released in South Korea, Canada and the Philippines
Just today, the UK
So we're getting bigger territories
Are these the full releases or just betas?
Full release
Oh shoot, okay
So we're, I mean they've been releasing all sorts of territories
Australia's had it for a little bit
So they're getting bigger, bigger territories
I mean the UK is pretty big
So maybe soon?
Yeah, maybe
It looks like weekly has been what they've been putting that stuff on
Again, by the time you guys hear this, it might be a thing
Yeah, so that'd be pretty cool
And last but not least
There's rumors that Microsoft may be purchasing, or set to purchase
The developers of Yooka-Laylee
Oh, that would make sense
Yeah, interesting
Like, who's the, like how, on a rumor scale of 1 to 10
They're saying that there's, you know
There's the Xbox XO 19 celebration
That takes place in London on November 14th
That would be a good place to announce something like that
Alright, so keep your eye on that one
Yeah
Alright, interesting
I have a few headlines for you guys
Actually, a lot of these have to do with like other, like streaming updates
And streaming news
YouTube being one of them
Of course, YouTube is a streaming platform as well
If you weren't already aware
YouTube is now rolling out something
You know, because like on Twitch and Mixer
We just talked in the last episode about subscriptions on Mixer
You know, so how is YouTube trying to get a little bit more into the monetization game
Allowing creators to make a little more coin
Subscriptions are a thing on YouTube as well
And I guess they have like super chat
Which means you get a comment that's pinned at the top of a chat
Kind of like, I guess it'd be similar to like a highlighted message
Which is the, you could
You probably noticed it's there on VoG network
Like, when we heard it open
Bobby and I were just kind of like
Yeah, might as well just open and see what happens
It's not something you really, it's like the more you watch
The more little virtual coins you get
Yeah, I saw that
It's Mixer's biddies
Or no, not biddies
What do they call them on Mixer?
Sparks
It's the Sparks from Mixer
Twitch kind of has their own system of that now
So we just kind of turned it on
But we haven't really, really given it thought
On how to best use it
But I have noticed people have started highlighting their messages
So this is kind of a similar thing you can do on YouTube
Well now another thing you're going to be able to do
Is animated stickers
So it's a little different from emojis
Because I guess they're big
They're like super stickers
And they've rolled them out to creators in over 60 countries
When you are doing streams or video premieres
You can buy a sticker
And drop it in the chat
And a streamer will get a cut of that sticker
A creator can moderate the super stickers
There are eight sticker packs
Five of which are animated
And so there will be different packs in different languages
Like English, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese
And you have to have super chats enabled on your stream
To be able to enable super stickers
Because YouTube has the various criterias that you can monetize
And all that stuff, different levels
So kind of interesting but I've got to admit
Stickers? I don't know
I mean if you're trying to get noticed by a big YouTube streamer
Maybe, I don't know
But ok, I mean they've got to think of ways to monetize
I've got to admit, one reason why I think Twitch is a great platform
Is because it's really easy to monetize on Twitch
It used to be easy to monetize on YouTube
But it no longer is
So it's pretty easy to monetize on Twitch
And so that's why I think a lot of people kind of go that way
Not that you're going to make a fortune broadcasting on Twitch
I mean we all still have day jobs, hello
But you know you make a nice amount of money
To maybe offset the cost of buying microphones
And doing a show and all that stuff
So it's kind of neat
And mic stands
That's right and mic stands which yes is in our future
Because I was actually listening to a recent episode
And I'm like oh my god every time Dark Soccer I pick up a mic
You can kind of hear it
So depending on how you guys listen to the show
I've been trying not to pick up the mic that much
I know we are going to address that issue
It's just one of those like you know
Making it better one step at a time
But yeah mic stands
Even if they're like handheld mic stands
Even if we had like handheld mic stands
It would not make all the rattling that it does now
I'm doing some investigation
Okay please do
Alright speaking of YouTube and all that stuff
Another Twitch streamer has announced that they are leaving
But they're going to YouTube this time
So what we've had two big streamers leave Twitch for Mixer
And now we have
Courage, CooRage
I don't know it's Courage but the R is capitalized
I don't usually get into the celebrity streamer culture a lot
So I don't know who these folks are
Do you?
Nope no idea
Well he's a big
And I'm not trying to shade him I just don't know him
I don't know her
But his real name is Jack Dunlop
But he goes by Courage online
And he is going to be going exclusively to YouTube
He has 2.1 million Twitch followers
And already 1.9 million subscribers on YouTube
I think there are a lot of Twitch streamers that kind of double dip on YouTube a little bit
By the way go check out our YouTube channel at VOG Network
So that part's not completely unheard of
But yeah now he's going to go over there pretty much exclusively
So that's going to be very interesting
And it does
Folks are saying that YouTube as opposed to Mixer
Maybe makes a little more sense for this particular streamer
Because he said he wants to go beyond gaming
Like he wants to do cooking and ASMR
Although this could be like tongue and cheek type of announcements
But maybe he's looking to go a little bit beyond just gaming
Interesting
Very interesting because I'm really surprised
And I got to say this
I am really surprised at this point
That Twitch has not tried to take on YouTube a little more
Like I realize that Twitch is broad in its categories
We have the things like competitive eating and ASMR and all that stuff
But I'm really surprised that they
That they're almost scaling back on some of the video on demand features
Like we're losing the live commenting
We're losing the premiere stuff
Like that they're almost scaling back on that
When I would have thought that Amazon would have really made it
Because they own Twitch right
Amazon would have really made a play to take on YouTube
And try to meet YouTube in that space
I'm kind of surprised they haven't done that
Maybe it's just me
But maybe the audience has not shown it's there
It would be nice to have an alternative for YouTube
It would be very nice to have an alternative for YouTube
Maybe Twitch doesn't want to have to
Or Amazon in general doesn't want to have to police that
You know there's a lot of the dark side of YouTube
We've heard a lot about
And maybe Amazon's just like you know what
We'd rather not deal with it
Twitch community's pretty cool
They're already not
They're already kind of having difficulties policing Twitch stuff as it is
I guess that's true
It is getting more and more difficult the bigger and bigger it's getting
And like you know I know Dark Soccer brought up that really unfortunate shooting incident
And I don't mean to go to a horrible place
But the reality is like I know more recently
It wasn't that one but there was another one that very recently
Was streamed on Twitch
And so you know that's not Twitch's fault per se
You know but certainly they don't want to be involved with that shit
They don't like having their name put out there
Next to gross content like that
So you know it's going to be interesting
Anyway a little tangent but just something that kind of surprised me
One more article that does not have to do with streaming
But it does have to do with movies
We're going to bring up Hideo Kojima again
By the time you guys hear this
You will be sick of me
Death Stranding will be out
And I'm so curious to see how the
We've seen the reviews
But now I want to see how the general population takes to that game
I'm only about a week away from my live hate playthrough
Of Death Stranding
And that's going to be the title of the stream
Hate playing Kojima's latest art school project
Excited
Anyway
But in being interviewed by the BBC about Death Stranding
Because obviously Hideo Kojima is out there doing the circuit and the press and all that
Kojima mentioned that Kojima Productions
The studio he runs
Is going to venture into filmmaking
Which I don't know if this is a rumor or what
But when you hear that Death Stranding has a two hour cut scene at the end of the game
Maybe not too surprising to hear
That Kojima is interested in getting into filmmaking
I thought that was the same as Mel Gursault 4 had a really long cut scene at the end of the game too
He's kind of already making films
But it's interesting
I mean
For all the crap that people are giving Death Stranding for being a walking simulator
Or whatever, what the game is
Maybe this is causing people to really think
What would Death Stranding be like as a movie?
Who knows?
I mean we won't really know until more of us get our hands on the game
But what's Kojima going to be capable of in a movie space or a more traditional film space?
He certainly has plenty of friends in Hollywood to help him make it happen right?
So it's going to be interesting to see what happens if he were to get into that
So yeah
Excited to see if they actually really do go that way in the near future
Who knows?
So would Kojima announce a film at E3?
Or how would that work?
He'd probably get his buddy Jeff Keighley to help him out
I imagine that's how that would work
Yeah that would be the game awards type of thing
Yeah right?
So anyway
It would depend if his project is based on a game or not
Can you imagine if they made Metal Gear Solid a more traditional movie?
You know?
If they just took some of the concepts from Metal Gear Solid and made a 90 minute film out of it
Could be interesting
I don't know
Wasn't that already Metal Gear Solid 4?
Perhaps
I think that is on record of having the longest number of
The longest length of cutscenes total
I hate Death Stranding is almost out
Alright
Well you know Kojima wanted to go into filmmaking to begin with anyway
So
Yeah
So maybe this is one way
Maybe he's going through that midlife crisis right now
Where he's like I gotta do that thing I always wanted to do when I was younger
And never got around to doing
And now I have all these holl-
I'm friends with Conan O'Brien I can do what I want
No it might sound like I'm shading Hideo Kojima
But I'm really not
I actually think like a movie would be
I'd watch it
Hell yeah I would
Like he's a good storyteller so why not
It's only 90 minutes maybe 2 hours
Ok maybe a Kojima movie is going to be like Titanic length
Like 3 and a half hours
But I'd still watch it right
Alright anyway
Let's travel around the room
That's all we have for news
Again these are early headlines
Huge news could have broke Thursday or Friday
Unfortunately the magic of radio is not that strong
For us to have heard it in advance
But you know we'll talk about
If there's anything really big that breaks
We will talk about it on our next live episode of OLR
Which will be next Sunday when we return
Which by the way is also starting to shoulder up
On the big Bamani holiday of 19 November and 20 November
I believe the show is on the 10th
Or no excuse me 10th was we're missing
17th is when the next show will be
So we're starting to saddle up against that
Yeah
Bamani holiday so anyway
Alright let's travel around and just catch up with our hosts
I know it's only a couple days into the week
But I don't know if you guys have anything
Any personal tidbits you want to get out
Or what kind of video games you have been playing
With what little time we've had
Darsakha I know you were mentioning a little bit of The Sims
While you've been recovering
Yeah I'm still on Sims 4
That's really about it
Just because I don't really have much attention span
For anything with everything else I've got going on
And honestly instead of playing Sims 4
I really should be working on that website
And getting an email migration finished
But I'm still just sore and itchy
Yeah but even when you're working on a big project like that
Taking a 30 minute game break can sometimes be
Sims is not a 30 minute game break
Fair, fair
I started playing last night around midnight
And it was 4 in the morning when I quit
And the only reason I quit is because the game crashed
Because I would save the game
Did you say I played a little bit of Sims?
That is a little bit
That is a little bit of Sims
Because basically I have to gear myself up for it
And not make any plans
Cancel the Friday night plans
Order a pizza
Dim the lights
It's Sims night
Hey that's me and Civilization
So you know what
There's always going to be some game
Build the pool, remove the stairs
That doesn't work anymore
I will find creative ways to make that work dammit
And actually though
With the next household that I'm doing
I'm actually building the current version
Of the full house
Because the full plans
Yeah but I want to build it with the current design
There's actually pictures of it
It's really really cute inside
Like the actual house in San Francisco
So not what you see on TV
Because obviously what you saw on TV is not the actual house
I mean honestly it's a really gorgeous house
But I'm thinking about doing that
But I'm going to have it
I'm going to have a witch
A vampire and a ghost
Live in the house
Because I can't have a werewolf
Like in being human
So I'm going to try to recreate that
Thing and see how it lasts
If my ghost doesn't want to move off
Dark Sakura I hate to break this to you
But Halloween is over
Halloween
Is not just a holiday
It's a way of life
Listen this is how you do it
Okay because I was
She is Jack Skellington
By the way I know my cheat codes to pick what type of
Ghost I get and how they died
Like my kids were talking about the neighbors having their
Halloween decorations still up
I'm like it's fine all they have to do is put Christmas
Hats on everything or Santa hats
And then it's Christmas stuff
You can just put hats on everything
And then you can just keep it up all your own
They have one of those witches that looks like it's
Flown into the door those are hilarious
I never see those
Just put a Santa hat on that witch
They have the feet sticking out of the ground
Of course of course
And then they have this weird skeleton like
Grim reaper thing that's always
I tell the kids that it's always staring at them
And then one time somehow it triggered from
20 feet away so that freaked them out
Good times
You could just go eco and just put a real skeleton in your yard
Right
Humans are
Are uh
What's the word I'm thinking of
Biodegradable
Oh yeah well you think your garage haunted house
Is cool Karen? Well at my house we've got
The bodies exhibited
Anyway
Alright moving on
Loki what about you? What's going on with you?
I've just been playing more of
What the golf?
And I've like
They have the way it works is like they have
Different labs so it's like different themed
Courses or whatever they're in there but there's like a
Ton of levels it's ridiculous and then each
Level has like a par or
Like a slightly more challenging level than
Another challenging level on top of it
And they have homages to a bunch of stuff
There's homages to like Mario
Brothers um I'm playing through
One right now that's an homage to Portal
Um that was pretty cool and then
Um
Yeah so I've been just doing lots of that
I'm probably gonna work some more on my game
I'm starting to like
Feel that like frustration that
Haven't progressed very far recently
Because I've been trying to get my
Respawn stuff to work correctly
And it
Hasn't been because
And I don't know why like
I was trying to focus on doing the most
Simplest thing possible but
Because it's sort of modeled after
Smash TV all the enemies spawn
Through doors so they have to walk through a
Door and trying to program a
Door to only work at certain times
When like say the player is on the other
Side of the door and I need to open
But also not have the player be able to
Jump back through the door
It's a pain in the ass
So I've been stuck
With door logic and stuff
Trying to get like one way walls
To work and stuff and
In many creative ways to
Do that and always finding a way to
Somehow break it
So
I may just say fuck the doors eventually
And just spawn into the level like
I don't care anymore just whatever
I just want this to be done but
Stay tuned for Loki's second game fuck the doors
Alright
My week obviously I've been
Preparing for my trip to New York this weekend
Which I'm very excited about but now I'm like
I'm not going to be able to do everything
That we want to do like their text messaging
Today about everything they want to do I'm like we don't have that kind of time
And it's like trying to fit in
People and stuff too I'm just like oh my gosh
It's going to be a busy busy weekend but I am
Looking forward to it
But early in the week I'm
Still playing Final Fantasy 14
It's kind of a thing I get on and regularly do with my friends
My Machinist is almost 18
So I'll finally have a healer, a tank
And a DPS at 80
Since my Gunbreaker and my Astrologian are already
80 my Machinist will soon be there too
Which has been a lot of fun to play
And I'm still continuing on in Bloodstained
I made quite a bit more progress last night
I got past the second boss
Which is funny because for all the difficulty
The first boss in that game gave me
I one shotted the second boss
It is all about that drill weapon which we talked about last week
Dark Sakura that Dan
I guess used a lot too
That drill made that second boss cake
So yeah
Pro tip get that shard
From one of those guys that has the drill as soon as you can
Because it makes things easier
Anyway that's really it
For my gaming week so far
So with that let's go to Twitter
Because we did open up Twitter
For your questions
And we want to get to some of those questions
That you guys sent us
So let's get to some of these
So we had some tweets and our first tweet
With a question comes from
Superhulk1999
Who asked us
Will the new consoles come with enough
SSD hard drive space
Like at least
8 terabytes or more
And that's signed Mike B
So thanks for the question Mike B
What do you think?
It seems like when companies release new consoles
Maybe there isn't always enough storage
Right away especially for where the generation
Ends up by the end of its life
Yeah I don't think there's gonna be
Maybe I would see one or two terabyte
Hard drives in these consoles
I would like more
Especially when you look at like say
Red Dead Redemption 2 which just came out on PC
That's a 121 gigabyte download
And because everything
Works perfectly when you download it
As they're downloading it
Or they preloaded it early
And they go to decrypt it or whatever
It redownloaded it
Oh shit
Good job
Game sizes especially
They're pushing 4K and everything
And pushing better graphics
That's higher resolution textures
More uncompressed stuff
That's gonna fill up really fast
Yeah
So I think what their solution's
Gonna be is probably allowing
External storage again
And so they'll be on you to buy an external
5 terabyte drive or something like that
To load your shit on
But that's
That's unfortunate and in order to keep the cost down
That's what they're gonna have to do is cut back on storage
So I would hope that one to two terabytes
Would be the kind of norm but
Yeah I would think as game companies
Are pushing more and more and more to digital
You know and the digital downloads and so forth
They've gotta have more space
But I think these companies could get away with a
1 or 2 terabyte drive a solid state drive
Well but solid state drives
Don't really go that high
Like you know the tweeter says 8 terabytes
But the simple mac
Mac to fatter?
Fact of the matter
Yes the fact of the matter is
The solid state drives are usually much
Smaller than your like you know
I have a 3 terabyte drive in my computer
But it's not solid state
Cause most solid state drives you can buy at Fry's
Like they don't go much past like 500 gigs
Maybe you can get a terabyte
Yeah but maybe they can like
Decide how they want to store that data
So that they can put the stuff that they need
Faster on the solid state drive
And you know maybe cash in the other stuff
From like your larger drive
I don't know
I think it would be more important for
Expansion to be easy
Like you know for all the shit that Nintendo
Is not having any room on its console
At least it's very easy to buy a new card
And expand it right
You know in the Playstation 4 you can expand
You know fairly easy and so forth so
I think as long as you can expand on whatever they give you
Relatively easy it'll be less of a problem
One other thing to consider
I think is that gaming is going
To go more and more into the cloud
Right cause that's a big thing as we talk about
Project xCloud we know Sony
Has been getting some interesting partners
When it comes to cloud gaming
Well maybe that space
Won't be as important as we think
Because there will be stuff
In the cloud which is just
On the internet but you know
That's the term everybody uses in the cloud
So it'll be interesting to see maybe the effects that that
Has on space
But I will bet the first printing
Will not be nearly enough so let's just
Hope that they allow it to be expandable
So we have a foodie question next
So this is from Redertainment
Who tweets orange lounge
Foodio I'm looking for
Recipe app suggestions
IOS preferably free
No dietary restrictions
I already have the joy of cooking
How to cook everything and
Mia lime
So I haven't a clue
There was one called Pepper for a while
But I don't know that it was free
He said no website it's all
App right? Yeah he just said app
Well I mean cause you can go
On websites like I have Epicurious
And Bon Appetit
And all of that
Yeah and technically if I'm not mistaken
In Safari you just click a couple buttons
And you can turn any website into like an app
Button basically so it runs like
It is an app kinda
Well and on top of that I'm actually
In the middle of compiling all of the recipes
That I like to use
As a PDF
To put into Apple Books just for myself
But I just did a quick search
On the app store right now there's NYT
Which is New York Times recipes
There's Yummly, Tasty
Which I actually use Tasty that's the one
Done by Buzzfeed
I was gonna say I think Redotainment is looking for suggestions
And so but you've used
I've used them before
Cause I gotta admit
Epicurious has an app
I'm terrible with recipes
Like Alan is truly the one
Who cooks between the two of us
I know how to do chicken on the form and grill
But that's
The extent of my knowledge
I would
So Yummly is good but their
Website is pretty terrible
Their videos because they've
Done some very dangerous things
On their videos before
But I mean Epicurious I've always been really good
I made my first cake with an Epicurious recipe
I did it from their website
But apparently they have an app
And I think I'm gonna get the New York Times
Cooking one myself
Cause that one looks pretty good
I do a lot of baking lately
Alright
Getting into another tweet
This one isn't awkward at all
This comes to us from
You all know who that is right?
That is GrandpaWarcraft
Or Captain Matt from the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast
Who tweeted us
This lovely gem of a question
Why did you dump GrandpaWarcraft
In 2009?
He would've made a good boyfriend
Now
It's a completely awkward thing to tweet me
When you know I'm married
And I know he's saying that only tongue in cheek
I wouldn't have read that on air
He just wasn't being a sass master
Because that's what he does
He drinks and he sasses
Sometimes you know
This has happened to everybody
At some point in their life
They go out on a date and they go
This person is going to be a great friend
Right?
And we are great friends
We did a podcast together for so many years
I live in his old house
And the reality is
If you had been my boyfriend
You'd be dead by now
Alright
Womp womp
I had to give him an answer
He'd enjoy
We're going on the
Star Trek Cruise together very soon
So I hope
I'm going to print out this tweet and frame it
And hang it in my cabin
Matt
And just remember it's 7 days and nights
At sea with me and my husband
Alright
Moving on
Girl
Look
If he's going to be awkward
I'm going to make it more awkward
Awkwarder?
Alright one more question
Coming from Flaco Jones
A more serious topic
Yeah come break our show again Flaco we miss you
Alright
Flaco Jones asks
Not sure if you got into this last week
But I noticed a lot of debate
About Death Stranding
Being good but not fun
In some reviewers opinions
My question is
Do games have to be fun?
If all games have to be fun
No matter what
Doesn't that prove that games
Can't be art
There's a difference between fun
And enjoyment
You know? Like you can
Enjoy something but not exactly
Have the most amount of fun looking at it
Right? Like
Like looking at
A painting. Like looking at Bosch
One of my favorite ever paintings
In the universe is
The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch
It's the same one that's got
Like the person
With the chicken head
And the ass bent over with people coming out of it
And the egg and all the weirdness
Because Bosch was an interesting fella
But I wouldn't say
That's a fun painting
It's not like something that's comfortable to look at
But it's enjoyable
Makes sense?
Yeah and I would say too that like
You know sometimes it's not necessarily about fun
I mean yes
Video games should be fun
It should be something that makes you feel good
But at the same time
I think it's more about emotion
Because art invokes emotion
Art invokes response right?
The biggest insult an artist
Can see with their work
Is for it to evoke nothing
But I would say like movies
We compare games to movies a lot
And going out to the movies
Is fun right?
But then I think about the time I went and saw
The movie Dancer in the Dark starring
Dancer in the Dark
And I cried so hard
And so much that I was like scream crying
At the end of the movie
And my shirt was like halfway soaked
I don't know if I would call that experience
Fun
But does that mean Dancer in the Dark is not art?
Yeah
So I kind of think there's like a similar sort of thing here
It's not necessarily that I went to the movie
And I realized Dancer in the Dark
Is a bit of an obscure pick
But pick a sad movie that you've seen
I see the grudge
Any kind of Japanese horror movie
That doesn't necessarily have a happy ending
Cause like American movies are all about
Happy endings and shit
What about like a serious movie
Like a Schindler's List
A Saving Private Ryan
You know movies that are
Kind of about some very serious heavy
Topics
But it's kind of like you get
And I don't think I would call either of those movies
Fun
I mean I go they're bad
Or I had a bad time or I regret seeing them
There's a difference between enjoyment
And having fun
I look at fun as a kind of a positive
Mirthful sort of thing
But to enjoy just means that you get
Some sort of satisfaction out of it
Right
There's also something to consider
This might actually be true of some games
I say that about Dancer in the Dark
I don't know if I would watch that movie
Again
There's other movies out there
I know I'm trying to think of something
I wouldn't say that Everybody's Gone under the Rapture
Was fun
But it's enjoyable and provocative
Like and there's certain games where I'm like
I'm glad I played that
And I'm really glad I experienced that
But I'm probably never going to play that again
Yeah I don't think I can go play it again
You know just
I had
I was playing it
I played it on stream
I kind of
Part of me was just I played it privately
Because I did have just a response
Where I had to you know once I was off camera
I was like oh my god
Oh my god and I had already seen you play it
It's a heavy game and again
I think so many people slept on this game
Because I got smacked with a walking simulator
Type of thing
Maybe that is a great
Because Death Stranding keeps getting labeled with this
Walking simulator and all this thing
Like that was a game where everybody's gone
And I remember the rapture got that whole thing about
Where's the game? What are you doing? What's the game?
A game
It's a narrative
I don't look at it as a game
I look at it as an interactive narrative
And honestly those are the kinds of games
I've personally been getting more into lately
Are those kinds
Other than building houses and watching my sims die
But I like the ones
Where you're living the story
You're seeing it unfold
Like To the Moon was another good one
I think the game
In Everybody's Gone to the Rapture was the exploration
Because you didn't necessarily do things
In the same order
There is a way you can play that game
Where you can beat it in like 15 minutes
If you just skip everything basically
But I don't think you'd get the same thing
Out of that necessarily
It's going and exploring and getting all the little
All the little
Unlocks, bits of story and the memories
That you unlock
Are part of the reward system
That you earned for doing your effort
An example akin to that
Is something like Lost Odyssey
You remember that classic Xbox 360 game
That really just was Final Fantasy
Under a different name pretty much
But part of Lost Odyssey was that the main character was immortal
It's not a spoiler, it's established in the opening
Is that the main character is immortal
And you get these books
Throughout the story
As you're playing a video game
You sit there and you read a book
Skyrim and Oblivion do this too
There's books in there
And some people go, meh, reading
And just throw away the book, right Logie?
Yes
But other people, especially in I think Lost Odyssey
Because if you actually go
And you read those books
It's like, holy shit
Some of those stories
Have almost a stronger
Emotional impact than the game
So isn't it weird
That we're talking about an art form
Embedded in another art form
Emotional response embedded within another
Emotional response
Or what about lore hunters in series
Like, you know, because
When I was playing WoW
I mean, the biggest thing that I got enjoyment out of
Was lore hunting
Was reading the books and seeing the things
And then, of course, breaking the game with my demon hunter
And there's some people that will play MMOs
And I'm sometimes guilty of this
They'll just, oh, quest text, meh
They skip it, it's like, what am I supposed to do in this quest, right?
But you're right, there's a whole rich world
In that, if you want to experience that
Anyway, I think we might be getting a little bit lost
From the original question that was asked
But I think we are kind of giving some examples
Is that there's also, like, different
There's different ways to have fun
Yeah
And sometimes that exploration
That sort of is the fun
And I think Death Stranding, if what I'm hearing about it
Is true, and again, I'm not going to know this
Till the next episode when I get to play it for myself
There might be a part of Death Stranding
That's kind of like everybody's gone to the rapture
Where it's like, you could just focus on the game part
Which maybe is not going to be the most
Maybe it is just going to be walking and tricky balancing
But if you allow yourself to get immersed
In that story and that universe around it
Then potentially
There might be more fulfillment out of that
And you might be left with a more rewarding sense out of that
I'm looking forward to the story aspects of it
Yeah
You know, and
That's why, like, for example, Breath of the Wild
Yeah, very
It could look like a very simple story
On the surface, but when you're
But I like seeing the way the societies are built
And the language behind it
And seeing how they've built the world
The world that something exists in
To me is more of the game than the game
Isn't it interesting, Dark Sakura
How, like, you and I
Especially, like, in the early
Reveals of this Death Stranding thing
We're both kind of like, what?
Okay, where's the game, right?
We're both kind of, like, sitting here going, come on
Right? But now it's like,
Now that we know more and more about it
It's kind of like, I have this morbid curiosity
But I'm more fascinated with this than ever
Yeah, and I mean
And you know me, I'm attracted to kind of the
Offshoot weirdo kind of storylines
Anyway
But it's like, I'll put it this way
I have learned a whole
In-game written language before
I mean, I've forgotten it since then
Because this was in high school
But I mean, my friends and I used to write
Each other codes in
And in other, you know, kind of
In-game languages
In a game that we've played before
You know, so having just
That richness to it
And I really think this is going to be a very rich
Universe with the work that's put into it
And the people behind it
So, yeah
Yeah, so we'll see
Great question, Flocko
Made a great conversation
Out of it, so
Love to have those here on the show
Sadly, that's all the questions we got
But, you know, the last time
We got probably twice as many
But we also had twice as much
So, that's alright
We're gonna try to really grow the family
Here at OLR as we move into our 800th
Episode and so forth, try to get the word out
God, that many
What are we gonna do when we hit a thousand?
That's still
A thousand would be
A good four years away
You know, I just like, I'm saying when
Because I think it's gonna happen
There's a, okay, real block
There's that honest part of me that's like, are we gonna
Hit a thousand? I'm like, oh my god
Four more years of this, but then I'm like
Didn't we think we were gonna hit 500?
We never thought we'd hit 500 and here we still are
So it's like, it's one of those things where it's like
I don't know what I'd do with myself
Maybe I'm not having fun, but I'm enjoying the ride
So if you're not having fun, is this art?
Is this art?
I'm choking some emotions
I mean, and not just to go back
On the nostalgic, you know, thing before
But look at what all of us have done
Every single one of us
In this room have gotten married
Yeah
One of us has spawned
One of us has prevented spawning
We have
Animals
We have lost people close to us
Yes
We have gained people that we don't want to be close to us
And lost them
And lost them
In a different sense
We have changed jobs
Yeah, all of us have changed jobs
All at some point in this room have been fun employed
Rob
No
No, you have not
I have not been fun employed
I was super fun employed though and that was great
Except I like money
You know, we adult harder than we used to
But
That's not fun, but it's enjoyable
But I'm just saying, it's like
No, for sure
I don't see any point in giving up
No, you're right, you're right
We will continue to do this until
One of two things
Either we can't
We're not able to get in the same room
And do this anymore on Sunday nights
Rob has a full hip replacement
Yeah, I mean, well
We physically can't
That might be one reason we don't do it anymore
Or we just kind of decide
I think we've said everything we have to say
No, that'll never happen
See, that's where I'm kind of at
Well, we've kind of
That is never going to happen
We still find new things to say
I don't know, here's
Let me ask this honest question
I'm going to reward those that have stuck around
With a bonus episode this deep in
With some real deep content here
Oh, yeah
Do you think your emotions
And your feelings about gaming
Are as strong as they were
When OLR first started
Probably more so
I mean, I wouldn't say that I am the gamer
I was
You know, ten years ago
Fifteen years ago, etc.
You know, I like to think that I've
I've
Grown
As a gamer
And grown into different tastes
You know, but
I think that
As I've grown and matured through it
I've got different attitudes
And when I see people
Who are now in the position that I was
When we started
I feel like I've got more to contribute
So, I mean, does that make sense?
No, no, totally, for sure
I don't know, like
I have to admit there's a part of me that's having
A harder and harder time staying on top
Of everything that's going on in gaming
And I don't know if that's because of my
Tendency to just kind of use MMOs
As my gaming crutch or what have you
Where I'm just kind of like, this is my comfort zone
This is my place and the thing that I do
But I feel like it's been harder
As the years go on to really stay on top
Of everything that's going on in gaming
And I don't know if this is also like a sign of getting older
But there's also some times where you kind of look at
Like these things that
The big discussions and debate that gamers are having
Where you kind of go like, I don't know if I
Get that, or I don't know if I
Understand why people
Are having that type of reaction
I think it's necessarily like
Before, like I know when we first
That's where you respond, okay boomer
Just kidding, GenX
GenX, it's GenX
Thank you
I think right now it's just
We've kind of grown with
Before, like I thought I had to
Get everything to be able to talk about everything
And then it's just like
It's like, look how much money I've wasted on
Like all these systems I didn't play
It's like, okay, we'll just scale back
With what you get
And not necessarily
Purchase every single game that comes out
Yeah, I still do catch myself
Doing that, like I have several
Games that are like big titles that I have
Not touched at all, like Kingdom Hearts 3
Just the other day
I'm like, oh yeah, I do have that game, don't I?
So like, I have this whole library
Of stuff I haven't touched, but I'll pick stuff up
Because I feel like I want it
But that's going to be the same thing
I think when the next-gen systems come out
It's just like, I'm not going to buy
Both of those systems
I will see what happens
But I don't know
I don't feel the need to do that
Even right now, I haven't played my PlayStation 4 in months
So
I don't know
I mean, we'll see
It's time, really, a lot of it
We don't have as much time as we used to
Dedicate the stuff like that
You have to balance it between everything else
So, yeah
I don't know
Anyway, the other thing
I'll piggyback on what you were saying to our Sakura
About just having
This place to do the show
And everything that has transformed in our lives
While the show has gone on
I think there's something to be said as well
About the way we've watched our audience
Grow with us
And the things that our audience has done
We have seen folks from our audience
Go on to do their own shows
And to do their own live streaming
And broadcasting and getting their voices
Truly out there
And in many ways, and I really mean this when I say it
There is truly no greater compliment
To what we've done
Here at OLR than the fact that
Some of you
Feel empowered to do the same
Yeah
And I think that alone has made this adventure
Worth it
I sound like it's over, but it's not
The road thus far
We're entitled to a little rumination
Sure, of course
We're fucking old
What happens when you talk to the old player character
In the video games?
Well, let me tell you about it
Let me spin you a tale
Girl
You know, I think that also
I mean, just go back and listen
To even a hundred episodes back
We're always
You know, I think that in some cases
The people who have stayed with us
Have our own personal struggles that we've had
On the show
That I think
That maybe even outside of just the realm of gaming
You know, we're people
And if anything that we might have experienced
Will help other people
Then I'm fine sharing those experiences
With people
Yeah, for sure
That's why I talk about my health openly
That's why I talk about
Real life stuff openly
Because it's not
The games that you're playing can also be a reflection
Of where you are mentally
For sure
You made me think about
The greatest
Feeling, the greatest reward
The greatest thing I've probably ever felt
From doing this show
When you talk about being open with your life
And being your authentic self here on air
The emails I've gotten
Where they were like
I think it's a little different now in the year 2019
But this show's been around for 17 years
In the earlier years of the show
Especially when we were first a podcast
2006, 2007, right?
When I got that email that said
Rob, you being your authentic self
And being a quote unquote
Normal gay guy
But that's, you know
When people are in their feelings
I totally get why somebody phrases it that way
You being a normal gay guy
Out and open and a gaming fan like me
It helped me
To accept that this was a part of myself
Just thinking about it
There is no
There is no greater reward, period
And I think
Just with our dynamic on here
The three of us
We actually
Kind of represent a different demographic
Each of us
That can interact together
I think that's what's kept this show going
As long as it has
There's been nights
We can get into it
Very passionate opinions
And I'm sure we've said things that maybe even
Piss some of our listeners off
But at the end of the day
They kind of come back because
It's that bar where you go where everybody knows your name
That whole thing, right?
It's like this, we have a strong friendship here
Where it's like, we're going to have passion
We're going to have opinions
We're going to have those things
But at the end of the day
We're all cut from the same nerd cloth
I guess
I'm just the poorly sewn one
I'm the amateur cosplayer
Of the group now
Fuzzy wuzzy feelings
That was deep
Someone fart before I get, you know
Well I will say you know that Loki
Followed up the tweet that Flocko
Wrote putting fun plus
Art equals
Fart
So there you go
We hope you found this episode
This bonus episode of Orange Laundry
Is a big gigantic fart
That's fun plus art
Thank you for sticking with us
Through this bonus episode
Through however many episodes you've listened to Orange Laundry
One other thing I wanted to say real quick
Sorry not to go back to the deep stuff
I think we've been talking behind the scenes
About trying to do some creative
Kicks in the butt
For episode 800
We kind of always ask ourselves
How do we celebrate 17 years?
How do we celebrate another year?
How do we celebrate another hundred episodes
When you've been doing it like this long right?
And I think like a creative kick in the butt
And I don't want to over promise and under deliver
So that's why I'm trying to like really bite my tongue
On like what we want to do
You trash your hotel room and hire hookers
No but I think when we like creatively
Kind of go back to the show and go
What can we, what can we like
Tune up behind the scenes
What we want to do different, what we want to do better
What makeover do we want to give ourselves
I think it's a nice little like invigoration
Last one right? When we took the show
And moved it to Twitch
It was a big like creative kick in the ass
You know and it's
It kind of keeps you going just that much longer
So I think
I look forward to 800 episodes for that reason
Because like how are we going to kick ourselves in the butt
Now to keep moving
So our show is old enough to vote
Next year
Just in time for the next election
Fuck don't get me started on that
Alright then with that
I will shut it down tonight
We've been going for quite a bit for a pre-recorded show
So it's almost 9 o'clock here
And I know everybody has their lives to get back to
But it would not be an episode of Orange Laundry
Now keep in mind this was a bonus episode technically
We're not going to number this one
So there was no classic game of the week
We didn't do some of our regular segments
All of that stuff will come back next week
In a normal episode of Orange Laundry
But we will go around and get everybody's
Final thoughts still
DarkSakura, your final thought for us
I'm kind of hungry
We've kind of gone during the dinner time hours
Doing this show
So I don't blame you for that feeling
Loki, your final thought
So I've been following
Salt and Straw which is an ice cream place
That they have by Disneyland
And they have monthly flavors
That they put out
They have five different flavors that are based on
Thanksgiving
One of them is salted caramel Thanksgiving turkey
It's salted caramel with crispy
Turkey skin
You lost me at caramel
Okay, my final thought is
You inspired me to do one
Last thing here because I have something you have to try
Uh oh
Uh oh
Okay
Uh oh, Rob just got
Giggly and went and grabbed something
Oh fuck, are these leis?
No, worse
Okay, so these are from Trader Joe's
They're kettle chips
Turkey and stuffing
I need to try this
Loki, if you will
I ate one, I thought it was fucking nasty
But I'm not huge on Thanksgiving food
Here you go, Darth Zarya
It definitely smells like stuffing
You can thank Alan for bringing these
There you go, Pikachu
What do you think?
It tastes like gravy a little bit
This is fucking yummy
If Alan doesn't like them
I'm giving you the bag
It's alright
I don't like them
It's got a weird aftertaste
You know what, when leis had that
Biscuit and gravy flavor, the first time I had that
I was like, this is fucking gross
But then it was like
One of those, I'm hungry and it's the only option
I ate it again, I'm like, these aren't that bad
I like to shout down a little bit
These remind me though
Because I'm definitely getting that turkey
And the stuffing
I really like it
That's redundant
But you know I also like those
Soy and butter chips
Oh yeah
Those are really good
Alright, well it started and it ended with food
Have a great night everybody
