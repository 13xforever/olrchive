0	17320	This week, Toyota decides that its legacy in racing games should not continue to be
17320	19240	arse and resumes licensing their cars.
19240	21660	Get your Supra on in Forza Horizon 4 soon.
21660	24640	This is just one headline from the Week in Gaming News, stay tuned for the rest, starting
24640	29760	right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
29760	35640	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35640	37520	where every gamer has a voice.
37520	43520	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 799 for this November the 24th
43520	45480	of 2019.
45480	49680	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
49680	50680	Sup.
50680	51680	Hi, how are you?
51680	52680	I'm here.
52680	53680	Glad to have you here as always.
53680	57080	Thank you for bringing a refill on the coffee supplies tonight, appreciate that.
57080	60200	I thought it was something better than what I grabbed, but I'm glad it tastes pretty good.
60200	64040	Yeah, it was like this, it wasn't like coffee beans, it was like a mix thing that was like
64040	65040	mocha mix.
65040	66040	It was pretty good.
66040	67040	No, it was not bad.
67040	68040	Coffee powers OLR.
68040	71840	Unless you're Tech Master Loki over there to my side here.
71840	74480	In which case, sugar free Red Bull is what powers Loki.
74480	75480	Sure.
75480	76480	How are you doing?
76480	77480	I'm fine.
77480	78480	Yeah?
78480	79480	Good, good.
79480	83400	All right, we are live on Twitch TV over twitch.tv slash VOG network or VOG network
83400	87760	for the voice geeks network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
87760	90920	nine o'clock Eastern ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
90920	95000	I say ish because if he has a long show, if he has a lot to talk about like he did tonight,
95000	96400	he loves his VR stuff.
96400	100120	So today was or this week was a pretty big week in AR, I think we're going to get right
100120	103360	into that here at the top of the show, but we do tape live of course, right after Bobby
103360	107840	does at the voice geeks network and we invite you guys to participate along with our chat
107840	111000	room over at twitch.tv slash VOG network.
111000	114440	But if you're listening on the podcast feed, hey, that's great too.
114440	116000	We appreciate all the support.
116000	121680	I should say as well tonight is, as you may notice, episode number 799, which means next
121680	125720	week, which is bound to be a slow news week, which is a, I'm not even sure we should really
125720	126880	be doing a show next week.
126880	127880	We will.
127880	128880	We will.
128880	129880	We're going to be here.
129880	133480	Because the holiday and the, I say, why would we, because the holiday in the US.
133480	138460	So for the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, many people travel and go places.
138460	141780	It's a big, uh, you know, eating dinner together type of holiday.
141780	146500	Um, but, uh, unless you're me, then you go out and eat with, you know, your significant
146500	147500	other and your dad.
147500	148500	That's it.
148500	151620	This is three of us going out, but do you know where we're going this year?
151620	156020	Actually, we're going to the local Brazilian grill for Thanksgiving.
156020	160740	So in addition, the fire and flame, in addition, Dan and I had an anniversary there once.
160740	161740	Yeah.
161740	165640	In addition to the meat parade that they have there, they have all the fixes for Thanksgiving.
165640	170540	So I'm hoping, yeah, I'm hoping to get the giant Turkey on the sword and grilled pineapple.
170540	171540	That's awesome.
171540	172540	I should have done that.
172540	177800	But then my wife decided to see, we were going to have Thanksgiving without family.
177800	181880	And then one of the family asked and I said, no, because the plan was, we're not having
181880	183400	Thanksgiving in the family.
183400	186120	Then one of her family asked and she said, yes.
186120	188820	You know what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving?
188820	190800	Not cooking, letting someone else do it.
190800	194940	I have to do a bunch of baking because like I was like, they're like, Oh, they want us
194940	198020	to bring some like, okay, I'll make some roast potatoes and I'll make my cranberry
198020	199020	sauce.
199020	200020	Dan's like, they want you to bake.
200020	201020	I'm like...
201020	202020	So they're open on Thanksgiving?
202020	203020	Yeah.
203020	204380	Oh, a lot of restaurants open on Thanksgiving.
204380	208440	And a big thank you to the staff for doing that because I know we see a lot of crap this
208440	212180	time of year about retail workers working on Thanksgiving, which, you know, it's, I
212180	216700	don't, I just, I don't like shopping during, I don't like shopping at all this weekend
216700	219240	because it's, it's, it's parking lots.
219240	221260	Parking lots are hell on earth.
221260	222260	I'm not doing it.
222260	225500	So, you know, and I realized there's the whole controversy with, with workers and everything,
225500	227780	but the reality is there are a lot of people that work on Thanksgiving.
227780	230020	Emergency personnel, people who work at gas stations.
230020	234260	I just don't think people should be working like during Thanksgiving lunch.
234260	235260	Yeah.
235260	238100	So hopefully, hopefully they have a nice way to split it up or something.
238100	239720	Um, but, uh, yeah.
239720	243340	So thank you to all the restaurant people out there and folks that do work Thanksgiving.
243340	247380	They don't want to be, I think though, I remember one year we asked the server like, Oh, are
247380	248380	you sad?
248380	251100	You have to, you know, be, well, I think we said it more tastefully than that, but we're
251100	253740	kind of like, Oh, how do you feel about working here Thanksgiving?
253740	257540	And they were like, I don't mind it because the tips are great today.
257540	260100	So not everybody, not everybody.
260100	263780	So hopefully, hopefully many folks out there get to do it by choice and aren't forced to,
263780	270220	or at least those that are forced to have a way to still enjoy the holiday however you
270220	271220	like.
271220	275620	Anyway, maybe enjoying the holiday for you is a marathon video game session where you
275620	277700	finally get to catch up on your backlog.
277700	278700	Show of hands.
278700	283460	Who's binging a Pokemon sword or shield, Death Stranding, any of the other new releases that
283460	287520	came out in the past week or so, uh, or the past month, past year.
287520	289340	How many of you guys are going to binge those this weekend?
289340	291180	My advice, go outside.
291180	293300	Well, you could, you could do both.
293300	294300	Yes.
294300	295300	Take it with you.
295300	296300	You're on a switch.
296300	297300	That's true.
297300	298300	Why aren't you playing a switch?
298300	299300	That's right.
299300	300300	I can go play Pokemon shield at the park.
300300	301300	Why not?
301300	302580	Uh, anyway, you know, that thing's going to be on me all the time when animal crossing
302580	303580	comes out.
303580	304580	Yeah, it's true.
304580	305580	It's true.
305580	307460	Anyway, uh, let's start off the show tonight with our kickoff topic.
307460	311500	I'm talking about a game that sadly will not be portable, uh, because the technology
311500	316680	is not really there to make a setup like this go portable, but, um, Loki, do you want to
316680	317680	start us off?
317680	320680	You're talking about, uh, what just got announced this week?
320680	325460	So did this, did the ceiling open up and did microphones fall from the snow?
325460	330520	Because this is not the same, not the same.
330520	337240	So we got a brand new half life, um, trailer for a game called half life.
337240	342080	Um, Alex wanted to say Alexa, but I didn't.
342080	348160	So half life Alex and it's going to be a brand new VR game that's coming out, um, in March
348160	350560	of next year and it looks pretty cool.
350560	357120	It takes place between the first and second half life games and yeah, I mean, that's all
357120	358120	I know.
358120	362600	I'm a terrible person because I've never played a half life game despite, well, they just
362600	368240	sit, uh, idly collecting dust with the rest of my backlog that's in, um, my scene library.
368240	371680	And yes, I would like to say that, well, now we've got the Thanksgiving break, maybe I
371680	374920	can go play as this, but I know better that I'm never going to do that.
374920	378720	So, um, I'll play it someday.
378720	380720	Yeah, I must've missed.
380720	381720	Go ahead.
381720	384040	It's not enough to make me want to play it because it's VR.
384040	385040	I won't play it.
385040	388640	Well, I'll totally play it for VR, but like, um, I don't know.
388640	393640	Um, I, I have not really gotten into half life, the half life series myself.
393640	395480	Um, I'm kind of in your boat, Loki.
395480	398920	Like I have some of the games, especially cause the orange box, I actually know I did
398920	400880	play.
400880	404760	When the orange box came out, I remember trying to play half life, but I didn't really get
404760	410320	like absorbed into it, but my husband loves half life and I'm sure you all are very curious
410320	411320	for Alan's thoughts.
411320	413440	We will get those thoughts later in the program.
413440	414440	He's out on an errand right now.
414840	415840	He'll be back around seven o'clock.
415840	420040	So I, he's the resident half-life Stan, uh, here in this house, we will get his thoughts
420040	421440	a little later in the show.
421440	423920	However, I can still appreciate for what it's worth.
423920	429120	I was very taken with how good it looked like I thought the graphics, well, it's the new
429120	430120	source engine.
430120	431120	Yeah, exactly.
431120	436080	And I think that's a big part of it is because, you know, we haven't had a new official valve
436080	439120	game in a long time, like a long time.
439120	442120	I should say, I should say like a mainline valve game, cause I know you could throw the
442120	446640	Dota card game thing at me, or, you know, the fact that they've been working on the,
446640	452600	the VR, uh, you know, uh, the, the palette of games that comes with HTC Vive and so forth,
452600	453600	those experiences.
453600	460040	Um, but I mean like, uh, like a mainline fricking game, you know, uh, I don't think there, there's
460040	464840	really been one of those since what, like Dota two would probably be the closest or
464840	467480	even maybe portal to those kids for a long time.
467480	473240	I don't remember what came out last was a Dota two or was it there?
473240	482440	They did like a VR mini experience thing for the, um, well, yeah, that's what I was saying
482440	486600	is that the VR thing for the HTC Vive, but I don't count that because that's essentially,
486600	488360	it's not like a mainline game.
488360	489360	You know what I mean?
489360	490360	That's it.
490360	491360	But I'm glad that source two is out finally.
491360	496440	Cause then other people that want to make games in that can maybe now mod stuff into
496440	497440	it.
497440	502000	I feel like what's probably taken a long time for valve to make a new like main game, if
502000	505920	you will, is the fact that it's the, it's the source engine that they've been working
505920	506920	on.
506920	511280	And, and now, you know, I presumably, I don't think we've had it confirmed unless one of
511280	517440	you guys knows different, but, uh, presumably this half-life Alex is running on some semblance,
517440	523960	excuse me, of a source engine part three, um, which three or two or two, I don't know
523960	524960	anymore.
524960	526560	Uh, they go, they don't go to three.
526560	527560	That's how you know.
527560	528560	Okay.
528560	529560	The newest source engine.
529560	530560	Excuse me.
530560	534360	Uh, it's going to be source engine Alex when it goes to three.
534360	539160	But I got to say it looked really good and honest to God, my gut reaction was, man, I
539160	543080	wish I could play this with a mouse and keyboard cause it looks like a really nice game, but
543080	547880	I don't know if it's going to be enough for me to jump to VR on PC.
547880	549680	Like I like VR.
549680	554440	Um, I have PlayStation VR and I like some of the things I've checked out with that,
554440	561280	but I'm not sure for one game in a series I'm kind of on if I want to jump into PC VR,
561280	564720	especially because I feel like the way technology is progressing, the VR is just getting like
564720	565960	better and better.
565960	566960	I don't know.
566960	567960	I'm a little bit torn.
567960	568960	I guess.
568960	571160	I mean, you could just probably borrow my Oculus rift.
571160	575040	I mean, well, if you're offering now we're talking, there's a way to enjoy it without
575040	579800	having to drop all that money on a, you know, PC, it's just sitting in a box right now.
579800	583720	I mean, I eventually plan on bringing it out again, but it's just, it's sitting in a box
583720	584720	right now.
584720	585720	Cause it's really the only space I have to play.
585720	590440	The rift is in the kitchen and yeah, it's not always convenient to do that.
590440	595280	But anyway, from looking at the trailer, honestly, that was my gut reaction was like, Hey, this
595280	597160	game looks like really good.
597160	601840	Like if this is the engine that valve is working on now, I hope they're going to use this to
601840	605320	make, can we get another orange box, another orange box, please?
605320	611240	Well, or make another portal, make another left for dead, make another, or if they are
611240	616520	insistent on not ever counting to three with one of their franchises, making a new experience
616520	619920	that uses the engine, I think would be really cool.
619920	623600	License that shit out to other people to make your games.
623600	626000	So that was, that was my honest to God reaction to the trailer.
626000	627480	I was like, neat, too bad.
627480	631000	I'm not going to spend the money to play this, but dang, if that's where valve is at right
631000	633520	now, I hope they turn out some more games with that.
633520	634520	That's honest to God.
634520	636640	Well, why would you work on an engine if you're not going to use it?
636640	640360	I mean, they're getting the very least license it out to other companies to make games where
640360	642480	why develop an engine if you're gonna make one game for it?
642480	645680	You would hope, but at the same time that EA engine can go, what is it?
645680	646680	Frostbite?
646680	647680	What is it?
647680	648680	What is it?
648680	649680	Yeah, but they use it for every single goddamn game that they have.
649680	650680	It needs to die in a fire.
650680	653680	It doesn't need to die in a fire, it's just they should stop forcing everybody to use
653680	654680	it.
654680	655680	It looks pretty good for Dragon Age Inquisition.
655680	659400	Yeah, but like you've heard the horror stories about how some games trying to work with that,
659400	662640	like, you know, that engine is part of the reason why Mass Effect Andromeda came up way
662640	664960	short of what they really wanted to do.
664960	668360	Like Mass Effect Andromeda was supposed to be like Mass Effect No Man's Sky, but it was,
668360	674040	I mean, if rumors are to be believed, but you can tell that Mass Effect Andromeda, like
674040	676080	it's disjointed.
676080	679160	And I think that's why, I mean, this narrative would certainly explain why.
679160	683680	If it's like Mass Effect No Man's Sky, those sex scenes are going to be some fucking weird
683680	684680	shit.
684680	687680	That's all I guess.
687680	689280	I don't know what it's doing.
689280	690280	All right.
690280	692360	Let me look at some comments in our chat.
692360	696680	Kaijuto in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says they could have skipped Half-Life
696680	698720	and went for a portal VR.
698720	700520	That would have been so freaky.
700520	706840	I worry about like, you know, already we know Dark Soccer is not the biggest fan of VR because
706840	709940	she gets motion sick pretty easy.
709940	715200	And when I think of a game like Portal in VR, I'm going like, I don't, I would get motion
715200	716200	sick.
716200	717200	They had a game.
717200	719200	They had what wasn't VR.
719200	724200	It was a version of Portal that used the motion controllers.
724200	725560	So that's what Bobby's talking about.
725560	728440	Valve actually did license a portal VR experience.
728440	734560	Oh, well also they, they had the, I want to say it was for the PlayStation three, uh,
734560	740120	was a DLC or something like that that used the PlayStation move controllers.
740120	743800	Maybe they had something similar with that on the PC as well, but there was something
743800	744800	that did that.
744800	750640	It was kind of, um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat, the break man in chat says, Alex
750640	752240	looks so good.
752240	753480	It makes me drool.
753480	755120	Uh, is that a problem?
755120	757140	No, you are free to like what you like.
757140	759600	And I'm sure there's a lot of people that are very excited about this.
759600	761160	I'm not saying I'm not excited.
761160	763960	I'm more excited for the engine than I am the game.
763960	765160	If that makes sense.
765160	766340	That's that's where I'm at.
766340	768640	And so, and to your point, it looks good.
768640	769960	Yeah, it looks good.
769960	772320	That's why I'm like, Ooh, I wonder what else they're going to do in this.
772320	775280	I wonder if they're going to make keyboard and mouse, you know, more traditional games
775280	778200	for this or, or what else is going to be possible with this.
778200	782740	But I also completely understand like, whereas I am of the mindset where I'm like, damn,
782740	785580	I would love to play this if it was keyboard and mouse.
785580	789900	And I'm sure some type of hacker is going to make that happen where you, I mean, but
789900	794260	not to say it's going to be any fun that way, because I'm sure there's going to be certain,
794260	797860	you know, kind of like how the Wii U shows off the Wii U, the, the touch pad and how
797860	802260	the Wii games, you know, I think there's going to be things in it that aren't going to work
802260	803820	per se on keyboard and mouse.
803820	809420	So even though a hacker might hack it to run on a monitor, like, is it gonna be the same?
809420	810420	Probably not.
810820	815540	Get very soon to a place you get stuck, unless hackers work on bypasses or something that's
815540	820260	probably going to take too much effort, honestly, that probably isn't worth their time.
820260	826020	But anyway, I completely understand why Valve, because they have entered this VR space with
826020	833860	almost said Oculus Rift with HTC Vive, whatever one of them, Valve has entered that space.
833860	838920	I understand, you know, they've got to back that up by throwing the weight of one of their
838920	844720	mighty franchises behind it, and really doing what they can to get it moving, you know,
844720	847680	get the sales moving, get people excited about VR.
847680	848680	So this is what they're doing.
848680	852400	They're doing the first Half-Life game in Lord knows how long since whenever the orange
852400	857160	box came out, which was probably 14, 13, 14 years ago at this point, maybe even further
857160	858320	back than that.
858320	859800	This show was going when it came out.
859800	863360	I remember that because, well, right, it was Xbox 360.
863360	873120	So it's, I think it was 2005, no, 2005 was still the Xbox 2007, maybe, okay, that was
873120	878000	around the launch of the PlayStation three, and it wasn't that podcast switch to being
878000	880160	about all games and not just music based games.
880160	881500	I'm pretty sure it sounds about right.
881500	884080	Like fall of 2017.
884080	885080	That sounds, or you mean 2007.
885080	886080	I'm sorry, 2007.
886080	890880	But that's still 12 years ago, you know, it's a long, long time since the, you know, the
890880	891880	orange box.
891880	897360	We're selling it.
897360	899400	The break man in chat says orange box.
899400	900400	Great game, bad name.
900400	903360	I wonder if that's what people say about this podcast.
903360	908600	Bobby Black Wolf either went to Wiki or just knows off the top of his head, October, 2007.
908600	909600	So you're close.
909600	910600	Right.
910600	911600	Yeah.
911600	912600	So there you go.
912600	917400	Y Y R says, how would you even hack in keyboard and mouse controls for something like use
917400	919000	your hands to clear the shelf?
919000	920000	Yeah.
920000	923760	In VR, that's where I think it would get stuck a little bit, but then Bobby follows that
923760	924760	up.
924760	927760	Use mouse to look at object, hold E, move mouse to move object.
927760	931580	Like they could do it, but will a hacker want to go to that kind of effort?
931580	932580	I don't know.
932580	937640	And to be honest, like if valve is building this through VR, then they want you to experience
937640	938640	it in VR.
938640	942560	And they're building like, it's not just going to be a normal, just do it like, just do it
942560	949080	like they do with the, um, there's a, like, I forget what the spell is in elder scrolls
949080	952440	Skyrim, but there's a spell where you can pull objects towards you.
952440	953440	Just do it like that.
953440	958480	Just look in the general direction of something, just pull it through the, um, now I will say
958480	961920	this because this was an interesting little debate I saw in discord, which I think was
961920	965480	actually a Bobby black Wolf's channel, but I'm going to steal it because it was still
965480	968280	our discord over at vog network.com slash discord.
968280	972200	There's a lot of talk about the hands and the way that the hands look in the trailer.
972200	976360	Uh, and then what we've seen so far, because the hands are kind of disembodied, you don't
976360	977360	actually see arms.
977360	981560	You just see these floating hands and some people thought that was a little weird.
981560	984720	I kind of think it looks like, I don't think it looks weird either.
984720	989400	I think it looks like pretty much any Wii game I ever played ever had, like that would
989400	992840	try to be somewhat realistic, had the disembodied hands as well.
992840	994840	I don't think it's a big deal.
994840	1001680	Like I get, I get where the mindset is because everything we do in gaming is one step closer
1001680	1003560	to the holiday, right?
1003560	1005380	Everything we do in gaming is one step closer to the holiday.
1005380	1008260	So if you want the holodeck, then you ought to be able to see your hands, right?
1008260	1013220	But I also understand, and to Bobby's credit on his show, and he even used Twitch to give
1013220	1017420	the full thing, like this is why you don't see hands because the game can, like the way
1017420	1020180	VR is today, it cannot track your hands.
1020180	1023820	It doesn't know if you're turning just your wrist or if you're turning your entire elbow.
1023820	1028420	Like the game doesn't know that unless they were selling these full body tracking suits.
1028420	1032940	So the technology's there, but like is the technology in every home?
1032940	1033940	God, no.
1033940	1037580	The technology is only the type of thing you see in those commercials where dudes are running
1037580	1042120	on treadmills and you see the neon lights all over in that place.
1042120	1043640	That's where that technology exists.
1043640	1045140	It's not in people's homes yet.
1045140	1048220	Will it be in people's homes in 10 years?
1048220	1049220	Maybe.
1049220	1051040	Decade challenge.
1051040	1054500	What my video games look like today and what they look like in 2029.
1054500	1055500	Who knows?
1055500	1060300	But for now, we just have the disembodied hands, but I don't, I don't think it looks
1060300	1061300	bad.
1061300	1062300	No, who cares?
1062300	1063300	I don't.
1063300	1064980	In fact, I kind of actually, that's what modders are for.
1064980	1068380	If you really want to mod in stupid elbows and go right ahead.
1068380	1069380	Yeah.
1069380	1073740	So, um, you know, well, I kind of liked the fact that they're see-through because you
1073740	1077740	know, especially since the game is all about the visuals, like, you know, if my big old,
1077740	1081620	my big old hands were in the shot, I want it to go.
1081620	1082620	I want it to go the opposite.
1082620	1087260	I want them to mod it in so that instead of your hands being there, it's just feet.
1087260	1088820	It's just your feet.
1088820	1093100	I want to see a mod called 45 where your hands are there.
1093100	1096940	They're just very tiny.
1096940	1097940	Very tiny.
1097940	1104700	It's like the tiniest hands, like the big head mode, but like giant head, tiny hands.
1104700	1105700	All right.
1105700	1107740	Anyway, one time I had to one big joke.
1107740	1108740	Easy joke.
1108740	1109740	I had to take the swing.
1109740	1111220	You just couldn't see my hands when I did the swing.
1111220	1112220	All right.
1112220	1113220	Anyway.
1113220	1116420	Um, I would rather though just not play a throw up game.
1116420	1118300	You'd rather not play what?
1118300	1119300	A throw up game.
1119300	1120300	Oh.
1120300	1124260	That's what VR games are to me, they're throw up games.
1124260	1133660	So well, let me ask you this, since you aren't a big VR person and I know that, um, what,
1133660	1137260	what would you do if the next, like, cause you are a big fan of the portal series.
1137260	1141020	Like I know Half Life, you're kind of ambivalent on like, you know, like Loki, like myself,
1141020	1143260	but what if the next portal game was VR?
1143260	1144260	I won't play it.
1144260	1145260	You're not going to play it.
1145260	1146260	Not at all.
1146300	1150780	Do you want to watch play throughs or, or would you just kind of be like, I'm out playing
1150780	1155100	at watching it played on a smaller screen with stuff around it may not make me a sick.
1155100	1159980	That's why I watched the Duncan Rompa, um, thing and it was okay.
1159980	1167340	Um, but I just, I don't want to, I, if it were on my head, I would be sick.
1167340	1172340	It would screw with my eyes almost anytime I get a migraine and it just screws with my
1172340	1173340	depth perception.
1173340	1175060	I cannot do it.
1175060	1176940	It's not a, it's not at this point.
1176940	1180460	I won't do it because I don't want the consequences.
1180460	1181460	Okay.
1181460	1183740	So it's people say, Oh, I can't do it.
1183740	1189340	Well, I can, I physically can put it on my head and watch it, but there will be consequences
1189340	1190660	and the consequences aren't worth it.
1190660	1194100	I remember you've done some minor VR things when you kind of like knew a lot about it
1194100	1195100	in advance.
1195100	1196940	Remember there was the last gamer X that we went to.
1196940	1201640	I like that one little thing cause it didn't make me so sick, but then like something like
1201640	1206600	five minutes after taking it off of my head, my head started to hurt and my eyes were like
1206600	1210300	doing that weird kind of after image thing.
1210300	1211940	So I mean, it was fun.
1211940	1212940	I enjoyed it.
1212940	1214800	It was a great experience and it was a neat little game.
1214800	1219680	What about something like Beat Saber that you're kind of like, nothing's really moving.
1219680	1223540	It's still trying to do a 3d environment that my eyes are trying to translate.
1223540	1227600	And even for me, like I like VR, I appreciate VR, but like, remember I was trying to play
1227600	1229200	Skyrim in VR.
1229920	1232440	And I say trying cause I didn't get all the way through it, but I played a pretty good
1232440	1233440	chunk of it.
1233440	1238440	My problem was I could play for maybe like 45 minute clumps.
1238440	1242060	And then like when I was getting to about 45 minutes, I was going, all right, I need
1242060	1243060	a break.
1243060	1246760	You know, I need to take this off my head and have a little bit of a break, which is
1246760	1247760	probably a good thing.
1247760	1251800	You're not supposed to do with any game hours and hours long session without taking a break.
1251800	1254740	I saw someone play Minecraft for 24 hours in VR.
1254740	1258680	That was, Oh God, that's no, that sounds terrible.
1258680	1260040	Was he taking breaks?
1260040	1261040	He did sleep.
1261040	1262040	Okay.
1262040	1263040	Well, he did play total.
1263040	1264040	Yeah.
1264040	1265040	So.
1265040	1266040	All right.
1266040	1267040	Anyway.
1267040	1270800	Uh, and Bobby, Bobby reaffirming with as much as a VR fan and advocate as he is, he says,
1270800	1273740	I'm won't ever try to convince dark soccer to do more VR.
1273740	1275560	She tried it and felt ill effects.
1275560	1277320	I'd rather her be healthy than play anything in VR.
1277320	1280100	I look at it as a green eggs and ham kind of thing.
1280100	1283120	You know, this is the whole story trying to convince him of the dude likes it, but the
1283120	1288320	same thing you can't officially say that you don't like something until you've tried it.
1288320	1291100	And like I said, I enjoyed the stuff that I've done.
1291100	1292580	It's just not worth it to me.
1292580	1294400	So you get it for other people.
1294400	1295400	You just don't get it for yourself.
1295400	1296400	Yeah.
1296400	1299040	Other people, if you have fun with it, do it.
1299040	1300040	Great.
1300040	1301040	Good for you.
1301040	1302040	Huzzah.
1302040	1305740	You know, while you've got the thing on your head, I'll just go run off with all of your
1305740	1308280	coffee and yay.
1308280	1310080	All right.
1310080	1311080	Anyway.
1311080	1316680	And keep in mind, I had a virtual boy dear Lord.
1316680	1318200	Well that's kind of different.
1318200	1322160	I mean, for what it's worth, I can already see like where things are going because here
1322160	1329240	we are getting closer and closer to March, 2020, March, 2020 is March, 2020 is going
1329240	1331760	to be a hell of a gaming month.
1331760	1333560	And I can tell you what's going to happen.
1333560	1335080	Dark soccer is going to be over here.
1335080	1339000	She's going to be playing her animal crossing brand new Loki or excuse me.
1339000	1342920	Bobby Black Wolf is going to be all about this half-life Alex thing and talking all
1342920	1348000	about it on his show in the VR myself, I will be consumed with the final fantasy seven remake
1348000	1350400	and I'm going to be playing the shit out of that.
1350400	1353640	And Loki will still not be working on his game.
1353640	1355720	I work on my game every week.
1355720	1360680	I will have, you know, if you give me proof that you finished it right before midnight
1360680	1365920	on the first of the year, I'll buy you a piece of, I don't need you to buy me a pizza.
1365920	1366920	They're like five bucks.
1366920	1368640	I bought a pizza today.
1368640	1371000	I'll make you a pizza.
1371000	1372000	Handmade everything.
1372000	1373000	Okay.
1373000	1377480	So what I only made that joke cause a it's easy and B I don't know what your wife will
1377480	1378960	do because she wants to hold on.
1378960	1382920	I don't know what in March, 2020 is like calling you.
1382920	1387680	Oh, nothing right now, but, uh, April, 2020 is cyber cyberpunk.
1387680	1394120	So I I'm down with that, but, uh, cyberpunk, but I don't know more.
1394120	1396760	I'm sure there's something, you know?
1396760	1397760	Yeah.
1397760	1399740	Here's hope of first saints row announcement.
1399740	1400740	Come on.
1400740	1402520	I was game awards right around the corner.
1402520	1407000	Actually it did not make the show roll tonight, but there was a brief cause it was all the
1407040	1408040	story was, was based.
1408040	1412600	I almost put it in rapid fire, but, um, I didn't, uh, it was basically like saints row
1412600	1415560	announcement is brewing for next year.
1415560	1419600	Well they're working on, they just felt like, I don't know if we talked about it before,
1419600	1423780	but I'll mention now since we brought it up, um, they're working on, they found the source
1423780	1425400	code for saints row too.
1425400	1429840	They thought that they had lost it for the longest time and they finally found it again.
1429840	1435680	And so now they're able to go back and fix all the bugs that were in saints row too.
1435680	1443520	And so now, um, they're just going through and just remastering that whole thing basically
1443520	1446940	making it run better, which I am totally for.
1446940	1449260	And it's going to be a free update if you have saints row too.
1449260	1454800	So, um, more power to them, but like just that whole team that came out of, you know,
1454800	1459160	the gentleman of the row and stuff, and now they're officially supported like modders
1459160	1460160	for that.
1460160	1463400	And actually I think he's on the development staff just, I, and I can't remember his goddamn
1463400	1469720	screen name, but, um, just, uh, I'm very excited about that cause I do love saints
1469720	1470720	row too.
1470720	1471720	All right.
1471720	1473000	This is moving away from the half life story.
1473000	1474000	That's fine.
1474000	1480520	At least they got the three, but, but then after that, you know, but then four was basically
1480520	1481520	a mod for three.
1481520	1485080	It was, yeah, it was cheap.
1485080	1486080	It's all right.
1486080	1487080	It's an okay game.
1487080	1488800	I'm willing to go back to saying it's an Oak.
1488800	1495200	It's not terrible game and you know, the, the gat one was okay.
1495200	1498640	Really three fucked up by getting ready to get, and then they kind of tried to retcon
1498640	1504520	that and now they've struck on the whole thing with leave gotten there.
1504520	1505520	All right.
1505520	1509320	Let's move on to our gaming weeks since we're, we were clearly not talking about half life
1509320	1510320	Alex anymore.
1510320	1513520	Uh, the types of video games we have been playing this week, dark soccer, how was your
1513520	1514520	gaming week?
1514520	1519080	Um, I started Pokemon sword because I want to surf etched.
1519080	1523680	I fall in love with my Pika Corgi, which I always forget the name of every yamper yamper.
1523680	1524680	Okay.
1524680	1527920	I have a hard time when I give them nicknames because I forget what the fuck they're called
1527920	1529840	if I give them a nickname.
1529840	1533360	Although I've come up with nicknames for them in my head and Dan's been watching me play
1533360	1535720	and he and I have just been laughing at shit.
1535720	1537320	I don't give my nicknames for the record.
1537320	1541560	In fact, there's actually an option where you can turn that question off and I did turn
1541560	1543200	it off because I never renamed.
1543400	1547640	I named Pika Corgi and I named my starter.
1547640	1552920	I started off with the fire bunny who looks like a score bunny score bunny.
1552920	1557280	I started off with score bunny who now looks like an angry youth with his hoodie.
1557280	1560840	Um, actually looks like a Naruto character now, whatever he's called.
1560840	1563600	Flame foot rabbit.
1563600	1565280	I don't remember the evolutions left on my head.
1565280	1569720	I named him Hikaru because I thought it fit and Dan's just been calling him Hikaru.
1569720	1571520	He's like, what's up with your Hikaru bunny?
1571520	1573400	I'm like, he's, he's cool, dude.
1573400	1575120	Um, so I've been enjoying it.
1575120	1576400	How much XP did you get?
1576400	1577400	Over 9,000.
1577400	1578400	Whatever.
1578400	1580200	That's like, that's Dragon Ball.
1580200	1585400	That's like Vegeta, but any who's, I've been enjoying the game.
1585400	1586400	It's been cute.
1586400	1588360	I'm just on my way to the first gym.
1588360	1592360	I mean like I just got through the caves and like there's, there's some fierce bitches
1592360	1593360	in there.
1593360	1594880	I need to, I've just been doing like crazy leveling.
1594880	1599000	Like every time hop comes up, I'm like, dude, you don't want to step to this.
1599000	1604040	And I'm like, I have just beaten that ass all over the place and I think his brother
1604040	1605040	is stupid.
1605040	1606040	Seriously.
1606040	1609620	Like, can you be any more full of yourself with your stupid, ugly shorts and your white
1609620	1610620	tights?
1610620	1613360	I mean, seriously, dude, you are a fucking champion.
1613360	1615120	You could afford some fashion sense.
1615120	1620240	Did you love how like the very first town you go into the very like first store you're
1620240	1624240	going to see is like a fashion outlet and it's like, let's play dress.
1624240	1625360	You can spend all your money.
1625360	1628000	You spent most of my money on clothes on dress up.
1628000	1631520	And then I was basically like looking for trainer battles just so I could save up money
1631520	1632900	to change my character's look.
1632900	1633900	So I changed her hair.
1633900	1635400	She's red head.
1635400	1639000	It's it's like their hazel does not look like hazel, at least not like my hazel, but I have
1639000	1640720	a lot of blue as well.
1640720	1645420	So I really couldn't pick like the right color for like I spent the longest trying to match
1645420	1649700	my eye color and I ended up going with green instead because it went better with the red.
1649700	1651960	I'm pissed you can't have facial hair on your character.
1651960	1655840	I mean, you are a prepubescent child.
1655840	1656840	So what?
1656840	1657840	Sure.
1657880	1660100	Let's go with realism there.
1660100	1662400	But the giant fucking long cat.
1662400	1663400	That's fine.
1663400	1666200	That's I can have rainbows in my eyes.
1666200	1668800	My eyes are literally that is kind of cool.
1668800	1670680	I went for a little bit more.
1670680	1671680	You know what?
1671680	1675080	I because I'm you know, it's like I'm going to my hair, I'll do the bun or whatever.
1675080	1676080	So it's cute.
1676080	1678440	And I wear the jaunty beret.
1678440	1681680	I'm laughing, though, at how they're kind of screwing up British slang, like they're
1681680	1683900	just throwing it out all over the fucking place.
1683900	1687440	And it's just like, I don't really think that's how people talk there.
1687440	1690640	I know what you're basing it off of, but that's a little bit that's like that's fan
1690640	1694200	fiction level of bad British speak.
1694200	1695560	That's what I'm saying there.
1695560	1698720	So other than that, I've been having a great time, like who's in my party?
1698720	1702320	I like whatever that thing is that carries a log around, not the log.
1702320	1703320	That's the koala thing.
1703320	1707600	I'm talking about the the fighting Pokemon with the big yeah, I know what the four by
1707600	1708600	four.
1708600	1709600	Yeah.
1709600	1710600	Yeah.
1710600	1713080	I just want to I would cosplay that and just carry around a four by four and that Pokemon.
1713080	1715240	Did you name that Pokemon splatter house?
1715240	1716240	I didn't get one yet.
1716240	1721480	You haven't gotten here yet, but at some point in the game, you're going to meet a character
1721480	1723280	named Opal.
1723280	1726080	That is like cosplay dream right there.
1726080	1727720	Opal is fucking fierce.
1727720	1728720	I like the goth girl.
1728720	1730560	Oh, wait, is Opal in your game?
1730560	1731560	No.
1731560	1732560	Yeah.
1732560	1733560	Opal is in both games.
1733560	1734560	I like the goth girl.
1734560	1735560	Some gym leaders aren't in both games.
1735560	1736560	The goth girl.
1736560	1737560	Yeah.
1737560	1738560	Marnie.
1738560	1739560	Yeah.
1739560	1740560	She's cool.
1740560	1741560	I'm like, that's like my aesthetic.
1741560	1742560	Why didn't I do that?
1742560	1744600	I hate the one guy who's like, I'm better than everybody because the chairman picked
1744600	1745600	me baby.
1745600	1746600	I think.
1746600	1747600	Yeah.
1747600	1753080	I'm like, um, dude, you need to, um, you know, use an enema.
1753080	1757280	You need like an industrial size enema where they have to hang you from your feet.
1757280	1758280	You need a colonic.
1758280	1759280	That's it.
1759280	1760280	You need a colonic.
1760280	1764440	So what you're saying is like a fire hose imminent because he is so full of shit and
1764440	1765960	up his own ass.
1765960	1766960	Congratulations.
1766960	1771600	You get to drink from the fire hose the other way.
1771600	1774320	You found the marble in the oatmeal.
1774320	1777840	Anyway, there's so many people that don't get these references.
1777840	1778840	It's weird, Al.
1778840	1779840	They should know it.
1779840	1785440	But anyway, um, but at any rate, that's like, I just been coming up with like all of this.
1785440	1789000	I'm just, I do nothing but talk shit about the characters when I play the game.
1789000	1791520	And Dan is just like talking shit about them with me.
1791520	1795600	So cause you know, normally if he's playing something, um, I'm his navigator.
1795600	1796600	Like they're prepubescent.
1796600	1799020	Jamie, do you always make fun of children?
1799020	1800020	He's tall.
1800020	1801020	So he's at least pubescent.
1801060	1805500	So anyway, because normally when Dan plays something, I'm his navigator, I say, Hey,
1805500	1806500	did you see that?
1806500	1809180	And Dan will look out for like shiny things for me.
1809180	1810660	And look, that's a sparkle thing.
1810660	1814100	And he apparently really like zigzag zoon.
1814100	1815100	He calls...
1815100	1816780	Who they changed for the gala region.
1816780	1818700	Yeah, it's like white and white, like black and white.
1818700	1819700	It's not bad.
1819700	1820700	I was like, that doesn't look like...
1820700	1823180	And then he like went up looking at, well, when you're on the last thing, you should
1823180	1826100	have a Gyarados and you should have this and this and Dan's like started like being
1826100	1827100	my coach.
1827100	1829440	Like he, he's my trainer coach.
1829440	1833440	I really wish I could change the trainer outfits because they're fucking terrible.
1833440	1834440	You can later.
1834440	1835440	Good.
1835440	1836440	Because they're fucking terrible.
1836440	1837440	Yeah.
1837440	1840800	Um, and at any rate though, it's just like, I'm having fun, but I'm really having fun
1840800	1841800	shit talking it.
1841800	1844360	Now, what number did you pick for your uniform?
1844360	1848040	Did you pick 666, 69 or 420?
1848040	1849040	808.
1849040	1850040	Okay.
1850040	1857200	It just like my two, my favorite number is eight and I like most multiples of two.
1857200	1858600	I do not like six as much.
1858600	1860440	And it's for me, it actually is very much an ass.
1860440	1865640	We think I've been this way since I was little, I like things in twos, fours and eights.
1865640	1869120	So I also love the number zero because it's nothing.
1869120	1870300	It's an infinite number.
1870300	1872160	It's absolute nothing.
1872160	1875320	So I'd picked my favorite combination of numbers, 808.
1875320	1881600	808 makes me think Bob because 8008 is boob on a calculator.
1881600	1882600	You know what?
1882600	1886600	When I forget to name, uh, what to name a hard drive, I call it Bob five, three, one
1886600	1887600	8008.
1887600	1888600	I have a hard drive named Bob.
1888600	1900000	The magic number five, three, one, eight, oh, wait, anyway, if that's, if that's it
1900000	1905160	for your gaming week and besides, yeah, it has to be, uh, three digits, but no, I wanted,
1905160	1906160	I wanted 808.
1906160	1909160	It works and I'm enjoying, it's fun.
1909160	1912520	It's the first time I've played a Pokemon game that I've actually really enjoyed myself
1912520	1913520	in a while.
1913520	1914520	All right.
1914520	1916520	Anything else for your gaming week?
1916520	1924120	Um, idle pouring, um, uh, Pokemon go, Harry Potter.
1924120	1927080	Um, I did get, um, what the golf.
1927080	1931280	So I am just when I get all this shit out of the way, it's just re I've got a lot of
1931280	1932280	baking to do.
1932280	1937160	I'm hardly gonna have time to play anything, but it'll, it'll be good.
1937160	1942920	Um, I'll, I'll be playing more stuff once the stupid idiot holidays are over and it's
1942920	1944280	not fucking Christmas yet.
1944280	1945760	So put your shit away.
1946200	1948720	No, no, uh, putting up Christmas until the day after Thanksgiving.
1948720	1949720	And then it's Hanukkah.
1949720	1952680	I already got latke mix and then I realized I had four more boxes of latke mix.
1952680	1954760	I think we still have latke mix from last year.
1954760	1956400	So I'm going to be coming over here.
1956400	1958140	Do not bring new latke mix.
1958140	1959140	We have plenty.
1959140	1960140	I'll cook all of it.
1960140	1962120	You'll just have a pile of latkes.
1962120	1963120	All right.
1963120	1964120	All right.
1964120	1966800	Uh, Loki, did you play a lot of games this week?
1966800	1968600	No, I did not.
1968600	1973120	I played a little bit of Minecraft earth, so I've just been going through that.
1973160	1978200	I did a few more of the adventures the other day, um, and I've had some different ones.
1978200	1982000	So there's one that's actually like a red stone puzzle, which was kind of neat.
1982000	1986160	Um, I just kept feeling though, cause especially after that one where I'm like just digging
1986160	1989920	in the hole after I killed the skeletons and then all of a sudden skeletons come out of
1989920	1993720	the side because they spawned up top for no reason.
1993720	1997680	Uh, I'm still worried every time I do one of these things that there's skeletons are
1997680	2000360	going to come and just shoot me with some arrows and kill me.
2000360	2002640	And then I'm going to lose everything that I just got.
2002640	2006280	So that's kind of annoying, but, uh, it's all right.
2006280	2011140	I didn't play it all week long because I'm kind of getting bored with it already cause
2011140	2012260	there's not a lot to do.
2012260	2013460	They have been updating it though.
2013460	2018640	So I noticed that there's now, um, seeds in there, so I guess you can plant those just
2018640	2019840	like you can in a normal game.
2019840	2022280	And then they have dyes now that they've added in.
2022280	2026320	And so they're updating and it's just, um, still can't do anything with meat.
2026320	2030200	Have a bunch of meat I'm sitting on, but I don't know.
2030200	2033280	And then of course, you know, I was fighting the one skeleton and they're pissing me off.
2033280	2038760	So I threw some TNT down there and blew them up and that worked out pretty well.
2038760	2045560	I played a little Pokemon Go and, uh, worked on my game some, I started working on the
2045560	2047440	procedural generation stuff on that.
2047440	2053160	So I have to, uh, develop something that I want to do for, uh, procedural maze generation
2053160	2055320	to get the level structure right.
2055320	2061360	And then once I get that done, then it's going to be random room generation and random, uh,
2061360	2063200	spawn wave generation.
2063200	2065800	So that's what I've been working on.
2065800	2066800	And what else?
2066800	2072600	Uh, I'm sure I play a little bit of what the golf in there as well and yeah, that's it.
2072600	2073600	All right.
2073600	2078280	Um, my gaming week, um, a lot of the same old, same olds, uh, continuing on Final Fantasy
2078280	2082120	14, of course, uh, was helping a friend of mine reach level 80 this week.
2082120	2083120	So that's exciting.
2083120	2088200	Uh, and then, um, I was playing all the GPS games, all of them playing a little bit of
2088200	2091440	Pokemon Go, probably that one, the least, uh, just because I didn't bother with the
2091440	2092440	team rocket event today.
2092440	2094800	I just haven't, I've really missed a lot of that.
2094800	2097960	And I, oh, there was an event today, there was an event today and there's a whole, like
2097960	2102200	you're supposed to fight Giovanni to get the shadow, uh, Articuno, I think it is.
2102200	2106360	And you know, all, but I'm just kinda like, I, I I'm kinda cutting that part out.
2106360	2109200	It's like, I don't, I don't have the time to go run around and find those and whatever,
2109200	2111660	because I'm too busy playing the other GPS games.
2111660	2115380	So I play, um, the Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, there's been an event going on there.
2115380	2118680	So I've been, you know, kind of, you know, getting the traces, uh, and then I really
2118680	2124260	went hard on Ingress this last week because, uh, there was the double AP, uh, event that
2124260	2126940	happened in Ingress and it just ended, uh, on Friday.
2126940	2128500	So, but I made the most of it.
2128500	2131780	I was out doing little bits of fielding every day.
2131780	2136060	And have you leveled back up to 16 again, not all the way to 16, I'm back to level 14.
2136060	2138180	So I just dinged 14 during the double AP.
2138220	2142180	Have they still figured out what you get for doing that?
2142180	2144220	No, they haven't, which is getting more and more frustrating.
2144220	2147060	Like, has it been like a year since they announced you can do it?
2147060	2149580	Yeah, Ingress is in a really rough place right now.
2149580	2150580	It's it's hard.
2150580	2154500	And you know, it's, you're watching the development team, like, you know, they're on the forums
2154500	2158980	and stuff saying, wow, we're trying, but I, if I feel like they don't have enough resources,
2158980	2163320	like it's very obvious, Pokemon goes the cash cow, that's where all the resources go.
2163320	2166740	And there's probably like a team of six people in the corner that are like the Ingress team
2166740	2167740	and God bless them.
2167740	2172060	I don't know what they can, but it's just not enough to stay on top of the very vocal,
2172060	2173540	very loud player base.
2173540	2176260	So you know what they need to do now?
2176260	2178300	So release another goddamn AR game.
2178300	2179300	Yeah, right.
2179300	2180300	Oh, which yeah.
2180300	2182180	Also, I know that was announced.
2182180	2184700	So Niantic is making a Catan game.
2184700	2185700	Yeah.
2185700	2188780	That's the next game they're doing is Catan.
2188780	2194300	I don't remember the subtitle, but it is Catan World Explorers, Catan World Explorers.
2194300	2199540	So it is basically the world's largest game of Settlers of Catan played on the real world,
2199540	2203140	which actually like as much as I, you know, every time Niantic has announced something
2203140	2205100	new, I've kind of done this, like, what the fuck?
2205100	2208820	Like when, when they announced Pokemon Go as their next thing, you know, after, because
2208820	2213060	I had played Niantic, or excuse me, I had played Ingress, I knew of Niantic for many
2213060	2214060	years.
2214060	2216860	So when they announced that Pokemon Go is their next thing, I was like, what the fuck?
2216860	2222020	Like, you know, but it turned out to be a rough start, but then the game got really
2222020	2223020	good.
2223020	2224020	Right.
2224740	2227700	And, you know, Harry Potter Wizards Unite isn't really a night.
2227700	2230660	It's more a Warner Brothers game, but you know, it's happy as whatever.
2230660	2232300	So that kind of, you know, it exists.
2232300	2233300	It's fine.
2233300	2236740	I think, I think that actually, I would say the Harry Potter game, as much as I don't
2236740	2241000	think the traces are as exciting as like catching the cute Pokemon, I would say the Harry Potter
2241000	2246460	game has done a very good job of like communicating with their audience, admitting when they make
2246460	2250900	fuck ups, being very good about what's coming out to the game, making regular updates to
2250900	2251900	the game.
2252100	2256860	In Harry Potter, if you weren't aware, that just released like three days ago.
2256860	2257860	I haven't played Harry.
2257860	2261340	I think I installed Harry Potter, but for those of you that may still have it lurking
2261340	2265580	on your phone, you can now send gifts to people, which is great because that helps with the
2265580	2267220	spell energy issue.
2267220	2271020	So if somebody goes to an inn, they can send you a gift that's like two spell energy, which
2271020	2273460	doesn't sound like a lot, but you can open 10 gifts a day.
2273460	2275620	That's like 20 spell energy at something to work with.
2275620	2277420	So it's kind of neat.
2277420	2280460	Helps a little bit with that kind of like how Pokemon gifting kind of helps with being
2280500	2282220	able to send like Pokeballs and stuff to people.
2282220	2287540	I just, I just, I don't know, like, cause you know, I know that they're struggling with
2287540	2292140	making updates to stuff and it's like really adding a fourth one is a good idea at this
2292140	2293140	point.
2293140	2294140	Yeah.
2294140	2298980	So anyway, um, yeah, I, I, I'm curious to see what the Catan thing works out.
2298980	2305100	I just, I feel like Ingress is not in a great place and if Niantic overall does not show
2305100	2310740	that game some TLC, I mean, they, I, they really, really botched the transition to Prime.
2310740	2312100	There's no nice way to put it.
2312100	2315140	They promised parody that they didn't deliver on.
2315140	2319320	And I think, you know, when I say parody, the features might be there, but what's not
2319320	2322100	there is the speed and the convenience.
2322100	2324420	And I think that's, what's throwing a lot of the player base off.
2324420	2328800	Like I, there's a lot that I like about Prime, don't get me wrong, but like, I don't like
2328800	2334100	the fact that it takes like, it takes easily three times as long to start up as the other
2334100	2336180	Ingress, uh, the original client did.
2336180	2338940	And heaven forbid if you switched to something in the background and then you got to go back
2338940	2341120	to Prime and then it's got to start all over again.
2341120	2342540	So it's just, it's really irritating.
2342540	2346360	Also, there's still a pay to win stuff in there too, which is kinda, and it's just,
2346360	2349700	you know, it's been the same fucking game for how many years.
2349700	2353740	Um, it would be nice if they'd mix it up a little bit and maybe this week you're competing
2353740	2358500	for unique portals or this week is about banners or, you know, something different, you know,
2358500	2362860	like, and not just throwing the same field in the same part of town over and over and
2362860	2365660	over again to win a cycle.
2365660	2369020	You know, it's just that aspect of the game is getting really boring.
2369020	2371860	So anyway, that's why I kind of quit playing.
2371860	2372860	I know.
2372860	2373860	It's just, they need more.
2373860	2377860	I think that people, cause especially as the game has been losing a lot of its regular
2377860	2381460	players because of the parody thing, it would just be nice if there was more that you could
2381460	2384500	do kind of as an individual, if that makes sense.
2384500	2385500	Yeah.
2385500	2386500	I don't know.
2386500	2388660	Like I know a lot of people that have just made it an individual game at this point.
2388660	2392300	Like it's just, Oh, I'm going to go get the banners or I'm just, you know, micro fielding
2392300	2398180	this little park or whatever it is, you know, it's just kind of, I don't know, anyway.
2398180	2402140	Other games I've been playing this week because what I've been playing a lot, a lot, a lot
2402140	2404140	is the same game I talked about last week.
2404140	2405580	That's Pokemon Shield.
2405580	2409760	I've been playing enough Pokemon Shield where I am further in Pokemon Shield than I've ever
2409760	2411660	gotten in a Pokemon game ever.
2411660	2416660	I am six gym badges in and I think the furthest I ever got, I think I got four or five gym
2416660	2419320	badges in Sun and Moon.
2419320	2425840	So I'm up to six badges in Pokemon Shield and I think I'm going to see it through to
2425840	2426840	the end.
2426840	2428240	I really do.
2428240	2432460	Because there's just so much about this particular gen that I'm liking.
2432460	2435960	And I got to say, I think one of the biggest things for me are those Dynamax raids.
2435960	2437400	Like they're so cool.
2437400	2442040	And what I love about it is that it gives an alternative for how to level your characters
2442040	2444400	as opposed to just grinding.
2444400	2448720	Like I don't feel like I have to go grind, grind, grind, kill two Pokemon, run back and
2448720	2449720	heal.
2449720	2450720	Kill two more Pokemon, run back and heal.
2450720	2451840	Like I don't feel like I have to do that.
2451840	2457960	I can just do some Dynamax raids, get some candy and level up my Pokemon that way and
2457960	2463000	then focus on the gym battles, which the gym battles are really well done.
2463000	2464720	I love the gym battles in this series.
2464720	2466380	Like the music is great.
2466380	2469200	The fact that they incorporate this whole stadium into it is awesome.
2469200	2472040	The Dynamaxing during the gym battles is really cool.
2472040	2475640	Like they did such a bang up job with the presentation in that regard.
2475640	2480160	And I think also honestly for me, and I know I'm the opposite of a lot of people, a lot
2480160	2482720	of people love that convenience of gaming on the go.
2482720	2488440	Me, I love playing video games on my TV, big, lying on my couch, you know, and I have it
2488440	2490640	all on the big noise and stuff.
2490640	2492640	I love playing on my TV.
2492640	2495800	And I think just having that all on my TV, even though ironically right now the Switch
2495800	2498800	is right here in front of me and I could play it right here during the show if I wanted
2498800	2502700	to, although I'm trying to focus on doing a show, I love being able to dock it and play
2502700	2503700	on the TV.
2503700	2506940	Switch is just a great platform for it.
2506940	2510260	So yeah, I'm trying to make my way to the seventh gym right now.
2510260	2514720	Just kind of got sidetracked with some rating as I usually do, because now I'm having to
2514720	2516300	sub in the right Pokemon.
2516300	2520080	So the next gym I'm going to is a dark type gym.
2520080	2522220	So I need some fighting Pokemon.
2522220	2528340	I mean, I can have, what is it, bug, fighting, or there's one other typing I'm forgetting
2528340	2529340	in the moment.
2529340	2530700	I'm sure somebody in chat is screaming it.
2530700	2537700	But I have my little Ninjask, which is my final swipe character, because it's the only
2537700	2539700	one I have that has final swipe.
2539700	2541840	And she also does a bug move.
2541840	2542840	So I have that.
2542840	2544260	But then I had to sub in my party.
2544260	2548040	Now I have a Bewear, because I have one of those little pink bears, so they're a fighting
2548040	2549040	type.
2549040	2553920	And then a Hitmonlee I have in my party as well, so another fighting type.
2553920	2558340	So I have those to go to the next gym with.
2558340	2560420	But you know what else is kind of nice?
2560420	2566940	I like the big open wild area, even though it runs like shit on the Switch when you're
2566940	2571640	online and the weather effects and everything, like the frame rate gets really bad.
2571640	2575020	It's one of those things where it's like, this is not impressive Nintendo technology
2575020	2576500	right here.
2576500	2581780	But as a game concept, I like it actually, because it kind of sets this precedent early
2581780	2587260	on that it's like, hey, you're not going to be able to catch everything.
2587260	2592460	And if you do miss things, they're probably here in this gigantic wild area.
2592460	2594520	So go forth and play the story.
2594520	2598020	You can always come back here and catch all these Pokemon at the end.
2598020	2602700	That's like the feeling I get, which to be fair, most Pokemon games, you can just play
2602700	2605760	straight through the story and then go back and get all the Pokemon you missed.
2605760	2610360	But there's something about that kind of setup where I just, I don't feel the need to catch
2610360	2612900	every Pokemon on every route along the way.
2612900	2616940	And I can just focus on trying to get through the story, leveling the right Pokemon in my
2616940	2619640	party to do it in that aspect of the game.
2619640	2620820	And it's worked for me.
2620820	2625540	And I've gotten further in this game than I ever have in a Pokemon game.
2625540	2630180	So I think that goes and just the quality of life stuff, man, having access to the Pokemon
2630180	2634100	boxes anywhere without having to be at a computer and things like that, like it goes a long
2634100	2635100	way.
2635100	2639540	Like they've done, they've done a really good job with the mainframe basically of this Pokemon
2639540	2640540	game.
2640540	2643580	I understand the whole DEXIT thing still bothers a lot of people.
2643580	2646420	I think that would be one of those things where like, it would be the whipped cream
2646420	2651700	and cherry on top if, when you beat this game, then all of the Pokemon's ever showed
2651700	2654260	up in the game, but it's not.
2654260	2655340	And that's okay.
2655340	2657220	It's still a damn good piece of pie.
2657220	2660740	You know, it's always, there's always a chance for updates later on.
2660740	2662220	I'm not going to hedge my bets on it.
2662220	2665940	In fact, I think they've been pretty clear in coming out and saying, don't count on it.
2665940	2669380	And that's, that's, that's for the third version, that's going to have both sword and shield
2669380	2674780	together and Pokemon gun, Pokemon gun, or I think that the popular and most likely would
2674780	2676900	be Pokemon armor.
2676900	2679020	So, but we'll see.
2679020	2680020	I don't, I don't know.
2680020	2684580	I mean, I, I don't know, like, and I kind of want to see him do another Pokemon game,
2684580	2687660	but then you're like, gen nine will be like four years away.
2687660	2688660	So I don't know.
2688660	2689660	We'll see.
2689660	2692780	But I do a remake of two, let's go, whatever.
2692780	2694220	Yeah, I would see more.
2694220	2695220	Okay.
2695220	2698320	So Kaijuna says, I still haven't beat my copies of ultra sun and moon.
2698320	2700420	So yeah, this is another thing that tends to happen.
2700420	2703820	So you get ultra sun and moon, you had black two and white two, right?
2703820	2706380	There was never a, what are those?
2706380	2710820	I mean, sequels in the same universe, same universe, same rosters, basically.
2710820	2715420	They're just different stories, but I could see where maybe there will be a sword to,
2715420	2719360	or, you know, ancient sword and ancient sealed or whatever they're, I don't know.
2719360	2722220	They could do a lot of things with it, but I could see something where they could put
2722220	2727540	out a sword and shield sequel that will expand on the decks, I suppose.
2727540	2732220	But I don't think the decks thing is like a deal breaker at the end of the day.
2732220	2736860	Like I can see why people are like hissy about it, but I also see a lot of criticisms
2736860	2741880	that are like, this Pokemon game sucks because it's the shortest one.
2741880	2744100	But then I'm like, okay.
2744100	2749820	But when I think about how many hours of Pokemon red and blue and yellow are in a fucking cave
2749820	2753700	running into random encounters over and over that you just want to run from anyway, because
2753700	2758980	you're trying to get to this next area and like how much of it is just grinding and grinding.
2758980	2763140	Like I kind of think the comparison is a little unfair because I think those numbers in the
2763140	2770100	older Pokemon games are a little bit artificially raised because it's grinding.
2770100	2774420	I know that's a hot take some of you aren't going to like, but that's the reality.
2774420	2779820	Like I feel like, for me, my reality, and I feel like in Pokemon sword and shield, like
2779820	2781380	I'm always moving.
2781380	2782620	I'm moving in this story.
2782620	2783780	I'm progressing.
2783780	2786220	I'm not having to just sit there and grind shit.
2786220	2789660	And even if I am doing like the Dynamax raids, it's kind of fun and different and online
2789660	2790660	and stuff.
2790660	2796900	So anyway, I do feel like the Dynamax raids was something that they took from Pokemon
2796900	2798140	Go.
2798140	2800420	And it's like, it's a great addition to the game.
2800420	2803620	So it's amazing how the games are kind of helping each other like that.
2803620	2808500	So anyway, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf says I would rather play a 10 hour game where I'm always
2808500	2812780	moving forward than a 60 hour game with 50 hours of grinding.
2812780	2813780	Yes.
2813780	2815460	Print that, put it on the back of the box.
2815460	2816460	That is how I feel.
2816460	2817460	Absolutely.
2817460	2818460	Let's see.
2818460	2819460	Other comments here.
2819460	2823900	Act Def says it is Pokemon, but most people have the dumb idea that it's only looking
2823900	2826340	at your phone and throwing balls at everything that pops up.
2826340	2830740	Pokemon Go has raid battles, has community events, it has PVP and other stuff.
2830740	2833780	Yeah, I guess a Go topic came up in chat.
2833780	2839360	Yeah, I love Pokemon Go as well, but it's a different Pokemon experience.
2839360	2843620	That's the interesting thing about this franchise is it's been imagined in all these different
2843620	2844620	ways.
2844620	2848700	I mean, Pokemon Puzzle League, am I right?
2848700	2852580	That's another way that the Pokemon franchise has been imagined.
2852580	2853580	So anyway.
2853580	2854580	All right.
2854580	2858620	I don't think I have anything else to share for my gaming week.
2858620	2861020	So that's it.
2861020	2862020	I guess we will move on.
2862020	2865260	We're going to get to the headlines for the week and talk about what is going on in the
2865260	2866260	gaming world.
2866260	2868020	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
2868020	2869020	Yes.
2869020	2877620	It's rumored that Amazon is going to enter the cloud streaming service for games next
2877620	2878620	year.
2878620	2882380	So, of course, Amazon has the Amazon Web Service.
2882380	2890660	That's a pretty big source for a lot of web infrastructure and basically really powerful
2890660	2892340	for something like this.
2892340	2895860	And it only makes sense that they would try to leverage that, especially with their other
2895860	2902940	streaming services that they have and Prime to try to get that all integrated.
2902940	2908140	I could see almost like now that they own Twitch integration with that, much like you
2908140	2913220	have with YouTube integration with Google Stadia.
2913220	2920060	My question would be is what are they going to do to try to differentiate themselves from
2920060	2926740	what Google's done and maybe being that they would be launching at least a year from now,
2926740	2931940	looking at what they can do differently so that they don't kind of flop like Stadia is?
2931940	2932940	Well, Amazon.
2932940	2938500	Well, I think it's too early to call Stadia a flop, not to derail the topic at hand, but
2938500	2942680	I think and I will say this coming up later in the show, our voiceover guy, Jason, since
2942680	2946420	none of us picked up Stadia early, but Jason, our voiceover guy did.
2946420	2950900	So he has a nice little package you put together for the break tonight that he's going to talk
2950900	2952340	about his impressions on Stadia.
2952340	2955700	So I'm really excited to hear it because I actually haven't heard the whole thing myself.
2955700	2959180	I only heard like the first minute when I was setting up for the show tonight, but I
2959180	2960340	didn't have time to listen to the whole thing.
2960340	2964500	So I'm excited to hear his impressions of Stadia, but I think it's too early to call
2964500	2972100	Stadia a flop because even though right now the early adopters of Stadia had to buy this
2972100	2976300	whole thing, remember that Stadia's vision is to be a free thing.
2976300	2979680	It is something that you'll be able to open up your Chromebook and you just launch Chrome
2979680	2982100	and you can run Stadia within the browser.
2982100	2985980	I think that's going to be the true test of, is there a demand for something like this
2985980	2988620	when they open it up to the wider market?
2988620	2992700	I think right now, honestly, truly people paid the beta test it.
2992700	2995340	So I hope you guys are enjoying that beta test.
2995340	2996340	That's what being an early adopter is.
2996340	3000700	But the problem I see with this though right now is that it's not really something I think
3000700	3008620	like, you know, games pass is like a better option than Stadia is because it doesn't make
3008620	3009620	sense.
3009620	3012100	Like, Oh, I get it's a cloud streaming service, but you got to buy everything.
3012100	3015800	And a lot of this stuff is really old and it's just, I got you the pricing model is
3015800	3016800	it doesn't make any sense.
3016800	3021600	Like if they have like, Hey, you pay $10 a month and you get access to all of these games
3021600	3025620	in this library and you could stream them all and play them more like a PlayStation
3025620	3027880	now, then that would make more sense to me.
3027880	3031760	But the way that they've done it right now, not really making any sense.
3031760	3035720	Well, let me steer the car back to the topic of hands as we are talking about Amazon potentially
3035720	3036720	entering this space.
3036720	3041680	We all know that Amazon has their Amazon prime, that they've leveraged all these different
3041680	3044920	services that Amazon has onto this Amazon prime.
3044920	3049300	It would seem logical, though nothing is certain until they announce something, it would seem
3049300	3052440	logical that if Amazon were to enter this space, it's very possible they could tie it
3052440	3056800	to a prime membership, or at least maybe some games you would buy, but there will be some
3056800	3060680	things that would be included as part of your prime membership.
3060680	3062680	Because that is, you know, Amazon makes a lot of money on that prime.
3062680	3065440	Or if you have your Twitch library that you could stream stuff.
3065440	3066440	Potentially.
3066440	3067440	I mean, we don't know.
3067440	3068440	There's so much to be determined.
3068440	3073600	We do know, and sometimes forget, Amazon's been working in the gaming space for quite
3073600	3074600	some time.
3074600	3078120	They've been working on that, what that MMO that they've been developing is they bought
3078120	3079120	that one developer.
3079120	3083640	And there was, I remember there was like some videos and things that were put out a while
3083640	3084640	ago.
3084640	3086760	I don't remember the name of it, but maybe somebody in chat remembers.
3086760	3090440	Amazon's working on something big within their own studios.
3090440	3094280	It's just that we don't know what the plan is for them to release it.
3094280	3097080	Are they just going to release it as something they sell on the Twitch app?
3097080	3101560	I don't know, but this would be a pretty big, if Amazon does want to enter the space, they
3101560	3105280	may have a bang up MMO exclusive game that they want to put in that.
3105280	3106800	So who knows?
3106800	3107800	New World.
3107800	3108800	Thank you, Quest Buster.
3108800	3111200	New World is the MMO that they're working on.
3111200	3112920	So there you go.
3112920	3115640	And then Lumberyard, says Bobby Black Wolf.
3115640	3117360	But is that the engine?
3117360	3118360	That's their engine.
3118360	3122320	I thought that they had, I wasn't sure if they were still working on it because I thought
3122320	3128360	that they were doing some other stuff for, I guess there's some games, I see Star Citizen
3128360	3132160	uses Lumberyard and Crucible and New World.
3132160	3136880	So certainly, I mean, you know, I know some people don't like to talk about rumors and
3136880	3142360	things, but I think this certainly, I mean, the things that aren't a rumor, we know that
3142360	3144840	Amazon has been working on gaming.
3144840	3147800	They just haven't done anything as far as releasing it yet.
3147800	3148800	Amazon owns Twitch.
3148800	3150700	They bought Twitch for a reason.
3150700	3153680	They have a really great gaming community within Twitch.
3153680	3158100	If they were to launch something like this and tie it to Twitch, it would probably get
3158100	3161040	some eyes on it because of the fact that they're behind Twitch.
3161040	3162440	You know, those things are facts.
3162440	3168160	So you feel like that, oh, there's this interesting little hole in the puzzle where something
3168160	3169920	could nicely fit.
3169920	3174000	And this does seem like a logical, I feel like five years ago on the show, the talk
3174000	3176240	was Amazon's going to put out a console.
3176240	3177240	And then that died.
3177240	3178240	You remember the rumors?
3178240	3182120	Amazon's going to put out a console because I knew there was, uh, they were built it into
3182120	3184320	fire or whatever the fire stick and that stuff.
3184320	3189100	I mean, they could, but I don't, I don't think, I don't think Amazon's going to put out a
3189100	3190100	console at this point.
3190100	3195560	I think it's this, I think now it's, oh, this is where things are going is the cloud service.
3195560	3201600	Hey, AWS, we got a big cloud that we operate and can deliver that type of bandwidth.
3201600	3202960	Let's do it.
3202960	3207440	But Amazon is probably taking a damn good look at what's happening with Stadia right
3207440	3213760	now and thinking about a lot of that because I, they would be fools over at Amazon to not
3213760	3218560	see all this complaining about bandwidth that people are having about Stadia right now,
3218560	3221380	which continues to be kind of the biggest complaint.
3221380	3224840	So an Amazon system really is going to have to answer that question.
3224840	3227640	What are they going to do about bandwidth?
3227640	3228640	Who knows?
3228640	3230960	And I don't, I don't know if it's an easy answer.
3230960	3240240	So, so anyway, Mr. Smoosh smells, a dark soccer is a dinner and he's putting on a show.
3240240	3243640	Oh, he's, he's, I think stalking off to check his own.
3243640	3244640	Yeah.
3244640	3247460	What he doesn't, he was asleep when the food dispenser went off earlier.
3247460	3249960	So he's going to be in for a real treat when he walks over there.
3249960	3253840	And I'm going to have to start a new Instagram for Midna anyway, because like, I don't even
3253840	3256520	remember the email I signed up for it with.
3256520	3257520	Oh no.
3257520	3260240	I changed it once because I couldn't remember the initial one and then I remembered the
3260240	3262120	initial one and all this shit.
3262120	3265320	So there's going to be a new Midna Instagram.
3265320	3266320	Fun.
3266320	3267640	All right.
3267640	3272740	So anyway, I guess there's not a lot else to say on the Amazon cloud thing right now
3272740	3279120	until we know that what they're doing or what they're planning, but it does, I feel like
3279120	3284160	this is the direction they're moving in and I'm curious to see what they unveil maybe
3284160	3285160	next year.
3285160	3288280	Well, and that's going to also depend on a lot of what, you know, they're doing with
3288280	3292760	the Microsoft X cloud stuff as well and where that goes.
3292760	3296720	And I think they're just gonna kind of look at what works, what doesn't work, and then
3296720	3297720	kind of go from there.
3297720	3300800	And that's what everybody seems to be doing.
3300800	3306080	But launching early, do you have that problem that you don't get to learn from other people
3306080	3312840	because you're, you're leading the charge however well you're doing it, I guess.
3312840	3313840	All right.
3313840	3317640	Well, moving on to our next story, which is about again, Pokemon sword and shield, some
3317640	3321720	of the big names in gaming this week as that did recently release.
3321720	3325180	And of course, you all know by now one of the biggest controversies in Pokemon sword
3325180	3330400	and shield is the fact that many of the previous Pokemon in the series were removed from the
3330400	3334560	game, even though the Pokedex is somewhere in the realm of just over 400, that would
3334560	3339560	still be about half the Pokemon did not make the cut in Pokemon sword and shield.
3339560	3345140	But that hasn't stopped folks from hacking and modding and doing what they do to try
3345140	3348040	to bring some of the Pokemon back into the game.
3348040	3353420	So what's interesting, apparently using older models from other games, one hacker actually
3353420	3358700	brought Omastar, which was cut, that's a gen one Pokemon that kind of looks like a snail
3358700	3361120	starfish hybrid thing.
3361120	3365180	And it was cut, it's not in Pokemon sword and shield, but somebody was able to kind
3365180	3370980	of hack it to actually put it in Pokemon sword and shield and it kind of works.
3370980	3373900	But I guess some of the entrance animations are a little borked.
3373900	3376860	So there's actually a YouTube out there and I didn't have time to rip it for the show
3376860	3382540	tonight, but you can actually see that it kind of does a fight and it works okay.
3382540	3388760	So people were able to add at least one Pokemon back into the game, I guess, but yeah, I mean,
3388760	3392140	that seems just more of like a challenge to me and it's honestly, Omastar is not that
3392140	3396520	great a Pokemon and it just seems like kind of a, eh.
3396520	3400500	It's neat that hackers and modders have accomplished that, neat.
3400500	3406480	And it does go to show that maybe Game Freak Nintendo should consider some type of addition
3406480	3410820	to add the older Pokemon back into the game, but at the same time, I can, you know, and
3410820	3415380	I got into this last week and I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll just summarize.
3415380	3419600	Game Freak may have made some strategical cuts to try to update the competitive side
3419600	3420800	of Pokemon.
3420800	3424600	Maybe there's a reason they wanted to throw away all the old legendaries, because anytime
3424600	3428580	you watch a Pokemon match, it's all those legendaries going up against each other.
3428580	3433120	So maybe they wanted to re- It's the third game that they're gonna put all of them just
3433120	3434120	in that game.
3434120	3435120	Oh, we'll see.
3435120	3438880	Anyway, now did this whole controversy slow down the sales?
3438880	3444180	Did people put their money where their mouth was and not buy the new Pokemon as a result?
3444180	3446680	And the answer is probably not.
3446680	3450460	I mean, I'm sure there's some people out there that are like, I sure didn't, but the sales
3450460	3452580	numbers are coming in.
3452580	3458560	Nintendo announced that over 6 million units between Sword and Shield, and I'm sure five
3458560	3462000	million of them were Shield and one million of them were Sword based on what I see on
3462000	3463000	my friends list.
3463000	3467600	That's no shade, it's just I see way more people playing Shield than Sword.
3467600	3472600	But anyway, Nintendo announces 6 million units of the game have been sold worldwide, 2 million
3472600	3478480	of them in the US during the first two days, meaning it's the highest grossing Pokemon
3478480	3480580	launch ever.
3480580	3486300	So that should hopefully be some good news for the folks at Game Freak that have had
3486300	3492180	to put up with a lot of social media online Twitter bullshit leading up to its release.
3492180	3497800	And quite frankly, and again, I'm probably gonna take a little shit for my hot take opinion,
3497800	3499280	but I'm still gonna put it out there.
3499280	3503900	I think this just furthers the proof that a lot of what you see on Twitter is just echo
3503900	3508700	chamber noisy bullshit that people never follow through on.
3508700	3511940	I shouldn't say never, rarely follow through on.
3511940	3512940	That's Twitter.
3512940	3516060	But you can craft Twitter into a very lovely echo chamber.
3516060	3519560	I've met a lot of great people on Twitter, I've made some great friendships on Twitter,
3519560	3522460	and know many people around the world from Twitter, but that's because I block a lot
3522460	3524360	of the annoying shit.
3524360	3529300	So I think the people pouring themselves into a tizzy and calling the games fails, the results
3529300	3532220	are in and biggest launch ever.
3532220	3534420	So I'm a big fan of muting people.
3534420	3535420	Yeah.
3535420	3538260	Oh, I like to block I understand why people do the muting.
3538260	3541340	I like to I like you to know you've been blocked.
3541340	3544860	I don't want to but it's different for me because if it's especially if it's a guy,
3544860	3547340	I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing that I blocked him.
3547340	3548580	Yeah, I've heard that before.
3548580	3549580	Yeah.
3549580	3550580	I understand.
3550580	3553740	Have you ever visited those profiles were in the about information?
3553740	3557100	It says blocked by so and so and it's like you're proud of that.
3557100	3558700	Like, I don't know.
3558700	3562180	Like the people that I've blocked on Twitter deserved it.
3562180	3570000	Like, you want people that I don't know, I just block everybody that adds me as a follower.
3570000	3571000	You block everybody?
3571000	3574620	No, no, no, I bought I've been blocking a lot because I've been getting a lot of the
3574620	3580900	these guys who like to post naked pictures of themselves following me for some reason.
3580900	3586120	And no offense, but like, I just don't want to keep having to like, and not even just
3586120	3591260	that, just even like some that my other followers or people that I follow seem to like their
3591260	3595160	photos, and then they get thrown into my feed.
3595160	3600440	And if I'm browsing on my phone or at work or something like that, that might be bad.
3600440	3603060	So I preemptively block them.
3603060	3604060	Do you know how?
3604060	3607320	I mean, and you've I know you've expressed you've had this problem too, but do you know
3607320	3609600	how much gay porn finds its way into my feed?
3609600	3611860	And like, I don't follow triple X accounts.
3611860	3613000	There's nothing wrong with it.
3613000	3616440	It's just that, you know, sometimes I'm looking on my phone at work and I don't need to see
3616440	3621260	that on my Twitter feed, but Twitter will show the things that your friends liked.
3621260	3627340	And some of y'all out there are thirsty, which again, I understand it's fine.
3627340	3628340	There's nothing wrong.
3628340	3633580	We all get in those moods, but like, Twitter stopped putting it in my feed.
3633580	3634580	There's nothing wrong.
3634580	3639040	It's like, you know, I, I, I, I'm curious who's following me and I see the profile picture
3639040	3640100	and I can't really tell.
3640100	3642020	So I go to their profile and there's butthole there.
3642020	3646540	So I'm like, well, I'm going to have to block you.
3646540	3649180	And I'd have to do the same thing if it was a female butthole.
3649180	3652980	But it's just like, I've seen titties to titties pop up on my feed to for the same.
3652980	3656940	I follow straight dudes to the, you know, it's just lesbians that like that stuff.
3656940	3660860	And it's just, it's just, I can't, I've got to keep my feed somewhat clean.
3660860	3665380	You know, maybe I, if I have some time one of these days, I can put it in a separate
3665380	3667300	like don't have like lists or some shit now.
3667300	3669620	And actually, I think you can do categories now too.
3669620	3673140	So you can do all that when I have the free time, which will never happen.
3673140	3674240	Maybe I can do that kind of crap.
3674240	3676100	But right now I got to block that shit.
3676100	3678040	So oh, I live by the list thing.
3678040	3683300	I the only there's a handful of accounts that I stay current on and it's thanks to the list
3683300	3684300	thing.
3684300	3688940	But the problem with lists is that you can't block retweets from your list.
3688940	3692920	So I had to remove somebody from my list that I really like and I really want to follow
3692920	3695140	because over three quarters of their timeline are retweets.
3695140	3698860	I just wish they had like options like, I don't want to see retweets from this person.
3698860	3699860	Yes.
3699860	3700860	My God.
3700860	3701860	Anyway.
3701860	3702860	All right.
3702860	3703860	That's enough.
3703860	3704860	Turn into Twitter rant.
3704860	3705860	Who knew?
3705860	3706860	Anyway, let's talk more about Pokemon.
3706860	3711100	Dark Sakura, you have another little interesting tidbit.
3711100	3712680	Yes, I do.
3712680	3718180	So you know, people have a lot of multiple devices that are plugged in, you know, to
3718180	3721860	their TVs that may have some interaction interaction.
3721860	3728420	Well right now, Pokemon Sword and Shield are causing some problems with Roku devices.
3728420	3734000	It's their Y-Com feature, the way it searches for the Internet for other players, is sending
3734000	3739080	out data packets that make the Roku go what and it gets stuck in a boot loop.
3739080	3743360	So right now the only way to fix it is turn on airplane mode on the switch or move the
3743360	3747740	switch in Roku to different wireless networks.
3747740	3752980	Roku is actually working on fixing it, but it's not really the fault of Pokemon.
3752980	3754300	It's something having to do with Roku.
3754300	3758300	So hopefully they'll get that fixed up, but it's not the first time I've heard of stuff
3758300	3759300	like that happening.
3759300	3761820	That is such a strange thing.
3761820	3765060	It has to be like some signal that it's using or something.
3765060	3769780	I do know like the switch in general, one thing I like about it is that when I just
3769780	3774820	when I hit my controller to turn on the switch, if it's docked, my TV turns on as well.
3774820	3778500	Like it sends that there's some type of smart signal or something it sends to the TV that
3778500	3780580	makes your TV turn on.
3780580	3781980	And I really think that's cool.
3781980	3791620	But yeah, like it's weird that maybe that signal is interfering with these other things
3791620	3792620	as well.
3792620	3796700	So I don't know anyway.
3796700	3797700	Let's move on.
3797700	3799300	Loki, what else is happening in the gaming world?
3799300	3800860	We had some big news this week, right?
3800900	3808820	Yeah, so they have the nominees for the Death Stranding Awards starring Jeff Keighley.
3808820	3814220	Basically it's the Game Awards and Death Stranding, of course, is getting nominations, which we
3814220	3822860	can kind of discuss how that's a little kind of sketchy being that Jeff Keighley is in
3822860	3823860	the game.
3823860	3829180	I mean, if it wins Game of the Year, it's kind of I don't know.
3829180	3833700	But I mean, it's his damn award show, so I guess he can do whatever he wants.
3833700	3837620	I don't always say the nicest things about a lot of gaming journalists, because I think
3837620	3840580	a lot of them are drunk on power.
3840580	3841580	Not all of them.
3841580	3843780	I've met some really humble, really awesome people.
3843780	3847340	So again, I don't want you to think I'm talking about you, just if you do happen to be one.
3847340	3850620	But you've probably met these same people that I'm talking about that are just drunk
3850620	3852860	with power on that type of stuff.
3852860	3857460	And I think Jeff, especially the ones that have really made it big or really mainstream
3857460	3861600	and so forth, I think he's a pretty respectable guy.
3861600	3866580	I think he made a big mistake in agreeing to be in the game Death Stranding.
3866580	3872980	And I do think he should maybe acknowledge that, especially if this game does end up
3872980	3874340	cleaning up some awards.
3874340	3880020	He may need to acknowledge that as the guy who's running this, producing this premier
3880020	3886200	Game Award show, it is a little bit of a problem that he is showing up in a game and everybody
3886200	3889020	knows how tight he is with Hideo Kojima.
3889020	3894160	And I'm sure, and I'm confident, this was not a rigged process.
3894160	3898480	I'm sure the journalists did their thing in the nomination process the same way they've
3898480	3899480	done in the years past.
3899480	3902680	I'm sure everything was done the same way as it always has been.
3902680	3904400	It's the perception.
3904400	3907280	The perception is there that it's worse.
3907280	3908280	And you know what?
3908280	3912560	He should really, he can't remove himself in the game at this point, or even stop the
3912560	3913560	award show.
3913560	3914560	And I don't think he should do either of those things.
3914560	3919120	I do think he should say, hey, I learned something from this and I realized I crossed
3919120	3923500	a line that if I want this award show to be taken seriously in the future, I probably
3923500	3925120	shouldn't cross that again.
3925120	3929120	So don't look for me to do any cameos in any future games.
3929120	3930120	Right.
3930120	3932520	So, so let's see, let's talk about the nomination.
3932520	3938920	So Game of the Year, as mentioned, Death Stranding Control, The Outer Worlds, Resident Evil 2,
3938920	3945640	Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Action Game, they have Apex Legends,
3945640	3953040	Astral Chain, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Devil May Cry 5, Gears 5, and Metro Exodus.
3953040	3958720	Let's see, we can, Action Adventure, Borderlands 3, Control, Death Stranding, Legends, All
3958720	3964800	the Links Awakening, Resident Evil 2, and Sekiro.
3964800	3968440	Could you read the awards nominees for best art direction, please, because there's something
3968480	3970480	I want to point out in that category.
3970480	3973600	Yes, actually, I was just getting there.
3973600	3981400	Art direction, Control, Death Stranding, Grease, The Legend of Zelda, Links Awakening, Sayonara
3981400	3984640	Wild Hearts.
3984640	3987760	I just wanted to interrupt here real quick.
3987760	3991480	What did I say when I was reviewing Sayonara Wild Hearts here on this show?
3991480	3994600	Does anyone remember what I said on that when I was talking about the game?
3994600	3995600	It purred.
3995600	3996600	Yeah.
3996600	4001320	Specifically, this game will get nominated for best art direction at award shows at the
4001320	4002320	end of the year.
4002320	4003320	Thank you.
4003320	4006480	But I mean, anybody who's played the game could tell you that.
4006480	4009680	They have a shit ton of esports nominations.
4009680	4018440	I didn't even realize that they had all that, event, coach, player, host, content creators
4018440	4020520	of the year, they've got stuff like that.
4020520	4023000	I have no idea who those people are.
4023000	4024840	I wanted to talk about indie games real quick, though.
4024840	4026880	Can I say quickly on the esports thing?
4026880	4029840	Because I definitely noticed it seemed like a lot of that was increased.
4029840	4033560	And I think maybe some of that is to try to bring more eyes to the show.
4033560	4038840	I think it is an element of the gaming community, whether you personally follow it or not.
4038840	4039840	I don't follow a lot of esports.
4039840	4040960	I completely understand.
4040960	4042080	But I get it.
4042080	4046160	I get that the Overwatch League is something that's growing and growing and so forth.
4046160	4047640	So I get it.
4047640	4051540	It's not particularly the categories I personally have any interest in, but okay.
4051540	4055660	So it's just weird to see so much more of it this year than in years past.
4055660	4056660	But anyway.
4056660	4057660	Go ahead.
4057660	4058660	And then, let's see.
4058660	4059660	I was going to...
4059660	4060660	Where was that?
4060660	4061660	Let's see.
4061660	4062660	They had mobile and...
4062660	4063660	So mobile game I wanted to mention.
4063660	4068660	They had Call of Duty Mobile, Grindstone, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Sky Children of Light,
4068660	4070240	and What the Golf.
4070240	4072000	And then independent game, of course.
4072000	4075620	We know who's going to win independent game here, I mean, come on.
4075620	4080820	Baba's You, Disco Elysium, Katana Zero, Outer Wilds, and Untitled Goose Game.
4080820	4085340	I'm surprised Untitled Goose Game did not get more nominations, actually.
4085340	4086340	Well they also got...
4086340	4089380	I would have thought Untitled Goose Game would have been a dark horse for Game of the Year,
4089380	4090380	honestly.
4090380	4091380	They had...
4091380	4092380	They have this...
4092380	4093500	I don't know why the category is called Fresh Indie Game.
4093500	4096000	It sounds like Indie Studio, but it's...
4096000	4101580	They had House House, Untitled Goose Game, Mega Crit, Slay the Spire, Mobius Digital,
4101580	4108220	Outer Wilds, Dead Toast Entertainment, my friend Pedro, Nomada Studio, Gris, and ZA
4108220	4111380	slash UM, Disco Elysium.
4111380	4115820	I know, there's a ton of damn categories, I'm not going to read them all here.
4115820	4121900	Family Game category, or better known as its Nintendo category, Luigi's Mansion, 3 Ring
4121900	4125900	Fit Adventure, Super Mario Maker 2, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, and Yoshi's Craft
4125900	4127540	of World.
4127540	4132100	Don't get me wrong, Nintendo does good family games, but I would like to think that there's
4132100	4137500	other people out there that have made some family games that, like, really?
4137500	4140460	This is all we have is just from Nintendo?
4140460	4141460	I don't know.
4141460	4144520	Like, wasn't there, like, an, um...
4144520	4145520	Was that this year?
4145520	4146520	I can't remember.
4146520	4149500	Wasn't there, like, one of the robots games that Sony made or something like that that
4149500	4150900	was pretty good for VR?
4150900	4153020	I don't know.
4153020	4154020	I would like to see...
4154020	4157700	I would like to see more than just Nintendo in that category, and I think last year is
4157700	4158700	the same way.
4158700	4159700	Okay.
4159700	4164540	Real quick, go back and read the Game of the Year nominees for us, please.
4164540	4167220	You know what I'm going to ask after this.
4167220	4172700	Game of the Year, Control, Death Stranding, The Outer Worlds, Resident Evil 2, Sekiro,
4172700	4175940	Shadows Die Twice, and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
4175940	4180540	Now, I realize not everybody's had time to play all those games, but certainly you've
4180540	4183780	had enough time to follow some of the buzz on these different games, and you kind of
4183780	4188060	know the perception and what the gaming community kind of views with these types of games.
4188060	4191860	So that being said, who do you think out of this group takes the award?
4191860	4192860	The Outer Worlds.
4192860	4193860	Wow.
4193860	4194860	You're the...
4194860	4195860	I wouldn't have thought...
4195860	4197020	Why would you say The Outer Worlds?
4197020	4198700	Because it's actually a pretty decent game.
4198700	4204100	It's of a quality of one of the older Fallout games.
4204100	4208140	I have not heard anything really negative about it.
4208140	4210660	Death Stranding, I've heard all sorts of...
4210660	4215280	It just seems very like this is kind of a Kojima passion project thing, and it just
4215280	4221940	makes no sense, and the gameplay's not really there, but the story's okay.
4221940	4225180	Control has a pretty good story, and the gameplay's pretty good in that one, so that could be
4225180	4227380	one that I could see.
4227380	4228380	Sekiro.
4228380	4229380	Sekiro.
4229380	4231260	I don't care.
4231260	4232260	I'm gonna pronounce it wrong.
4232260	4234260	You said it right the first time.
4234260	4235260	Whatever.
4235260	4237940	That one seems like that might be a pretty good one.
4237940	4241260	The gameplay in that was supposed to be pretty good, and I think, if I remember correctly,
4241260	4243940	that's kind of like the Dark Souls type game.
4243940	4245980	Smash Brothers Ultimate's just Smash Brothers.
4245980	4248820	I mean, I guess you could see some omniscience there.
4248820	4251060	I would see that more of like a family game.
4251060	4252940	It might win that category.
4253140	4254140	Resident Evil 2.
4254140	4255380	Dude, it's a fucking remake.
4255380	4257260	I just don't really care.
4257260	4261980	I mean, it might do all right, but I think Outer Worlds will take it, unless it's really
4261980	4263820	rigged and Industrial will take it.
4263820	4264820	Dark Sakura, thoughts?
4264820	4270020	I'm leaning to Death Stranding because everyone is up Kojima's ass, just saying.
4270020	4275200	Other than that, though, my second for that would have been Sekiro, just because it's
4275200	4279940	been out longer, more people have played it, it's got a really great storyline, it's pretty,
4279940	4282220	and it's hard as shit.
4282220	4285180	I actually think Smash Brothers is going to take it, and I think it's going to leave a
4285180	4289180	lot of people asking why the fuck wasn't this nominated last year, and the reason why is
4289180	4293180	because of the way the release windows work, and I think it is going to cause some questions
4293180	4297460	about, hmm, maybe the strange eligibility window for this ought to be revisited.
4297460	4302460	However, I think Smash Brothers takes it because I think there is going to be blowback on Death
4302460	4305940	Stranding because of the Kili thing, I really do.
4305940	4310700	And I don't think the game, I mean, I want to play it and form my own opinions, but the
4310700	4315140	game doesn't seem to be reviewing at the level where I thought it would have.
4315140	4319020	So I'm not sure it's going to take the big prize for that reason.
4319020	4323300	I think, ultimately, the users vote on these, right, because you can go vote on them online, right?
4323300	4325820	And that's another reason why Smash Brothers takes it in the end.
4325820	4331300	I think that game is too goddamn popular to not win, and it's not like it's not deserving.
4331300	4334420	I mean, they've continued to deliver on that game over and over again throughout the year
4334420	4338360	with the DLC and so forth, so I mean, it certainly deserves it.
4338400	4341200	I think just a lot of people are going to be asking, why didn't it win last year?
4341200	4342800	It should have won last year.
4342800	4345680	And it was a December release, if I remember right, right?
4345680	4347280	So it's the eligibility window is a little weird.
4347280	4348800	Yeah, I think it came out.
4348800	4349800	Yeah.
4349800	4355160	It's just like when the Oscar nominations come out, if Jordan Peele's Us gets nominated
4355160	4358520	for movie of the year, which it very well might, I think people are going to be asking,
4358520	4359840	wait a minute, what the fuck?
4359840	4361240	Wasn't that last year's movie?
4361240	4363240	No, came out in like February.
4363240	4367280	So you know, sometimes the eligibility windows are a little weird.
4367320	4372400	I do think there is a sleeper candidate in control.
4372400	4373680	That one I hear is a pretty good game.
4373680	4381760	I think if the critics were voting and not the gamers, I think there would, like if this
4381760	4387120	were the Oscars, where just industry people were voting, I have this really funky feeling
4387120	4390440	control would win.
4390440	4393600	Because you know, again, I haven't played it, so it's hard for me to wrap my head around,
4393600	4396760	but it's on my radar, it's on my list of games I really want to play.
4396760	4400360	Because everybody that has played it has really good things to say about it.
4400360	4405440	And like just, you know, the studio that put it out puts all these other winners out and
4405440	4406440	so forth.
4406440	4412720	So it's got a really, I feel like a cultish almost kind of following to that game in a
4412720	4413720	way.
4413720	4415920	So I feel like control is kind of a sleeper candidate there.
4415920	4421520	But I just think, especially being the only Nintendo one in there, I think there's no
4421520	4423520	way Smash Brothers doesn't win.
4423520	4428080	If Link's Awakening also got a Game of the Year nod, then it would be a tougher call.
4428080	4431720	But I think there's no way that Smash Brothers, especially with the fans voting, I think Smash
4431720	4432720	Brothers has it in the bag.
4432720	4433720	I don't know.
4433720	4434720	But that's me.
4434720	4439120	So anyway, the other, you know, the other thing, the one other thing I'll say is interesting
4439120	4440240	about the game awards.
4440240	4448140	There was an award for community or something or like on what was it ongoing game, something
4448140	4451240	about like ongoing life of the game.
4451240	4454760	Let's see, community support.
4454760	4455760	That's it.
4455760	4457160	Tell me, tell us the candidates in this category.
4457160	4465480	So community support, Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Final Fantasy XIV, Fortnite, and Tom Clancy's
4465480	4467240	Rainbow Six Siege.
4467240	4472480	And this I believe is the category for like continued support of the game post launch
4472480	4476680	basically and talking with the community and basically like hyping up the products and
4476680	4477680	things like that.
4477680	4478680	Right.
4478680	4480760	And like, you know, continuing support for the game after it's out.
4481280	4487640	Yeah, I, I mean, Final Fantasy XIV should get that.
4487640	4490280	I have a feeling they had their best expansion this year.
4490280	4495640	I have a feeling Fortnite will get it, but users, Apex Legends better not fucking get
4495640	4496640	it.
4496640	4497640	Users vote?
4497640	4498640	Oh, no, wait, wait.
4498640	4499640	No, I'm sorry.
4499640	4500640	I'm thinking Anthem.
4500640	4501640	Sorry.
4501640	4502640	Sorry.
4502640	4503640	Getting those confused.
4503640	4504640	Apex Legends.
4504640	4505640	That might not be so bad.
4505640	4506640	Yeah, no, Apex won't be bad at all.
4506640	4510480	And Apex arguably could deserve it, but I think it'll be Fortnite because again, users
4510520	4511520	vote on it.
4511520	4518840	So, um, uh, but read that list one more time because I want you guys to listen.
4518840	4520520	Who's not here?
4520520	4529120	Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Final Fantasy XIV, Fortnite and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.
4529120	4535600	Who's not here in that lineup that is really stunning in, in, in my opinion, when it comes
4535600	4538560	to this community thing, like I'm actually stunned and shocked.
4538560	4539680	Who's not in that list.
4539680	4540680	Who's not in that list.
4540680	4541760	World of Warcraft.
4541760	4544080	How about any Blizzard product?
4544080	4545080	Overwatch.
4545080	4548320	Because fuck them.
4548320	4552440	For me, Overwatch is the glaring admission there.
4552440	4558200	And is that punishment for what's happened the past couple months?
4558200	4563400	I don't know, but I, I have to, I am stunned that Overwatch was not in that category.
4563400	4565360	They're banned from being awarded.
4565360	4567880	You know, I don't even see now that I'm looking at this.
4567880	4572880	Uh, well, the Overwatch is nominated for esports game of the year, which I think it won last
4572880	4573880	year.
4573880	4578920	That like, for me saying it's stunning for it to not be in the community category, it
4578920	4586200	would have been goddamn like fucking like, uh, uh, uh, uh, stop the presses, like interrupt
4586200	4587960	special news announcement time.
4587960	4594000	Tom Brokaw here with a special news report, uh, that would not be in the esports category.
4594000	4595000	Come on.
4595000	4597800	Especially with like everything Overwatch league has accomplished in the past year.
4597800	4600740	That's a real, would have been a real interesting one.
4600740	4602120	So a multiplayer game.
4602120	4609320	We have apex legends, Borderlands three, call of duty, modern warfare, Tetris 99, and Tom
4609320	4611480	Clancy's the division two.
4611480	4613280	So interesting.
4613280	4618060	Anyway, I just, I, is something I noticed cause yeah, I get the Warcraft could be another
4618060	4621880	one too with the, especially with wow classic having launched, but I was just, you know,
4621880	4625360	as a final fantasy 14 fan, there was definitely a part of me that was like, yay, they're getting
4625360	4630000	acknowledged and rewarded because their latest expansion is the best they've ever been.
4630000	4631800	So good for them.
4631800	4637280	They have a good, I'm sorry, just one last one, uh, scored music, cadence of Hyrule,
4637280	4641280	Death Stranding, Devil May Cry 5, Kingdom Hearts 3, and Sayonara Wild Hearts.
4641280	4642280	That's a pretty good category.
4642280	4643280	That's a pretty good category.
4643280	4644280	It really is.
4644280	4645280	So, all right.
4645280	4646280	All right.
4646280	4648840	Anyway, uh, SG100 Matt does want to say, I mean to play devil's advocate, Overwatch hasn't
4648840	4650620	really done much this year.
4650620	4652280	Last year they were doing more with the game.
4652280	4657740	This past year, it felt kind of the same, um, but I mean, there's still, still continuing
4657740	4662720	support with new heroes and stuff, but, and the, the special events, but maybe because
4662720	4665600	the special events are kind of recycled cause Overwatch 2 is on the horizon.
4665600	4666600	I don't know.
4666600	4669360	I just, I noticed it wasn't there a little bit surprised.
4669360	4670360	That's all.
4670360	4671400	Anyway, moving on.
4671400	4675920	Let's talk about, uh, since obviously Kojima is taking up a lot of the talk when it comes
4675920	4679740	to the game awards, I think it's worth talking about this.
4679740	4681420	What is Kojima going to do next?
4681420	4684780	Um, because I don't think it's going to necessarily be Death Stranding 2.
4684780	4686500	You know what he said he wants to do?
4686500	4688460	Well, I think that's what I'm about to talk about.
4688460	4691880	So, uh, what he said he wanted to talk about on Twitter.
4691880	4697300	So he wrote a tweet, um, that he said, uh, this is the tweet as to make the scariest
4697300	4702700	horror game, I'll watch the scary movies in order to awaken my horror soul.
4702700	4708260	The I is the Thai horror movie I rent when making PT.
4708260	4710300	This freaky ass movie.
4710300	4715380	Notice he calls it PT and not Silent Hills.
4715380	4718980	Just just, it's just interesting that he didn't, it was, that whole thing was supposed to be
4718980	4722460	Silent Hills, but he called it PT maybe because that's all it ever ended up being.
4722460	4723460	I don't know.
4723460	4727940	But anyway, number one, interesting observation, uh, Thai horror movie I rent when making PT,
4727940	4730020	but was too scary to finish watching.
4730020	4733080	The package is scary, so I rented the disc only.
4733080	4734740	Will I be able to finish watching?
4734740	4735740	You've seen this Dark Soccer?
4735740	4736740	I don't know anything about it.
4736740	4738580	I tell, I probably wouldn't like it.
4738580	4741700	I started watching it movies, fucking creepy as fuck.
4741700	4747380	It's like this, this, uh, violent planner has like a cornea transplant.
4747380	4752940	Um, and, uh, uh, she starts seeing like multiple images of people dying.
4752940	4754420	It's really fucking creepy movie.
4754420	4755820	And they remade it with Jessica Alba.
4755820	4757940	Oh, it's that one.
4757940	4758940	Yeah.
4758940	4762700	Oh, I heard, cause I heard when the Jessica Alba one came out, people were razzing it
4762700	4765300	being like, this ain't shit compared to the original.
4765300	4766300	So yeah.
4766860	4767860	Anyway, interesting.
4767860	4768860	Yeah.
4768860	4772740	If you ever want to watch it, I'll, I'll, I'll pick it up again.
4772740	4774580	I am perfectly content.
4774580	4776700	This is like you and the VR thing.
4776700	4779020	I am perfectly content hearing your take on it.
4779020	4781300	I much prefer Asian horror.
4781300	4782300	Sure.
4782300	4786540	Although I will say that I'm still kind of about Train to Busan, but that is a good movie.
4786540	4788540	I will say this, you know what I do want to see?
4788540	4791500	Cause I've never, I have heard nothing but great things about it.
4791500	4795260	Um, going over to, I think it's South Korean film Parasite.
4795980	4796980	Yeah.
4796980	4797980	I want to see that.
4797980	4798980	That's one I haven't seen.
4798980	4799980	It's on my list.
4799980	4801580	I'm hearing lots of stuff about that.
4801580	4802860	So anyway, I hope I'm right.
4802860	4805580	I hope I didn't credit that to the wrong country.
4805580	4808860	I just, I think it was, but I'll double, I'll double check it.
4808860	4811220	But have you, have you, well, you saw Ju-On, right?
4811220	4813060	Or did you see the original or did you see Grudge?
4813060	4815340	I think he made me watch the original Grudge at some point.
4815340	4819500	I need to have you watch Black Ghost and White Ghost cause they're a little bit more suspenseful.
4819500	4822820	They're not really gross or super scary.
4822820	4823820	To me, they weren't super scary.
4823860	4827980	But if you just want to sit and laugh the whole time, watch, um, Kayako versus, not
4827980	4831740	that one, Sadako 3D, which was like Sadako from the Ring.
4831740	4832740	It's a terrible movie.
4832740	4835180	Actually, Kayako versus Sadako is also hilariously bad.
4835180	4838300	Swongtong in chat says, I watched Suicide Club last week.
4838300	4839300	That messed me up.
4839300	4841500	Suicide Club Club is a fucked up movie anyway.
4841500	4844020	Dark Sakura made me watch that or somebody made me watch that.
4844020	4845020	I have two copies of it.
4845020	4846020	I think you did.
4846020	4847020	Like Loki, somebody made me watch that.
4847020	4848020	I got a copy of it.
4848020	4849020	Yeah.
4849020	4850020	I was like, ugh.
4850020	4851020	Copy.
4851020	4852020	You know, they did, um, Battle Royale on Blu-ray.
4852020	4855740	I was just about to ask, why, why was Battle Royale all of a sudden floating around Facebook
4855740	4856740	this week?
4856740	4860740	Is it because it was the anniversary of, of, um, the movie's release.
4860740	4864540	And so like I did, What's Your Face doing the China to get exploded.
4864540	4865540	Okay.
4865540	4868580	You know, why don't they have a battle royale battle royale game?
4868580	4870020	Would that be inappropriate?
4870020	4874580	They recreated, they, they actually stole that idea for, um, a Marvel series about a
4874580	4879420	two years ago, a year ago, two years ago where they were kidnapping different teenage superheroes,
4879420	4885220	including like some of the runaways and Jubilee and all them and put them in like a battle
4885220	4887020	royale, like full on deathmatch.
4887020	4891900	So I fell down a Wiki rabbit hole and I was trying to look into why did they never remake
4891900	4892900	battle royale?
4892900	4896300	Because surely somebody wanted to remake it for a us audience.
4896300	4899060	And sure enough, they were trying to do that at one point.
4899060	4903060	Um, even despite the controversies about, you know, the things that happen in schools
4903060	4906060	and stuff, you know, there was, there was a particular way they were going to frame
4906060	4907060	it.
4907060	4908080	Um, and let's be real.
4908080	4912200	It's not like seeing teenagers get cut up in horror movies is anything new.
4912200	4915560	Hello, any Freddie or Jason movie or Halloween that ever existed, right?
4915560	4918880	Well, the hunger games games, even though she said she never read battle royale, I watched
4918880	4919880	the movies.
4919880	4920980	It's very reminiscent.
4920980	4924340	And that's, that's kind of where the story ultimately ends up is the reason why they
4924340	4928480	have not remade the movie is because the hunger games happened and we had Lord of the flies.
4928480	4933880	And he said the, the guy who owns the rights said, no matter what we did, if we were to
4933880	4938040	release battle royale here in America, everybody would say it's a rip off of the hunger games.
4938040	4941080	Even though it came first, but he's like, you and I both know the world doesn't work
4941080	4942080	like that.
4942080	4943160	Yeah, but it doesn't.
4943160	4947120	It's just like when beat mania came out and everybody, the ex play fucking called it a
4947120	4948880	guitar hero rip off or whatever.
4948880	4952080	It's like, wait, wait, you ignorant fuck.
4952080	4954040	But so what though?
4954040	4955040	Like doesn't matter.
4955040	4958120	So what if someone calls it a rip off of hunger games?
4958120	4962640	Who cares what people say about a movie doesn't mean it's going to be bad.
4962640	4964440	Doesn't mean people won't go see it.
4964440	4968840	There's plenty of things there, you know, based off of other things, make it even more
4968840	4969840	gory or something.
4969840	4973840	Also, I think I shit a lot already kind of spawned off because of the hunger games.
4973840	4979080	Like what was the other big teenage book movie they started doing the maze runners, the maze
4979080	4983800	runner or is that it was in.
4983800	4989080	There's also, uh, there was the other one that was by the same author that did like
4989080	4995160	the, um, which I can't remember what it's called now.
4995160	4998360	Um, yeah, they had, they've had a few other ones.
4998360	5000960	There was, um, I don't, they all suck.
5000960	5001960	That's what it was.
5001960	5006600	Uh, but yeah, there's been several books of that genre that have been made into movies
5006600	5007600	and stuff.
5007600	5008600	So what's it matter?
5008600	5009600	Early days.
5009600	5017120	I mean, even, let me just, oh, and also battle royale two was crappy, hilariously crappy
5017120	5018120	divergent.
5018160	5019160	Oh, divergent.
5019160	5020160	Divergent isn't the same.
5020160	5021160	Tiger Claw got me.
5021160	5022160	That's what I was thinking of.
5022160	5023960	But it's a completely different kind of genre.
5023960	5027040	Yeah, but those movies exist because of the hunger games because they were looking for
5027040	5028040	the next young adult.
5028040	5029040	They want young adult shit.
5029040	5030040	Yeah.
5030040	5033800	But you know, I mean, if they wanted to do like a battle royale rip off, they could do
5033800	5035440	like a supernatural thing to it.
5035440	5036440	That's the problem.
5036440	5041580	See the reason why I'll tell you why they haven't made a, um, new or a remake of battle
5041580	5042580	royale.
5042580	5043580	The running man.
5043580	5044580	There's another one like that, by the way.
5044580	5045580	Ooh, yes.
5045580	5046580	They should do a remake of that.
5046580	5050940	The reason why they can't do a remake of battle royale is because they can't stretch it out
5050940	5055220	to be a franchise and milk that shit for as much fucking money as they can.
5055220	5056220	That is the real reason.
5056220	5057220	They tried in Japan.
5057220	5058220	We saw it happen.
5058220	5059220	Let me bring it back to the comics.
5059220	5061620	We're going to bring it back to the topic that started this whole tangent.
5061620	5062620	No, that's okay.
5062620	5066060	And that is Kojima taking on horror games potentially because you know, he basically
5066060	5069160	is saying in that tweet, I'm trying to put myself in a horror game mood.
5069160	5073060	So it's, I mean, he didn't say it like that, but it's read the subtext.
5073060	5078060	That's not the thing I thought he was going to talk about because he, the rumor was saying
5078060	5081820	the next thing Kojima productions were going to do was a movie.
5081820	5085740	Oh, there was the, Oh, so maybe what if he did a horror movie?
5085740	5091860	That seems likely, or what if he put the studios like CG, you know, cause you could do a whole,
5091860	5096420	I mean, especially as good as Death Stranding looked and how beautifully everything moved.
5096420	5101580	Imagine if, well, in another, just earlier than that, uh, Detroit was the same way.
5101580	5103420	It was all mocap acting.
5103420	5110660	You could do a movie all in mocap CG like that, which would give you a lot more, say,
5110660	5113300	less special, special effects.
5113300	5114300	You know what I mean?
5114300	5117340	Things that actually seem more immersive in their environment.
5117340	5118340	What if he's doing that?
5118340	5119340	Who knows?
5119340	5120860	Uh, only Kojima knows.
5120860	5126200	So we can, we can only look for the hints, uh, within the tweets in the time being.
5126200	5127200	That's all we can do.
5127200	5129420	Next franchise to be released, the audition.
5129420	5132060	Let's move on and talk about other movies.
5132060	5133600	You don't know what the audition is.
5133600	5134600	I don't think.
5134600	5136100	I don't think so.
5136100	5141300	It's this woman auditions a man to be, or she's pretending to be the audition, but she's
5141300	5144860	like trying him to be her husband and then it's kind of like borderline fake snuff film
5144860	5145860	type thing.
5145860	5146860	It's really, it's creepy.
5146860	5147860	Anyway.
5147860	5148860	Yeah.
5148860	5149860	And I haven't watched it.
5149860	5150860	How about something family friendly?
5150860	5151860	Okay.
5151860	5152860	How about Sonic?
5152860	5153860	Okay.
5153860	5155140	So again, Sanic.
5155140	5160020	So you know how much they were saying that the redesign costs the company, right?
5160020	5163860	When the, the, the rumor was something like 35 million or something like that.
5163860	5169780	Well, there is a source close to the production quotes, quote, quote, um, uh, that was released
5169780	5174900	through IndieWire that said that it was actually less than 5 million for Paramount.
5174900	5179380	Um, a reason being, and actually the reason why this makes a lot of sense is because apparently
5179380	5183980	when the first trailer came out, the only, uh, the effects that were finished was the
5183980	5184980	stuff in the trailer.
5185020	5188980	So keep in mind how much VFX costs for design and render.
5188980	5195980	Um, on top of that too, they did, now they did have to rework the, um, you know, the
5195980	5200420	character design, reanimate, stuff like that, but that's going to be a lot less, especially
5200420	5202300	if most of the rig is already done.
5202300	5204220	The body really looks about the same.
5204220	5206380	It's re-rigging the face, right?
5206380	5209660	And if they didn't have to add effects to it, going in afterwards to add the effects
5209660	5212140	would really put it much, much lower.
5212140	5217900	They didn't have as much work to do, especially if that redesign was, uh, redesign was done
5217900	5220620	a lot earlier than we saw it happen.
5220620	5224140	So, and you know, it could be possible because this happens a lot.
5224140	5229660	I mean, in 3d design, in web design, in anything, you know, anytime you design a character,
5229660	5232620	you're going to have mock-ups.
5232620	5236300	How many times have you looked at a beta version of the game and seeing that a character looks
5236300	5237300	completely different?
5237300	5239820	What about that pirate game that turned into Banjo Kazooie?
5239820	5240820	Right?
5240820	5241820	Right.
5241820	5246060	So, I mean, and there's still like erroneous data for some of those models that are in
5246060	5247060	games.
5247060	5251060	The same thing happens with movies, especially when you're dealing with CG, you're going
5251060	5253140	to have test mock-ups.
5253140	5259300	So it could very well be that they may have already had that design already done.
5259300	5263740	You know, I think even if it had been 35 million, even I know it was five, but even if it had
5263740	5268240	been 35 million, I think it would have still been worth the investment because this movie,
5268240	5272440	you know, and it's funny because we just were talking about how Twitter and internet noise
5272440	5276880	doesn't always really matter at the end of the day, but at the same time, something felt
5276880	5280320	very different and legit about the Sonic movie talk.
5280320	5282720	And I really think this movie would have just straight up bombed.
5282720	5286160	There would have been so, like even myself, maybe, and maybe this is why I'm like, oh,
5286160	5290040	this is going to turn around because even myself, like based on that first movie trailer,
5290040	5292080	I was like, this is going to be bad.
5292080	5293360	I don't, I'm not going to see this.
5293360	5294360	Forget it.
5294360	5295360	I'll just wait.
5295360	5296360	And what comes on Blu-ray.
5296480	5297480	I mean, it's a trailer.
5297480	5299760	Even I'm kind of like, well, I think I've had something to go with, I'll probably go
5299760	5300760	check it out.
5300760	5301760	Why not?
5301760	5305520	And I think there's a lot of people that now were like, Sonic, oh yes, that is the character
5305520	5307200	I remember from my childhood.
5307200	5311040	I think that, I think it's going to make up that 35 million or 5 million, whatever it
5311040	5312040	is in box office.
5312040	5313040	There's another point to this too.
5313040	5317600	And these are a couple of deleted tweets by one of their VFX designers, um, named, uh,
5317600	5322640	actually a motion capture animator, Stu Whitten, um, at Stu underscore FX on Twitter.
5322640	5325120	Um, and this was on November 12th.
5325880	5331960	Oh, one said pretty much went back to our original design, LOL, see, number two, mad
5331960	5334520	props to our character lab in Vancouver team.
5334520	5337280	And he had a link on there, but these were deleted.
5337280	5341960	So apparently this design, like I said, was already done.
5341960	5342960	Hmm.
5342960	5344800	So very interesting.
5344800	5345920	It doesn't surprise me.
5345920	5348760	I had a feeling that it was already done.
5348760	5353820	Um, tiger claw and chat says it has a lot to live up to considering the success detective
5353860	5358420	Pikachu had, um, that's pretty true as well, you know, detective Pikachu did pretty damn
5358420	5359420	well.
5359420	5363860	Um, and I did go see that in the theater actually, and it was a super fucking cute movie.
5363860	5371500	So, um, yeah, I mean, I have to say, uh, in the pre trailer, the first trailer era, when
5371500	5376220	tiger claw would post all these things on Sonic, I would, I would want to be like, dude,
5376220	5377340	stop trying to make fetch happen.
5377340	5381100	This movie's destined for failure, but now I'm like, all right, I get where your hype
5381100	5382100	is.
5382780	5388100	I may not be leading that hype train, but I'm like, okay, I see why people are excited.
5388100	5389100	I get it.
5389100	5390940	It looks, it looks kind of neat.
5390940	5394580	So all right, anyhow, let's move on.
5394580	5399020	Let's talk about, uh, potentially the future of gaming in our next story.
5399020	5400020	Loki.
5400020	5401020	All right.
5401020	5406260	Uh, so obviously we're waiting, um, with beta breath about the announcement of the PlayStation
5406260	5410060	five and wondering what the hell is Sony going to offer with that?
5410100	5415620	Well, we get a little bit of a glimpse with a brand new patent for their controller.
5415620	5421460	Now the controller looks pretty similar to the dual shock for, um, just some minor tweaks
5421460	5422460	with how it is.
5422460	5430380	One thing that is noticed on the redesign is that the light bar seems to be missing.
5430380	5434340	Um, it doesn't seem to be in that picture, at least from what I can see.
5434340	5440220	Still has the touch pad available, um, on top there, but maybe that'll be a touch screen.
5440220	5441220	Who knows?
5441220	5445660	But right now, um, not a whole lot that we can see other than, I guess, being that there
5445660	5450300	is no light bar there, I guess that kind of makes sense because I'm assuming there may
5450300	5453980	not be a camera, although there would have to be a camera because you'd have to, how
5453980	5455740	would you get PlayStation VR to work?
5455740	5460020	So the VR needs one, well, unless they're going to change how that works, but I don't
5460020	5461020	know what that would be.
5461020	5462020	I don't know what that would be.
5462020	5463020	Can do that.
5463020	5464020	So we'll see.
5464020	5465020	Um, but yeah, it looks pretty similar.
5465020	5471820	Maybe they just decided, I mean, what games use that light bar for control with a camera
5471820	5476420	that can't just be subbed in for the move, which is kind of required to use VR anyway.
5476420	5479500	Like that, that the controller light bar hasn't been used on any recent games.
5479500	5482660	I mean, I think it's pretty and I think it makes a neat ambient effect.
5482660	5483660	Don't get me wrong.
5483660	5487380	Yeah, they use it for like indicators and stuff like that sometimes, but it's not like
5487380	5488380	anything meaningful.
5488380	5491740	And there's also that tiny little light strip in the, in the touch pad that you could kind
5491740	5495180	of use that for, um, maybe instead of having that whole backlight.
5495180	5499180	So, but, and then, and also just because this is a patent doesn't mean it's going to show
5499180	5501100	the exact design of that.
5501100	5503140	Maybe they'll tweak that and have it in there.
5503140	5504140	Who knows?
5504140	5506620	Um, but it looks pretty similar.
5506620	5510100	I mean the same layout and everything, they're not moving the six around or anything like
5510100	5511100	that.
5511100	5515860	I mean, it's, if you were to tell me that's a DualShock 4, I'd probably believe you.
5515900	5518740	So for the most part, it just kind of looks like they're just sticking with what's worked
5518740	5522820	in the last generation, which seems plenty like a good idea to me.
5522820	5526540	I guess there's no, we're not expecting any big change with like, oh, they're saying like
5526540	5527540	the share button showed up.
5527540	5531420	Maybe like similar, they're going to have haptic feedback or whatever in the triggers.
5531420	5533380	And so that was something that they were talking about before.
5533380	5537600	And that's something that the Xbox One X sort of has a little bit of rumble in the triggers
5537600	5538600	as well.
5538600	5543300	So, uh, be curious to see what that's like, but like you're playing horizon and you go
5543300	5546780	to like fire the bow and it's going to kind of do that haptic feedback to make it really
5546780	5549260	feel like you're pulling the bowstring back or something like that.
5549260	5550260	Yeah.
5550260	5551260	Yeah.
5551260	5552260	So that can be neat.
5552260	5553260	Yeah.
5553260	5554260	All right.
5554260	5555260	Well, we'll see.
5555260	5559260	And again, we don't really know until it is officially unveiled by PlayStation.
5559260	5561460	All right.
5561460	5565780	Moving on to talking about sales, sales, sales, because you know, there are going to be a
5565780	5568060	shit ton of sales on Black Friday.
5568060	5569060	They're going to be online.
5569060	5570060	They're going to be in stores.
5570060	5571060	They're going to be everywhere.
5571060	5575940	I'm sure some of you more thrifty, uh, gamers out there already have your eyes on what might
5575940	5577380	you pick up on Black Friday.
5577380	5581500	Sadly, you know what I'm not seeing on Black Friday sales, Death Stranding.
5581500	5584780	I was hoping, I was hoping I might be able to get a deal on it if I waited, but it looks
5584780	5586100	like that's not happening.
5586100	5589140	So maybe, I don't think it is at this point.
5589140	5594320	Uh, but you can already get in on some of the PlayStation four Black Friday deals, uh,
5594320	5598740	which include, uh, I guess the PlayStation VR is coming way down and this is a big one
5598740	5606940	$199 as opposed to $300, uh, the game bundle that has the VR headset, the camera and five
5606940	5612360	games, including Astrobot Rescue Mission, Skyrim VR, Resident Evil 7, Everybody's Golf
5612360	5614020	and PlayStation VR worlds.
5614020	5616440	That's pretty damn good for $200.
5616440	5619500	So I expect that may, uh, that may get some people on board with that.
5619500	5620500	We'll see.
5620500	5624780	Um, also $200 for just a straight up PlayStation four.
5624780	5628860	If you don't have PS4 yet, if you haven't jumped into the, uh, latest generation, or
5628860	5632420	maybe, you know, you've been Xbox this whole time, you haven't, uh, picked up PS4 for whatever
5632420	5637500	reason, $200 for a one terabyte PlayStation four that comes with Last of Us, God of War
5637500	5642220	and Horizon Zero Dawn, a PlayStation four pro for $300.
5642220	5647060	So that's, um, pretty darn, you know, those are some big, deep cuts, but you would expect
5647060	5652100	those types of, uh, deep cuts, uh, this, you know, especially right before PlayStation
5652100	5653580	five is coming out.
5653580	5658540	Um, also, uh, Death Stranding is going to be free with a PlayStation four bundle, a
5658540	5660700	certain one, uh, that you can pick up.
5660700	5665260	So there's lots of deals and that's just the official PlayStation deals.
5665260	5671100	But I know everywhere, every, uh, company is having different sales of their own.
5671100	5675940	Uh, Loki, I can't help but notice you have a cheap ass gamer who I know they live off
5675940	5676940	this stuff.
5676940	5679140	So anything that caught your eye over there?
5679140	5680740	Uh, not really.
5680740	5682700	I was just kind of taking a look to see what they had.
5682740	5687340	Yeah, they had, I haven't pulled it up, but they had on their Twitter, uh, link to an
5687340	5692340	Excel, it's not an Excel spreadsheet, it's a Google docs, a spreadsheet or whatever that
5692340	5695820	they've got, um, breaking down the different deals.
5695820	5700060	I actually visited that the other day because I wanted to see if Death Stranding was on
5700060	5701060	it.
5701060	5702060	Yeah.
5702060	5705780	And I don't see Death Stranding on any of these, but there's lots of other stuff that's
5705780	5706780	on here.
5706780	5708020	I mean, it's worth checking out.
5708020	5709020	Oh yeah.
5709020	5712260	This is the time to catch up if there's anything else, you know, not from November this year.
5712300	5715460	Uh, you know, cause we all know Pokemon sword and shield ain't getting discounted.
5715460	5718540	So, you know, if there's anything not from this month that you want to pick up from the
5718540	5720860	year, you know, Black Friday is going to be a great time to do it.
5720860	5726100	Uh, and you know, I think some places won't reveal their deals until what Black Friday
5726100	5727860	or Cyber Monday will be another one.
5727860	5728860	Right?
5728860	5729860	Yeah, that would be another one.
5729860	5732820	Um, just trying to see what other stuff they have.
5732820	5736220	I'm gonna wait for like, and obviously we'll have a steam sale pretty soon.
5736220	5738780	So I'd be curious to see what they have on there.
5738780	5740500	I made my purchase this week.
5740500	5742600	So I've, what'd you pick up?
5742600	5748180	I picked up, um, it was a game that I played and I had talked about a little bit on my
5748180	5749420	Twitter as well.
5749420	5754440	I had played this at one of our Sac Indie arcades couple of years ago, I think in 2017.
5754440	5759980	And it's a local dev who's out of Oakland who put out a game called black future 88.
5759980	5762780	It's a rogue light and it's fucking amazing.
5762780	5765300	And it's just like some indie guy that put this out.
5765300	5768300	So it's out on switch and steam.
5768300	5769300	So go check it out.
5769300	5773780	It's like, they have a 10% off right now, so it's like 17 99, uh, while I are wants
5773780	5779240	to recommend the recently released Contra and Castlevania collections currently 10 bucks
5779240	5780460	down from 20.
5780460	5784700	You had me for a second there when you said, Contra is like the new one and then you let
5784700	5786900	the collections like, Oh, okay.
5786900	5787900	Okay.
5787900	5789620	But that back when the concert games were good, right?
5789620	5790620	Right.
5790620	5791620	Like new Contra.
5791620	5792620	No.
5792620	5793620	Um, let's see.
5793620	5796140	Oh, quest buster says dragon quest builders two is 25 bucks.
5796140	5797140	That's pretty good.
5797980	5801980	Matt says Amazon is usually quiet until week of, but most of the time in lockstep with
5801980	5802980	other retailers, prizes.
5802980	5807540	They came out with something today, uh, cause I know TVs, that was the thing that caught
5807540	5808540	my eye.
5808540	5813080	Cause you guys know I still don't have a 4k TV cause I, I made the dumb mistake of buying
5813080	5816300	a TV like the year before 4k became affordable.
5816300	5818220	So I'm, I missed the fuck out.
5818220	5823860	But now I'm starting to look at it going, Ooh, tempting, super tempting cause I kind
5823860	5829580	of want 4k gaming and I have a PS4 pro and other things is more 4k.
5829580	5830580	So I'm thinking about it.
5830580	5831580	I think about it.
5831580	5832580	Yeah.
5832580	5833580	We'll see.
5833580	5837460	But it's, it's also like, but you could also be saving that money for like buying a house,
5837460	5839460	but we'll see.
5839460	5840460	All right.
5840460	5841460	Um, let's move on.
5841460	5846980	Let's move on to a time before, uh, you know, before games, before black Friday was really
5846980	5852540	like this holiday in and of itself, a simpler time when it was, when it was proper and easy
5852540	5854020	to make a game based on poultry.
5854020	5855020	Yes.
5855020	5858620	So we're going to go back to a classic time with the classic game of the week segment
5858620	5862460	where every week dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5862460	5864660	Hey, you guys should check this game out.
5864660	5868560	Or maybe not so much sometimes a game that you should check out, but this game is kind
5868560	5869560	of stupid.
5869560	5870560	Isn't this game topical?
5870560	5871560	Yeah.
5871560	5872560	So what'd you pick?
5872560	5878620	Well, I think it's a game called Ego mania and like I, for the longest time I always
5878620	5881340	thought it was a Turkey cause it doesn't look like a Turkey, but it's supposed to be a chicken
5881340	5885220	It's that's a, that is a fucking Turkey.
5885220	5887340	That's a fucking Turkey across the top of the screen.
5887340	5893460	That is a ugly ass Atari, 2,600 Turkey actually looks like a very well run, you know, rendered
5893460	5897620	Turkey for the 2,600, but still, and can I say something about the guy playing this gate?
5897620	5901420	Cause I watched the four minutes or whatever I took of this video earlier.
5901420	5904540	Whoever's playing this sucks sucks.
5904540	5909540	I don't think he gets past like six eggs ever.
5909540	5913060	Here is another video, but it was actually a guy recording it on the TV cause it's for
5913060	5917140	a world record getting a fucking world record in Ego mania.
5917140	5918740	Like this is stupid.
5918740	5921140	If I had an Ego mania, I'd want it to be about waffles.
5921140	5922140	Okay.
5922140	5926180	So the first thing everybody's yelling in chat, which was the first thing I yelled,
5926180	5927180	isn't this just kaboom?
5927180	5928180	Yeah.
5928180	5934980	So at any rate, um, it was done, uh, and it came out in January, 1993 by us games for
5934980	5936460	the Atari 2,600.
5936460	5943860	And it was similar in design to kaboom, which is itself derived from the arcade game avalanche.
5943860	5948380	You know, one could make the argument that that's big bird at the top of the screen because
5948380	5949380	it'd be all yellow.
5949380	5953460	No, but it's the sad big bird from when they put them in the circus and the yellow.
5953460	5955020	So it'd be like half sad.
5955020	5956020	He's half sad.
5956020	5957500	I'd be sad if I was in this game too.
5957500	5959060	This game is fucking ugly.
5959060	5960060	Dark soccer.
5960060	5961060	I should watch follow that bird.
5961060	5963940	Well, the only reason I picked it cause it's a fucking Turkey.
5963940	5968740	You don't know the classic games of the week are not always winners and we need to know
5968740	5969740	about the shit.
5969740	5970940	So we don't repeat our mistakes.
5970940	5971940	That's true.
5971940	5977900	And this does come from a time and an era where games like this caused the entire industry
5977900	5978900	to crash.
5978900	5981100	I bet that I don't think this is as bad as ET.
5981100	5982620	I used to play this game.
5982620	5983940	I remember this game.
5983940	5985820	Oh my God.
5985820	5986980	I bet that's what I want.
5986980	5987980	That's cookie monster.
5987980	5988980	Hold on.
5988980	5989980	Hold on a sec.
5989980	5990980	Look at, look at the picture.
5990980	5991980	Look.
5991980	5993180	No, I'm looking at it right now.
5993420	5994420	I played this game.
5994420	5995420	Okay.
5995420	5996420	I remember this game.
5996420	5997420	Wow.
5997420	5998420	Why didn't you play kaboom?
5998420	5999420	The good game.
5999420	6000420	That's the same thing.
6000420	6001420	I don't remember.
6001420	6002420	Hopefully I can get this to show up.
6002420	6003420	Oh, nevermind.
6003420	6004420	You're showing the video.
6004420	6005420	I'll send it in chat anyway.
6005420	6006420	But anyway.
6006420	6007420	Ecomania.
6007420	6008420	It's a stupid, stupid ass game.
6008420	6009420	Anyway.
6009420	6012180	So doesn't the chicken make like clucking noises as it's going around?
6012180	6015620	If I remember correctly, it's an Atari 2,600.
6015620	6020300	So it probably made unless there's a port to like another console maintain.
6020300	6021760	It's a Turkey.
6021760	6023120	So anyway.
6023120	6026440	So you basically have to catch eggs in a bowl and it's supposed to be a bear catching it
6026440	6027440	by the way.
6027440	6028440	Who's walking through honey.
6028440	6030840	Cause you see how he's sinking down a little bit.
6030840	6031840	Yeah.
6031840	6032840	He's it's barren.
6032840	6034960	Oh, 420 is the points.
6034960	6040360	But I thought, I thought the bottom was all yolk from the cracked eggs.
6040360	6044360	They kept dropping cause the guy playing sucks, but you see it's going down.
6044360	6051160	Oh no, he drowns in the egg yolk, egg full of protein.
6051160	6052160	Yeah.
6052160	6053480	This little bow legged ass bear though.
6053480	6054640	So maybe it, maybe it is.
6054640	6055640	All right.
6055640	6056640	Let me look at it.
6056640	6057640	Let me wait till an egg falls on the ground.
6057640	6059640	No, he's just stupid.
6059640	6065600	Um, anyway, so, um, you have to catch eggs in a bowl on top of your head.
6065600	6068480	I mean, it's the, the, you actually have two difficulties.
6068480	6072720	You have an easier one where you get a bigger, a larger hat for catching.
6072720	6073720	It's an upside down hat.
6073720	6074720	It looks like a bowl.
6074720	6075720	Fuck ever.
6075720	6076720	Anyway.
6076720	6078280	Um, so yeah.
6078280	6082120	It's not like it has a plot cause it's an Atari 2,600 game.
6082120	6090000	So electronic games in June 20, uh, 20, 1983 said it was quote, delightful in a game that
6090000	6092160	improved on Kaboom.
6092160	6097000	And it said that was, and I'm going to quote this again, a fully animated delight that
6097000	6105080	might even eclipse its inspiration with state of the art graphics on the 2,600 the fuck.
6105080	6111200	It also, um, there was another game actually from 1982 inspired by avalanche called chicken.
6111200	6115320	Pretty much the same, same shit, but it actually looks like a chicken.
6115320	6121080	I feel like the story behind this game is that big bird is deciding to poop eggs all
6121080	6123160	over his friend cookie monster.
6123160	6132320	Big bird cannot cause big bird's a dude and I mean big bird does not have the egg producing
6132320	6134920	internal bits.
6134920	6137360	Well big bird was really a bird anyway.
6137360	6138360	Forget it.
6138360	6142520	I'm not going to try and just, I'm not trying to try and justify this game.
6142520	6147960	It was designed by Henry will and West Traeger music composed by Todd Marshall.
6147960	6148960	Okay.
6148960	6151320	I heard the target 2,600 in 1983.
6151320	6155480	I think I did read that one thing that separates this from kaboom.
6155480	6160160	So there is one way that this is different from kaboom is that if you actually get all
6160160	6165080	the eggs in the stage, which this guy never does a spoiler cause he is fucking terrible
6165080	6166080	at this game.
6166080	6170200	But if you get all the eggs in a stage, is Bobby Black Wolf playing this game?
6170200	6171680	No, come on.
6171680	6172680	Let's let's be fair.
6172680	6176880	Bobby Black Wolf would be like way better than stage one is actually playing in big
6176880	6177880	hat mode.
6177880	6178880	Oh my God.
6178880	6186640	Anyway, but apparently if you catch all of the eggs, you get to throw the eggs back.
6186640	6188640	That is the big twist.
6188640	6193920	Even in kaboom, if you got to throw a bomb back at the bandit, that is the big twist
6193920	6194920	in this game.
6194920	6195920	Apparently.
6195920	6199760	So, and Bobby says, Hey, I would be better than this guy.
6199760	6201040	No, that's true.
6201040	6210560	And VG realness says the shade of it all SSJ 100 Matt does a bunch of salt emoji.
6210560	6211600	I'm so mean.
6211600	6215440	We should have, you know, for our next game jam, we should have terrible ripoffs as the
6215440	6216440	theme.
6216440	6217440	And then we can do there.
6217440	6218440	So that's, that's a good idea.
6218440	6224920	But actually I will say this tiger claw with a really good thought in our chat, tiger claw
6224920	6231320	said, maybe it's time for a new category called the classic shitty game of the week.
6231320	6234480	Well, you know, dark soccer already has next year's theming.
6234480	6240320	I can do a shitty game a month, but you already have a monthly thing, but it's still a classic
6240320	6241320	game.
6241320	6242320	Okay.
6242320	6244880	So it would fall under the umbrella of classic game.
6244880	6248040	It would just be my category would be, and here's your piece of shit for the month.
6248040	6249040	Okay.
6249040	6250040	All right.
6250040	6251040	All right.
6251040	6252040	So do it.
6252040	6254320	So 2020, we're going to have what was classic pinball, classic pinball, and we're going
6254320	6257760	to have pinball 2000 classic shitty game of the week.
6257760	6258760	Classic shitty game.
6258760	6259760	Oh, this is good.
6259760	6260760	This is good.
6260760	6261760	Cause this will be a chance.
6261760	6264560	I mean, we're, we've already, Halo's going to be the first game we've already, you've
6264560	6269120	already done Halo, but you, and we've already recognized games like miss nude world 96.
6269120	6270920	That's not really a shitty game.
6270920	6271920	It's actually fun.
6271920	6272920	Yeah, that's true.
6272920	6275880	The technology in that game, the soundtrack, everybody move your body.
6275880	6281560	Um, like I would do stuff like, I mean, night trap, night traps gotta be one of them.
6281560	6282960	I think I might've done night trap.
6282960	6283960	I think you did too.
6283960	6290640	Um, I could do stuff like, um, Oh, like WCW thunder, which is one of the games that I
6290640	6291640	thought was so bad.
6291640	6292640	I took it back.
6292640	6293640	Oh God.
6293640	6294640	It's a good one.
6294640	6295640	Oh yeah.
6295640	6296640	Oh yeah.
6296640	6297640	Okay.
6297640	6298640	I'll do yours.
6298640	6299640	I mean, I'll just spoiler alert.
6299640	6306280	People don't fucking see that happening, which seriously, uh, what was all those games on
6306280	6308360	the 2,600 that caused the video game to crash?
6308360	6311680	Like the Chuck wagging pure in a Chuck wagon, like it was garbage.
6311680	6313080	Uh, commercials were funny.
6313080	6314560	What else on 2,600?
6314560	6317120	Not the, no adult games.
6317120	6318120	Don't go.
6318120	6319280	So it's showing things like beat them and eat them.
6319280	6320280	Cause that's too easy.
6320280	6321280	That's gross.
6321280	6322280	Yeah.
6322280	6323280	But like, like, you know, there was et there's Pac-Man.
6323280	6324280	Yeah.
6324280	6328040	There's plenty of like, you just do a whole year of shitty 2,600 games and fill it up
6328040	6329040	like that.
6329440	6330440	Anyway.
6330440	6332000	I mean, fuck I might even, I don't know.
6332000	6333000	Yeah.
6333000	6335000	By the way, this is a completely off topic.
6335000	6336000	What else is new?
6336000	6343080	I picked up one of the 1978 punk table tennis consoles that plugs into the little UHF.
6343080	6344080	Oh rad.
6344080	6345080	Thing.
6345080	6346080	Um, I haven't tested it or anything.
6346080	6348120	I paid like eight bucks for it, but I picked one up.
6348120	6352480	Uh, the other thing that you picked up that you have yet to bring up on this show, fail,
6352480	6354880	fail, that you sent me a picture of last night.
6354880	6356320	Oh, well we don't own it.
6356320	6357320	We're borrowing it.
6357320	6358320	Still it's your house.
6358600	6361080	I have, um, an Elvira scared stiff in my garage.
6361080	6362080	So cool.
6362080	6363080	Come play.
6363080	6364080	I will.
6364080	6365080	I think I might.
6365080	6366080	Girl.
6366080	6367080	Don't threaten me with any time.
6367080	6370560	Well, you know, um, Wednesday night is our classic gaming shit thing at my house.
6370560	6372240	Well, you know what I mean?
6372240	6373240	It's like we do it.
6373240	6374240	Um, we do it.
6374240	6375240	Wow.
6375240	6376240	You hype it up so well.
6376240	6377240	Well, we, we do this thing.
6377240	6380240	Come over and have a shit time at dark soccer's shitty party.
6380240	6381240	I'll bake.
6381240	6384920	I'm going to be in there baking anyway, so fuck, cause I've got to bake for the sisters
6384920	6387840	and have to bake for Thanksgiving and have to bake for Dan's birthday, which is Friday.
6388440	6392080	So, I mean, what the fuck ever sisters coming over, I want to play pinball with them.
6392080	6393080	I don't think so.
6393080	6394080	Really?
6394080	6396800	Cause I think, well, I mean, I'll invite the sisters, but I doubt they'd want to just play,
6396800	6402880	you know, Sega Saturn and Nintendo, but at any rate, um, but yeah, we do a classic gaming
6402880	6404840	thing on the night before Thanksgiving.
6404840	6406480	So you've been over for a couple of those.
6406480	6407480	Yeah.
6407480	6408480	We've been before.
6408480	6411080	Just dependent if we remember when we did the smash party.
6411080	6412080	I do.
6412080	6413080	Yeah.
6413080	6414080	So we did it.
6414080	6415080	One of our smash parties was like that.
6415320	6418200	VGRealness says the stuff dark soccer bakes looks so damn good.
6418200	6420800	Well, maybe dark soccer will have to send a care package.
6420800	6421800	Maybe I will.
6421800	6423440	Even though Canadian Thanksgiving already happened.
6423440	6424440	Well, yeah.
6424440	6425440	Okay.
6425440	6426440	Okay.
6426440	6427440	I'll tell you what.
6427440	6429480	Message me on the Facebooks.
6429480	6432100	I will arrange a bake exchange with you.
6432100	6435320	If your name is VGRealness or you're opening this up to everybody.
6435320	6436320	In return for poutine.
6436320	6437320	Oh, okay.
6437320	6438320	Are you opening this up to everybody or just VGRealness?
6438320	6439320	No, just VGRealness.
6439320	6441680	Cause VGRealness can get me Canada stuff.
6441680	6442680	Okay.
6442680	6446040	Just like freeze pack me some Tim Hortons.
6446040	6447960	I want some fucking ketchup chips.
6447960	6449560	No, no, no, no.
6449560	6451480	I have to look for Canadian stuff I want.
6451480	6452480	So, but I will do it.
6452480	6455120	Cause we can get all dressed here now.
6455120	6456120	I love all dressed.
6456120	6457120	Oh my God.
6457120	6458120	But you know what?
6458120	6459120	But you know what?
6459120	6463520	If you do that, if we can set up a food trade and I will also send you C's candy.
6463520	6464520	Okay.
6464520	6465520	So anyway.
6465520	6466520	All right.
6466520	6467520	Moving on.
6467520	6469880	We actually, we have a break segment this week.
6469880	6470880	I'm very excited.
6471080	6474800	So we're going to take a quick break in studio, but for you guys that are watching along or
6474800	6476880	listening along on the podcast, this is great.
6476880	6480200	So we haven't talked a lot about Stadia tonight.
6480200	6483840	And that's because none of us have played it yet, but you know who has played it is
6483840	6486960	our voiceover guy VX Jason XV.
6486960	6492580	So he has worked very hard on this segment after he got his Stadia to give his impressions
6492580	6493580	for you guys.
6493580	6496600	And so I'm very happy to debut it here tonight for you guys.
6496600	6500480	So I want to say a big preemptive, thank you to Jason for this.
6500480	6502740	I'm really excited to have this here on the show tonight.
6502740	6507560	So without further ado, let's get to Jason's thoughts on Google Stadia.
6521560	6524080	Tonight, Jason gets more than 13 seconds of airtime.
6524080	6527760	I get to chat at you during this break about my feelings on Google Stadia, the next great
6527760	6528760	streaming game service.
6528760	6530360	What do I think about it?
6530360	6533560	Find out right now on orange voiceover radio.
6546560	6551680	Google Stadia, Google's first grade foray into non-mobile gaming Stadia officially released
6551680	6555560	the week of November 18th, depending on where you live and your circumstances, you likely
6555560	6557340	received it someday that week.
6557340	6560800	My account set up email came out on Wednesday, which I promptly opened and set up waiting
6560800	6563720	anxiously for the Stadia package to arrive the next day.
6563720	6565400	And it did.
6565400	6568000	The Stadia package arrived on Thursday while I was still working.
6568000	6572000	I did open it up, inspect all the contents, take initial notes on all the hardware and
6572000	6575960	plugged in the controller to charge it just in case I decided to use it wirelessly.
6575960	6580200	You receive your color choice of a very typical looking console controller with a slight difference
6580200	6581200	in buttons.
6581720	6584800	A double row of menu buttons on the top of the front face of the controller, a Stadia
6584800	6589040	button located in the same place as the PlayStation button on PlayStation style controllers.
6589040	6593760	It has PlayStation style analog sticks parallel to the bottom, yet Microsoft style face buttons,
6593760	6595920	A on bottom, Y on top.
6595920	6600120	There is also the requisite physical documentation with the lightest of details, a Chromecast
6600120	6601800	Ultra and its power brick.
6601800	6605480	The most noteworthy detail in all of this was that the Chromecast's power brick has
6605480	6608280	an ethernet port in it, which was neat.
6608280	6611560	I've since learned this is a standard feature of the Chromecast Ultra, but I've never
6611560	6615920	used that before I received it in this package, so it's still neat.
6615920	6619080	I had a bunch of things to do on Thursday after I was done working, so the bulk of my
6619080	6623600	review time wasn't particularly extensive, it was only about a little bit over an hour.
6623600	6627680	As I do with all new systems, I spent the first amount of time going through the menus,
6627680	6633480	and the first point of contention I faced was that when you use Stadia.com on a PC,
6633480	6635920	you have no access to the Stadia store.
6636000	6640800	Both Stadia.com and playing via the Chromecast tell you to open the app to manage your Stadia
6640800	6643880	library or purchase games.
6643880	6648280	So I pull up my phone and claim the first two free Stadia Pro subscriber games, Samurai
6648280	6652480	Showdown, naturally the 2019 release, and Destiny 2, the collection.
6652480	6656520	Given the lack of time I had Thursday night, I opted for Samurai Showdown because I probably
6656520	6660200	wouldn't even get through character creation in Destiny 2.
6660200	6664480	Based off how playing Destiny went, I was correct in that assumption.
6664480	6667400	Google has a gigantic leg up on content service providers.
6667400	6670640	Their history, growth, and optimization for all things networking means that they have
6670640	6674760	data centers around the world, close to major internet hubs and in some cases even closer
6674760	6676200	to consumers.
6676200	6680360	This capacity is immense for their purposes alone, and grows even larger still since they
6680360	6682960	sell it to customers via Google Cloud.
6682960	6685640	And then there's the technical proficiency of the tools in use.
6685640	6689800	Their stewardship of the VP9 codec, the video codec they encode every YouTube video into
6689800	6694480	among others, means that they have gigantic amounts of source materials and tools to encode,
6694480	6697240	stream, and leverage the codec's capability.
6697240	6701640	I assume Stadia's output is VP9, I don't actually know.
6701640	6705520	There's been nothing in the Stadia interface that actually reports this, there's no technical
6705520	6709880	details right click option that I noticed, and I haven't done the research for it yet.
6709880	6714280	But if they don't use VP9 for this, I would be very surprised.
6714280	6717280	So my Stadia controller had already been plugged in and was charging.
6717320	6722320	I had to install Chrome in order to access Stadia.com on this PC as I hadn't yet.
6722320	6727080	And upon starting the Samurai Showdown, I immediately ran into something peculiar.
6727080	6731360	When you hit a button on any controller in Samurai Showdown for the first time, it displays
6731360	6734080	the confirmation that the device is in use.
6734080	6737960	I had accidentally hit a key on the keyboard, and it said keyboard connected.
6737960	6742960	And then when I used the Stadia controller, it said player 2's controller is connected.
6742960	6743960	Player 2.
6743960	6744960	Hmm.
6744960	6749840	And, unsurprisingly, Player 2's controller is not able to navigate the menus, so the
6749840	6753680	Stadia controller was doing, effectively, nothing in game.
6753680	6757760	Okay, I have a lot of accessories plugged into this PC.
6757760	6760120	Is it Player 2 because the keyboard was pressed first?
6760120	6763480	Close the game, log back into it, hit the controller first.
6763480	6764480	Nope.
6764480	6766120	Still Player 2 controller connected.
6766120	6770600	Look around at all my obvious things, my VR controllers are shut off, I do have the Xbox
6770600	6773240	wireless adapter plugged in, might have to remove that.
6773240	6774360	Oh, wait a second.
6774360	6778680	My Xbox One controller didn't land on the dock correctly, so it was still on.
6778680	6782800	Okay, shut that off, restart the game just because of habits, and now the Stadia controller
6782800	6784600	connects for Player 1.
6784600	6785600	Hooray!
6785600	6792080	This was an immediate realization that the Stadia controller is seemingly not necessary.
6792080	6799200	The upfront $129 cost for Stadia now feels excessive, but more on that in a little bit.
6799200	6800460	Samurai Showdown played well.
6800460	6802960	There were no glaring visual imperfections to speak of.
6803080	6807840	I could tell a minor fuzzing and shine that I know has to do with re-encoding into lossy
6807840	6810480	codex, but only because I'm looking for it.
6810480	6814880	Only because I'm really staring at the sharp edge of static lines and text.
6814880	6819560	If you want an example of what this is and why it is, I recommend Tom Scott's video
6819560	6824040	Why Snow and Confetti Ruin YouTube Video Quality.
6824040	6826600	The weirdest thing about this is load times in the game.
6826600	6830080	Between battles, there's still a 3-5 second load time.
6830200	6834840	Whenever I think of a server-backed system, I immediately expect the server to be powerful.
6834840	6839860	More powerful than my PC, more powerful than whatever system I'm using to access it.
6839860	6845120	The load time is likely no worse than it would be if locally on my PC, and giving every player
6845120	6849880	a super-powered PC doesn't really scale to the number of players I assume Google hopes
6849880	6853040	to achieve with this.
6853040	6857040	The controls for Samurai Showdown felt a little rigid, but I think that's intentional Samurai
6857080	6861320	Showdown historically has always been a bit more strict, more so than Street Fighter,
6861320	6863240	way less floaty than Super Smash Bros.
6863240	6865360	But granted, this is also an assumption.
6865360	6870120	I haven't played Samurai Showdown since the original Neo Geo version, and I was never
6870120	6871480	any good at it.
6871480	6875040	This isn't something that I can compare a feel against, because that varies from game
6875040	6879880	to game, and again, I don't have enough experience at Samurai Showdown.
6879880	6882680	This is something that's going to be best determined by something that I'm adequately
6882680	6886560	experienced with, and as of this writing, the only games that I've played outside of
6886560	6892880	Stadia in its library are Thumper and Trials Rising, and I'm not really interested in re-buying
6892880	6894480	games.
6894480	6896320	And that's a pretty big sticking point for me.
6896320	6899940	I consider the library to be one of Stadia's two elephants in the room.
6899940	6902320	I don't like the purchasing model.
6902320	6906280	Google Play should sell these games directly.
6906280	6910800	This was my biggest complaint about OnLive, because if they fold and I lose my library,
6910800	6911800	that hurts.
6912000	6914760	And as far as I'm aware, that's exactly what happened.
6914760	6919000	I didn't lose anything at the time, because they were waiving subscription charges, and
6919000	6922720	I just used the 30 minute free trials of all of the games that they offered.
6922720	6925480	I never bought anything directly through OnLive.
6925480	6929080	But all of this comes through as being a digital purchaser.
6929080	6931480	I've used Steam since its release in 2004.
6931480	6934660	I can't tell you the last time I bought a boxed PC game.
6934660	6939720	Since about 2-3 years into the 3DS's life, and this entire generation of gaming consoles,
6939720	6942000	I have a strictly digital library.
6942000	6943280	No Xbox discs.
6943280	6944520	No PS4 discs.
6944520	6945520	No Switch cartridges.
6945520	6947040	Okay, that's a lie.
6947040	6951280	I have a disc of Titanfall for the Xbox One, but that's because I wanted the limited edition
6951280	6954440	box and the game came with, but it's still shrink-wrapped.
6954440	6956960	And I already own the game digitally.
6956960	6960440	I have a high degree of confidence in Microsoft and Sony staying power.
6960440	6964520	I had little confidence in OnLive staying power, and I'm on the fence about Google's
6964520	6968480	continued support of Stadia, so I'm kinda torn.
6968480	6970880	And this doesn't apply to Game Pass nor PS Now.
6970880	6973520	Those are both in addition to something you already have.
6973520	6976440	For Game Pass, you already have a PC or an Xbox One.
6976440	6980720	For PS Now, you already have a PlayStation, or a Vita, or a PlayStation TV.
6980720	6982880	Do those still work if you already own them?
6982880	6984620	I don't actually know.
6984620	6989600	But on that fact, the PlayStation TV, a product, died before PS Now.
6989600	6991020	The service did.
6991020	6994480	Game Pass and PlayStation Now can persist as long as those two companies are still in
6994480	6995740	the gaming business.
6995740	6998700	And even if those services go away, there's a fallback.
6998700	7003580	They still offer their digital library for use on hardware directly.
7003580	7005540	So then what is Stadia's fallback?
7005540	7007260	I don't know of one that already exists.
7007260	7009540	I don't know if they've said there will be one.
7009540	7011700	I do hope one comes.
7011700	7017020	So going back to the $129 upfront cost, when you sit back and add it up, it's not unreasonable.
7017020	7023740	For $129, you get a controller, $40, a Chromecast Ultra, $70, Stadia Pro for three months, which
7023820	7026540	is a $30 value so far as they've announced so far.
7026540	7029900	I'm not paying for Stadia Pro until February 2020.
7029900	7032860	It does seem like Google is taking a bit of a loss here.
7032860	7036740	I do think that allowing people that already have a game controller and a PC, which is
7036740	7041580	many people, to pay $10 and just start playing games would have been a great decision on
7041580	7042780	their part.
7042780	7046580	After all, the point here is to not need powerful hardware.
7046580	7049000	Okay, okay, enough about all this.
7049000	7050300	Let's play some games.
7050300	7052300	Yeah, Samurai Shodown played well.
7052300	7054740	I made it through a handful of rounds against CPU opponents.
7054740	7059140	I dare not play human opponents because I'm not good at fighting games, and I didn't want
7059140	7061060	to focus my attention on battles.
7061060	7066380	I wanted to focus my attention on everything else that Stadia is offering about this experience.
7066380	7070500	My first round of playing was on a Windows PC, ethernet wired directly into my router
7070500	7074500	using the Stadia controller via Google Chrome, and it held up really well.
7074500	7079800	As I said, I also played with my Xbox controller, which also worked, albeit without the convenience
7079800	7084480	features the Stadia controller has for simple game exiting, nor the ability to take quick
7084480	7087360	screenshots and game clips, and so on and so forth.
7087360	7089240	I don't know what more I can say here.
7089240	7090520	Stadia held up on my network.
7090520	7091520	I used Comcast.
7091520	7096840	It's rated at 85 megabits per second as an average download speed, sub 20 millisecond
7096840	7102240	latency, all of this to some speed test server that my router uses, and this is also on Amplify
7102240	7103740	router equipment.
7103740	7109240	I played a game, and it felt good, which for being on some server somewhere reasonably
7109240	7112920	geographically close to me, I assume, is a good sign.
7112920	7114560	My second round, I played Destiny.
7114560	7116680	I have played through the story of Destiny 1.
7116680	7121460	I enjoy and play a lot of first person shooters, and this is probably more representative.
7121460	7127200	Not only this, but this was also done on Stadia via the Chromecast, and I did not plug in
7127200	7128600	an ethernet cable.
7128600	7133040	I had slightly lower hopes for this because I know wireless latency, but I was still really
7133040	7134400	pleased with the result.
7134400	7135480	I set up my character.
7135480	7139960	I did the opening Guardian revival wake up and the initial quest to make it to the city,
7139960	7144400	and there were one or two points in which the quality stuttered a tiny little bit in
7144400	7148360	random moments, not like too much going on on the screen, anything like that.
7148360	7152080	I didn't notice if this actually impacted my inputs.
7152080	7157400	It was only notable for output video frame stutter, frame drops actually, and there were
7157400	7161120	at least two to three occasions where the output video quality dropped.
7161120	7165920	It was either a bitrate drop or a 4K downgrade to 1080p, maybe both.
7165920	7170560	I also was not playing this on a 4K TV, so I'm not sure.
7170560	7174320	Again, there's no technical indicators on the game screen to tell you anything like
7174320	7176720	this, at least as far as I've encountered.
7176720	7181400	There might be some indicator if the output channel fails outright for some reason, but
7181400	7185600	that hasn't happened in my admittedly only few hours of playing so far.
7185600	7189920	The cute part of Stadia, socially speaking, was that the group of Guardians that I crossed
7189920	7193840	paths with in the opening sequence showed up in my Recent Players section of the iOS
7193840	7194840	app.
7194840	7195840	Cute.
7195840	7200080	That said, I have not yet played Stadia via my phone nor a tablet.
7200080	7203200	So Stadia isn't bad, network conditions permitting.
7203200	7208160	If you have quality internet and network equipment, but lack any other high-powered devices, be
7208160	7213160	those being a console or a sufficiently powered PC, this could be a huge boon for you.
7213160	7217160	I don't expect it to be an overwhelming success, because the players that would choose to use
7217160	7221520	it are a subset of players that will put money into this hobby and don't already have
7221520	7227120	a console, don't have an up-to-date PC for these modern games, etc.
7227120	7229520	But those players definitely exist.
7229520	7232560	For me, I need to go make some progress in Death Stranding.
7232560	7235440	So back to you, Studio N7.
7235440	7239540	All right.
7239540	7241680	Thank you so much to Jason for that.
7241680	7249040	It was neat to hear the thoughts on Google Stadia, especially not just all the bad stuff
7249040	7252960	or the hang-ups or even just all the good stuff, but I liked that Jason took a deeper
7252960	7256200	dive there and was talking a little bit about some of the things under the hood and was
7256200	7257800	actually showing the app.
7257800	7262440	I had no idea that that was a thing, the app would show you who you were actually playing
7262440	7263440	with and things like that.
7263440	7264440	So that part was kind of neat.
7264440	7265560	So thank you.
7265560	7267320	And folks in chat, give me some kudos as well.
7267320	7274720	We have some folks also in chat are noticing that we have a plus one now in Studio.
7274720	7278120	So Alan has taken a seat and joined us here in Studio.
7278120	7279120	Hi, Alan.
7279120	7280120	How are you?
7280120	7281120	Nice to have you back on the show.
7281120	7282120	Hello.
7282120	7283120	Hi.
7283120	7284120	I'm here against my will.
7284120	7285120	Now, come on.
7285120	7286280	Come on.
7286280	7288000	You make people think I'm so mean.
7288000	7293000	But no, I had to have you because I think you know about a certain news item that came
7293000	7294000	out this week.
7294000	7295000	Yes.
7295000	7296000	And you know, I don't play Half-Life.
7296000	7297000	He doesn't play Half-Life.
7297680	7301720	So when it comes to the resident Half-Life stand in the house, that would be you.
7301720	7303480	So you love Half-Life, right?
7303480	7304480	I do.
7304480	7308920	And what is it about the Half-Life games that just you love?
7308920	7317720	It really was the first FPS to incorporate narrative storytelling into the gameplay without
7317720	7319440	use of cutscenes.
7319440	7323360	Because well, cutscenes back then in the late 90s weren't really a thing to begin with.
7323360	7328320	I mean, outside of RPGs rather.
7328320	7339120	So just, it's like, it's really like deep sci-fi without being too convoluted.
7339120	7344000	It's yeah, I just think gameplay is great.
7344000	7345000	Okay.
7345000	7348480	So obviously, I think you heard the big news this week about Half-Life.
7348480	7351760	They didn't announce Half-Life 3, but they announced a new Half-Life game of some sort,
7351760	7352760	right?
7353160	7355640	So I'm sure you have seen all the news on Half-Life, Alex.
7355640	7356640	Yes.
7356640	7357640	So what are your thoughts?
7357640	7361640	Are we going to have to buy a VR setup?
7361640	7367660	There's a scene in the show Mad Men where Don Draper is in like an elevator with this
7367660	7369720	junior associate.
7369720	7377640	And the junior associates talking to Mr. Draper and he says, you know, buddy, I'm really worried
7377640	7378640	about you.
7378640	7379640	I worry about you.
7379640	7383320	And he says, I don't think about you at all.
7383320	7384320	That's sort of his retort.
7384320	7388800	I don't, I feel nothing about this announcement.
7388800	7390920	I don't mean that pejoratively.
7390920	7399080	I've been, I've so absolutely made peace with the fact that I'm not going to get Half-Life
7399080	7403740	3, that I don't feel, there's like, there's like a hole.
7403740	7406000	There's a vacuum where my heart should be.
7406000	7409120	And I'm like, oh, anyway.
7409120	7410120	So I'm hungry.
7410120	7412600	Do you want to go to Chipotle?
7412600	7420160	It's really, it's sort of like, it's like the dad that leaves when you're three and
7420160	7423120	you and your mom grew up to be fine.
7423120	7425240	And then you find out like, oh yeah, he's alive.
7425240	7426240	He's living in Texas.
7426240	7427280	Do you want to go meet him?
7427280	7432760	And it's like, I don't bear any ill will towards this person, but like, I don't know him.
7432760	7438760	He's a stranger, you know, like, it's so.
7438800	7443800	That's really what I'm getting at.
7443800	7445800	It looks, it looks well-made.
7445800	7451640	The biggest thing, it's a relief that knowing that Valve has like an A programming team
7451640	7454160	that still makes games, that was the revelation.
7454160	7457820	I was like, it wasn't so much, oh fuck, it's like new Half-Life.
7457820	7463560	It was more, Valve has a video game that isn't just the maintenance team for Dota and Team
7463560	7464560	Fortress 2.
7464560	7466000	This is incredible.
7466000	7469600	They make blue chip products still.
7469600	7477460	That's really what I, that was the stunner for me, but I don't care for the fact that
7477460	7488480	it takes place between Half-Life 1 and 2 or particularly before Half-Life 2.
7488480	7493080	There was a rumor that at the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 3, Gordon was going to die and then
7493080	7496960	it's sort of revealed, like the G-Man comes out and reveals that Alex was always like
7496960	7501200	the chosen one and Gordon was sort of like a means to an end to get her to a certain
7501200	7502200	point.
7502200	7509520	So, I love Alex as one of the best sort of like side NPC characters like ever made.
7509520	7514880	So Alex is incredible, but yeah, the fact that it's sort of like a weird timeline thing
7514880	7517320	that they wedged in, I don't care about VR.
7517320	7521940	I think that this is going to be the killer app that VR needs for people to pay attention
7521940	7527320	to it because Beat Saber was, I think, the killer app for a lot of people.
7527320	7529240	But even then, it's kind of a music game.
7529240	7530240	There's a novelty to it.
7530240	7531620	I think Beat Saber is incredible.
7531620	7535420	It's a killer app, but it's one killer app.
7535420	7536420	Yes.
7536420	7544340	There's still a point of entry with, because like there's the PlayStation VR.
7544340	7550800	To use like a Vive or the Oculus, you need a computer to go with it that's still pretty
7550800	7551800	powerful.
7552160	7554980	People were saying five years ago that PC gaming was going to be dead.
7554980	7557480	That turned out to be a complete and utter lie.
7557480	7562760	PC gaming is a strong, they're porting stuff to PC that's like years and years old just
7562760	7564340	because they can.
7564340	7572080	Like you've got Square releasing Saga Frontier 3 or Saga 3 on Switch, but also PC because
7572080	7573080	why not?
7573080	7574080	Well, we did it for Android.
7574080	7575080	Might as well.
7575080	7576080	Yeah.
7576080	7580240	So PC gaming is as relevant as it's ever been.
7580360	7586040	The fact that the point of entry with, and also, so like I don't, I'm sure it'll get
7586040	7590880	cracked so that you don't need a VR device to play it because it's going to run off PC
7590880	7598040	that then runs through your Oculus or to your Vive, whatever is a Valve compatible VR device.
7598040	7602240	But like, I don't care about that.
7602240	7609080	And this also does sort of give credence to the rumor that the reason why Gabe, I'm going
7609080	7615840	off, like I'll talk like this for the next three hours if you want, is chat enjoying
7615840	7616840	this?
7616840	7618920	Well, I was going to ask you about this because you call it Vive.
7618920	7619920	I thought it was Vive.
7619920	7620920	Vive, whatever.
7620920	7625020	No, they like your analogy.
7625020	7626200	So please keep going.
7626200	7632920	So I lost, I lost my train of thought.
7632920	7636140	You're talking about hacker because we got into this earlier in the show is that hackers
7636140	7642020	are inevitably going to make you able to play this VR game on your keyboard and mouse.
7642020	7643020	Possibly.
7643020	7644280	Is that really going to work?
7644280	7647880	Because certainly the reason why this is in VR is that there's going to be certain things
7647880	7652300	like you have to do this with your hands or you have to do this certain motion that might
7652300	7654700	not translate very well into keyboard and mouse.
7654700	7660580	So not only is somebody going to have to hack it to play on the monitor and keyboard, mouse,
7660580	7664340	but somebody is going to have to hack the control scheme to get around things that are
7664340	7667900	going to be very VR specific.
7667900	7675620	So I'm not really interested in upgrading my PC to support whatever device it is.
7675620	7677700	I have other things to spend money on.
7677700	7684700	I'm glad that Half-Life fans, I think we're all like, I mean, oh, I remember what I was
7684700	7687060	going to say.
7687060	7693940	There was a rumor that the reason why Gabe didn't want to do Half-Life 3 is because he
7693940	7699740	considers Half-Life to be this thing that has to show off the next evolution of gaming
7699740	7703380	or whatever weird BS like had lost up his ass that he is.
7703380	7707620	Because with Half-Life 2, it was twofold.
7707620	7711980	It was the physics engine that was Source 2, which at the time was revolutionary, and
7711980	7717020	the physics and weight puzzles that were in Half-Life 2, and then also Half-Life 2 was
7717020	7722020	their modality of launching Steam.
7722020	7728900	And Marc Laidlaw basically released the script for Episode 3 because it had been so goddamn
7728900	7742380	long that the NDA had run out, so he's like, here's what the script of Episode 3 was.
7742380	7748060	And I guess Gabe was like, no, I'm not going to make Half-Life 3 unless we have something
7748060	7751740	worthy of it technology-wise to show off.
7751740	7753900	That was always a weird rumor.
7753900	7759420	And the fact that Gabe dined from his ivory tower, yes, here's a little crumb, a little
7759420	7760900	morsel of Half-Life content.
7760900	7766660	The fact that it's attached to what is probably the best big-budget VR title that we're going
7766660	7771980	to see for a very long time, that sort of gives credence to that theory that Gabe doesn't
7771980	7777260	want to put Half-Life on things that aren't revolutionary, whatever buzzwordy definition
7777260	7778260	of that.
7779260	7786940	My point is that I'm not surprised that we are finally seeing Half-Life content attached
7786940	7791140	to VR because VR is sort of the thing where the technology's there, it looks great, it
7791140	7792860	plays great.
7792860	7794060	People don't care yet.
7794060	7797900	And is Half-Life Alyx going to make them care?
7797900	7803620	It's going to be closer than they ever have been in the past.
7803620	7806780	I will say the takeaway that I took from the trailer, and not to repeat myself too much
7806820	7810220	because we already got into this earlier in the show, but for your benefit, I'm not the
7810220	7816700	big Half-Life fan, you are, I appreciate it, I understand why it's popular and all that.
7816700	7821420	But I was more taken back like, ooh, this is pretty, are they going to use this engine
7821420	7822420	to make more games?
7822420	7823420	Is this the new source?
7823420	7826660	Is this what my Portal 3 is going to look like?
7826660	7830420	Is this what my future Valve games are going to look like?
7830420	7834420	But Half-Life VR, meh, not my thing.
7834420	7839100	So the fact that it's wedged into the current timeline, it's not a sequel to either Episode
7839100	7847980	2 or whatever, the fact that it's VR, I'm so pleased to see that the programmers, the
7847980	7853180	software developers who work at Valve haven't just been getting a paycheck with no product
7853180	7858100	for the last, I don't know, what is the last real big blue chip Valve game that they, what
7858100	7859100	is Dota, right?
7859100	7860100	Dota's the last big thing they put out?
7860100	7866260	Probably Dota 2, unless you were to count the pack-in stuff, the stuff that shows off
7866260	7867260	the Vive.
7867260	7868260	Yeah.
7868260	7869260	Vive, whatever.
7869260	7875220	The cute little portal, there's a launching game in a warehouse, so there's a little mini
7875220	7876420	game collection, Wii games.
7876420	7881900	The fact that the developers at Valve were given an opportunity to program something
7881900	7886060	big budget and A-list, for me, is an epiphany.
7886060	7893040	I thought that they gave up eight, nine years ago and they were just letting Steam break
7893040	7894120	in billions for them.
7894120	7900980	So the fact that they just even made a game is great, but I'm not, I don't, again, it's
7900980	7906900	like there's a vacuum where my heart should be, it's not pejorative, I just, I want, it's
7906900	7908900	been so long that I want more.
7908900	7910460	I don't care about this.
7910460	7912220	All right.
7912220	7914980	So there you go, folks.
7914980	7918340	Are you going to go and revisit the old Half-Life games as you do?
7918340	7921460	Like once a year, I see you firing up Black Mesa.
7921460	7922460	Yeah.
7922460	7927060	They nerve, well, they, they, I played the Zen update for Black Mesa, which came out,
7927060	7928300	I think, four or five months ago.
7928300	7930380	If you haven't played it, it's incredible.
7930380	7936900	I think they've released the chapter after the big head, the, whatever the big headcrab
7936900	7939140	boss behemoth is.
7939140	7944260	So I haven't played that, so there's still Black Mesa content I need to follow up on,
7944260	7950020	or I may just wait for them to actually put out the whole rest of Zen because there's
7950020	7952700	only like one or two chapters left and then the game's done.
7952700	7960540	Um, so yeah, I will revisit Half-Life one and two and Black Mesa at some point, but
7960540	7965380	Half-Life Alex, I'm sure I'm, of course I'm going to play it at some point, but like 10
7965380	7969500	years from now, five years from now, borrow his VR, whatever.
7969500	7970500	It's cool.
7970500	7972940	I like Alex fine.
7972940	7974780	It's just, I've, I've moved on.
7974780	7976420	I've grown as a person.
7976420	7977860	You waited too long, Gabe.
7977860	7978860	I don't care.
7978860	7979860	Um, yeah.
7979860	7980860	All right.
7980860	7988260	Um, do you have any thoughts, Matt, cause I see you kind of eye in the mic.
7988260	7989260	No I don't.
7989260	7990820	I mean, I'll, I'll check it out when it comes out.
7990820	7993820	I mean, I'm sure it won't be that expensive of a game, so.
7993820	7999020	So we've derailed a bit from, uh, the, the show role as, as listed on the television
7999020	8000020	screen.
8000500	8003500	But I do want to, since we do have Alan here, I want to ask you about one other thing.
8003500	8007940	So, um, you're not really playing Half-Life at the moment and it doesn't sound like you're
8007940	8012280	going to be playing Half-Life Alex anytime in the future, but I noticed you have been
8012280	8013280	playing.
8013280	8014280	What have you been playing?
8014280	8015980	I, you know, I got to ask you about this one.
8015980	8017340	So what have you been playing?
8017340	8019940	I, we talked about this the last time you had me on the show.
8019940	8020940	Did we?
8020940	8021940	Yeah.
8021940	8026500	Cause I, I told, I said, everyone Google project brutality three and I saw Matt Google it right
8026500	8027500	here.
8027500	8028500	Um, it's doom.
8028500	8029500	Doom mods.
8029980	8032620	So it's the same thing you talked about weeks ago on the show, I thought you were doing
8032620	8033620	something new with it.
8033620	8034620	You haven't beat it yet?
8034620	8035620	Well, no.
8035620	8043540	Um, I've been, I, I've, you, it has all of these new enemies and you sort of can control
8043540	8046980	like what randomization it has for the enemies and weapons.
8046980	8049940	So I play it and then I bump it up a notch.
8049940	8054820	Like I want, I want these really impossible monsters to spawn on level three instead of
8054820	8059100	level eight and then level eight is going to have like even more terrifying stuff.
8059100	8062780	So I've just been playing around with the config, the, the, it's, it's an incredible
8062780	8063780	mod.
8063780	8064780	There's like dozens of options.
8064780	8066220	So that's still got my attention.
8066220	8069260	It's just funny when I kind of peeked my head on it cause we still have that giant green
8069260	8071260	screen that separates the two sides of the office.
8071260	8073860	So I peeked my head over on your side of the office, I'm like, you're still playing doom.
8073860	8075580	Do you know how old that game is?
8075580	8076580	Yeah.
8076580	8080100	And then, so you, you, you said, and this is funny, I hope that chat, you enjoy this,
8080100	8082140	the viewers at home.
8082140	8086800	You said, so you're still playing doom, but you've modded it to death, right?
8086800	8088140	And I said yes.
8088180	8094420	And then I press the G key and I throw a grenade and he's like, why did you throw a grenade?
8094420	8095860	You can't throw grenades in doom.
8095860	8100220	And I looked at Rob and I said, the words that just came out of your mouth were modded
8100220	8102460	it to death.
8102460	8103860	What does that mean?
8103860	8105220	You can leave my program.
8105220	8106220	Yes.
8106220	8109140	Give the mic to Loki and remove yourself from the stage.
8109140	8110140	Thank you.
8110140	8111140	All right.
8111140	8112140	Thanks for your thoughts.
8112140	8115260	They have mods available where you can fuck the enemies in the game because they turn
8115260	8121980	into hentai women or hentai, there's anything you could possibly do in doom you can do.
8121980	8124300	So throwing grenades is the least difficult.
8124300	8127940	In all seriousness, thanks to Alan for letting me put him on the spot with his half-life
8127940	8128940	impressions.
8128940	8129940	He did a very good job with that.
8129940	8131580	So I appreciate it as always.
8131580	8135780	For now though, let's get back into what we have coming up with our rapid fire news.
8135780	8136780	Loki.
8136780	8140460	I didn't even realize this is how often I play racing games nowadays, but I didn't even
8140460	8146940	realize that Toyota has been holding out from putting their cars in games.
8146940	8147940	So that's the thing.
8147940	8153200	Apparently since 2017, they have not been including their games in racing games.
8153200	8154420	But now that's going to change.
8154420	8160420	Apparently they're going to start putting them back into games starting with Forza.
8160420	8167660	So there on December 12th, Forza 4 is going to get the 1998 Toyota Supra RZ as part of
8167660	8170500	the series 17 update.
8170500	8173260	Interesting indeed.
8173260	8176540	Someone was asking them about Need for Speed and apparently they said they didn't want
8176540	8178380	to promote illegal street racing.
8178380	8179380	Oh wow.
8179380	8180380	Dude, come on.
8180380	8181380	Oh wow.
8181380	8182620	Like, dude, seriously, really?
8182620	8183620	It's a video game.
8183620	8184620	Give me a play.
8184620	8186860	Like all the other companies are doing it.
8186860	8187860	Seriously.
8187860	8188860	Stupid.
8188860	8189860	But, yeah.
8189860	8195840	Funny enough, since we were just talking about Doom, if you're interested in 90s shooters
8195840	8200360	like the such, you might want to check out Hellbound, which apparently is going to be
8200360	8201560	coming out pretty soon.
8201560	8209200	They have a demo that is available that you can check out and it looks pretty awesome.
8209200	8213320	Very much a Doomquake vibe going on there.
8213320	8214920	And that's available on Steam.
8214920	8215920	Alright.
8215920	8218680	Yay demos.
8218680	8222800	For those of you that are into Pokemon Go, the details have been announced for Community
8222800	8224280	Day for December.
8224280	8228520	So like last year, it's going to be an encore weekend, so you can catch all of the Community
8228520	8232400	Day Pokemon from prior Community Days in 2019.
8232400	8235840	So it will be boosted all weekend and then I think there's special events that happen
8235840	8241800	from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. where you get the catch Stardust, the catch XP and half egg distance.
8241800	8246600	And if I remember right, that's the time when the shinies really show up too, is that same
8246600	8247760	like three hour period.
8247760	8251360	So if you really want shinies, that's the time to play the game.
8251360	8255660	So Community Day weekend, but from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. everything will be boosted.
8255660	8260760	So you can check that all out on Saturday, December 14th, as well as Sunday, December
8260760	8261760	15th.
8261760	8262760	That's pretty cool.
8262760	8267160	I wish they did stuff like around holidays, like Thanksgiving.
8267160	8269920	I think they have something for the day.
8269920	8272880	There's a Team Rocket event going on right now and I thought there was something about
8272880	8277800	you can trade like half Stardust trading and I think you can do two special trades a day
8277800	8280240	and that's going to start like the Thanksgiving weekend.
8280240	8284000	And I thought it was really well timed because you're going to have people that are visiting
8284000	8286200	from far away, visiting family.
8286200	8290320	So it's the time where people are going to be like, oh, here's my regional, you know,
8290320	8291320	you can pick this up.
8291320	8292620	That's going to be pretty cool.
8292620	8295120	So that is coming to the game also.
8295120	8298160	And I should mention this because a lot of people are excited about this.
8298160	8303440	Any Pokemon you evolve during that time frame will get the community move from the Community
8303440	8304440	Day.
8304440	8306480	So you have a second chance to get the special move.
8306480	8311960	What's important about this is that that part of it is not just 2019, it's 2018 as well.
8311960	8315920	So some people have been sitting on a hundred percent Larvatars for a long time waiting
8315920	8319240	to get a Tyranitar with the special move that's only from Community Day.
8319240	8322200	So you will have that chance during December Community Day.
8322200	8324200	So people are very hyped about that.
8324200	8326320	So all right.
8326320	8331040	Also we should talk a little bit about Steam Remote Play together because that is now out
8331040	8332040	of beta.
8332040	8333040	That is awesome.
8333040	8334480	And they have a sale going on to promote it.
8334480	8335480	They do.
8335480	8338960	If you are not familiar with Steam Remote Play together, it's pretty much PlayStation
8338960	8341240	4 SharePlay, but it's on Steam.
8341240	8342700	You can play local multiplayer.
8342700	8347240	So even if your game doesn't support online, you can do local multiplayer.
8347240	8351260	And then this also will work with cross platform play.
8351260	8356480	So I could be on Windows and Dark Soccer could be on Mac and Loki could be on Linux and we
8356480	8357480	could still all play together.
8357480	8358480	So that's pretty cool.
8358480	8360960	It's still all through like Steam.
8360960	8366820	Are you saying that super multitasking versus I'm going to actually build a plague?
8366820	8370080	You may remember we asked Darren about that when he was here announcing it.
8370080	8372300	And he's not building it with that in mind.
8372300	8376080	He's building it for, you know, the expos and same room and all that.
8376080	8377080	And I think.
8377080	8378080	But no, no, no.
8378080	8379080	But this could be.
8379080	8380080	No, this works with all.
8380080	8381080	I know.
8381080	8382080	I know.
8382080	8386040	But you if there's any lag, you know how that game can be very unforgiving.
8386040	8389520	So if any lag comes into it or what have you, you know, like, would you play a music game
8389520	8390880	over share play?
8390880	8396680	Well, yeah, so maybe the lag, you know, will it work?
8396680	8397680	Yes.
8397680	8398680	Will it work?
8398680	8401480	Well, to be determined, but will it blend?
8401480	8402480	Yes.
8402480	8404400	And unofficially or it's unofficial.
8404400	8407120	It's not supported by the death, I guess would be a way to say that.
8407120	8408120	All right.
8408120	8409720	Anyway, Dark Soccer, you have a few things for us.
8409720	8415080	Soul Calibur six season two will actually be starting tomorrow, November 25th for us
8415080	8416080	here on Sunday.
8416080	8423480	And it has a downloadable character Hilda will be on November 26th, along with the creation
8423480	8428760	parts set C as stated by Bandai Namco.
8428760	8435680	It will she's got there actually will be a soul attack and resist impact battle systems.
8435680	8440840	New stage called Silver Wolves Haven and a training exclusive stage called Grand Labyrinth
8440840	8442480	Sealed Corridor.
8442480	8444760	Different UI stuff, too.
8444760	8452800	And season two will also introduce three other characters, including Haomaru from Samurai
8452800	8454800	Showdown.
8454800	8458840	And let me see if we can get the other two while I'm here.
8458840	8465560	Cassandra and I don't see who else Cassandra, Haomaru, Hilda.
8465560	8466560	So, yeah.
8467280	8472040	And then also in other news, which I'm sure a lot of people were aware of, is that Arc
8472040	8477120	System Works has a trailer for new Guilty Gear coming out and it's going to be called
8477120	8480520	Guilty Gear Strive.
8480520	8483320	I had actually already been looking at that because I was kind of thinking of cosplaying
8483320	8484320	Mei.
8484320	8485320	So.
8485320	8492800	But the trailer came out and it's rebranded a few things around there, brought in some
8492800	8497920	old school characters like Chip and Mei and Potemkin and Soul Bad Guy, who just has the
8497920	8499400	best name.
8499400	8509800	So I'm actually bringing out bringing back from the first Guilty Gear Dr. Baldhead, who
8509800	8511280	became Faust.
8511280	8514280	So but I think they're bringing him back as that role.
8514280	8515280	So that'd be cool.
8515280	8516280	That's it.
8516280	8517280	All right.
8517280	8518280	Cool.
8518280	8521880	We're going to now travel around the world and check out release dates.
8521880	8524920	I have a feeling this is going to be a quick segment, at least certainly the U.S. part
8524920	8525920	of it.
8525920	8526920	I can't imagine it's going to be hopping.
8526920	8530720	It is a very Japanese week, ironically.
8530720	8536760	So the two games we have coming out this week, Cyber Troopers Virtual On Masterpiece 1995
8536760	8544280	to 2001 on PlayStation 4 and SD Gundam G Generation Cross Rays on PC.
8544280	8545280	That's it.
8545280	8546280	That's it.
8546280	8547800	Well, happy Thanksgiving from Japan.
8547800	8548800	To be expected.
8548800	8553440	Now, funny, going over to Japan, you still have some releases, because obviously Thanksgiving
8553440	8558080	is not a factor over there, but we do have some releases this week in Japan, including
8558080	8562280	on the PlayStation 4 this week, 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.
8562280	8566340	We also have that same SD Gundam Generation Cross Rays, which is also out in Japan, perhaps
8566340	8569720	why it's timed for the world at the same time.
8569720	8575880	And then we also have Aibea comes out in regular and premium editions this week, as well as
8575880	8578360	Amamain comes out this week.
8578360	8582520	And then we get A Plague Tale Innocence and a price reduction just in time for the next
8582520	8584680	season, Soul Calibur 6.
8584680	8586720	Price reduction also coming in for Days Gone.
8586720	8590000	But here's the title of the week.
8590000	8591640	Here's the name that got me.
8591640	8598520	So coming to the PlayStation 4 this week from Maker's 5 or Publishers 5 PB is the game.
8598520	8601320	Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?
8601320	8604840	Infinite combat.
8604840	8609520	And so, of course, I had to look like I was like, what the fuck and get this on the battlefield.
8609520	8614840	Well, I should have known that's an anime based on the popular anime.
8614840	8617320	Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?
8617320	8621880	Infinite combat will let you play from the perspective of the protagonists and they will
8621880	8624880	head into dungeons and interact with characters in the dungeons.
8624880	8627760	So is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?
8627760	8632480	I guess find out when that title releases this week on PlayStation 4 in Japan.
8632480	8637320	Looking quickly at the Nintendo Switch to see if there's anything I should note here
8637320	8641760	because if I clicked the wrong thing and accidentally brought up Nintendo 3DS, which is not looking
8641760	8642760	great.
8642760	8649000	But on the Switch, yes, we have that same SD Gundam game is out there too.
8649000	8651600	Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?
8651600	8656680	The only, oh, we have two new ones that aren't on PlayStation, Flowers, which is not to be
8656680	8659140	confused with the Journey Flower game.
8659140	8663720	This is another one that looks like it's based off an anime or manga.
8663720	8669860	And then Japanese Rail Sim 3D Journey to Kyoto comes out this week.
8669860	8671040	And that looks really pretty.
8671040	8675020	It's just like the train on the front cover is going through this very like flowery type
8675020	8676920	of village and it's a pink train.
8676920	8677920	So fun.
8677920	8679220	There's a Hello Kitty train.
8679220	8680220	Yeah.
8680220	8683260	So if you want to travel on a train from your Nintendo Switch, you can import that lovely
8683260	8685140	title from Japan.
8685140	8686700	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
8686700	8687700	Three games.
8687700	8691140	I thought I had already mentioned, but apparently I guess they moved the date or something.
8691140	8697380	The Asterix Novelics game is coming out on November 27th for the big three.
8697380	8700820	And then for Switch, we have Black Sad Under the Skin.
8700820	8704740	This kind of almost like a modern noir from the picture.
8704740	8710820	And then on the 28th, also Honor and Duty D-Day All Out War Edition.
8710820	8711820	That's it.
8711820	8712820	All right.
8712820	8715220	SSJ100Matt in chat says, this is cracking me up.
8715220	8716420	I don't know why.
8716900	8721660	It's a comment about the train sim game that I said, as 200 Matt says, there better be
8721660	8724340	some train drifting action.
8724340	8727780	And that makes me laugh because I'm like, that would be actually really funny.
8727780	8730940	Can you imagine like a high speed train racing game?
8730940	8732180	Have you not seen YouTube?
8732180	8733700	Oh, is that a thing?
8733700	8734700	It is a thing.
8734700	8736940	They have a game that is train drifting.
8736940	8737940	Really?
8737940	8738940	They do.
8738940	8739940	It is a real thing.
8739940	8740940	Okay.
8740940	8741940	Is the train actually on rails or?
8741940	8742940	It is on rails.
8742940	8743940	Wow.
8743940	8745340	It's a ridiculous game.
8745340	8749740	They actually did it during one of the AGD queues.
8749740	8753300	I don't remember the name, but there is, it is a thing.
8753300	8754300	Okay.
8754300	8755300	And it is awesome.
8755300	8757500	I was just thinking how funny it would be if you had a game like Mario Kart, but you
8757500	8762580	were driving this car that was just like pulling 20 cars behind it.
8762580	8769020	And so it turns into like Mario Kart and Snake at the same time or Tron light bikes or something
8769020	8770020	like that.
8770020	8775300	It's called Densha de lightning stage.
8775300	8777700	It's in the Densha de Go! series.
8777700	8780820	And Orange Right just gets a gold star for naming it first in chat.
8780820	8781820	There you go.
8781820	8785460	They did it AGD queue 2018 and it was hilarious.
8785460	8786940	All right.
8786940	8787940	Let's move on to the mailbag.
8787940	8790340	I think we have at least one letter tonight.
8790340	8792860	Participate at orangelaungerator.com is the place to send emails.
8792860	8793860	Dark Sakura.
8793860	8795860	We have two actually.
8795860	8798460	One of them I can only read partially.
8798460	8802740	So one, um, uh, it's from Ferto Swagons.
8802740	8805540	I'm going to be nice.
8805540	8806540	Hey, OLR.
8806540	8809100	If you were forced to pick only one game to play for the rest of your life, what game
8809100	8810660	would you choose?
8810660	8814020	First of all, I wouldn't choose because I don't have to.
8814020	8815340	Question really makes no sense to me.
8815340	8816700	It's just a fun hypothetical.
8816700	8818940	These hypotheticals are illogical.
8818940	8820340	I don't know.
8820340	8821340	People want to know.
8821340	8822340	All right.
8822340	8825180	Look, I'll answer it because I'm going to be that bitch and be the genie or excuse me,
8825180	8827900	the one that wishes for more wishes when the genie comes out.
8827900	8831420	Because the game I would pick would be Little Big Planet.
8831420	8835740	I guess namely Little Big Planet 3 because I could get Little Big Planet 1 and 2 because
8835740	8838820	I could play other games that people have made.
8838820	8841620	Mario Maker would be a really good choice in that regard too.
8841620	8846300	Or I suppose Dreams might be the ultimate game to pick for that.
8846300	8849900	So that is my clever little tongue in cheek way around.
8849900	8855060	I would pick my 20, like 285 in one cartridge for Super Nintendo.
8855060	8856060	There you go.
8856060	8858180	See, it's not that hard a question to answer.
8858180	8864780	But in all seriousness, even though I kind of joke that that's a way to wish for more
8864780	8869500	wishes, at the same time, actually Little Big Planet was a really fucking solid platforming
8869500	8870740	game that was a lot of fun.
8870740	8875380	And like Mario Maker, I mean, Super Mario is one of the, it was my favorite game of
8875380	8876380	the year.
8876380	8881220	And honestly, even without the fact that I'm essentially getting more games in one with
8881220	8885080	those picks, they would be worthy selections.
8885080	8888220	I mean, I guess otherwise I'd say, what, Super Metroid, duh.
8888220	8891700	Loki, do you have a game, one game for the rest of your life?
8891700	8892700	One game?
8892700	8895420	If I'm going to pick a game for the rest of my life, it's going to be fucking laser
8895420	8896420	tag.
8896420	8897420	Oh, okay.
8897420	8899700	Except I would have to pick a specific laser tag.
8899700	8904420	So did you know your laser tag over here is a portal now?
8904420	8906380	The one that you, the new one that you...
8906380	8907780	The new laser tag is a portal?
8907780	8909100	It's a portal.
8909100	8914460	Why can that be a portal, but the one I suggested back in May is not a fucking anything yet
8914460	8917020	because it's sitting there in goddamn limbo.
8917020	8920380	But that place, it has nothing of fucking significance there.
8920380	8921380	I know why.
8921380	8922380	I know why.
8922380	8926220	Because the player that submitted it has an Onyx reviewing badge, so like all her stuff
8926220	8927220	gets upgraded.
8927220	8928220	God fucking damn it.
8928220	8929220	I swear to God.
8929220	8930220	All right.
8930220	8931220	Anyway, uh, next email.
8931220	8934220	Oh, is this the one I can't read?
8934220	8938740	Um, because it really, it's, well, okay, I'll go ahead and read it.
8938740	8939740	Okay.
8939740	8940740	This is from Robert.
8940740	8943300	I don't know why it was sent for this, but I'll go ahead and read it.
8943300	8946140	Um, updating, actually, I'm not going to read it because there's a lot of stuff in here
8946140	8947140	that's wrong.
8947140	8952780	Um, because first of all, Mac OS 8 came out about 25 years ago and he's talking about
8952780	8954340	current operating systems.
8954340	8957420	So Mac OS 8 doesn't work, doesn't function on anything modern.
8957420	8959900	So and iOS 10 is three years old.
8959900	8961420	We're on iOS 13 now.
8961420	8962420	Okay.
8962420	8963420	If we're not reading it, then don't read it.
8963620	8965620	Is there a part of it that we are going to read?
8965620	8966620	Um, no.
8966620	8969620	Um, I'm just going to basically say, I said, and I replied to him that I was going to acknowledge
8969620	8972020	that he sent me email and thank you for writing in.
8972020	8973540	We'll talk about this one privately.
8973540	8974540	Oh, okay.
8974540	8975540	Yeah.
8975540	8976540	That's all.
8976540	8977540	So that's it.
8977540	8978940	Well, it's not every day.
8978940	8980540	Someone gets a personal response from dark soccer.
8980540	8985100	He got two personal responses because he was sending me, uh, uh, uh, something that should
8985100	8988940	have gone to another podcast on our network.
8988940	8989940	Oh, okay.
8989940	8992220	But it's in a, but I'll just say this right now.
8992220	8997060	It's inappropriate to send it to our participate inbox instead of reaching out directly to
8997060	9000220	contact the proprietor of the podcast or was it negative?
9000220	9001220	No, it wasn't.
9001220	9002220	Oh, okay.
9002220	9004740	But it's still, we check this box like once a week.
9004740	9005740	Oh yeah.
9005740	9006740	Yeah.
9006740	9007740	No, it's just your message isn't going to get.
9007740	9008740	Yeah.
9008740	9009740	It's not going to get to them in a timely manner.
9009740	9012340	And on top of that, again, if it's an important enough message like that, you need to reach
9012340	9015740	out to the proprietor of that particular podcast.
9015740	9016740	I'm curious what it is.
9016740	9017740	I didn't see it.
9017740	9018740	So I'll tell you what it was later.
9018740	9019740	All right.
9019740	9020740	That's fine.
9020740	9021740	All right.
9022260	9024420	Oh, Bobby says he got it too.
9024420	9025420	That's so interesting.
9025420	9026420	All right.
9026420	9028580	Anyway, so again, and I, I just wasn't my message.
9028580	9029580	It's inappropriate.
9029580	9031140	Go ahead and contact them directly.
9031140	9032140	Okay.
9032140	9033140	All right.
9033140	9034140	Well, let's move on.
9034140	9037140	I think we have some more stories to get to, so we'll start with you.
9037140	9038140	Loki.
9038140	9039140	What do you have next?
9039140	9040140	So this is pretty cool.
9040140	9047340	Someone had taken it upon themselves to port over, um, super Mario land to the super Nintendo.
9047340	9050700	So they dubbed it new super Mario land.
9050700	9054340	It is basically recreating the whole game from scratch.
9054340	9055700	It is not a rom hack.
9055700	9057740	It is its own thing.
9057740	9062080	It actually has four player multiplayer in it as well, and apparently pushes the super
9062080	9066260	Nintendo to its limits as far as what it's able to do.
9066260	9071020	Um, what they've done with some of the animation is basically kind of have the crappiest like
9071020	9072500	20 second clip.
9072500	9074820	Oh, I had it on top of that.
9074820	9075820	They're not going to release it.
9075820	9079920	That's the annoying part because he did it as a Christmas present.
9079920	9082000	The thing is, okay.
9082000	9086200	The other clip that you're thinking of was like some dude's YouTube and I didn't want
9086200	9087200	to put the whole thing.
9087200	9088200	Yeah.
9088200	9090320	So that's the clip you get.
9090320	9098140	So the thing is that files have their way of making it out to the internet.
9098140	9102240	So whereas he said he wasn't going to release it on the internet.
9102240	9103240	It's on the internet.
9103240	9106240	He sent it to 30 people.
9106240	9107240	That's it.
9107240	9111040	And then one of those 30 put it back on the internet.
9111040	9116920	So you know, it may have been out there in a place where I found it.
9116920	9123440	And so I was able to get it and yeah, um, but yeah, it looked really cool.
9123440	9126600	And it's, I mean, it's just a complete remake of the whole game.
9126600	9131960	And the fact that he did this just with straight raw assembly and they even have like sound
9131960	9135480	samples that, you know, it's basically like Mario's voice from like some of the other
9135480	9138760	games, you know, just ridiculous.
9138760	9144740	And the art style is done very much like he did or like Donkey Kong Country where it's
9144740	9146520	actually he made the renders.
9146520	9152160	So like they had, they did an interview with him on Nintendo life talking about, um, how
9152160	9153160	he did.
9153160	9157560	And so he actually created the models in blender and then ended up, um, scanning them and putting
9157560	9162280	them into as sprites into the game.
9162280	9168120	And it's just, I mean, the amount of work that it would take to do that, it's just ridiculous,
9168120	9169760	but pretty cool.
9169760	9176160	All right, well, uh, moving on, we just have a few more stories for you guys and then we're
9176160	9177960	going to get to our discord.
9177960	9182280	So if you guys want to, uh, can participate with the show by calling in tonight, you sure
9182280	9188020	can by joining our discord, uh, you can join the green room, uh, and we will be, uh, taking
9188020	9189020	your calls live on air.
9189020	9192160	Of course, if you have questions in chat, you can get those out there too.
9192160	9196040	I will do my very best to, um, get any questions you guys have for us to discuss here at the
9196040	9199800	end of the show, but we have a few more stories before we get there, including this one on
9199800	9203400	Fortnite, uh, a new dungeon crawl mode in Fortnite.
9203400	9209420	Uh, so specifically Fortnite saved the world, which I was so irritated when I found out
9209420	9213280	and figured out, Oh, Fortnite saved the world is the one you have to pay for early access
9213280	9214280	for.
9214280	9218000	I went and I fucking installed Fortnite again on my computer, just so I could play this
9218000	9219000	only to find out.
9219000	9221640	You got to pay 40 bucks if you want to access this mode.
9221640	9222640	And I'm like, fuck that.
9222640	9225280	I'm not paying 40 bucks for a game I feel kind of on the fence about.
9225280	9228760	I don't really like, I want to know if the dungeon crawler is good though.
9228760	9229760	That's the problem.
9229760	9234120	But anyway, I guess I've ruined the story for myself, but I was just so irritated by,
9234120	9239720	Oh man, I got, you mean I got to pay for a video game, but anyway, uh, Fortnite saved
9239720	9244420	the world has a subterranean area to explore in Hexylvania.
9244420	9249740	You can get new weapons, new loot, uh, and there's new heroes, uh, to battle the monsters
9249740	9250740	there.
9250740	9254500	Uh, which of course will be hiding the ultimate boss because that's how a dungeon crawler
9254500	9255500	works.
9255500	9261580	Uh, Swamp Knight makes made their debut in Fortnite along with Murr Monster Ken.
9261580	9265480	And then I guess the Mythic Storm Kings, there's all these new characters and there's a new
9265480	9267340	crossover quest with that.
9267340	9270620	I was all about trying the dungeon crawler cause I was like, Oh, this might be a fun
9270620	9275220	mode and something that's a little more like PvE in Fortnite, which is what saved the world
9275220	9276220	is.
9276220	9278940	But up save the world is still in early access.
9278940	9282220	So you have to pay 40 bucks if you want to be able to access it.
9282220	9286060	Rumor is it's supposed to be on its way out of early access in some point in the near
9286060	9287060	future.
9287060	9290700	But I think a lot of people thought it would happen when the black hole event just happened
9290700	9292700	and it went into, what do they call it?
9292700	9294360	Chapter two or something.
9294360	9298540	So they thought that would be the point that saved the world goes free, but it didn't.
9298540	9299540	They're still charging for it.
9300060	9301060	Got to make their money.
9301060	9305860	I'm going to wait for like, I'll try maybe 20 bucks, but I'm not paying 40, especially
9305860	9307280	when I don't know much about the mode.
9307280	9311380	Now at this point, I'm like, all right, I guess I will try to find a YouTuber or a Twitch
9311380	9314800	streamer that's playing this part of Fortnite.
9314800	9320300	I mean, I've watched like Flaco play the hundred match and it looks like he's having fun.
9320300	9325060	I'm kind of like, Oh, it's, it's interesting to watch, but just, I, when I play it, I just,
9325060	9326060	it's terrible.
9326060	9327060	And I don't know what I'm doing.
9327060	9331140	There's no tutorial or maybe there, if there is, I haven't found it cause I installed the
9331140	9335240	game a long time ago, but, um, yeah, I just, I don't know.
9335240	9338260	I can't get into Fortnite the same way everybody else does.
9338260	9342100	So, all right, anyhow, uh, let's move on.
9342100	9346220	Uh, and I forgot to advance there to Fortnite save the world, but we just talked about that.
9346220	9350220	So let's go to, um, another Stadia follow-up dark soccer, right?
9350220	9355260	So Stadia users have been complaining that on their Chromecast ultra, it's been getting
9355260	9360580	extremely hot and it forces the system to shut down mid game without saving their progress.
9360580	9364700	When Reddit users said that in the middle of the Destiny 2 fight, the Chromecast died
9364700	9366780	and lost connectivity to the network.
9366780	9370660	And then when he went to go and plug it from power, it was incredibly hot.
9370660	9375100	Um, you know, when people say it's hot, they're supposed to have some sort of heat, you know,
9375100	9377200	heat protection in any way.
9377200	9381060	But one of the Google representatives said, this is a quote, we know, um, any sort of
9381060	9382940	heat on a device can be worrisome.
9382940	9387800	We confirm there's no thermal overheating issue with the Chromecast ultra.
9387800	9391380	During normal usage, it can get hot to the touch, but it's working as designed, which
9391380	9392380	is fine.
9392380	9393900	You know, we deal with that with computers all the time.
9393900	9394900	You've got them working.
9394900	9395900	They're going to get hot.
9395900	9396900	They're going to be hot to the touch.
9396900	9403340	You know, don't put your laptop on your fucking lap because heat sinks are in the bottom of
9403340	9404340	it.
9404340	9405660	Vents are in the back.
9405660	9408660	Don't look at me because I know what I'm doing.
9408660	9413940	I know we don't have a camera on dark Sakura, but, uh, her laptop is in her lap.
9413940	9417520	I wouldn't think it would be necessarily a problem with her laptop.
9417520	9421140	Mine on the other hand, mine doesn't get that hot.
9421140	9423620	And on top of that, you'll notice my vents aren't blocked.
9423620	9424620	Yeah.
9424620	9427200	And also you're using it for a very limited amount of time.
9427200	9429420	You see how often I put it back on the table, right?
9429420	9430420	I'm just giving you shit.
9430420	9431420	That's what I do.
9431420	9434940	Well, at any rate, of course, people don't believe the official word because they don't
9434940	9436740	understand technology.
9436740	9443140	So, um, but people are saying that, yeah, that it's shutting down 10 minutes after overheating.
9443140	9445580	And that is not how it's supposed to behave.
9445580	9447700	I'll tell you that right now.
9447700	9454460	Usually if something shuts down, like if I go outside with my phone on 110 degree day
9454460	9458580	talking to people on it, I'm going to get the thermal warning on my phone and if I keep
9458580	9460420	using it, it will shut down.
9460420	9464300	If my computer were having a thermal event, I would have a warning pop up and it would
9464300	9465300	shut down.
9465540	9470060	These products are built to shut down when they are too hot.
9470060	9473660	And if it's shutting down and you're getting widespread reports of this, so they're just
9473660	9478080	talking about the heat and the heat is normal, but getting so hot that it shuts down.
9478080	9479080	That is not normal.
9479080	9480080	So.
9480080	9485060	Especially in November, you know, like my phone will do that in the summer months.
9485060	9487060	Our November is 70.
9487060	9488060	True.
9488060	9494920	You know, um, but yeah, and people are like, well, even with all that happening, Stadia
9494920	9497960	just feels really niche and not important.
9497960	9505400	So I didn't feel Jason's summary was that negative though, and not Bobby did a summary
9505400	9506400	on it too.
9506400	9510600	And you know, I feel like I, I do feel that, I mean, not to say like some of the things
9510600	9515200	that Jason said, yeah, but it's, that also is more about like the, the, just the setup
9515200	9518640	of the, the store and the model to begin with is interesting.
9518640	9522480	But anyway, all right, um, moving on, we have one more story.
9522480	9526120	This is very sad, but, um, on a respectful note, Loki.
9526120	9527120	Yeah.
9527120	9535080	So, um, unfortunately the, uh, creator of, or one of the designers of EverQuest, Brad
9535080	9537360	McQuaid has passed away.
9537360	9545160	So he, um, passed away in his home, um, at the age of 51 and he was basically known in
9545160	9553600	the community by his alias, um, Aradune and, you know, started his journey through the
9553600	9560920	game industry back in 89, um, worked on a shareware RPG called Wizard War, which I think
9560920	9567480	I've, I think I've played that, um, and then of course went to work on, you know, EverQuest
9567480	9568480	as well.
9568480	9569480	So that's unfortunate.
9569480	9570480	Yeah.
9570480	9572880	It's a very young age for that to happen.
9572880	9576040	Um, I know they didn't say why and it's, you know, if the family doesn't want to disclose
9576040	9580120	that that's not our business, but, um, very, uh, very young and very sad to hear that he
9580120	9581280	was working on something else.
9581280	9585640	I know too, that unfortunately, um, he will not get to see through to completion, but,
9585640	9591240	um, I know like EverQuest in particular, you know, uh, it was such an important game of
9591240	9592840	the MMO genre.
9592840	9598000	I did not get sucked into EverQuest personally, but I darn well recognize that without EverQuest,
9598000	9602040	we wouldn't have certainly like Final Fantasy 11 was very EverQuest inspired.
9602040	9605360	Uh, and we would probably not have things the same way, like we have with like World
9605360	9609600	of Warcraft and some of the other more modern MMOs that we have, you know, today.
9609600	9612200	Um, so this game really paved the way for that.
9612200	9615080	And certainly, you know, Brad's, um, vision was a huge part of that.
9615080	9620260	Um, I will also give a shout out, um, to, uh, Bobby, cause I know he did play a lot
9620260	9621260	more EverQuest.
9621260	9623220	He had a very touching tribute on his show tonight.
9623220	9627420	So I mean, if he weren't already listening, um, at five o'clock, uh, when his show was
9627420	9631020	on earlier, excuse me, five Pacific eight Eastern, when his show was on earlier, um,
9631020	9634300	then you will definitely want to check out that podcast feed when it is released.
9634300	9636100	So, um, rest in peace.
9636100	9640980	Uh, always hard to hear about the game designers, you know, that did such big things, especially
9640980	9641980	at such a young age.
9641980	9643900	That's the, that's the hardest part of that.
9643900	9644900	So, yeah.
9644900	9645900	All right.
9645900	9648060	Um, well, let's move on.
9648060	9652380	So hopefully on a happier note, I want to get to our round table and invite, uh, some
9652380	9654900	of the, uh, calls and all that good stuff.
9654900	9657140	And we do have one caller that's on the line.
9657140	9659660	So let's get to it and bring them on the show.
9659660	9660660	Hello.
9660660	9661660	You're on orange launch radio.
9661660	9662660	Who's this?
9662660	9663660	Hey, this is Def.
9663660	9664660	Hey Def.
9664660	9665660	It's good to hear from you.
9665660	9666660	What's on your mind tonight?
9666660	9671940	Well, I was going to write an email about this because it was from last week, but I
9671940	9672940	forgot.
9672940	9673940	So whatever.
9673940	9676900	What's on your mind about it?
9676900	9678900	I want to talk about Wayfarer.
9678900	9680900	Oh sure.
9680900	9682940	The Niantic, a point of interest submission.
9682940	9683940	Oh boy.
9683940	9685940	Can we talk about what I've seen?
9685940	9687460	Have you seen my Twitter feed?
9687460	9688460	I've seen.
9688460	9691260	I just, I just decided to go all in this week.
9691260	9692260	I have seen.
9692260	9693260	Okay.
9693260	9695580	So if you aren't already aware, we did talk about this last week, so I'll try not to repeat
9695580	9696660	myself too much.
9696660	9702020	But the Niantic point of interest system, which was exclusive to Ingress, uh, but affected
9702020	9707700	Pokemon go and Harry Potter, it opened up to Pokemon go players of level 40 last week.
9707700	9712900	And I sat here and I complained on the show, Oh God, we're going to get all this bullshit
9712900	9716460	that's getting submitted because people are going to think, Oh, I want a Poke stop on
9716460	9717560	my couch.
9717560	9720220	And people are going to love that because it's more Poke stops.
9720220	9721780	Whereas I'm like, hold on.
9721780	9727000	What you do affects a variety of games and you do not want player versus player battles
9727000	9730340	happening on your lawn or whatever bullshit's being submitted.
9730340	9731740	But anyway, that was my take.
9731740	9734660	What's your take Def?
9734660	9741620	And I pretty much agree on at least the most part because yeah, there's people that have
9741620	9743740	like gems on their house.
9743740	9751580	I personally know that and, and it's like really, really tough to like do raids or something
9751580	9758580	like that on those places because yeah, because it's not necessarily the best, but it, they're
9758580	9761020	actually like, okay, submissions.
9761020	9765420	There were, there are legit, they're, they're not like, Oh, they're in sight in a house
9765420	9771360	or they're like, uh, manipulated what like you were talking about, uh, last week I think.
9771360	9778160	And I think also Matt, uh, showed some, uh, some of the pictures, uh, of someone getting
9778160	9781040	like, uh, a statue or something.
9781040	9787480	And yeah, I was like, yeah, and most people here also have the same idea because if, if,
9787480	9793480	if something like it's populated here in Mexico, it's like, we can sit the murals.
9793480	9798560	We have a lot of religious murals here and they're, they're legit.
9798560	9804040	They're okay by the Wayfarer standards, but it like there's tons of people like saying,
9804040	9809880	Oh, I'm going to make one in my house so I can get a Pokestop or I can get a portal even.
9809880	9812520	But I'm like, no, you shouldn't do that.
9812520	9817720	If you're going to do something like that, think more like in an open space and in a
9817720	9826200	place that needs the Pokestop is if there's already, uh, like already enough POIs on your
9826200	9829520	place or near your place, you don't need more.
9829520	9835440	And that's also like my stance on that, but at the same time and, and sometimes because
9835440	9841960	of, of how the rating works and especially in places that, that don't have probably that
9841960	9847380	commodities, especially like talking about safe, safe, uh, safe places that don't have
9847380	9849960	like a proper sidewalk here.
9849960	9856840	I, uh, and the place I live, there, there are streets that don't have even like a proper
9856840	9857840	street.
9857840	9859400	They're, they're just dirt.
9859400	9861200	So they don't have a sidewalk.
9861200	9865960	They don't have like a proper place for pedestrians.
9865960	9872960	But uh, if I check that in the Pokestop or the POI, it's in a place that I know that
9872960	9876400	people can traverse a walking there.
9876400	9883720	I'm gonna submit it like a safe place because I know it's actually a place that people actually
9883720	9884720	walk on.
9884720	9889020	So yeah, yeah, that's tough because if you don't know the place and, and that's, that's
9889020	9896020	also like one of the things, uh, I'm probably like, again, some of the people like that,
9896020	9899920	that actually review here is that, Oh, it is not on a safe place.
9899920	9901280	No, but you don't know that place.
9901280	9907280	If you know the place, you know, that all you know, that actually people go there and,
9907280	9908960	and do what pedestrian stuff.
9908960	9910080	So yeah.
9910080	9911080	Some of the advice.
9911080	9914480	So this week is what has happened since when I was talking about this last week is that
9914480	9917960	I'm seeing more of the Pokemon Go submissions come through this week.
9917960	9920280	And let me tell you some of my pet peeves.
9920280	9923400	And I think some of the people listening to the show probably know that, but I'm at like,
9923400	9926420	for what it's worth, I'm going to put this out there for the greater population.
9926420	9931040	These are some things that are going to instantly make me like, like hate your submission.
9931040	9932600	Number one on the list.
9932600	9939500	If your justification says in the justification, we need a pokey stop here because don't stop
9939500	9944200	talking because what's happened, I've already deducted a star in my mind.
9944200	9945680	I'm not supposed to do that.
9945680	9947300	I'm going to admit I'm not supposed to do that.
9947300	9951560	But in my mind, when you say we need a pokey stop here, you're not submitting this because
9951560	9952960	it's a place of interest.
9952960	9955760	You're not submitting this for the reasons you're supposed to be submitting a portal.
9955760	9962060	You're submitting it because this is convenient for your walk or your life or your way of
9962060	9963600	playing the game.
9963600	9968240	And so when I see that in the justification, I'm looking for reasons to deny it.
9968240	9971480	I'm not going to say I always do it because there was one that came through that said,
9971480	9973000	we need a pokey stop here.
9973000	9976760	And I was like, it's actually like, it was like a war memorial or something.
9976760	9980360	And I was like, it was like in a post office and I'm like, I hate this.
9980360	9984640	I hate that I have to approve this, but it actually does meet the standards and it's
9984640	9986360	a super safe place to be.
9986360	9987360	So I'm going to approve it.
9987360	9989440	But like, I was looking for a reason to deny it.
9989440	9991240	Like I really was.
9991240	9996520	So you know, and you might hate me for saying that, but at the same time, I hate that you're
9996520	9998480	submitting something not for the right reasons.
9998480	10001520	So deal.
10001520	10006580	And the other thing that like, just, oh my God, I've seen some real brazen stuff.
10006580	10011200	Like people submitting the lawn at the apartment complex, calling it a dog park.
10011200	10014640	People submitting a restaurant just because we don't have a pokey stop in the strip mall
10014640	10016000	and we should have one.
10016000	10019440	And I'm just like, well, you're not getting one because this doesn't meet the criteria.
10019440	10021420	So try again.
10021420	10026080	I will say though, like, you know, I do think not to say all the Pokemon submissions are
10026080	10027080	shit.
10027080	10030400	I think some of them have been pretty decent.
10030400	10034720	I tend to be a little more, it's interesting Act F because I tend to be a little more forgiving
10034720	10039620	when I see that the submission is in Mexico or Puerto Rico, because I know those places
10039620	10042140	are hurting for more points of interest.
10042140	10046920	So I tend to be a little more lenient, but like I got one the other day that was exercise
10046920	10049720	equipment at a park and like, it's fine.
10049720	10053020	It meets standards and I approved it, but I know it's going to get denied because the
10053020	10057220	picture was terrible and it made it look like it was the play structure that was already
10057220	10058660	a portal.
10058660	10060620	So it's not going to go through.
10060620	10066340	I approved it because I'm like, it's pretty much, it's a park, it's Mexico and it does
10066340	10068020	meet all the standards.
10068020	10071260	Like I'm fine with this being a submission, but it's not going to, I can tell you it's
10071260	10072340	not going to go through.
10072340	10074580	So be aware of the pictures that you're taking.
10074580	10077500	That is super important.
10077500	10080100	And the last thing I would say is that don't submit shit.
10080100	10083140	You don't want 30 people there for any x-rayed for.
10083140	10089200	I saw somebody submit a tree in their backyard called a hundred year old tree.
10089200	10094180	First off, if you do not have an official sign that has the seal of the city or county
10094180	10099420	on it, that denotes it as a historic tree, that it's a fucking tree and a natural feature
10099420	10100420	is not a portal.
10100420	10104260	So it's getting denied, especially when that fucking portal is in your backyard, no matter
10104260	10110040	if you say it's on a walking trail, who's walking trail, bitch, yours, no, no pokey
10110040	10111040	stop for you.
10111040	10112420	Shut it down.
10112420	10115020	So anyway.
10115020	10118740	And yeah, I have seen those kinds of submissions.
10118740	10128740	One of the first ones I reviewed there was a rock, a simple rock with a Pokeball bag
10128740	10131580	or like a backpack on over it.
10131580	10135340	I'm like, really, really?
10135340	10141380	And you have seen, I have tweeted you some of the findings I have encountered this week.
10141380	10145580	So yeah, but I have others.
10145580	10146980	I have to read this comment from chat.
10147820	10151260	Matt says some Pokemon go players are strange.
10151260	10155260	There's a subset of folks that seem to think that Niantic owes them something and they
10155260	10156980	should make anything a stop.
10156980	10161260	Well, guess what, bitch Niantic ain't reviewing your portals.
10161260	10163260	They outsource that to the player base.
10163260	10169600	You know, who's reviewing your portals me and I don't owe you shit.
10169600	10174780	So take your stop and shove it.
10174780	10175780	And that's really true.
10176780	10186340	We were basically doing the job that Niantic isn't doing, but at least in that sense, we're
10186340	10191060	like taking proper precautions and stances on that.
10191060	10197020	So at least that's something I actually like about this, that we are the players are taking
10197020	10204740	care of this because yeah, even in my own community, me and some other players, even
10204780	10212180	Ingress players, we're trying to teach the other players that are submitting like, oh,
10212180	10220060	you should do this, especially like you said in the part that you need to tell why this
10220060	10222340	should be a POI.
10222340	10228860	We're telling people do not tell that it should be a Poke stop, tell why it's important for
10228860	10233860	the community, tell why the history behind the POI.
10233860	10238780	So yeah, we're trying to tell people about that, the pictures, the photos, all that.
10238780	10242180	You can document this.
10242180	10247020	I can't speak for the entire Ingress player base that is already in Wayfarer and has been
10247020	10251900	using Wayfarer for some time and probably needs to also support your submission to actually
10251900	10253100	become a thing.
10253100	10258620	But I can speak for a large chunk of the base that I've talked to that is in there in Ingress,
10259580	10264020	they all feel what I just said earlier, that if you put in there, this should be a Poke
10264020	10268940	stop because we're already going, nope, you're not following the rules.
10268940	10270940	You're not submitting this for the betterment of the game.
10270940	10275700	You're submitting it for the betterment of yourself and you're already going to be an
10275700	10276700	uphill battle.
10276700	10284380	Quite literally, the second one I reviewed just now is the back of a building, Thunderdome
10284380	10285380	rear entrance.
10285380	10290660	The Thunderdome is the location where trainers and masters converse on catching recent Pokemon.
10290660	10292220	It is a sidewalk.
10292220	10295300	First off, it broke through.
10295300	10300220	You can deny it right there with the reason description because you cannot say in your
10300220	10303740	description, Pokemon, Ingress, portal.
10303740	10307620	I realized some things have snuck through like, you know, under the old rules when the
10307620	10312220	player base wasn't doing it and Google was doing it themselves, some things snuck through.
10312220	10314220	That's why you have like shapers.
10314220	10316740	Sometimes you see reference to shapers or XM.
10316740	10318620	Those are Ingress terms.
10318620	10322320	But for now, when the player base is reviewing, just based on that description, they name
10322320	10323940	check the game.
10323940	10325140	That's not a point of interest.
10325140	10327260	So rejected based on description.
10327260	10329660	I don't even have to look at where it is or the picture itself.
10329660	10332100	The description is bad enough.
10332100	10339140	And I have seen that the like churches, temples, like stuff like that, that people say in the
10339140	10343420	description, oh, people come here to pray, to get shinies.
10343420	10347220	And I'm like, really, people, really?
10347220	10348920	One star.
10348920	10354260	One star because you're submitting something with a Pokemon reference and you are forgetting
10354260	10357460	that you're not submitting just for Pokemon Go.
10357460	10360500	That's what I need the player base of Pokemon Go to understand.
10360500	10362300	And I love both games.
10362300	10365700	I am max level in Ingress and max level in Pokemon.
10365700	10369740	So I can speak with some sense of authority for the Pokemon group too.
10369740	10375540	And I just, I need them to realize what they're submitting is not just for their game.
10375540	10381820	And yeah, then one more thing about this, there's a video on YouTube from Pokemon Go
10381820	10389460	YouTuber Trainer Tips that explains really, really well how Wayfarer works like in both
10389460	10393660	points of view from the submitter and also like a reviewer.
10393660	10399220	So I suggest people that probably don't understand that much about Wayfarer and want to get into
10399220	10404260	it and are submitting like focus stop portals and all this stuff that check that video.
10404260	10405260	It's really informative.
10405260	10408100	But again, I don't want to keep this overly negative.
10408100	10411420	There are some positive things that I'm seeing, you know, and especially like, you know, I
10411420	10414860	saw one the other day that was like, this park has been here for three years.
10414860	10416980	And this is just a justification, not the description.
10416980	10420020	This park has been here for three years and it's still not in the game.
10420020	10422240	And I'm looking and I'm like, yep, it's a park.
10422240	10423240	It should be in the game.
10423320	10426120	Okay, you can have your stop because it meets the criteria.
10426120	10429280	It was a sign at a park that really should be there.
10429280	10431480	And those are the, that's the type of stuff I love.
10431480	10434680	Things that like parks and historical places, universities.
10434680	10436880	I'm pretty, you know, pretty good about that stuff too.
10436880	10440000	Places where people should be gathering anyway.
10440000	10445680	You know, the wonderful thing about these games, it's getting people to use public parks.
10445680	10449800	You know, I realize some cities have had issues with that, but they're stupid.
10449800	10452720	For the most part, I think a lot of cities are really happy about it.
10452720	10457480	Like, you know, I see food truck events that are like, come to our food truck event and,
10457480	10460560	you know, we have pokey stops here you can play, you know, and so forth.
10460560	10463120	So anyway, anyway.
10463120	10468980	And yeah, and I also feel like for rural players, because obviously they don't have like that
10468980	10477400	many POIs, but at least I'm seeing more people like, especially here locally from the outskirts
10477400	10484520	and places that like are small towns, basically, that are getting submissions and all that
10484520	10485520	stuff.
10485520	10494840	And I'm pretty much, of course, if it's a legit one, if it's a sorry for approval, I
10494840	10501080	usually give those five stars, even if it has like a kind of shady description.
10501080	10507040	But sometimes it's people, and I know my people, I know my Mexican people.
10507040	10508040	So yeah, basically.
10508040	10509040	I'm sorry.
10509040	10510040	I'm sorry.
10510040	10514400	While you were talking, I brought up something that SJ100 Matt put in chat.
10514400	10517420	And this is a piece of work, for God's sake.
10517420	10521680	So it's a picture of a fire hydrant that's been painted, and it's called American flag
10521680	10522920	fire hydrant.
10522920	10526960	This fire hydrant was painted to resemble an American flag after the events of 9-11
10526960	10528600	in 2001.
10528600	10532260	I believe that this pokey stop nomination is important because it stands as a symbol
10532260	10536620	in a local community to help us remember what happened on September 11th, 2001, as
10536620	10538980	well as what and who we lost.
10538980	10541300	Through remembrance, we get stronger as people.
10541300	10542300	Never forget.
10542300	10543300	Okay.
10543300	10544300	It's a fucking fire hydrant.
10544300	10548400	It's a fucking fire hydrant, one star obstructs emergency services.
10548400	10551980	And quite frankly, sir or madam, how dare you?
10551980	10557220	Because you're trying to leverage this tragedy so you can have a fucking pokey stop?
10557220	10558740	And what the fuck?
10558740	10563100	Just even apart from that, not the first time fire hydrants have been placed and painted
10563100	10564100	as the flag.
10564100	10566220	There was one in the 80s when I was a kid.
10566220	10567860	Which is, and you know, that's-
10567860	10572060	And I think it's actually illegal, it has to be done by city ordinance.
10572060	10576340	Well, one star obstructs emergency services, and you might be thinking, we don't have to
10576340	10579580	be standing on the hydrant to access it.
10579580	10583340	You aren't thinking of all the games because in Ingress, sometimes you have to stand on
10583340	10586540	the center of the portal if you want to remove shields with ultra strikes.
10586540	10589260	Your submission blocks emergency services, one star.
10589260	10590260	Yep.
10590260	10591260	Basically, yeah.
10591260	10592260	So anyway.
10592260	10597220	And then SGA-100 Matt says also Staten Island, just saying.
10597220	10600300	We should have the Niantic Wayfarer review podcast.
10600300	10605980	Actually, okay, so I'm trying to talk to one of my Ingress buddies to convince her to do
10605980	10606980	something.
10606980	10607980	But anyway.
10607980	10608980	That would be hilarious.
10608980	10609980	I know.
10609980	10610980	It's a panel.
10610980	10611980	We vote you out.
10611980	10612980	Anyway.
10612980	10614860	All right.
10614860	10615860	Thank you so much, ActAft.
10615860	10616860	I'm gonna let you go.
10616860	10617860	So we wrap up the show.
10617860	10618860	But great conversation.
10618860	10620580	Nothing gets me riled up like a shitty pokestop.
10620580	10622660	Hey, thanks for having me.
10622660	10623660	Like always.
10623660	10624660	All right.
10624660	10625660	Take care, buddy.
10625660	10626660	You too.
10626660	10627660	All right.
10627660	10628660	All right.
10628660	10629660	I think we're at the point of the show where it's time for us to wrap up.
10629660	10631020	And Les, do we have any last minute stories?
10631020	10632020	I don't know.
10632020	10634060	I saw something and I actually downloaded it.
10634060	10637580	I didn't look too much more into it where someone did like this.
10637580	10642900	I mean, it really just looks like it was done in like some like maybe Unreal Engine or something,
10642900	10644240	some real life world.
10644240	10646720	But it's like a free running Mario game.
10646720	10651920	And it looks like one of the more recent, you know, 3D models and new 3D Goombas and
10651920	10654880	everything all in this just like overworld place.
10654880	10656240	And I forgot the name of it.
10656240	10657240	I downloaded it earlier.
10657240	10659240	And if I could remember more about it, but I found it on Twitter.
10659240	10661360	I'll have to see if I can find it again.
10661360	10662360	But it's out there.
10662360	10666280	It's just weird because it's got like realistic shading, even though it's like Mario.
10666280	10669040	Just normal old Mario and Goombas.
10669040	10672040	I didn't really see a point to it, but I'm like, oh, waste of time.
10672040	10676840	I got into this YouTube, well, I just want to mention this because I got into this like
10676840	10683320	YouTube, I don't know, rabbit hole earlier about the IAAPA.
10683320	10689000	So that's a it's a convention for amusement parks and amusement park innovations and stuff
10689000	10690000	like that.
10690000	10694240	And one of the videos they showed on there was somebody playing a game that looked like
10694240	10702960	on a Tron light cycle VR, but the game itself looked much like Wipeout or F-Zero.
10702960	10704920	That is a perfect combination of things right there.
10704920	10706440	It is a good combination of things.
10706440	10707440	I like that.
10707440	10708440	All right.
10708440	10711280	Well, we're about to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.
10711280	10716100	But I do want to say happy Thanksgiving holiday to those of you here in the States that are
10716100	10718480	celebrating Thanksgiving this week.
10718480	10722480	But you know, around the world, thanks to everybody that listens to and supports the
10722480	10723480	show.
10723720	10725320	I do appreciate you guys.
10725320	10728400	And you know, you may have noticed tonight is episode number seven hundred and ninety
10728400	10732400	nine, which means next week will be episode number eight hundred of our show.
10732400	10733400	Believe it or not.
10733400	10738000	Any of you who are friends with my husband on the Facebook, just saying ask him to be
10738000	10739520	on the show.
10739520	10742900	So we're hoping we're going to have a good time and a good show to mark eight hundred
10742900	10744440	episodes of the show.
10744440	10748600	But I think it's an appropriate time of year to really give thanks to all of you that turn
10748600	10753240	to tune into the show, whether it be here on Twitch as we record it live or if you're
10753240	10757040	listening on the podcast feed every week, you are just as important as well.
10757040	10760000	And we hope you do feel you have a voice at the table if you ever want to send us an email
10760000	10761960	or a tweet or anything like that.
10761960	10765360	We would not have the motivation to keep going because of you guys.
10765360	10768960	Longevity does not always translate into mainstream success.
10768960	10773660	However, I feel like there's been many success stories out of this show.
10773660	10775600	And that is really thanks to you guys.
10775600	10779480	You know, just a couple of weeks ago, I was in New York City hanging out with some of
10779480	10783080	you guys, and I would not be doing that if it wasn't for this little program that we
10783080	10784080	have here.
10784080	10789400	Our little show, our little secret show that hates shitty Pokestop submissions.
10789400	10794640	So just giving thanks to all of you guys who take time out of your week, whether it be
10794640	10798080	here live on Sunday nights or at some point throughout the week, maybe while you're working
10798080	10800640	or on your commute or what have you to listen to this show.
10800640	10801640	Really appreciate that.
10801640	10802960	And thank you so much.
10802960	10807080	On that note, let's go around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10807080	10810280	Um, Loki, I guess we'll start with you.
10810280	10815980	Hopefully I'll get to work more of my game during my time off this week.
10815980	10817400	My final thought is wish me luck.
10817400	10819560	I might actually be a Pokemon game.
10819560	10821120	I'm making progress to be Pokemon shield.
10821120	10822120	It looks like it might happen.
10822120	10823120	You are a Pokemon game?
10823120	10824120	I thought you said be a Pokemon game.
10824120	10826560	I thought for sure that you beat Let's Go, but I guess not.
10826560	10832120	No, I only got as far as Pokemon Go Park and I'm not counting Let's Go either because it's
10832120	10834040	not a mainline game technically.
10834040	10835040	It's kind of a side game.
10835040	10836040	Yeah, close.
10836040	10837040	I know close.
10837040	10842000	Um, so my final thought is, yeah, I want to be Pokemon shield and I forgot to give the
10842000	10845320	little thing about a five star review wherever you found the show.
10845320	10849520	Help us spread the word because, uh, we don't, if, if your friends and your fam and other
10849520	10852640	people out there, you know, on the internet aren't here, we can't hear those voices.
10852640	10853640	So help us spread the word.
10853640	10855440	The auto hosts on Twitch go a long way as well.
10855440	10860440	Besides, we're definitely not worth one star because we don't block emergency services.
10860440	10864720	We meet, we meet all, should I submit studio and seven as a, no, I'm not going to submit
10864720	10869240	it as, because that would be bad because that's, it would also give away my home address.
10869240	10870720	That's not a good idea.
10870720	10871720	Why would I do that?
10871720	10876200	Anyway, you can do it after you move, Oh, then have like a little plaque in the backyard
10876200	10877200	historical site.
10877200	10881640	No, cause then my frenemy who plays for the other team, it'll be right next to them and
10881640	10883520	I'll live on the other side of town.
10883520	10888920	I'm not giving my friend to me another pokey pokey stopper, uh, uh, portal.
10888920	10889920	Anyway.
10889920	10892600	Um, dark soccer, last but not least your turn.
10892600	10894760	I got a shitty schedule at work starting in February.
10894760	10899680	It's a 5am shift, which would keep me from here anyway.
10899680	10900680	So wish me luck.
10900680	10906080	I'm going to go petition my case and I already mentioned it to the boss that I can't work
10906080	10909120	before eight o'clock and I can't work Sundays.
10909120	10911160	So wish me luck.
10911160	10912160	Fingers and toes crossed.
10912160	10916160	Cause that's going to be rough if, uh, it's a six month stint this time instead of three
10916160	10917160	months.
10917160	10918160	Oh golly.
10918160	10921560	So yeah, I have been very specific about it.
10921560	10922560	All right.
10923520	10924520	All right.
10924520	10926920	Um, well I guess that that we're going to wrap up.
10926920	10930920	So have a great holiday, those of you in the States, but no matter where you are, happy
10930920	10931960	gaming this week.
10931960	10932960	Have a great time.
10932960	10936000	And we will see you next time here on orange lounge radio next week.
10936000	10939800	Episode number 800 cause we're old.
