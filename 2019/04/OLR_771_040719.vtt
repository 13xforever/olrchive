00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
This week you got your Apex and my Fortnite

From downtown, in my rage

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Your Mario and my little big planet

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
And your VR and my Switch

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
We've read through the fools and hope it's all legit

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
To bring you tonight's news starting right now on the show

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Where every gamer has a voice

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Where every gamer has a voice

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Live with episode number 771

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
For this April the 7th of 2019

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
And joining me in studio

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm so full

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
You're full?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Of those cookies that you brought to the studio tonight

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Well I meant to save one

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
But I ate it

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
She was going to give us a cookie

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
But she ate it

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
They came out black

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Or gray

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Because I made raspberry and blackberry puree

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And when I added it to the batter

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
It turned gray and got really sticky

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
So I had to add more flour

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
So I don't know if I'm going to make them again

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Because the first bite's like sugar cookie and then raspberry flavor

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It turned out good though

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
It did but I like my sugar cookies

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
But I'm not doing any more dandelion cookies this season either

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Speaking of our raspberry cookies

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Would you allow the Twitch folks to see the back of your head

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Because it's a very lovely red color

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
This isn't raspberry though

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I know it's a little lighter than raspberry

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
But I like the color

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
This is flamingo

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
This is orange and peach

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You can't really see

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
This is where my head was shaved

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Well and for the podcast listeners

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
They can't see anything anyway

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Sucks to be you

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I didn't say that they suck

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I said it sucks to be them

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Since they can't see the gloriousity

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Of my you know

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
My hair

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Well if you want to see the gloriousity of hair

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
You can tune in live every Sunday night at Twitch TV

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
My follicular glory

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Is that a word? Follicular?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Let me do my plug be quiet

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Twitch TV slash vog network

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
More information and other great podcasts

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
At vog network dot com

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Other things you can see on Twitch

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
It's a word

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Follicular

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Can I introduce our third host please?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Alright over there by my side

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Did you just catch a Pokemon here?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Techmaster Loki

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Live on air

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Is there something good on the house I should be paying attention to?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
No I just have to get rid of all these

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Great and whatever

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh like the quest you have to make so many

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
No I just have so many of them

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I'm taking out my inventory space and normally I just throw them away

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So you know might as well

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Gotcha you got too many balls

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Robin he's throwing away his blue balls

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Too many balls

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I don't want to know about yellow balls

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Over in our chat

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Over at Twitch TV slash vog network

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Because again we tape live on Sunday nights

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And you guys can join us in our chat room

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Bobby Black Wolf suggesting that somebody could make a clip

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Of the hair thing and then

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Cause yeah there are clips of our show

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And Bobby's show

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
We have a little archive cause that's a little something special

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
You can see it free of course when we broadcast live on Sunday

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
But you can subscribe using your

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Twitch Prime subscription or any of the

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Twitch subscription offers they have there

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And you will get access

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
To the complete video library so you can watch

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
A video episode if you want

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Audio only of course is free as it's always been

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
For coming up on 17 years

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
But the clips that people make

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Are free

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So you can see little like 30 second clips of our show

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Some people clip random things too

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I think some people just accidentally clip the button

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Cause they'll be like these random I'm like why did somebody

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Clip that it's just us I mean

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
It's not like yeah but there's

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Also clips of things that are like

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
You know funny moments or like when

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Smoosh came on camera that one night or whatever

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
So things happen

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
It's part of the magic of doing Twitch since

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
We did move over in December

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
From Shoutcast where we were beforehand

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Anyway let's get

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Into our kickoff topic tonight let's talk about

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Let's talk about anniversaries

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a little bit different of a kickoff topic

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Usually we would talk about you know some

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
New gaming story or what's

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Going on in the news and there is a little bit going on in the

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Gaming news this week although it's probably slowed down

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
A little bit from last

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Week because of

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You know there's no PAX this week

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Or GDC I think everything's calming down a little bit

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But we do have a big anniversary

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
That we're looking at this week and that is

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Final Fantasy 6

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Celebrating it's 25th anniversary

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Now of course I'm sure

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Many of you guys that consume

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Gaming podcasts are probably aware at this

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Point that here in the US

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
We received Final Fantasy 6

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
As Final Fantasy 3

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
So sometimes this is called Final Fantasy 3 US

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
We received it as that but

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
This is in the true Final Fantasy

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Canon it's the 6th game and

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
25 years ago on April

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
2nd so this week in

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
1994 Final Fantasy

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
6 was released in Japan

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
We got it a little bit later because

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Back then you know it wasn't

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Such a global economy

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
The internet had not yet taken off

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I think the internet was probably still government in 94

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't think you could do internet on Prodigy

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Or AOL that stuff yet

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
94? Not yet

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Almost there right? No you had AOL

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Remember I met Dan

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
In my first year on AOL

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
In 93, 94 was

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
AOL 1.5 which was the DOS based

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I thought it was more like after I graduated high school in 96

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
But I think it was still

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
We can say it was still very niche and not a lot of people were

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I was in college

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
But anyway

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Regardless Final Fantasy 6 came out

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
25 years ago and obviously

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
A lot of people

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Remember this game very fondly

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Although we sometimes joke about

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Super Nintendo releases and

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
What's better Super Metroid or

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Chrono Trigger or

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
We razzed maybe other games

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Of Final Fantasy series like you guys know I have my

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Issues of Final Fantasy 8 and so forth

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
All that tongue and cheek

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Talk aside I think

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Generally most people regard this

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
As especially in

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Our age group of gamers

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And that's an important footnote to make

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You know the late 30's early 40's

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Probably a good range outside of that too

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I think there's a generation almost that would consider

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Even if maybe Final Fantasy 6 isn't

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Your favorite game

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
It's probably one of your favorite

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Games if you're a role play

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Person if you're more of a sports gamer

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Maybe it's not in your list but I know a lot

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Of people that would be Final Fantasy 10

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
If you're a sports game oh for Blitzball

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Heck yeah come on San Arc and Abe's yeah right

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
But anyway

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I think this game certainly left an impact

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
On a lot of people

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Dark Sakura you know since you were

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
On the internet earlier and I know you're a big retro

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Gamer and a big gamer girl

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
All the way back in college and so forth

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
What was your memories with

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Final Fantasy 6?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Pretending to have the flu for a week so I could beat it

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
After I rented it

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
So you rented the game

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
You didn't even I rented it and you held on to it

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
For an entire week that's a lot of late fees

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
No I

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Renewed my rental the place that we were renting our

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Video games from you could rent for a week oh that's

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Oh nice and so cause I wasn't running through

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Blockbuster we were doing like little mom and pops

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah I rented cause I worked for

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Mom and pops I usually rented through there too but

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah but I

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Played the shit out of it

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
And I actually

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Started over after the

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Minecart level and then

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Just started completely over and just

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Zoomed right up till then and then

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Got through it I don't know why I think it was

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Just that motion sickness thing I've had cause I had

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I just couldn't do it at all

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Got so pissed that I put it away for a day

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Went back started over and beat the

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Whole game in the rest of the week and

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It was absolutely amazing and then I

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Finally got my own copy

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I remember

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Watching a friend in high school

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Play it because you know my family

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Was pretty middle class so it's like

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
We didn't really get the games when they first

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Came out or that was a real treat like when I got

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Mortal Kombat on Mortal Monday or whatever

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It was that was a freaking treat cause

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I usually didn't get games on the release day so I didn't get

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Final Fantasy 3 I didn't even I somehow didn't

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Even realize the game was coming out and I was over at a

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Friends house one day and

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
We were about to do I used to do

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
D&D in high school so we were about to do a D&D

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Thing and I walk in and they're playing

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm like oh my gosh this

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Is like Final Fantasy 2

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
But because remember I didn't I wasn't

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
As aware of what was going on in Japan and everything

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm like this is Final Fantasy 2 but like

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Like oh my gosh I'm just like watching

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Like dumbfounded the entire time because

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
There's like the mechs and the different

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I think he was at the point in the game where you

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Had Edgar and Sabin and

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So he was showing off how you could put like in the

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Controller input cause remember with Sabin it's like

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
He did a little Hadouken and he would actually do

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Was it that was one move?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I think so. You know there was like the controller input moves

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And it was like oh my gosh it's like a

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Fighting game not really but you know

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
When you're 13 you're thinking those types of things right

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It's a fighting game and then

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Of course Edgar had the tools right

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
So he had like the chainsaw

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And the so it was like

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah the autocrossbow the gas

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Thing the bio weapon or whatever

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And so it was like getting to see all that for the first

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Time was like oh my gosh it's so cool

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
And so like I knew I had to have it and so I

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You know begged and I ugly begged

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I was like what did they get? So finally

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
For Christmas that year I got that game

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And I just I played it like

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Every single day until I beat it

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I think part of me as a

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Kid is still a little more

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Fond of Final Fantasy 2 or what

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Would be 4 of course in canon

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Just because that was like the first one

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I played and especially like the

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Story from start to finish

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Because I don't know why but Final Fantasy

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
6's ending

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Was always a little weirder to me

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Like that I think it's

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Let me kind of rephrase this

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Because I think it's something I've grown to appreciate

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
In my older years

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
As I did versus when I would have first

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Played through this game you know

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Many years ago when I was like

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
13

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Is that I seem to remember

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Actually no I would have been ordering 13

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Because this game was out when I was in high school and it's

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
What 25 years ago so I was more like 15, 16

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But I didn't

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Like the way like at the end you

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Split up into the 3 parties

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
And he had to kind of go through that way

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And then like everybody

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Kind of had like a little piece of an

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Ending and then like if you didn't have

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Somebody you wouldn't see their piece

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Because there's somebody I didn't

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh I think it was Shadow I didn't have Shadow

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
You have to wait for him

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Well right but I didn't know that

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Wait for his late diva ass

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Right so I didn't know that when I was

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
A teenager actually you know the

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
As a teenager do you know what I remember

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
About Final Fantasy 6

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Like something I interpreted in the script

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
That like nobody else took away from it

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And I know this is wrong but when I first

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Played the game I thought that

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
One of the flashback scenes with

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Realm and

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
What was the older guys name

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Her grandfather

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Whose name I can't remember in the moment but somebody will

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yell it out in chat shortly

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I thought that Shadow was Realms mom

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Notice I didn't say dad

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I said mom

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I thought that was like the twist

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Because ninja why not a female ninja

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Thank you strago

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So why not a female ninja

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And I don't know what it was in the script if there was like a

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Pronoun I misread or something I don't know but I thought

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Like for years

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
That Shadow was Realms mom

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Until somebody was like

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
No no no like it's actually

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Maybe her dad but it's not really said

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I would have

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm now going to head canon that it's her mom

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Because we don't really know

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
If Shadow is actually a dude

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Ultros was her mom

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Alright what are you

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
You played through this game right

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah I rented it from Blockbuster

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I did I think

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm pretty sure I did I know I didn't own it

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But I had it long enough to play through it and beat it

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And I did

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And it was great

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I think I rented it multiple times

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And just

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Everything about it was fantastic and I must have

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Played it like

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Over the course of a weekend or something to finish it but

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
In a weekend

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I remember that game took like 60 hours

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
To beat or something I don't know

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
But it was yeah I was

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I just remember the end on it

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But I don't know

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
How long it took me to do it but

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It was fun

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
So if y'all have an SNES classic

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I mean that's probably the easiest way to play this game now

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Well let's talk a little bit about you know

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Because to tie this into some more recent news

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And things we've been talking about on the show more recently

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You know we seem to think

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
That we might be standing on

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Looking at the future of gaming

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Where things are going to go more streaming

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And so forth

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And it's not like you know Super Nintendos are gonna suddenly

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Wilt up and die and those things

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Especially can take a beating right

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Well I mean that's just what

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
They're pushing for console

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Gaming and stuff but it doesn't mean that anybody's actually

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It doesn't mean it's gonna take off

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
You know like they may say that

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
We wanna go this route but if no one buys

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
The system or no one pays into it

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
They're not gonna continue with it

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So I'm not really worried

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
That it's going streaming because

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
There's still PC

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
There's still retro

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
You know if you don't like what

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
The new game's coming out on your streaming

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Platform or if it's just

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Not gonna work because you don't have the bandwidth

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Or the bandwidth caps

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
For it then

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm sure you'll find ways around it

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
When we're looking at 25

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Years from now do you think

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
The only way people are going to be able to experience

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Final Fantasy 6 is

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
By finding

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Grandma at that point or Grandpa's old

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Super Nintendo and playing

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
The actual cartridge or do you think

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
No emulators come on

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
So emulators

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
All of a sudden they're gonna find a way

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
To wipe those off the internet this time

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I guess that's true I don't

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Maybe because I think of the full experience

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
As plopping down in front of the TV

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
With a controller but you're right

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Why can't you do an emulator on the TV thanks

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
To the

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Little computers in a box and the USB

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Stick which name escapes me at the moment

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Raspberry Pi

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And all those things

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And I'm sure that technology's gonna just get even more

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Yeah they're gonna get more powerful

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And it's just gonna be

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You'll be able to play all those old games

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
That you want

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Just because there's new games coming out

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Doesn't mean we have to only play those new games

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Otherwise we wouldn't be remastering

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Borderlands 1

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Or doing all this stuff

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I think it's just

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Good games are gonna be good games no matter what

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And that's why everyone's saying

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Well it's all gonna go the streamy route

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
But indies

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Can't necessarily afford to maybe

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Be on those streaming platforms so they're gonna do

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Things differently

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Unless there was a do it yourself solution

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Like YouTube

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
There will be ways

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
To put yourself on different

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Platforms but it doesn't mean that's the only

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Way to do it and they're gonna

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Fill the void of so it's not gonna be

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
That this is gonna be the only

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Way you do it it's only gonna be streaming

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
You're not really gonna purchase anything you're only gonna have

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Licensing to it or something maybe the

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Wrong thing to say is the only way but

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Especially again you know not to repeat this conversation

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Too much when we go look at the film industry

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I think and we see like a lot of it is

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Netflix and these sorts of things now maybe

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
The primary consumption method is

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Streaming and physical

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Blu-rays and DVDs are more

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Collectible keepsake they're more

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Collectibles they're more the secondary way to

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Do things right I guess you could

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Do it that way but if it's gonna be like

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
You know the film industry that we're gonna

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Have Square Enix's streaming service

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
We're gonna have Nintendo

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Streaming service Microsoft streaming service

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Sony EA Activision

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
All of them wanting their own I think

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I think especially on the TV I think things are gonna

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Break with that eventually I think you're gonna

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
See mergers and things you know

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh you're gonna see piracy is what you're gonna see

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Because people are gonna get tired of it

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Lots of great comments in our chat

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And Bobby Blackwolf saying

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Google wants to dumb down

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Your computer enough to make it a dumb terminal

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Where the actual computing power is in a server

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Farm so the new computers of the future

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Wouldn't have the horse power to run an emulator

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Well a super

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Nintendo emulator in this day and age can run on your

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Phone you know what I mean but I get what

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
You're saying they're kind of tongue in cheek when it comes to Stadia

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And things no I get what they're trying to do too

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
They're lowering the cost of computing

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
For like people to get

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Into that so like say I don't want

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
To drop several thousand dollars on whatever

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I can buy a Chromebook or well

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And also something we we really

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Always need to be aware of is that we're

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
In the United States we're in California

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Computers and being able to go pick one up

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Is kind of a part of our culture but you go

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
To many other countries throughout the

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
World and computers are

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Not something that's just

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Assumed everybody has in fact

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
It's a rarity you don't see computers but I'm

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Never gonna buy a Chromebook for

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Like playing games that's never

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Gonna be a thought that ever goes through

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
My mind because if I'm gonna build a

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
PC to play games on whether it be

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Buying a laptop or something it's gonna have

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
The horse power to play games I'm not gonna

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Well I'll just buy a Chromebook

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Because it essentially does nothing without

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
You know Google you know

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
So I just

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I would never do that but

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
There's other people that Chromebooks are

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
A good option like for example I have a

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Co-worker that is retiring and she

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Wants a computer that can she can check email

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
And do Facebook and I'm like

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Chromebook is your way to go because

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
That's all that shit does

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
That was that was my mom when she was still

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
With us is that she just

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Wanted to do email and she wanted to

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Be able to look at her kids on Facebook

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
That's all she yeah and so for that I mean

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And she's like well maybe I should get a Mac

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Even email I feel like is

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Starting to fade away it doesn't seem

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Like email is going away in favor of things like

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I hate to say it Facebook Messenger but Facebook

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Messenger is huge but I also see

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Other I feel like things like Telegram

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And some of those are starting to gain a lot of speed too

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Well I don't think

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Email is not going anywhere but

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I think that

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You know for there's a market

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Physical mail is not going anywhere either

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But like the only thing that I welcome

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Getting in the physical mail anymore is

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Packages like stuff I bought on the internet

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That's it it's true yeah

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
But I don't know

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I just think that it's not going to be

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
They want you to

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Be convinced that this is going to be the next

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Big thing because they want the investors

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
To be excited about it and they want

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
People to be excited about so they jump into

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It but let's just see what it actually

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Is by the time it actually comes

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Out and how wonderful it is because

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
If you may remember not that long ago

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
When they were talking about the PlayStation

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
3 or I think it was the PlayStation 3

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
That it was going to be you know

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
1080p

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Full native 1080p 120

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Frames per second it's just going to be this

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Monster of a system that was going to be super

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It just it fucking wasn't so it's like

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
The same thing with

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
They overhype everything

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And then it comes out and then they have to lower their

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Lower your expectations to what it actually

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Can do so let's just wait and see what

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It can actually do before we

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
You know start predicting where the industry

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Is going because who gives a shit where the industry

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Is going we're just going to go with it

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Dialing back to Final Fantasy 6 a little bit

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Since that was what this is originally about

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I would love to see this game remade

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Well it has been Loki

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Well I meant remade like

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I meant remade in sense like Final Fantasy 7

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Is being remade type of thing

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Oh you want to see it but I don't know if it would

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I don't know if you can ever like

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Lightning strike twice with

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
The Final Fantasy 6 like you know obviously

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
The recent mobile

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Support they did was not good

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Or I would even take

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
A new Final Fantasy game

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Done in the style of Final Fantasy 6

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
We don't need 3D polygons

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
In like real time battles and shit like that

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Just you know drop

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Down because that doesn't cost

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
As much to develop

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Didn't they kind of do that with the Final Fantasy 15

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Damn it I can't remember the name of it

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
But it was basically like it was like a

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Earlier throwback

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Well they also did the after years for Final Fantasy 4

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So that was like that

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And if you got that on the WiiWare it was like

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
It was like you were playing Final Fantasy 2

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Slash 4 like graphics

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
There was some good comments so I want to make sure

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I got a couple other of these because

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
ActDeft in our chatroom said that eventually

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And I lost the original comment but he had made the point

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
That oh yeah games eventually will fall

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
In the public domain too

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
So after so many years

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
You're not really pirating the game anymore

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Because it's in the public domain

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
But it doesn't get really complicated though

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Unfortunately the game was made in Japan

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
But I guess since it was put out in the US

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
As Final Fantasy 3 I guess there's

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
A certain term

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
But you can thank Disney for continuing to

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Push that term back

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Because Mickey Mouse

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Mickey Mouse should have been public domain by now

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
But he's not

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
So kind of interesting how that all works

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Well it's because he's also their trademark

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
So you got trademark issues too

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
But Bobby Blackwolf

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Pointing out the new Dragon Quest

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Does that if you'd played that on 3DS

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
It had the top screen and bottom screen

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And I think with the whole

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Switch port they're doing something with that too

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Obviously it's not top screen and bottom screen but like a button

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
To switch between the two

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So some people do dig their retro modes

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Dragon Quest is a pretty good game as well

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
So

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah Questbuster says

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I wanted that 16 bit Final Fantasy

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
13 that Square Enix made

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
A trailer of to explain the story

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
TigerClawnChat says

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Some games will get in the public domain

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
But some of the more bigger ones they will continue to make games

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
For those as long as they are around

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
You know I'm almost starting to feel like about

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Video game remakes though kind of finishing up

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
That thought as I am some of the movie remakes

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Like some of them can be really good

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
But a lot of them

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Are not good and something like okay like the

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Borderlands remaster where they just basically

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Went in and put out

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
4k textures and didn't really change the game

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I would consider that more like a

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Criterion collection

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Release of an old movie

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
They're not trying to redo the movie

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It's not a remake it's a remaster

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Exactly

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
They did change a few things

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
A lot of video game remakes are kind of

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Not Resident Evil 2 though

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
That was freaking amazing

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
There's a few diamonds in the rough and I liked

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Blaster Master Zero even though other people

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Had their problem with it and I would say not

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Every movie remake was bad

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Although most of them are I'm trying to think of a good

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Movie remake

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
The new stars born was incredible

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
So you know

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
It's not Barbara

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Or Judy Garland

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I kind of thought it was better

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
There were as many motorcycle accidents in it as there

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Was in the previous version

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
There's no way I'm going to answer that question

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I actually think that the Total Recall remake

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Which is actually I think off the original

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Story

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Honestly it's arguably a better

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Movie than the Arnold one

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Even if it doesn't have the cult following

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
The original one did

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Not Spielberg

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Miniseries, Stephen King

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Miniseries, some people swear that the

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Miniseries they did on The Shining is actually better than

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
The movie because it was more faithful to the book

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Stephen King actually signed off on

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
The Shining

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Well Stephen King also signed off on the end of

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
The Mist and that was a poor decision

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
That's true too

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
But then they made The Mist a TV show

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Isn't The Mist a TV show now I think

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I thought I heard something about

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Not that I watch TV anyway

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I know I so rarely do anymore these days

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And then what else

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Every Animal Crossing new game has been good

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
The It, some people

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The It

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
It's just It

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Versus the miniseries

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
It's not Tim Curry

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I don't mean to

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Go down this rabbit hole

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I don't mean to go down this rabbit hole of remakes

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Someday when computer technology

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Is good enough

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
To resurrect

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
You know

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Movie actor Tim Curry

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
He's not dead

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I understand he's not dead but

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
To the point where mobility is limited

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Mobility is you know

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
He's not what he used to be unfortunately

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But he's a national treasure

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
International treasure

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I want the new Dune to be good

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Because I saw the

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Four hour original

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Because I knew someone who

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Remember we talked about Betamaxes earlier

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Someone had it taped on Betamax

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Funny enough Questbuster and chat

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Is talking exactly about the Dune thing right now

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Sci-fi did their own Dune series

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And it was actually pretty good

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
The series is good but it lacks the epic music of Tangerine Dream

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
That was in the movie

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
That's how some people feel about Legend

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
To tie it back to Tim Curry

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Legend

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I was telling you actually somebody on the phone

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
On this show

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
On this show

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
On this show

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

I will always play

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Order of Magic was also done by Jon Pappadou

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Well, we tried to get everything set up

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Dan couldn't find the crap we needed

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
but then we decided

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
we might be playing something on the Saturn instead

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
because we want to go through

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
all of our Konami collections

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
and just sit and bore the shit out of people with Parodius

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
and Salamander

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
and maybe some weird RPGs

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
that we have to have a translation FAQ for

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
that we're going to speak our own dialogue for

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
like View 10 a game

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Hi, in another universe I turn into a car

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
if everyone has seen the Utena movie

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
that must be the awesome universe

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Utena turns into

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
spoiler, she turns into a pink Batmobile

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
and she and Anthe drive off through the city

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
it's weird

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
and then they're naked on the chassis

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
of the pink Batmobile

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
as they drive off into their lesbian sunset

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
that is literally the ending of the Utena movie

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
okay

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
right?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
okay

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
right?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
ah, jeez

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
but anyway, we've been kind of on this

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
old Konami shooter kick

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
so that's kind of what we're going to do

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
we watched through different playthroughs of Parodius

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
and the collection that we

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
no, it's not the collection we have

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
the PSP version

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
is the one where they replaced

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
um

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
crap, what song was it?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
it was like a pop song that was in the

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
pattern version and they switched it out

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
for a remix of

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Brilliant to You

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
because we were trying to figure out which one had Brilliant to You in it

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
and it was

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I think Ocean Berry Parodius

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
for the PSP

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
so

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
anyway

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Bright Man says a pink lesbian Batmobile

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
that's not something I thought I would hear about

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
have you heard this show?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
well, we've done it all

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
now we have pink Batmobile lesbians

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
show Michelle

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
or Tamar

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
anyway

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
so that's really been about the

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
extent of us making plans

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and just getting shit together

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Dan kept thinking we wanted to play

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
on the CRT, I'm like why would we play

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Saturn on CRT when it's

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
you know

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
HDMI

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
whatevs!

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
um, I played not a lot

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
of stuff this week but I did start off the

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
week by trying to transcribe more

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
edits I was missing off of my DDR machine

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
and I got through 18 of them

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
before I decided to try to transfer

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
them to my system and

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
you see the problem is I'm using a brand new

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
editing tool

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I used to use one called DDR Edit Max

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
and it's old, it only ran

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
on XP and out of

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Visual Basic 6

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
runtime

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
which doesn't work in

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Windows 10, so I found

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
thanks to the Wayback Machine

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
DDR Edit Max 2

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
that actually does work

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
but

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
there's a problem is that something's

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
wrong with the edit

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
files themselves and

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
the machine does not recognize them

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
or doesn't recognize most of them

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
it recognized one of them

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
and I don't know why one works

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and the rest don't

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
so I've been

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
digging through them through

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
hex editors going back to my

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
edit FAQ that thank god I made

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
a long ass time ago because

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
it's actually helped me trying to read this shit

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
which I found out a bunch of new stuff

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
with it as well and I've been

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
updating it as I go but I

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
still haven't gotten any of it to work correctly

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
because something is fucked up

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
in the header and I'm not sure what

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I need to figure out how to fix it

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
because there's some really awesome edits

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I want to play so that was

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
about most of my week

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
and then I decided

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
to check

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
to see how much well because I

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
saw the Labo

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
VR kits coming out this

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
following week so I was like okay well

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
it seems so soon like

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
yeah let's see how much the other

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Labo kits are because I know they're coming down in prices

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and stuff so I found the robot kit for

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
$29.99

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
it actually ended up getting I think for $25

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
after I think I had a

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
coupon or something on there but

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
$25 for the robot kit I was like

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
can't beat it for that price that's kind of worth it

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
so I went ahead and picked that up

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
so I've been building that I started that today

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and then I pre-ordered

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
the VR kit that will be coming next week

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
because my kids like

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
playing with the VR stuff and I hate

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
having to set up the Playstation VR for them

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
all the time so I was like well I'll just

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
build this and they can shove their

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
head in the butt of a bird

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
so

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
so we'll be doing that

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and then

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
what else I played a little bit of Ingress

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
today just because I was

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
because I was

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
trying to report a

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
pokestop for being in the wrong

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
spot and

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
you can't do that in Pokemon Go and

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
apparently I can't do it in Ingress either but

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
you have to download Scanner Redacted and you can still do it

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
there which is the 1.0

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
because they had it was

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
the arcade creek trail and they had the

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
lizard marked there which there is a lizard

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
it's a big cement lizard but it was

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
several like tens of feet

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
away from where it actually is

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
it's in a completely wrong spot so

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I was going to report it

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
but I did

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Download the Scanner Redacted app and since you made

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
your account before Prime

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
you can still now if you're a brand new agent

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
you can't use Scanner Redacted because

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
they're trying to prevent people making new accounts

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
to spoof and things but since you had an existing account

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
you can do it yeah so

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I may get around to that or I just may not

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
give a shit but

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
it was in the right spot at one

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
time so it's like it got moved I don't know

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
how that's shenanigans

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
it's awfully

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
conveniently close to a

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
mobile home park where maybe someone's

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
living in and

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
you know couch portaling

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
send me info on that portal we'll get it fixed

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
but anyway so yeah I did that and

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I played Pokemon Go a little bit because

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
yeah so I'm going

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
to be I wanted to and like

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I must have been half asleep last night when

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I decided to order I ordered another

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
docking station for my

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
switch because I was like I want to take it apart

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
and I'm going to use this to build

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
and then of course my dumb brain today

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
is like you idiot you can't

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
you can't hack that apart to make it

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
allow you to stream

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
from handheld mode because the damn thing's gonna

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
think it's docked and it's not going to work so

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
that's kind of the frustration

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
because I wanted to like actually

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
do some streaming from the

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
VR thing to show like what it looks like

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
but you can't because

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
fucking switch

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
can't stream in handheld mode

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
so

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
what are you going to do?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
So yeah

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I guess I'll just have to find something else to do instead

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
and play some Borderlands

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
alright yeah that's it

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
My gaming week so I actually

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
officiated my first wedding

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
yesterday so

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I do weddings now if you're curious

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
at least in California

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm sure it's probably not that hard to do in other states

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
but so that

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
took up a lot of my time this weekend however

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I have been playing some other games

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
including Beat Saber I

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
played a little bit this week because I had not

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
gotten around yet to the official volume

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
one DLC pack and they

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
put out that what's that

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
crab song whatever that April Fools

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
thing was like a year ago it was like this crab song

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
that they put in Beat Saber

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
that you can play

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I also like the coloring in it because they use

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
blue and green as the colors instead of the blue and red

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
that most songs do

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
so yeah that was fun I liked

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
playing that so I played a little bit of that

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and then I played some of the DLC songs because I downloaded that

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
because I have Beat Saber on PlayStation 4

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
so I was playing some of those songs and

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
you know just enjoying

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
expanding the original library of songs

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
not that the songs are bad but now

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
they're starting to sort them out a little bit too so like

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
instead of just having a big song list

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I have like official volume one

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
soundtrack add on

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
songs or whatever it's called and then like

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
DLC one and so on and so on

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
so yeah I've been playing that

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
and then I've been playing Final Fantasy 14

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
just a little bit kind of got sucked back into that

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
after the Stormblood story patch and for no

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
good reason I pushed my

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
White Mage all the way to level 70 so that's my

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
fourth job at max level behind

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Astrologian Bard and Red Mage

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
so now I have Astrologian Bard, Red Mage, White Mage all

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
at 70 no tank at 70 yet

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and I don't know if I'll bother taking a tank that high

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
because I'm not that big a fan of tanking

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
but I guess if anything I like Dark Knight

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
of the tanks but we'll see

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
so did you want to say something on?

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I actually just remembered the other

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
thing I was going to do for gaming is I'm going to go back to

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Star Trek Online. Oh yeah

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I'm going to cancel the wow and everything and go back to Star Trek Online

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I'd be curious how that game kind of

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
sizes up now compared to when it was first out

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
They've been incorporating more characters and

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
have from the TV series and

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
have the actors back

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
as voice actors. Oh that's cool.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
So I didn't mean to derail your segment

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
but I thought that since you're talking about MMOs

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
that might be curious too. That's not the first time.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And I do it to you too. Alright.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says oh speaking of Diablo 3

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Rob I sent you something on Switch. I apologize

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I haven't checked Diablo 3 on Switch in a long time

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
but I should probably get on that. It would be nice

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
to roll a season 16 character

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
but one more game that I played this week

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
that I think is kind of a big deal IDK

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I played Borderlands which you know

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
is not a game I've played. I've played it before

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
but I haven't played a lot of it

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
but I downloaded the remaster

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
because I had it on Steam

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
anyway, the original, and if you had

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
the original game of the year edition

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
which I'm sure a lot of people bought for like 5 or 10 bucks

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Yeah I just saw what was it

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
the pre-sequel and stuff was discounted

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I'm like oh I should buy the pre-sequel

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
and I looked at my library and I'm like oh I already have it

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
So I looked at my library

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
and now there's Borderlands GOTY

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
and then there was sure enough Borderlands GOTY

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Enhanced and I was like cool

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I downloaded the Enhanced one and

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
originally it wanted to set my configuration

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
for 1080p and I was like

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
no I know my video card can do better than that

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
it was doing ultra

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
settings at 1080p so I kicked it down to

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
high settings on 2K

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
obviously my video card's not quite

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
good enough to do full 4K but it's 2K

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
and that works. The game runs very smoothly

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
and it looks really good

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
on PC. The art

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
style of the, you know how Borderlands has the very

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
strong outlines in a lot of

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
the art that it does. It really pops

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
you know in that high resolution

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
It is funny though because you definitely

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
notice the parts of the game

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
that aren't in 2K or 4K

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
namely anything pre-rendered

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
so like the little introduction videos

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
so I've played through the intro of the game

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and I did the first boss or whatever

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Nine, what is it? Nine Tails?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
No Nine Toes

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
So I've killed Nine Toes and when it did

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
the whole like introduction

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
it suddenly switches to a video and you can

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
tell like there's like it looks

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
kind of a little more grainy and not

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
quite the same and I was like oh okay

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
but you know obviously that's a very minor

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
complaint it's not even really a complaint

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
because the game is how old but it's

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
fun to explore it again and I feel

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
like in some ways I've gotten a little

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
better at shooters on the PC

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
and I think because I remember I used

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
to be very much like I only wanted to do

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
shooters with a controller because of

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
stuff like Halo that I you know

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
had grown up on or whatever but thanks

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
to things like Overwatch and other

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
shooters I've been playing on PC like I feel

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
very comfortable playing Borderlands on

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
PC with keyboard and mouse

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
so I remember how it was the opposite in Final Fantasy

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
11 where I played everything on a controller

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
including my macros as a healer

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Well you know in Final Fantasy 14

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
some people play controller on

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
computer and it's totally

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
like but that game was kind of built for

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
a controller not so much 11 a little bit

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
well no a little bit because it was on

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
the Playstation 2 in Japan and not everybody

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
had that you know yeah and

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
honestly for the longest time I was

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
strict to controller

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I mean Rob came

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and saw me play using my little shoulder buttons

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
for my macros and yeah it works but

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I don't know it's kind of funny

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
how people kind of turn around on what they play on

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It does yeah yeah um let's see

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I think

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Borderlands still has an aim assist on

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
PC which helped me that is

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
true the aim assist is still there obviously

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I'm using it no shame in that I

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
the nine toes guy killed me once

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
because he has two little ads

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
or whatever and so I had to do him

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
do that fight does he have nine toes

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
apparently he has nine toes and three balls

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
that's what the intro says there's a lot of

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
there's a lot of straight

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
bro humor in the game

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
in Borderlands that I just

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
kind of go whatever

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I find it more questionable if he had

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
a camel toe so

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
anyway but whatever I think the

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
game is it's fun to play I like

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
the questing system feels like an MMO

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
really so it's kind of yeah it's fun

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
so I'll probably play some more of it I want to play

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
some more of it and see you know where the story goes

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
and I because I've never

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
really touched the second game and you know

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
if I really enjoy it maybe I'll even buy the

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
third game when it comes out so

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I'm definitely buying the third game but I want to let

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
y'all know I finally am getting around and I played

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
a little bit of Borderlands before but it was just like I'm terrible

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
at shooters this is bad but I don't know

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I'm approaching this with some

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
more years of gaming of different types

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
under my belt and I'm kind of like into it right now

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
and it looks very nice with the enhanced version

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
so um kudos

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
so far so

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Bobby Blackwell says will you buy the third

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
game in September or in April

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
um I'm not going to buy the third game unless

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I actually make it through the first two

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
isn't that fair? Three

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
well I,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
do you have to play pre-sequel? Pre-sequel's

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
pretty fun Is it? Alright

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
well then I guess I have three to play so

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I don't know I haven't played

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
pre-sequel yet

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
well let's I guess we need to get into the

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
news a little bit and talk about why Bobby

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
is asking that question uh real quick

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
this is where I usually plug our social media

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
so follow us on Twitter slash

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
or excuse me at OLR we're also on

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
radio we are no longer on Google Plus

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Google Plus is officially dead rest

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
in peace uh alright let's

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
get to the news starting off with

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
the big decision when to buy Borderlands

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
right? Yeah so Borderlands

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
uh they did a second because you may remember

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
the original announcement that they did at PAX East

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
they had more details coming

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
you know next week

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
and so the more details that were coming

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
it's going to be

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
an exclusive

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
game to the Epic Games Store for six months

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
it's going to be launching September 13th

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
and then you'll be able to buy it elsewhere

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
April 2020

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
and it's also going to be out on

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and of course

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
a lot of people aren't very happy about this

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
mainly because the Epic Store

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
is very bare bones

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and is missing a lot of the things

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
that you would expect

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
from a storefront including you know being able

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
to um

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
put stuff in a shopping cart

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
and you know I don't even know

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
do they have friends list? I mean they have friends list

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
but they don't have a lot of most of

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
the bare modes things I would say

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
it is bare bones but also I would

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
say it's it's progressed since

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
it first came out they're still updating it

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
and who knows where we're going to be in September

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
September's still a ways out

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
so of course since quickly though

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I can understand the frustration though where it's like

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I have Borderlands 1 and 2 on

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Steam and now I'm going to have to go

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
to this store to get Borderlands 3

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
and it's you know going to be a little bit different

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
of course tell that to all the Bayonetta

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
fans right?

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I have to buy a Wii U or a

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Switch if I want to play Bayonetta 2

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
even if I play the first Bayonetta

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Xbox 360 or wherever

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
the multitude of places where the first Bayonetta came out

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
it's on PC now

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
not not Bayonetta 2

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
the first Bayonetta is but not Bayonetta 2

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
gotta get a Switch

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
because the Epic Games Store is still so bare bones

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
that there is no way to leave reviews

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
on any game there

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
people have turned to Steam to go

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
express their frustrations by review

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
bombing of course the other Borderlands

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
games and you know Steam is very

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
fond of that happening so

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
yeah

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Steam is really not getting a lot of good news

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
with this because not only do they not get the game

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
but then now all the users are going to

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
shit on the store for Borderlands

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
1 and 2 right

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
so that sucks but I know that

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
they had talked about ways to

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
prevent review bombing so we'll see

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
how that ends up working out but

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I mean I don't know like

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
yeah it's annoying

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
that the only thing Epic's doing

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
right now seems like to try to drive

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
people to their platform well a couple things

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I guess they're lowering the price

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
which is why or the cut that they

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
take which is why these big game companies are

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
kind of going their way because I'm sure they're

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
getting money thrown at them

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
plus they're also getting more

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
of more profit off of everything

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
so of course they want to make as much

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
money as possible

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I think originally the plan was more

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
to try to drive you know indies to their

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
platform but

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
whatever it is what it is

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the free games they give away

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
is nothing to buy

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
no that's nice and it's

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
to me it's kind of like you play

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
and stuff like that or like even

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
EA services

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Origin you just have to have

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
it for certain games whether you like

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
it or not and I think this is kind of like this

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
if I want to play this game on PC at launch

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I just have to

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I already have Epic installed so it's not a big deal

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
to be honest I have Origin

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
you know love it or hate it

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
which it's come a long way but I

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
have Origin installed because that was the only

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
way I was going to be able to play Mass Effect Andromeda

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
on PC

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
as well as got a sweet deal

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
on Titanfall 2

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
you know there's just there's certain things that

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
you can only get on Origin that have to do with

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
EA BioWare and that type of thing

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Can't you put like external games into it?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
You have to have Origin for Apex

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Can't you put external games into your Steam library

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
anyways because I thought they have ways to launch them

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
so I mean I'm sure that if this

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
isn't like any other game out there

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
you can have an executable that's straight

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
you don't have to launch it through the Epic

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
storefront I'm pretty sure

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
that you can just have an executable shortcut or something

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
The way that it works for

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Origin is that it will

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
open when you have the link to

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
the game it will open

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Origin and then open the game

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
but run it through Steam so that you can do your

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
screenshots and everything through the Steam platform

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Oh wow. Because that's how

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
basically how I got all of my stuff

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
for my little effect which I've kind of let

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
fall to the wayside

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Well the game's been out a long time now you've probably screen capped almost everything you can

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I've had drama that's kept

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
me from posting and being sick and

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
family members dying and stuff

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
speaking of Mass Effect not to like

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
completely 180 this conversation but I noticed

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Alan was like he was

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
reinstalling Mass Effect the other night and I'm like what's going on

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
he's like there's some new mod that came out that I want to check

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
out so I think they have like another new

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
graphics mod or something and so

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
now I see him because you know remember

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Alan will get obsessed with one

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
game at a time. One game at a

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
time and um

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
It's nice to be able to have that kind of restraint

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I don't have that kind of restraint

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I know he's the complete polar opposite

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
so like Dark Souls has been his thing for a long time

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Overwatch he still kind of plays off and on

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
this is the one that surprised me do you know what game

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
has been like his late like it's all he's been playing

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
lately? Dead Island

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
of like all the games in the universe

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
The first one? Yeah

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I think it's a combination of the

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
series but mostly the first one

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
like that's what he's kind of been

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
into lately so yeah

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I mean not to knock that game I know some of y'all are big

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
fans. By the way what ever happened

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
to Dead Island 2? Wasn't that like supposed to be out by now?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Uh I think Dead Island

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
2 already came out. No I don't think it ever did

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
there was like a Dead Island like

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
expansion for the

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
first game or something it was just built on the

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
first game. It still says it's upcoming on

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
wiki. Yeah they showed a trailer for Dead Island

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
2 like in 2014. Yeah I was like

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I was like the last time I went to E3

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Oh yeah. I saw that Dead Island 2 too.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That was a long time ago right?

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Well there's a rumor on

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
this E3

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
like thing about with some pre-alpha footage

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
on it saying that

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
it's supposed to

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
the release date is going to be announced at E3

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Well then they

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
have like a what was the other dead game

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
there was another dead bot not Dead by Dawn

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
but like there was a

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
oh like not a dead island but like a dead

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
free running game I can't remember the hell it's called

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
but they had like a couple sequels of that

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I thought that was maybe

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I don't know maybe

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
stop making zombie games because

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I can't tell them apart okay?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Maybe you should stop doing that. I did not mean to

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
180 the conversation but we got on a tangent train

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
as we sometimes do. Let's have the

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
the chat brings back. Act F says

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Dead Island Riptide no that was kind of that was

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
still it was like the first game

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
like after bit because you

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
just started at level 40 or you could import

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
characters to the first game it wasn't a true sequel

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Dead Island Riptide was not the true sequel but

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
good point

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
The Break Man says is Dead Island any good

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
and Quest Buster says

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
it's good now it was pretty broken on release

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
and that's pretty much everything I've heard too and knowing Alan

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
he's probably modded the fuck out of the game

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I'll bet you anything what got him on it there's probably

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
some graphic mod for the game

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
that got him into it

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Maybe he should join up with Minecraft

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Knowing Alan as well as I do

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
So YYR

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
is kind of fed up a little bit here

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
saying I'm just fed up with apps

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
and launchers I basically refuse to

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
play anything that would require me to download

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
an app or get another launcher

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I have enough accounts I don't want anymore

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
since I play mostly niche stuff

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I haven't really been affected by any of this yet

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
but if someone releases their game on the epic store

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
good for them but I'll never play it

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Um

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Isn't it I might be wrong I don't to be

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
honest I've never bought anything on the epic

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
store I have a nice collection of the free

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
stuff and fortnite that's about it

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
so I mean at least I bought things

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I haven't bought anything yet on the epic

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
store personally but

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
do you

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
because we were just kind of talking about the

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
launcher loading in the background

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
if I get a game like

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
say super meat boy that I got for free

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
or whatever on the epic game store

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
if I just run that executable

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
doesn't it not go through the store

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
like maybe you don't have to use launcher I don't know

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I can't remember I have it just I had it already

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
on there when I was trying out

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
development in unreal engine so

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I already have it on there

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
for that um

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
and but I right now it's mainly

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
now it's just to grab the free

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
game of every couple weeks or whatever

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
that they put out and Bobby's correcting

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
me it does still launch the epic game store in the

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
background alright fair enough it's probably

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
must check to make

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
sure you bought it or something I don't know yeah

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
so I mean whatever I've

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I haven't really purchased anything from

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
the epic game store I have looked at the new

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
game that they have from coffee scene studios

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I may pick up that one

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
um but

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
so far I haven't purchased anything

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
from there alright

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
well let's move on and talk about

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
um what's going on

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
with the switch online retro

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
service so um

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
switch online uh has

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
been adding more NES games every

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
month and um

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
uh some of the latest

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
games will be coming to the switch um in

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
April of 2019 on

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
the 10th so what next week I think yeah

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
about three days uh they've announced

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
the next series of games that's going to come out which includes

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
punch out

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
not the Mike Tyson punch out cause obviously

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
the licensing stuff is gone although

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I'm sure y'all heard about that tweet where Mike Tyson

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
was like why am I not in punch

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
out on this like I seriously don't

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I don't think Mike Tyson knows

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
that he was taken out

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
of punch out a long time ago I don't

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
think he knows about Mr. Dream shh don't tell him

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
don't tell him I don't know

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
anyway he might bite Mr. Dream's ear off

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
uh also coming out Star

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Soldier kind of a fun little shooter

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
and then Super Mario Brothers

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
The Lost Levels at least

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
that's what they're calling it here in the

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
US and so they actually are

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
giving it the little box you know that they kind

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
of created for Super Mario All-Stars

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
little square box but what's funny is

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
that when they showed the preview movie

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
they didn't bother to correct the title screen

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
or anything so when you launch it it's still just

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Super Mario Brothers 2

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
obviously the Japanese version of these releases

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
same thing punch out Star Soldier

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Super Mario Brothers 2 for them

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
but you know like if you launch

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
our Super Mario Brothers 2 in their

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Famicom online it says Super Mario Brothers

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
USA they changed the title screen

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
they didn't they didn't do that here

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
so

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
because they actually did get it released to

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Super Mario USA there later right

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
yeah so but anyway

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
that's not really the big news although it's certainly

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
a part of this as well as the the

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
question people might be asking is how long

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
is Nintendo going to keep going with this like

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
are they going to release every single NES game

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and which honestly would be doubtful

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
due to licensing

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
and you know especially when

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
third parties develop the game where does

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
the money go and all that stuff so

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
um apparently what's happening

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
over in Hong Kong some leaflets for the

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Switch online service were being distributed

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
and leaflets talk about what

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
the Switch online service includes because you know

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
they're trying to sell people on get your

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
you know online Nintendo subscription

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
so you can access the classic library

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
but apparently there's one little section with

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
fine print that says

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
eventually Nintendo will stop

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
adding new NES games to the

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
collection but obviously they're not

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
saying when or anything

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
like that but this it kind of already

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
has the internet riled up on oh

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
the Super Nintendo must be coming because

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
they're saying the Nintendo thing is ending

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
there's only a finite amount

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
of games on the Nintendo so eventually

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
yes it will end

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
and it could be

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
ending in three years

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
it doesn't mean it's going to end by the end

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
it's because we live in a world where people

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
are going to sue over the fact that Red Bull

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
doesn't give them wings so of course they have

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
to you know put the

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
put the disclaimer in there guess what

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
eventually we're not going to be adding

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
this was in Hong Kong I don't know if Hong Kong

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
has a sue happy culture like we have here

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
but but I get what you're saying

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
of course I get what you're saying you have to

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
you have to say the obvious things like

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
that because you're right people will sue well I've been paying

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
money every month where's my new games class

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
action lawsuit yeah

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
yeah anyway uh

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
dark to see in chat says well I assume they would

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
they were not going to end it like next month

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
but obviously they won't keep it going forever

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
honestly they would have made a lot more money if they

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
just uh virtual console

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
you think huh I know

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
well now especially that they just gave away a year

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
free with Amazon Prime obviously

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Twitch and Amazon must be kicking them some money

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
but it's interesting they could have made a lot

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
more money a lot more

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
way all they just

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
seem happy I don't have to drop

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
the drop the cost

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
of the games down like you know cut down the amount

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
that they were charging for those because eight dollars

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
for a Super Nintendo game is just ridiculous but

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
cut that down to a point that it is like

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
very like four ninety

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
nine or something like that or you know

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
cut it down to where it's just like impulse by

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
people be eating that shit up

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
so Questbuster in chat says there's around

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
seven hundred or thirty officially licensed game

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
on the NES but

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I mean you're assuming they're going to

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I mean I don't think you specifically are assuming but like

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
they're not going to release all seven hundred thirty games

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
they're just not like the licensing on

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
too many games is too complicated for example

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
by Konami not going to come out

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
not going to happen because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
licensing now is complicated

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I don't think Konami owns the license anymore

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
they haven't for some time either EA has

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
or somebody else has it and that

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I mean miracles happen because they did

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
release that arcade game on 360

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
when people didn't think that would happen but it's going to be

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
much harder for like a classic thing

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
that Nintendo kind of oversees for that to happen

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I would say things like the

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Guardian Legend as much as Dark

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Sakura and myself and many of you stand that

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
game hard I just don't see that game

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
coming out because the license it's too complicated

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
who owns that game now? I think we figured

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
it out. Whoever owns

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Bode Brund

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
well Bode Brund only published it

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
it's compile

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
we figured out the rights in the previous episode

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
it's so far like four times removed

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
now at this point and then I think I cried

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
yeah I might have cried

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
but you know again

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
miracles happen but they're just

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
not going to jump through hoops

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
for all seven hundred thirty games because

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
also let's be real some of them were pretty bad

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
some of those games were pretty bad

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
so maybe we don't need

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
all seven hundred and thirty but

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
yeah I think you know it's inevitable this is

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
going to end but I would say it's still going to be going at least

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
for a year I think the

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
thought is that you know as far as a Super

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Nintendo online or something that does

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
seem like a very logical kind of next

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
step although

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
you know Loki to kind of build on your point

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
maybe they're going to have

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
the NES library be

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Nesflix style

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
but maybe the Super Nintendo games

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
they plan to do piecemeal maybe

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
we're all assuming they'll be

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
assuming or did they say in

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
the earliest they did say in the

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
earliest press releases

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
that there would be Super Nintendo games didn't they

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
and the earliest earliest

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
materials about this online service

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I'm trying to remember that far back

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
and they seem to remember that might have been a

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I don't need

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
the Super Nintendo games to come out

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
because I have a Super SNES

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Bobby's confirming what I just said they did say the earliest

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
ones absolutely did say that

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
well that's cool but I don't need it because

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
you only sold me your systems

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
you know you sold me that stuff already so

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
obviously I already have it and modded it

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
you know

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
SNES classic yeah exactly so I

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
don't need your you know extra

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
stuff Bobby points out

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
the early ones didn't even mention NES

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
games they only mentioned Super Nintendo games

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
so it would be interesting if they started

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
to dial back from that now but I kind of I don't think

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
they will I think most people kind of figure that

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
maybe when this

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
new Switch comes out or whatever they'll roll

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
out if rumors are true they'll

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
roll out the matching Super Nintendo library to

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
go with it who knows but we'll see

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
anyway that's to assume that the

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Switch Online stays legal

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
right Narsakra I guess there's some interesting legal

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
things going on right there is that

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
basically in the UK the

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
competition and markets authority

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
has opened an investigation against Microsoft

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Nintendo and Sony to check on

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
their online service practices to see

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
if they violate a consumer protection law

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
consumer law is a lot

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
more of a big thing

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I guess in

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Europe Australia

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
those general areas

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
but basically

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
they want to see if it's violating

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
those aspects of their consumer law they want to know

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
the auto renewal policies are fair

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
how easy it is to get a refund

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
or cancel it and whether or not the terms

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
of services

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
take more power out of the

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
customer's hand and put it into

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
the companies so basically

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
they want to make sure the laws are fair and

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
equal to both company and

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
consumer it's

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
actually part of a response to

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
a quote super complaint

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
on a loyalty penalty

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
which is basically the tendency for

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
some of the companies to punish

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
long standing customers by

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
making it difficult or

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
expensive to leave

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and so they're

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
they said the investigation just started but they may

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
only take enforcement action

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
if they believe the companies are not being fair

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
you know

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
the biggest things that have indicated

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
this is becoming a problem is that Sony raised

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
prices for Playstation Plus

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
that there is

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I mean just kind of like we were saying that there's no

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
guarantee that you're going to get

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
the same number of free

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
games or perks for

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
the cost that you're paying for it

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
and of course there is

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
auto renewal

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
you know for example

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
like what's going on now

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
with the Switch promotion for Twitch Prime

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
you have to

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
turn the auto renewal off after your time

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
period is up or you're going to get charged

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
and well

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
it's interesting because you know this is UK

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
law so a lot of our normal ways of

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
thinking don't really apply

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
necessarily but like I know this is a super

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
common tactic in the US like

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
when it comes to let's say Spotify

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I'll pick on Spotify you get 99

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
cents for a month of Spotify right

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
but the whole trick is now they get your credit

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
card number they're going to auto bill you

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
unless you like turn it off

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
and heck there's tons of iPhone

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and Android apps that do this too right they'll give away

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
a 7 day

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
preview of like the sleep

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
app that I use we'll do like a 7 day

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
preview of their mode but then

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
if you don't turn it off it will do an auto

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
renew so like I feel like in our

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
culture that's a thing like you got

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
it like we all know that's a gotcha

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
tactic in a lot of different places

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
right or a gym membership that's another

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
big one sign up for a gym membership

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
for 5 bucks but then after

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
30 days oh it's going to be the full you know

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
$50 a month or whatever it is right

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
but um yeah

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
it's the fact that it's UK law

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I don't I can't put myself into the same

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
like shoes or whatever

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
so but some of our chatters think there

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
might be something here uh break man in chat says by

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
British laws I think they have a chance

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I think Microsoft and Sony will lose this

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
but I don't know how it will affect us in America

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
well and I will tell you one thing too

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
just with some other companies

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
like for example with these

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
increased stringency of

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
encryption requirements and

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
uh customer control over

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
their personal online data

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
um because they became so

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
much stringent um overseas

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
that American companies are actually now

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
following suit to match those so that they don't have

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
to worry about what

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
are we doing different here what are we doing different

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
there you know it's

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
going to be universal it's why when you go on to all

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
these different websites now there's a huge

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
fucking thing that says by using

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
this website you agree to use cookies

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
here's our cookie policy that's because of

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
something that happened in the UK not here

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
so but we all

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
kind of get it too because

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
in the world wide web

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
you know it kind of has to apply

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
they set the bar at the most

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
stringent standard and then the rest of us kind of see

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
the effects of that exactly yeah

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I think the auto renewal you know it's interesting because you know

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
it's a like when you get your free

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
PlayStation Plus games let's say

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
if you don't renew

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and you're at the mercy of

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Sony and everything I'm saying could apply

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
to Microsoft or I'm not picking on

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Sony I'm just using them as an example

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
but um you know if you don't renew

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
um you don't get to play

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
those games anymore that you got for

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
free and that's part of the agreement but

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
you're kind of at the mercy of Sony

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
could kind of kick up the price of that

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
at any time they want to

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
well the same thing goes for Spotify subscription

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
or Pandora or Apple Music

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
it really is quite literally the same

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
thing it's just for games instead of listening

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
to music you know

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
it's really

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
no different I mean you know

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Pandora could bump up their price or Spotify

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
could bump up their price and it's really

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
mean

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
it's like that ongoing

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
capitalist inflation cycle

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
where everything else increases

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
but your money does not so

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
it's all that

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Akuma JP in chat says in Japan

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
we're trying to get rid of auto-subscribe

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
and fees for unsubscribe

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I can't even believe there'd be like

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
fees for unsubscribing you know what I kind

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
of think is that I

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
the thing that frustrates me is that like to

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
get to unsubscribe from some

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
things you have to like call

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
in and the thing is only

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
open between like 9 am and 5

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
pm when a lot of people are working or whatever

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
so sometimes it's like really hard

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
to like cancel something because you can only

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
do it over the phone even though you can sign up for it

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
online so I kind of think

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and I thought I heard something about the rules

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
moving this way or whatever is

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
that if you sign up for something

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
online you ought to be able to

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
cancel online as well

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
you shouldn't be able to sign up

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and then not

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
like cancel the same way you signed

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
up they should only have cancellation

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
cancellation over the phone is the only option

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
if subscribing over the phone is the only

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
option that's the thing that I kind of disagree with

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
but I thought I heard something about laws

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
we're looking into that as well

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
so YYR in chat

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
says where are there fees for unsubscribing

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
it could be another part

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
you know Akuma JP is commenting from Japan

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
so maybe it's just not something we

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
have here but

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
well I have heard of things like early

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
termination agreements like cell phones

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
you sign up for a year

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and then mortgages prepayment penalties

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
sure or

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
again

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
gyms right for some

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
deals you have to sign up for a year

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
and if you break it early you get a penalty

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
so but I get

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
that that's kind of you know

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
maybe we kind of sit here

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
going oh well doesn't everybody

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
know that but you know certain cultures

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
may have a different approach and I think

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
that's also what you're seeing here is that the UK

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
is starting to look at some things that maybe

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
we've just kind of come to accept as normal

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
in our culture and going huh should that

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
really be the way I don't know

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
so anyway

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
alright Sia Tabiri in chat

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
says Verizon will never let the

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
government stop that and Amazon

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
or Act Deft points out Amazon

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
used to have a cancellation fee for monthly

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
prime subscribers but they got rid

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
of that and then

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
the break man says

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
rollover contracts are a big no-no

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
in the UK as of the 2015 law

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
very interesting how all these

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
as the world gets more and more closer

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
together through the internet

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
all these laws in different places

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
kind of set different tones very interesting

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
anyway it's always about

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
consumer advocacy though that's very important

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
well let's move on for the sake of time

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
we're gonna go to our next topic Loki

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
yeah so this is kind of neat

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
so apparently Microsoft is rolling

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
the Xbox or they're giving you an

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
option to

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
have basically Xbox Live and Game Pass

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
as one big subscription

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
so apparently the plan

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
is to merge them into a $15

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
per month subscription called Xbox Game

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Pass Ultimate

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
that'll basically give you both of those

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
services

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
at one cost now

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
apparently the annual of course

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
live gold membership is

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
$60 and 12 months of Game Pass is

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
$120 so that still

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
works out to $180 per year

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
so you're not really saving any money

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
in that way

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
but maybe $15

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
a month they're kind of

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
poising it in a way that

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
like hey you pay like 12 bucks a month

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
for Netflix or whatever and

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
it's not much more so

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
maybe that's how they're trying

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
to sell it when I first read the article

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I was like oh this is what they're gonna start to move to

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
it's the only option I was like I've been saying this

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
they dropped the price down like maybe dropped it down

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
to like say $12.99 a month

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
or something like that and then

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
look see if you sign up for both

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
you save a little bit but

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
if you sign up for both

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
you pay for both that's not really much

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
of a deal

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
aren't you saying that only if you're paying for like live

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
on a year if you're paying live month to month you're still saving money

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
aren't you? Right but you're

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
always gonna be saving a month even just paying it for a

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
year so I

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
depends on how you want to do it

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
but I've been kind of sitting here going it's only

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
a matter of time before they just kind of

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
loop Game Pass and gold into the same thing

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
and this feels like a step in that direction

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
even though you know the finances and all that

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
get tricky and I do think

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I do think you know they're not gonna

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
be able to easily

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
convince people to do this if they can't get

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
the price of Game Pass as low as the price of gold

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
maybe this could be per month

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
and then if they have like a year

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
subscription to this it's even less

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
you know maybe they could do something like that

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I can understand that might be a little bit more

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
enticing because it's like oh hey you know I can get both these

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
services for less than I'm

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
you know paying for them

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
you month to month or something like that

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I just don't see the advantage of just

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
putting the prices together

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
it's if you're doing it month to month

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
and YYR points out if you're paying month to month

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
$15 a month is a 25% savings

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
over subscribing to both individually

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
but if you're paying $60 a year then it's the same

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
price unless they get rid of gold

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and just have that is this is your

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
only option I just I feel

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
like that you know I've been saying that for a long time

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
but maybe I know I know we're probably still

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
a little bit away from that but it'll be

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
very interesting to see I think at E3

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
what Microsoft does to push this further

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
are they saying this is going to be a thing at E3 or

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
sooner than that?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
The thought was that it's supposed to be

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
this is rumor right? It's supposed to be out

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
around the time when the Xbox

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
One S all digital edition is revealed

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
the thought is so

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
that I think is supposed to happen in a few weeks

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
so I guess we'll hear about this before

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
E3. Alright

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
it'll be interesting if all this stuff kind of comes out

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
before E3.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Moving on to what's been kind of

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
an interesting back and forth this week

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Kotaku ran a very

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
interesting piece on BioWare

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
that was really kind of a dragging and exposing

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
of some of the things that went on behind the scenes

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
at Anthem and the development

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
of Anthem and why Anthem may not

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
have turned out to be as

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
wonderful as it did. I'm not going to

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
really try to summarize the article if

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
you want to go read it you can. I would say

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
what I took away from this and maybe some of you in

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
the chat feel different but it really sounds

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
like they shifted

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
development in the last year

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and a half which I feel like we

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
hear about games all the time and I would say

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Final Fantasy XV was another one of those games

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
they just took the wheel and change

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
development in the last year and a half and

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
that's one of the reasons but it sounds like the biggest

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
reason Anthem had

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
problems was that they were forced to use the Frostbite

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
engine. It really sounds like that Frostbite

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
engine is not doing

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
BioWare any favors because it sounds

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
like I'm hearing a lot of the same

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
stuff out of what happened with

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Mass Effect Andromeda and so on. Anyway

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
but the complicated

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
stuff that happened. So Kotaku

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
put out their story and then like what like 15 minutes

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
after the fact BioWare

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
put out a thing that

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
basically was like you know

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
we don't agree and it was

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
very kind of generic and didn't really

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
speak specifically to the piece like they knew it was

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
coming but they didn't know specifically what was

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
in it and obviously if Kotaku had asked

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
BioWare to comment on it then they probably knew it was

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
coming. Well a secondary

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
piece kind of came out and

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Casey Hudson I believe wrote this piece

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
to something they sent to the whole

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
staff and of course emails

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
leaked from within what a shock

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and part of the letter says

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
what we found out of bounds

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
was the naming of specific developers

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
as targets for public criticism

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
because Kotaku does try to kind of

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
draw this line of this particular

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
individual came in and the development kind of

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
shifted so it did kind of I did

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
find it to be maybe finger pointing a little bit

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
but I didn't me personally I didn't see

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
it as a negative I kind of felt like

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
it might be that this guy saw this

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
machine that was rolling in like all these different

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
directions and had to put it on

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
course because it was spiraling out of control

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
or something. It sounds like there's a lot

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
of other issues going into this that are

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
more complex than a three hour show can handle

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
but what's also interesting

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
is Kotaku kind of notes at the end of the letter

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
they said that

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
they've heard from a number of developers

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
who work or have worked at beloved

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
AAA game studios with messages like

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
replace BioWare with my

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
studio and it's the same story

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and these are things like

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
crunch hours

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
just things

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
rivalries between studios that are in

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
different cities and like all

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
of these things are just like really really

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
messy and

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I don't know

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I think we all have been sitting here going

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
the gaming industry is going to

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
crack under some of this at some point

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and I don't know if it's the AAA

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
gaming that is going to be

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
looking at streaming as a primary thing that's

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
going to cause some things to crack or if

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
game developers do

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
cross that bridge and they

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
form a big game developer union

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I mean Hollywood has unions

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
they need to unionize like

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
major Hollywood has Screen

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Actors Guild, Writers Guild

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I mean right so

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
it would be

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
sorry now it's SAG-AFTRA

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
the Screen Actors and the Play Actors

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
and voice actors

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
are part of that as well which

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
have affected gaming in the past

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
and they have very specific rules

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
they have to follow so anyway

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I know that's a really kind of like controversial thing

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
but I think a lot of us are sitting here going

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
this whole like gaming crunch

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
time and the way games are being developed

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
it ain't working

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
y'all

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
and especially when you look at Anthem

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
some people are still defending

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Anthem and having a good time playing it

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and if you're having a good time with Anthem

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
go you, have fun

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
but I'm hearing some challenges about

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
what to do at the end of Anthem

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
and that it seems like it might be a little bit short sight

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I feel like this is a broken record

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
there's so many of these games that have been in development

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
for years, well we just joked about

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Dead Island 2 right?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
they probably haven't started the real development

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
on Dead Island 2 yet

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and they're going to crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
to get it out by the end of a fiscal year

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
so

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
anyway

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Kaijuto in chat says if they make a union

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I hope they name it the multiplayer

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
unions don't really get

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
very cute names

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
it'll probably be something very, very plain

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
let's see

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Act Def says

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
it's the people running the unions that

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
may be bad, unions aren't a bad thing

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and devs should definitely form one

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I don't know if the US has a similar law but in Mexico

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
you have the right to start a union

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
yeah you have the right to start a union, it's just

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
some companies will go so far

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
as to show you movies on your first day on why it's a bad idea

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
sometimes happens

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
so anyway

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
YYR in chat says and this is why I develop games

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
in my spare time and refuse to actually try to do it

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
for a living, sorry that you're all still waiting

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
for the new bungee ferret tossing but

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
it's not ready, and that's okay

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
YYR, when it's ready, it's ready

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and that's cool, I mean you got new baby

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and all that stuff, you're busy

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
it's fine, it's done

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
when it's done, right

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
just like we've gotten used to with a lot of blizzard games

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
just like we get used to with a lot of movies

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
it's done when it's done, right

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and that's a-ok

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
so

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
what was I gonna say with the whole

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
that whole tangent

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
about the development needing to take its time

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I lost my train of thought but

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I think, you know, it's gonna get worse

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
in some ways when the graphics

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
are pushed even further

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
as we move into the Playstation 5

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
and the Xbox, you know, whatever the next Xbox

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
is, I don't know, I feel like something's gonna give

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
here, it's just

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
this industry really can't

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
keep going the way it's

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
going and people

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
need to be held accountable for some of these really

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
fucking bad decisions that happen

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
because I, from my perspective and looking

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
at all this, I feel like truly

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
the bottom line in this whole

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
thing on why these games are not

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
turning out as good as they could be

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
is that they're being forced to use the Frostbite engine

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
because of some type of company

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
you know, because EA, EA's making

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
them do it, like the real enemy

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
in this whole thing between

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Mass Effect Andromeda and

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
maybe the next Dragon

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Age and Anthem

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
is the Frostbite engine

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
so, you know what, EA

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
it is time to let that engine

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
go and if your developers

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
want to make a game in Unity, fucking let them

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
fucking let them

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
why are you, why are you tied, like you're

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
gonna go like that, do you want that Frostbite

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
engine to be the hill that you

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
die on? Cause

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
so far it's not looking good

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Unless they have some sort of exclusivity

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
contract

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and they're stuck to it

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
What I'm saying is that that contract is garbage

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
and it's sinking those games and they need to

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
end that contract or whatever it is

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
But companies don't think that way, they think of

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
immediate and not long term

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Anyhow, let's move on

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
we got plenty more show to cover

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Alright, well, how about

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
loot boxes?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
How about no loot boxes?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Well, anyway

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
the Federal Trade Commission is going to

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
be holding a public workshop

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
on August 7th

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
2019 at the Constitution

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Center in Washington D.C.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
It will be webcast on the FTC's

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
website, but the workshop is called

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Inside the Game, Unlocking Consumer

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Issues Surrounding Loot Boxes

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
to quote

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Examine consumer protection issues

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
related to video game loot boxes

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
End game rewards players can

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
buy while playing a video game

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So this is what they want to do, they want to include

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
industry representatives, consumer advocates

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
trade associations, academics

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and government officials to discuss

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
these following things. So it's the

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
end game transition landscape

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
including origin and

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
evolution of loot boxes and their role

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
in game play in the digital marketplace

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
and this is actually bullet points from

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
their thing

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I was just going to say, Bobby is suggesting

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
this webcast should include one slide

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
with one word, don't

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Research examining

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
consumer behavior including child and adolescent

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
behavior in the context of video games

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
and digital transactions

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
and a discussion of consumer awareness

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
and education about end game digital

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
transactions including the mechanics, marketing

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
and financial commitments associated

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
with loot boxes

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
They're also saying

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
that the public can

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
submit their input on those

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
topics by emailing lootbox

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
workshop at

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
ftc.gov up until

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
June 7th of this year

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
So there you go, you can send your email

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
subject, loot boxes, message, don't

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
There's also

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
an online

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
comment, forum

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
comment, forum on

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
the FTC

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
website which I will be linking in chat

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Oh good!

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
But I'll just

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
go ahead and read it, it's regulations

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
dot gov slash

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
dot get question mark

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
D equals FTC

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
dash 2019 dash 0021

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I imagine most of you will just Google

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
it. Whatever, I just said it

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
because it was a short one, it wasn't all crazy

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
But yeah,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
basically you can

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
comment on the

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
document, there's nothing supporting right now

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
but the final

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
on that page is the document

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
for their

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
proposal on here for that workshop

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
and just taking a quick glance

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
over on it

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Why does everything from the FTC

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
have to be in Microsoft Word format?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So basically

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
yeah, it's a lot of what I said

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
but it talks about what a loot box

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
is, why people

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
have concerns about it

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
and basically some of the goals of it

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
and again, it's for the public

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I think it would be interesting to read this

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
and I might have to go in and do it later just to see how it's been

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
dumbed down for government officials

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
There's also a media contact listed in here

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Fun

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I imagine many of you are running

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
to the forum right now to simply post

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
don't

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Does anyone enjoy loot boxes?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Sometimes they're kind of fun if you're guaranteed

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
something nice

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I mean, I didn't mind it so much in

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
but I got

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
kind of tired of it

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I prefer being able to

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
win currency in my game

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
instead of getting a box for it

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
because that's 90% of

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I saved my points and got stuff

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
instead of just paying into them

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
What are the people who will pay into it to get the biggest and bestest?

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I like Enforza

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
where it's like you kind of have a wheel

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
that you spin but you'll get everything eventually

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
you know what I mean? If they want to

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
hand it out in a random order then fine

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I don't know, but anyway

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
AkumaJP in chat says

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
free loot box I don't mind

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
when it's free and you get them as a part

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
of playing through the game

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I think that's why a lot of people kind of give

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Overwatch some slack because

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Overwatch is kind of constantly handing out

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
free loot boxes between the holidays

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
and every time you level up and all that stuff

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
so I think that's why

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
some people kind of let that one slide

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I don't know. Anyway, moving on

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
we still have some more gaming stories for you guys

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Loki. Alright, well

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
something coming from yet another

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
battle royale game

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
but taking a page

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
out of Apex Legends

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Fortnite has decided to add reboot vans

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
which apparently is very similar to

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
the respawn

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
beacons that you have in Apex Legends

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
but of course now they're just

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
kind of skinning it for

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Fortnite so that's the new update that's going to be

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
coming very soon as well

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
to kind of mix up the game a little bit

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
and they kind of do something like

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
once a month anyways to kind of mix the game

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
up so I'm not surprised

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
that one game's curving

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
off of another game for

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
gameplay ideas

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It's kind of interesting now to see how like

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Fortnite that's been kind of leading things

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
it's kind of taken some cues now from

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Apex which has Apex overtaken

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Fortnite at this point or is it still kind of like a back

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
and forth? I've been watching the

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Twitch rankings that closely and I know that's just one

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
representation

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
of how the games might actually be doing

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
when it comes to the money they're making

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
and so forth so yeah but

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I mean I think it sounds interesting

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
I don't know I still just when it comes

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
to Fortnite like the building thing I just

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I've never been able to wrap my head

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
around how the building works like what

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
like strategically how you like do that

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
in Fortnite because Fortnite has like no

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
tutorial and so I've never really been able to

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
figure out how to use that effectively

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
You can do the creative mode which

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
you know what's funny and a half later because I went to go look at the

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Weezer thing at one point and like you know

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I yeah the creative mode's kind of fun I

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
like that but then when I I don't know

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
what the building in combat

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I don't know I haven't been able to wrap my head around that but the building

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
stuff isn't in Apex so

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
in some ways it's kind of easier I think

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
so yeah

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Bobby Blackwell says

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
in Fortnite when you shoot someone they turn into

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
a 10 story building yeah

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
or they they try to hide themselves inside

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
a 10 story building so that you can't shoot them

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I suppose alright anyway

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
one more story for you guys before we get to

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
the Classic Game of the Week and it has to do with some

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Best Buy leaks so who

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
knows if they're true or not but

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I know they're talking about some things

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I think a lot of us have been waiting for

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
well anyway apparently these were on

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
internal employee terminals

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
suggesting that Persona 5

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
was about to get a

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Switch release for 60 bucks

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
they didn't have a date on it

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
it just was in the system

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
you know how that goes somebody made a record in the system

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
you know how that goes remember Walmart Canada

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
and E3 last year yeah

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Metroid Prime Trilogy was

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
another one and I think a lot of us have been kind of

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
asking oh when is that going to come out on Switch so that

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
might actually be a thing but then

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
the other surprise in there was

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
The Legend of Zelda

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
A Link to the Past

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
wait a minute wait a minute

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
that's the Super Nintendo game

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
why would the Super Nintendo game

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
be released by itself

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
unless

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
either Nintendo does plan to

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
piecemeal this despite

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
their earlier marketing about

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
the NES and the Super Nintendo

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
being separate or could

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
they since they're making

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
this Link's Awakening game

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
in a 3D environment

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
that looks a lot like A Link to the Past

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
but 3D could they

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
possibly maybe

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
be remaking

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
A Link to the Past as

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
well that's what some people are

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
theorizing with this how would you

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
feel about how would you guys feel about

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
A Link to the Past remake

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
in that

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
3D style that they're doing this Awakening

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
remake in

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I mean

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I need my pixels

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I'm open to it like the Secret of Mana

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
remake was alright

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
but the original is still

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
like the one like if I'm like you've never

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
played Secret of Mana I'm gonna pull up the original

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
like the 3D remake was cool

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
in some ways but it also had issues when it first came out

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I don't know if you guys remember the Secret of Mana

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
kind of had some issues when it first came out so

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I don't know but Nintendo

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
usually does not

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I would trust Nintendo's quality

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
a little bit more than probably anybody else

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
so anyway

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
let's see

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Brakeman says I want a VR style

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
remake be careful what you ask

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
for let's see

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Bobby Blackpool says what is the remake also

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
has Metroid and has a randomizer

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
you're on

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
but I don't think that's what's gonna happen although

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
god I wish Nintendo would go down that path

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
can you even imagine you know what I want

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I want a new remix game

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
like NES remix and wasn't there

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
SNES remix at one point I remember

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
no there wasn't then I want an SNES

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
remix I want those games to come back

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
out those are fun anyway

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
alright let's move on to

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
the classic game of the week

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
every week here on the show Dark

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Soccer steps in the gaming vault to find the game

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
that she thinks hey sticky

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
you guys should be checking out this classic

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
oh my god the cat threw up and you know

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
sometimes that's what I say in the vault

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
sometimes Dark Soccer will pick

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
pretty obscure Japanese titles you probably never

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
played like last week was one of those

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
titles right it wasn't very

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
yeah it was but this

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
this week she's picking a game

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
that I owned

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
this is a little bit more

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
one that you guys probably could play

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
honestly act deaf this goes out to you

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
what is the classic game of the week

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
actually finger trick

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
it is Kirby Superstar

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
because

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
it's so much fun I've decided that

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
my first tattoo might actually

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
be Kirby riding the star

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
it might be if I don't get my cherry blossom

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
but anyway

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
in PAL regions it was released as Kirby's

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Fun Pack and it came out in

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
1996 so the

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
year I moved out here

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
the year I graduated high school

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
girl I should take that back

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
no I moved out here did I move out here in 96?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I don't remember

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
no I think I moved out here in 98

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
anyway whatever

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
anyway it was

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
developed by HAL Laboratories and published by Nintendo

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
for the Super Nintendo

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
and it was part of

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
the entire Kirby series

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
it basically was advertised

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
as featuring 8 games

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
7 short sub games

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
with all the same basic gameplay

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and too many games

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
it was later released on Wii and Wii U

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
and there's an enhanced remake

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
called Kirby Superstar Ultra

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
that came out on the DS in 2008

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
also Nintendo

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
re-released Kirby Superstar in Japan

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
US and Europe

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
in November 2017 as part of the

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Super NES Classic Edition

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
which I think I played

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
quite a bit of that during the time

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
anyway you play

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
as Kirby who can float

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
and inhale stuff and spit him out

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
if he swallows certain enemies

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
he gains their abilities and can use them

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
as his own

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
another feature of this

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
particular game is helpers

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
so when Kirby has an ability he can

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
transform it into a helper character

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
that the second player or computer can

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
control and certain abilities

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
like

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
crash or the mic cannot be

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
like crash or mic cannot be

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
turned into helpers

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
so you have to choose to give the helper

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
a form or revert them into a power

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
up in an emergency

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
so some of them

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
like wheelie allow Kirby to interact with

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
them during two player play

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
so

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
basically if it takes too much damage

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
then Kirby can grant it a new power

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
before it disappears and he has to create

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
a new one and if Kirby takes too much

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
damage he loses a life

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
so there are a few

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
the different ones in here are Spring Breeze

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
which is a simplified remake

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
of Kirby's Dream Land

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
but it has the Superstar enhancements in it

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
so basically you have to make it to a

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
castle to challenge King Dedede

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
who has stolen food from Dream Land

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
wah

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and also float islands

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
in Castle Lola Will have emerged

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and Kabula does not

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
appear and then

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
when you reach Castle Dedede you don't have

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
to do a boss rush to get to

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
King Dedede

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Dynablade is an original

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
one where you have to stop Dynablade

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
which is a giant bird from

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
disturbing Dream Land's crops

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
it's all about food isn't it Kirby?

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
so you have four layers that you have to play and then you face off

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
against Dynablade and you have two secret

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
areas and many bosses that move around the world

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
map in this one

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Gourmet Race, jeez even more food

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
so you have to race against King Dedede

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
while eating as much food as you can

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
so

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
you take

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
it takes place across three levels of different links

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
and whoever earns the most points by the end of all three levels

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
with a bonus point being the first to

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
finish each race

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
and so then you can choose to race

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
King Dedede or your ghost

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
to be the best at that

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and the DS actually had multiplayer

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
functionality in this one

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
then we have the Great Cave Offensive which is

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
a metroidvania style game

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
where Kirby has to explore a cave for treasure

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
and so you have

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
sixty treasure chests

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
and you get a maximum score

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
of, it looks like

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
ninety-nine million

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
no, nine million nine hundred and ninety

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
nine, nine hundred and ninety points

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
and sixty treasures

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
it also has references to

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
other Nintendo games like the Triforce

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
screw attack

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
the helmet of Captain Falcon and

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Mr. Saturn from Earthbound

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
and then you've got

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
other value

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
items that appear like in other

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
role playing games. We have the Revenge of

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Meta Knight which basically has Kirby

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
trying to destroy Meta Knight's battleship

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
the Halberd before Meta Knight can

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
conquer Dreamland

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
you have a time limit and it will cost

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
you a life if it hits zero

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
and it is very apparently plot based

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
so then we also have Milky Way Wishes

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
which is the largest game in the collection

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
basically the sun and the moon

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
around planet Popstar

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
are fighting and a creature named

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Marx tells Kirby that he must travel across

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
nine planets to restore a giant

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
wish granting comet

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Nova, comet Clock Nova

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
so unlike this one

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Kirby can't copy

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
the enemies

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
he can get copy essence's

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
deluxe and then he can choose a copy ability

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
from the list and then he has it through the game

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
also

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
beating Milky Way Wishes

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
grant you the arena sub game

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
and the arena is an endurance mode

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
that is a big boss rush, you fight basically

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
every boss, there are 26 bosses

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
in 19 rounds

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
and in between each round you have

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
a room with maximum tomatoes

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
five of them which can only be used

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
once each and then

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
two randomly selected pedestals will

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
give you certain powers

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
you can choose any of the powers at the beginning of the game

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
and then if you beat that you get the sound test

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
function so you can listen to all the music in the game

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
there are some sub games like Samurai Kirby

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
where it's a

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
timing based mini game

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
like quick draw from Kirby's adventure

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
where you have to

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
do the attack at just the right moment

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
wild gunman basically and then megaton

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
punch which is what I did yesterday

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
anyway you have to punch a crack

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
in the planet and you have to make a bigger crack

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
the point is crack rob

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
anyway

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
this is one of those games that had a special

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
chip for it, it's the SA-1 chip

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
and

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
with this particular

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
one it was basically just to

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
be able to

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
help with some of the computer generated imagery

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
like what was in the

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
introduction

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
they had some

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
other things that were planned

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
for the game and of course

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Sakurai who also did give us Smash

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Brothers

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
was developing the game using three different

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
design pillars as he said it

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
a two player co-op gameplay, beat em up

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
gameplay and an omnibus format

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
that you could use it to reach

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
an ending and actually it was

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
that last

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
sorry the two player co-op

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I believe was requested by Miyamoto

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
and then

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
a couple of the other things

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
that were wanted to be in the game

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
was one called Kagero Mansion

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
which was a survival horror game

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
that leaves Kirby stuck in a mansion

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
with a cursed seal in his mouth

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
so he cannot use his

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
inhale or copy ability

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
and then

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
it was meant to be a little bit more

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
proactive in the gameplay but

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
they didn't want to

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
do it so basically

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
but when it was sold in Japan

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
it was sold in a package

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
resembling a wooden box with a seal

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
burnt off

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
like buying high priced sake or dishware

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
comes in one of those boxes, luxury items

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
so the design was supposed to be

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
like a luxury item box

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
so anyway

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
with the remake version

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
which came out in 2008 so it's still

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
under that 10 year thing

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
it has different modes

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
in it for Kirby Super Star Ultra

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
there's Revenge of the King which is a more

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
difficult version of Spring Breeze

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
where you fight a stronger King Dedede

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
which is Mask's Dedede

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
and in this one Kabula appears

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
and you

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
have to face using Starship Kirby

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
and you also have a Boss Rush

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
and they're all powered up

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
on top of that. Then you have Meta

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Nightmare Ultra which you

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
control Meta Knight and he plays

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
through the levels on Spring Breeze, Dynablade

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
the Great Cave Offensive, Revenge

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
of Meta Knight, and Milky Way Wishes

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
and at the end of Milky Way Wishes instead of fighting

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Marks he fights Galacta Knight

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Helper to Hero

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
is also like an arena mode

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
but you play as a helper

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and fight a new character

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Wham Bam Jewel

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
True Arena is an enhanced arena

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
you've got all your extra bosses

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
in that one and then you have the sub games

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Snack Tracks, Kirby Swipe

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and Kirby on the Draw

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
which can be played up to 4 players

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
a local play. Anyway

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
it was pretty

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
pretty rad. People liked it and it

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
sold over 1 million copies in Japan

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
and it received fairly

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
favorable ratings and

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
a lot of people considered it one of the best games

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
in the franchise.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It got really great reviews

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
in EGM back then Electric Gaming Monthly

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
GamePro really

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
GamePro gave it a 5 out of 5

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
in sound and control and Fun Factor

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
got a 4.5 out of 5

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
and it was really considered just a

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
very charming and fun little game

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Famitsu gave it 32 out of

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
40

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
and in 2008

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Superstar Ultra became a Famitsu

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Gold title

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
and that particular one

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
sold 1 million

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
21,000 copies in

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Japan and was the 9th best selling

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
game of Japan in 2008

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
as of December 2008 it was the 5th best

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
selling Nintendo DS game in the US

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
and as far

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
as its legacy

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
some of the tracks

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
ended up in Super Smash Brothers

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
especially in the N64 and that was

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
the music from the Gourmet Race and Kirby's

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
theme song. It was on

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Wii Virtual Console

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
and Wii U Virtual Console

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
like I said earlier

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
and it was included in Kirby's Dream Collection

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
that was released on the Wii

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
in celebration of the 20th anniversary

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Metal Knights Battleship

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
the Halberd reappeared in

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Kirby's Squeak Squad

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Kirby's Epic Yarn

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Super Smash Brothers for Wii U

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
and Kirby Planet Robobot

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
try that fist a little

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
it's not a tongue twister it's a

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and then a stage based off

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
the Great Cave Offensive

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
shows up in Super Smash Brothers

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
for Wii U

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
that basically is just a reference back to them

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
of course it's included in the Super Nest classic

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
edition. So there you go

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
we got some koi b action

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
yes and it's a game that I

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
remember pretty fondly as well

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I had this game, I loved the samurai game

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
the little wild gum and rip off was so much fun

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I can't go

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
all

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
crazy

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
about

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
picking weird obscure shit no one's heard of

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
or that maybe five of us have heard of

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I like the obscure stuff but I think

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
a good segment is a mixture of all of it

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I am still thinking of getting the Kirby

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
on a star

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
because I said that when I lost

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
100 pounds I'd get ink

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
well now I've lost 116

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I guess you still don't have ink

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
that's okay because I talked about getting a tattoo a long time ago

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
as well because I was

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
going to get a sound wave

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
here because thankfully

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
thanks to the long running history of this show

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I have audio of my mom

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
because she was on the show so I wanted to get

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
you need to get the one of her going, Rob

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
well I wanted to get her

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
on my arm

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
and it's that whole little nerdy thing

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
where you can use the phone to play it and read it

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
and I realize that type of stuff won't be around forever

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
even though tattoos are but I still think like sound waves

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
the fact that it would be my mom and just the fact that

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
this shit here has been

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
a part of my life for so long there should be a

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
representation of that, you know, so

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
that's what I'm looking into doing

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
we'll have to go get matching

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
tattoos, no we wouldn't get matching tattoos

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
but sibling tattoos

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
anyway, does Agdeft have a Kirby tattoo?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I'd be curious about that

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
yeah I really want to know Agdeft, do you have a Kirby tattoo?

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
and where is it?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
we're going to take a studio break real quick

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
but we're just going to throw it to a segment

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I made earlier today, we're talking about classic

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
games, I've talked a lot on the show

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
before about the classic

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Nintendo online library on the Switch

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
but I've talked about the

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
oh well maybe that's

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
something for the future

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
but I've talked about the Famicom

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
library and how there are some subtle differences

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
in some of the games and I thought it would be kind of

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
fun for this segment tonight to

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
show some of those subtle differences

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
here, so we will be right back

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
here on Orange Lounge

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Radio, let's throw it to myself

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
earlier today

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Hey everybody, it's Rob in the

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
office studio and I thought for our

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
OLR break tonight we could take a look at something

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
that I've talked a few times about on the show

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
but I haven't really shown here on the show

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
and I thought it would be a good thing for the midpoint

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
break, I've done a couple of livestreams

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
on my own personal channel that have

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
addressed this a little bit but what I wanted to show

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
tonight was the Nintendo Switch

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
online family computer classic console

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
or Famicom classic console

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
as opposed to the online library

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
for the NES that I think many of you

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
are used to, if you own

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
a Nintendo Switch you've probably fired up

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
this application and it shows you

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
all the classic games that you can play

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and you can fire up whatever it is that you

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
want and you can play it, so

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
here's what it looks like right now

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I think we're going to talk in tonight's show about some of the other

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
games that are coming soon, you can kind of see generally

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
what it looks like for those of you that don't own a Switch out there

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
you can pick whatever game it is

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
that you want to play and you just pretty much

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
go right into that game and you can hit the ground running

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
and play the game

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
but I want to take a look at the

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Japanese version of this, the Famicom

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
which you can see right off the bat

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
had the very different controllers

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
it was a different system in Japan

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and because it was a different system

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
there was also some different

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
types of peripherals, like they had a

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
disk based system if you weren't already aware

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
you could actually load

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
games based on a disk

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
kind of like computers back in the 80's

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
a lot of disk based stuff

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
well it's very easy since the Nintendo Switch is region free

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
it's very very easy to create a

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Japanese account, you can go online

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
you create an account and just set it's

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
home as Japan somewhere

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
and then you can sign in on your

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Switch with that account and you can go on to the

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
eShop and download this for free

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
and as long as you still have an online subscription

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
for your US account

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
or wherever it is you happen to be

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
it will work, the Japanese

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
stuff will work too because again

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
the Nintendo Switch is region free, it's just most people

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
don't think to make a Japanese

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
account to go on to the Japanese eShop

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and download this, if you do do that

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I notice sometimes I get

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Japanese news updates and things

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
because I have both accounts on my Switch but

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I don't mind at all actually

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
it's sometimes nice to see things on the other side of the pond

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
so let's fire up the Famicom version

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
of this and you don't have

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
to use, so you'll notice

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
if you have a Japanese account here, you don't have to use

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
the Japanese account, you can just use your regular account

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
in fact that would be the one you would want to use

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
because that's the one that actually

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
is paying for the Switch online service

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
which maybe you got free through the whole Amazon

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
deal lately, I don't know, but you only

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
need that Japanese account

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
to actually download the client from the

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
store, you'll see here, oh the

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Japanese version looks very different because

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
again the boxes in Japan

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
very different and so it looks a little more jigsaw

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
puzzle here because of the fact

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
that all the

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
disks were different sizes and of course

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
there's a lot of special versions, different

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
software as well and all that fun stuff

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and so you can kind of jump in and see some of the

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
big differences, for example let's fire up

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Super Mario USA

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
right, which we all know is Super Mario Bros. 2

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
so it has kind of a different title

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
screen to it, otherwise

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
once you get into the game really it's pretty much the

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
same thing, it's just Super Mario Bros. 2

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
they just had that different screen that

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
went with it, so that one's a little bit like

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
whatever, there's not a lot of differences there

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
of course, one of the big big differences

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
is that Japan has been getting some games

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
that we haven't been getting in the US

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
for example, I don't believe this Yara

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Kung Fu came out in the US

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
at all, this is based on a classic

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
arcade game, a really classic fighting

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
arcade game and yeah you can play

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
this which I don't think is available

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
in the US store at all

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
so, you know by downloading the Japanese

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
client, which again you have access to

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and if you're paying for the US online you can just

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
create a Japanese account and go get it, you can check

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
out this game if you want, that's not

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
the only one

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
however there, you could also get Fire Emblem

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
which I know is a series a lot of people

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
are paying attention to now

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
but the original original was on

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
the NES and so that's what this game

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
is, unfortunately this one's a little

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
harder to play because as you see you're

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
gonna have to know some Japanese

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
in order to kind of make your way around the game

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
but I'm sure there's lots of FAQs

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
online that'll help you get through the game

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
because obviously, you know, people have

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
wanted to play this before so there's

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
fan translations and all that good stuff

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
obviously you can't translate the ROM itself

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
but there's some good text guides and things

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
that can walk you through the game and when in doubt

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I'm sure a lot of YouTubes or other Twitch streamers

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
that are playing the game as well could also

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
help out with things like that, so this bottom option

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
will always take you back out to the main menu

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
also some other interesting differences, Blaster

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Master, completely different game

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
in Japan, so it has like a completely

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
different screen here, Metafight right?

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
When you start the game, so you remember the story

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
in the US is like, oh you're gonna go rescue

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
your frog so you have this, you know

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Sophia, the big

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
car that you're driving through the cave

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
right? You've seen that sequence at the beginning of Blaster Master?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Yeah, all in Japan? No.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Different story. It's not a cave.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It's like this laboratory thing.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Completely different story going on in that game

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
there, so that's kind of another like

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
little interesting difference. But one of the things

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
that I think gets really interesting is when you get

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
into some of these games that were on the

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Disk System, the Famicom Disk System

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
because some of the sound

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
is slightly different because the

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Famicom Disk System again had that extra

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
sound chip, so the versions

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
that are actually emulated here on

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
the Famicom library are

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
the Disk System versions. So for example

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
let's go to a game that I know everybody

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
knows, so where is it down here? Here we go.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
The Hyrule Fantasy, right? The Legend of Zelda

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
and you can see that little logo with the little

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
yellow guy there for the Disk System, okay?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
So that shows you that The Legend of Zelda was

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
a disk game and the way they translated that

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
when this game came out in the US was they

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
used the battery pack, but let's take a look at some of the

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
differences. So

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
it's very subtle

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
but if you can kind of hear the theme music

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
in the background, I'll shut up for a minute.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Little chimes.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
There's some extra stuff in it, right?

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Because there was a different sound

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
processing system on the

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Famicom with the Disk System

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
versus the NES. So it sounded like a different

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
font as well that they used in that version.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
So I can just go in real quick here as well.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I think I already set up a file. Now you have

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
to actually wait. The downside to using

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
the Disk System is it emulates the

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
loading times as well.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
So you have to sit through the loading times

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
to actually get into the game.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
But once you do,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
it's pretty much the same game you remember from before.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
But let me go pick up the sword,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
okay?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
And it is in Japanese

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
so he doesn't say

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
what he usually says.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
It's dangerous to go alone, right?

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
But now, listen carefully when I fire the sword

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
because I have the full health.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Kind of a very

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
different sort of noise it makes there when you fire

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
that off, right? So some subtle

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
differences. Again, at the end

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
of the day, it's pretty much the same game

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
but there are some differences.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Now, some of these differences on the other

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Disk System games get more so. Like if I

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
were to go over to Metroid,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
okay, so here's Metroid.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And again, if you listen

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
very carefully, you can hear an extra kind of

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
bass track in the background

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
music here. But if I actually get into the game,

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
okay, look at this. You don't remember

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
this from the NES version of Metroid

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
because this was

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
on the Disk System so it had a file menu very

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
similar to what you had

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
with The Legend of Zelda because

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Metroid came out first in the US

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
and that was their password

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
pack. That's why there were the silver

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
boxes. This and Kid Icarus

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
were the password pack series. So they

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
used passwords at first to sort

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
of emulate a little bit what they

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
were doing with the

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
sorry, I hit the mic. With the Disk

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Systems before. So if I actually start the game

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
here and it actually, you know, it'll load here a little bit

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
and then

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
you'll hear it. Loading, loading, loading.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Now loading.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Lots of loading for these games.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
That's, again, the downside to the Japanese

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
ones is that you have to actually emulate

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
that disk loading. Here we go.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I think it'll start here after this.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
You kind of notice like, kind of like

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
an extra horn noise in there a little bit.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Probably. Oh, and I actually

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I picked a pile that I actually already played so I can't

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
even go pick up the item now because I've already played this

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
character a little bit. Whoops. That's alright.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
You can still hear like, some

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
of those subtle differences a little bit.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And when I get hit, like that little owl noise

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
is slightly, slightly different.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Newer releases.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I mentioned Kid Icarus as well

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
and I think we'll go there.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
So again,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
a screen with multiple files

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
just like you'd have in the other

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
disk games so

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
it wants a name but I don't really have

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
one so we'll just give it a fake name there.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
start the game.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
And

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
all those loading screens.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
There we go.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And I think

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
for the most part the audio

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
is very similar in this game.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
But I think when you get

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
hit

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I want to say I noticed

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
a big difference when he, like

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
if you die or whatever. Maybe to do that

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I might have to just do a falling death here.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Oh, maybe it was the Grim Reaper guy.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Let me see if I can just run up to him real fast

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
this first level.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Let's be real, it's not hard to die in Kid Icarus.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
This game is very hard.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Some of those games you have to really kind of remember

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
your way through.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Okay, let's see.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
So there's the harp that turns everybody

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
into hammers.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Kind of makes a little bit of a different noise instead of just

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
like a tick tock.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Ooh, I really went the wrong way on that.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I'm really not supposed to go to the right, that's okay.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Alright, there's one of the death guys.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Oh no!

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Did you hear that little extra

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
backing track there? Wow, I wasn't

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
trying to die there, but you know, fail.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I did it anyway. Alright.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Anyway, I think that's enough

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
of a tour. A little quick break tonight.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
But you know, I just thought for those of you that have

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
played Nintendo Switch and maybe haven't played around with it,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
it's kind of just fun to look at some of the differences

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
between the Japanese releases and the American

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
releases. And again, you know, even though

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
you might be like, well, whatever with the extra sound,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
you do have some of those extra games.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
And now it's going the other way

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
too with this last month that we had

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
we had the Star

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Tropics release in the U.S. that they didn't get

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
in Japan. So you know what? If you happen

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
to be one of those few Japanese listeners

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
that's participating with Orange Lounge Radio tonight,

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
maybe there's something to go in the other way

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
as well if you want to check out Star Tropics for the first time.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
So there's that. Anyway,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
just a little bit of a tour there of the differences

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
and I'll be curious if any of you guys

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
check it out this week. Be sure to send me a tweet

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
at MrRobRoberts if you decide

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
oh, this segment kind of

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
inspired you to go into the Famicom

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
library and check some of the things out there.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
But for now, we will head back to the studio.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Enjoying that. YYR is like noticing

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
a lot of the differences that I'm pointing out there

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
and talking about maybe making a

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
switch online just

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
to check that out. And Brakeman

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
made some funny comments in our chat at

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Twitch.tv slash OLR going, the music

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I grew up with and loved was

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
watered down. My whole reality has been

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
shattered. Gee, thanks, OLR.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
It's all perspective. I mean,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
sure, maybe it was missing some of

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
the tracks there because it had

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
like one less chip or something.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
But perspective a little bit,

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
those loading times in Metroid

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
were pretty bad and that didn't exist

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
when it was in a cartridge form.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
There are some pros and cons and

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
like I said, I'd be curious if somebody like

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
AkumaJP or maybe one of our other listeners in

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Japan would be curious about

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
exploring it the other way to see

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
what we always complain about and maybe

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
hear what the watered down audio sounds like or

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
check out StarTropics or some of those things

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I was addressing there in the video.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Yeah.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Let's see.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Other comments in chat here. MetalMayham

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
says, admittedly, I never had Kid Icarus on the nest.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
It's a hard game, but it's definitely

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
worth playing. It's a fun game.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
So, Brakeman said that was a really fun segment.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
OrangeRite says, Joy Mech Fight

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
is worth the time to make the Japanese

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
account alone. Yeah, why not? I mean,

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
part of the reason I want to highlight that is

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I know I always talk about it, but like, those of you that

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
are already subscribing to Switch Online, which is

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
a ton of people at this point with the Twitch Prime

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
add-on now, you know, you

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
can go peek at some of those differences. Again,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
it kind of takes a special type of gaming

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
nerd to appreciate a lot of those differences. I think

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
for the most part, they're all going to be very subtle and you'll just

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
be like, oh, there's really the same game.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
But there's at least those couple extra games, like Joy Mech

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Fight and so on. So, anyway,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
all that being said, I think we

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
will get back into some

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
news and our show and the rest of what we got

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
to talk about tonight. So, let's do some rapid

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
fire news. Loki, I believe, starting

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
us off. There's some ridiculous stuff that you'll

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
find out there on the internet, including

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
screenshots, or I should say a

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
photographs of Gabe Newell

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
in China,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
pimping out

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
some underwear. Well, apparently

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
some Chinese company that sells underwear

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
has used his likeness

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
on the cover of these

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
packages, and it's funny because

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
You know, when I think of underwear model,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I don't always think of Gabe Newell,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
but I appreciate that we're being

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
body positive and featuring all sorts of

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
different, except the picture is him fully

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
clothed, to be clear.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
The picture is Gabe Newell

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
fully clothed. He's wearing a bra on his head,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
like Travis, being Queen

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Amidala.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
No, no, none of that. Are they selling

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
boxers or briefs? That's the important question.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Apparently, they appear to be

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
boxer briefs. Broccoli?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
No, boxer briefs.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Although, the way

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
they actually have it listed, it's

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
large brief.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
It's 5XL.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Oh, okay.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
That's just probably the box the person picked up.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
So, alright.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Interesting. Congrats, Gabe Newell,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
CEO, underwear model.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
But are they three-packs

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
is what I have to see. It's only a two-pack.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Oh, okay. Can't get to the

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
three-pack. No.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Apparently, so, yeah.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
At least they respect that part of the

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Newell. I'm so glad we talk

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
about such important elements of GameCo.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I'm so glad for all the stories we bumped tonight so we

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
could cover that one. Hey, you know what?

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Can you not get enough of Hideo

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Kojima? Well, guess what?

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Soon, you'll be able to get him in other

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
mediums as well, including

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
a brand new show that's gonna be

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
on Prime Video. So,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Hideo Kojima has apparently

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
a cameo in

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
this new crime series. It's coming out

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Too Old to Die Young.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
And he's actually featured in the

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
trailer very

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
extremely briefly.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
But you can check it out.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And it looks

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
interesting. I don't know what the series is about

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
but it's

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
the music

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
they have the retro

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
was it like the

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
retro waves music in the actual

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
series? Plus it just kind of

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I don't know, very dark and stylistic

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
so it looks neat. And that

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
seems like something that he would get himself

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
involved in. So

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
check it out since I have Prime

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Video and I don't use it for anything.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Alright. Get on it.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Alright. Moving on

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
April Fools was this past week

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
which, you know, I'm kind of over

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
all the dumb things people do on that day.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
But once in a while, like video games

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
will put out like a little extra thing for

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
April Fools Day that ends up being like a permanent thing.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
For example, I talked earlier in the show, Beat Saber

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
had that crab song and that's like there

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
now. Yeah, a full time thing. Well,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
also, here's another one. So if you're a Rage 2

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
player, then they

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
unleashed a new announcer pack

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
featuring Tim Kitsrow

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
who is the announcer from NBA

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Jam and NFL Blitz.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
So if you want the guy from downtown

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
if you want that in

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Rage 2, yes, that is

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
really something that is available.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
If you pre-order Rage 2, you

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
get the He's On Fire cheat code

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
DLC pack.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And that will have the commentary for

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
the actions that you perform in the game.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
It looked hilarious. Yeah, it looked hilarious

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
in the trailer. And that's a real thing.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
So I like it when the April Fools jokes are

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
like legit, like actual things

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
that are just, they're just stupid and you turn them on

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
in office as you need to.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Now y'all know I love me some Civilization 6

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
right? In the Civilization series.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I think this is really cool is that

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
now if you link your 2K

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
account, you can actually

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
play Civilization 6 with cross

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
save support. So you can

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
start a game on the PC,

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
save it, and pick it up on the Switch.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Cool. Pretty cool. Yeah.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Cross save as opposed

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
to just like a cross play type of thing.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
So that's pretty neat. So anyway, that was a recent update

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
that just came out. No April Fools joke there.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Where you can save a game

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
on the PC and you can pick it up on the

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Switch. Again, you have to have a 2K

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
account to basically

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
facilitate the cross save. So

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
yeah, yet another game company account

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
you get to make. Woohoo. But that's kind of

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
a neat thing there. So do remember that

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
the original, or excuse me, the Switch

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
version of Civ 6 is the original

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
with no expansions.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
So keep that in mind for your Civ 6

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
game. That's an important thing is that if you have

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
a Civ 6 game with all the expansions

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
oops, you can't actually transfer that file.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
So do keep that in mind

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
with this. But I think that's pretty cool.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
It's kind of one of those things that like now they announced

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
and I'm like, oh, that really should have been there

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
the whole time. How about that?

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Well coming out is going to be

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Konami's Arcade Archives

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
series.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And the game that's going to be added to that is

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Time Pilot. That's going to be coming

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
out on April 11th, 2019.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Basically you go through time rescuing other

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
pilots. Apparently in 2001 we were supposed to have UFOs.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I love Time Pilot.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
But it is actually saying it's going

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
to be the first of their classic

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
arcade titles to join that. So that's pretty cool.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
It'll be on PS4

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
and Switch in Japan on April 11th.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
It will be 823 yen.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
A game that was

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
prominently featured on

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Nick Arcade.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I was going to say StarCade.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
StarCade had this game all the time.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Anyway, also the game

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Power Rangers Battle for the Grid

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
is going to have some free DLC characters

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
and more content.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Enway has revealed

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
three characters coming out.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
That's going to be Dragon Armor Trini

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
rest in peace.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Udonna and

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Cenozoic Blue Ranger

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
are going to be out with no other

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
cost and that they are

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
hard at work on packing more content

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
into the game.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
They are giving the

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
fans what they want. All six of them.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
There's more fans than that.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Alright.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Well go go Power Rangers.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I heard what you did there.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I know. It was intentional. Let's travel around

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
the world and check out some games that are coming out

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
real soon starting in the US.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
We have a few things this week.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
on PC, the Nintendo Switch,

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
We have Shovel Knight

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Showdown on PC,

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Mac, and Linux.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Wii U, Nintendo Switch,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Zanki Zero

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Last Beginning on PC

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
and PlayStation 4.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Earth Defense Force Iron Rain on

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
PlayStation 4.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 4

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
VR Kit is coming out this week

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
on the Switch. And last but not least

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Konami Arcade Classics

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
PC, Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
and Xbox One.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Which if I'm not mistaken has Time Pilot

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
in it as well. So it's a little weird

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
that Arcade Archives is doing one for 8 bucks

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
when it's part of a collection that's going to be

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
20 bucks. So this is a little weird

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
but okay.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
You gotta choose how you want to consume your

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Time Pilot I suppose.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
So I'm traveling over to Japan. It's a little bit lighter in Japan

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
this week. I don't know if that's because gold weeks

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
at the end of the month or some of those budget things

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
that Loki talked about in the last episode. Who knows

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
maybe all of that coming into play. But the only release

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
really on the PlayStation 4 this week is

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
V-Rally 4 that is out on April

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
11th. Over on the Nintendo

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Switch, oh a little bit a bigger deal

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
on the Switch. Not only is V-Rally 4 also

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
out on the Switch, but the Final Fantasy

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
X and X-2 HD Remaster

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
hits the Switch on April 11th.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
So that's kind of a big deal. So that is happening

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
this week as well. But that's

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
really it as far as like big notable releases go.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Dark Sakura, what about the UK? Two things

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
on the 8th.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Dangerous Driving and

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Zanki Zero Last

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Beginning. That's

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
it.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Alright I think Dangerous Driving was

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
supposed to be coming out here too but I must have missed

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
out on the list. But it is. Okay.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
It's Burnout Paradise or it's basically

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Burnout. Yes but the

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
team kind of doing a new game right? Yeah.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
It's basically Burnout.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
It's like yeah. Burnout Take Down

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
basically but not. That team is

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
in the UK so maybe it is coming out there first.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Right. Yeah so maybe they do get it first

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
for a change. Who knows.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Anyway. The

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Final Fantasy X stuff won't be out until next week.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Yeah it's Japan's getting it

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
first. That sometimes happens. Of course.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Alright. Well I mean honestly.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I mean what can they do for us?

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
If you really

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
wanted to play those remasters right now

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
it's out on Playstation 4 and PC.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
It's just the Switch versions you have to wait on.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Anyway. Alright.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Let's go to the mail bag

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
because every week you guys send us

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
emails at participate at

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
orangelandradio.com

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
and why are you laughing?

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Because there's nothing in there. There's no email.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Nobody sent us any emails to participate.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Someone trying to scam us did.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Those don't count. Spam emails don't count. I deleted it

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
and bypassed the trash. So participate

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
at orangelandradio.com if you

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
want to send us an email in a future week but

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
since y'all didn't send us emails you know what that means.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Fuck off. No.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
It means I get to have an excuse to

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
talk to Dark Soccer about Drag Race.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Season 11. So.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I need to watch the last episode but it's already been spoiled

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
for me in the most delightful of manners. Well you don't have to

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
spoil it here but who are you rooting for on

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Drag Race Season 11? I'm rooting for that

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
little romance budding between Miss

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Vanjie and Brooklyn

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Heights. Even straight

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
people know Miss Vanjie. Even

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
straight people do.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
That was the most meme-able thing that's ever come out of

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
the show. I'm actually

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Evie Oddly is my top favorite.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
My second favorite would be

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Brooklyn Heights.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
And my third favorite is actually

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
kind of a tie between Miss Vanjie just

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
because I love her. I mean I love

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
her terrible. Get these cookies!

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Yeah. And I love her talking.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
And Nina West.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Yeah I love Nina West. I like

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
the campy queens. Yeah I love the campy queens.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
My favorite is Evie Oddly for sure.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I think she's going to go all the way to the end.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Nina West I really like too.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
She's going to be here locally in a couple weeks. I kind of want to go

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
see that show. I think it'll be a lot of fun.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Yeah I'm like you. I love a campy queen.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
But as far as like a glamour queen goes I think

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Acuria Chanel Davenport

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
has been bringing a lot of great stuff to the runway. I do

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
but I really like Plastique Tiara

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
and I would like to have another Asian queen

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
somewhere in the top. Yeah.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
I mean that isn't you know the

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
an

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
imitatable uh

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Raja. And not this bitch on

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
this season. Oh yeah.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Her. Her. Her and Silky

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
can go fuck right off. The other one I wanted to

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
fuck off is gone. What did you say is in town tonight?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Somebody's downtown tonight from the show.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
He said. I lost it because it was

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
on my Facebook. Oh

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
it was I remember it was Trinity. It's not even from the

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
season. Yeah Trinity the Tuck. Your current

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
one of your current fucking half

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
reigning. One of our local queens

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
is um performing with her. Oh fun!

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
That's good. Support your local queens.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I want to tell everyone right now I'm going to

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
give one more shout out and this is to

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
a Facebook page

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
that everyone must follow.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
It's called Possum Core.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Okay. And it's nothing but adorable

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
little freaking possums.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Alright well moving away from the mail

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
bag saying. Possums! I

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
did neglect to ask you because you're talking about

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
plugs. Did you have a podcast you want to plug this week?

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Um. I guess we can do that here too.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Game Buoy.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Heck yeah. Game Buoy.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Our pals at Game Buoy. I'm trying

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
to do like non-vogue ones but

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
no one gave me a submission this week. The girl

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
can't help it. And they just came back. They just came back

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
from a hiatus. Welcome back. Welcome

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Buoyak. Yeah. Game

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Buoyak. Keep us afloat.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Aye aye.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
We don't want to you know

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Other nautical terms. Yes.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Will you be our star to guide us in the

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
gaming news

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
realm with opinions. Possums!

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Yes. We don't want to sink

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
by not knowing

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
all the gaming news that's not on our

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
radar. Dude I am posting this freaking adorable possum in chat.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Alright. Anyway. Let's move

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
on. Alright. Back to gaming news. And

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Loki what do you want to talk about in gaming news tonight?

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
So I just mentioned during

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
our release dates that the VR

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Joy-Con set is coming

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
out for Labo.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
And to go along with that they

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
released a video this week announcing that

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
hey not only are you going to be able to use the stuff

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
that's in those sets with

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
this but you'll be able to use the VR

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
goggles that you create with it

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
with other games. So

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
on April

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
25th they're going to

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
add support to

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Super Mario Odyssey and

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Zelda Breath of the Wild.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
So the way this is going to work in Mario

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Odyssey you're going to have a few different

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
levels or mini challenges

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
they call them. Where

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
basically it's all in 3D but you're kind of

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
watching from like a

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
kind of a fixed camera type thing.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
So you're going to do that.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
So they're just videos basically?

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
No you actually play it. Oh you're playing it

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
but it's a fixed camera. Yeah so it's like a fixed

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
camera type thing. Gotcha. But then

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
in Breath of the Wild though it's actually

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
going to be full on like

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
a VR first

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
person view I guess. Or

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
VR support

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
throughout the entire game except for the pre-rendered

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
cutscenes which won't be in VR.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
But apparently you'll

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
be able to turn that option

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
or turn that on in the options menu

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
to get full VR support

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
for the game. I can't imagine playing through

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
that entire game in VR though especially because there's no

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
there's no way to strap it to your head. You have to hold

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
it. There is not a way to

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
strap it to your head. You have to basically hold

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
it up because it's

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
basically just the

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
the actual switch

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
just inside some cardboard and you have to hold it up

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
because it's weighted. So you

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
can't really strap it to your head because it'd be pretty damn

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
uncomfortable.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
It's not exactly well thought

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
out for like playing a long game

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
like that but I can see the Mario

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
thing is a neat idea. It's a cute novelty.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
It is a cute novelty

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
but yeah it'd be nice if they had straps to actually

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
strap it to your head but

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I can't see how that would be comfortable

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
in any way being that it is just a piece of cardboard.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
You have to like not only hold it up but like

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
the joy cons are there too because and Bobby's

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
pointing out it tracks your head movement that way

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
you have to control it up here.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Yeah you're holding it like this.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
It doesn't sound comfortable at all.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
It's going to be very uncomfortable.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
That's the type of thing where it's like I will give that three minutes

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
max and then I'll be over it.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I'll play the Mario Odyssey levels

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Yeah the Mario Odyssey one looks good.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
It'll be very short but

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
It's like I'll turn it on just to see

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Hyrule in VR. Ooh that's neat.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Okay done.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
That's about all I would be able to tolerate of that as well.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
For sure.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Well I want the full report

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
next week on the VR thing.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Yeah well I'm putting together the robot

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
one now so I mean that'll be fun.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
But yeah the VR one is

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
coming on Friday when it releases

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
because I ordered it through Amazon.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I want to know all the details on that so

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
alright. Well moving on let's talk about

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
you know for VR beginning

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
something else is ending

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
sort of. Starlink is

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
going away a little bit. Well obviously

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
they can't like shut down the game. If you've already

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
bought the game you obviously can still

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
play it however

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Ubisoft has mentioned no more physical toys

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
will be made for the game so

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
the toys to life things. They were clearing that shit out at

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Target a few weeks ago.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Yeah and honestly like

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Nintendo kind of treated this like it was

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
a Star Fox game so I kind of forgot

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
it was a toys to life

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
game I just kind of thought it was a

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
oh somebody like made

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
put Star Fox in a not Star Fox

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
game and now it's sort of Star Fox. I can't believe it's not

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Star Fox. It's just yeah I don't know

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
it's a neat idea but

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
eh. Now to be clear

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
the game is still being supported because

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
pilots, spaceships, weapons there's going to be a

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
spring update that's going to add more of that but it's

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
all digital which maybe

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
some people are going to enjoy is that it seems like all

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
these things they had planned for future toys

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
eh. Well that's you know

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
funny enough that you mentioned that because that's actually how

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
they treated the PC version of

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Disney

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Infinity was it was all digital

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
you had cards you could put codes in you get

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
like with the actual well originally I think it was the

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
mobile they had a mobile game too I think

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
so you put in codes that came with the actual

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
characters to unlock

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
the digital ones but of course you know

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
now there's ways to you know cheat

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
that but it was all

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
now I think if you buy the games it just comes

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
with all of the characters that they had released

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
with that so

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I don't know that's the only bad thing about those toys

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
to life stuff is like

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
eh. It's

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
it has to be really something

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
you want to collect because those things are

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
pretty big like the Arwing thing I could see

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
that would be pretty cool for someone to put on a shelf

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
but like all the other things

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
I don't know that's a bit

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
much. Alright

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
now the company did make a statement

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
the developers of the game made a statement

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
you don't usually hear them be very frank about what's

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
going on but the statement says despite

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
the immense and continuous support from our players

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
the sales for Starlink Battle for Atlas

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
fell below expectations

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
consequently we recently made the decision

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
to not release any additional physical toys

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
for the spring update and in the future

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
not often you hear a company being very upfront

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
where it's like well didn't sell enough of them

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
so the end

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
so it's kind of a sad reality

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
I guess so that's what happens when you guys

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
try to jump into the toy toys

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
life stuff too late in the game I mean

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
come on it'll be so up to you

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
maybe it'll work a little better for him digitally

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
we'll see but I

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
still need to play the game myself just because I

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
was curious about the whole Star Fox

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
you know obviously I would play on the Switch so I could see all that

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
go check out the clearance stuff

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
because those games I think were

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
the toys themselves were like five bucks

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
so like a big thing and I was like

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
maybe I should get some of these and I'm like I'm never going to play this

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
why am I going to buy this stuff

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
alright moving on Dark Sakura what do you have for us

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I got some stuff

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
so Jackbox Party Pack

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
6

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
is coming in Q4 2019

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
but at any rate

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
they did

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
something kind of different

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
they do

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
we know that it's going to be called

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
trivia murder party minigame

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
from 2016

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
it's going to be returning

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
and that it's going to give us five games

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
per collection and maybe four more

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
and one with a new concept

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
so

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
at any rate it also did like a

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
really weird kind of

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
trailer with people wearing sheets

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
in a forest labeled ghosts

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
like what is this

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
it's going to

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
at any rate be

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
PC, PS4, Xbox One

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Switch and Apple TV and iPad

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
so

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
hopefully it'll be

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
pretty good

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
we'll see

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I don't know do you think you're going to

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
begin to this one?

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I haven't gotten any of the other Jackbox games

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
although didn't they give one away

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
I think Epic Store had one

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
for free didn't they?

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I don't remember

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I'm trying to look at this weird

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I don't have enough friends to play those with

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
so that's the problem

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
oh you have at least three

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
not that they want to play with me anytime

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
oh no

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I do have the Jackbox Party Pack

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I grabbed that

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
it was one of the free Epic games

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
that they had on there

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I did get that

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
by the way The Witness is free right now

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
so check that out

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
well at any rate

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I don't know if the weird

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
trailer is enough

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
it's kind of like people are banking in

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
on this kind of

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
oddity related

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I don't know Trivia Murder Party was awesome

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
so I'm down for a sequel

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
but I wonder what type of new theme they're going to be able to do

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
what was the t-shirt one that they had

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I don't remember

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
I don't really play a whole bunch of it myself

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I just remember the last time I played it

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
was over at a Halloween party

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
well

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
well at any rate

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
sometime later in the year

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
we're going to have it

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
so we will see it when we see it

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
sounds awesome

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
anything else?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
so we're having a microphone issue

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
and I can't tell which mic it is

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
it's all of the mics

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
they're all bad

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
I'm terrible

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Radio Shack Ghosts

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
well we didn't get these from Radio Shack did we?

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
well it's still Radio Shack Ghosts

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
you know Dan worked for Radio Shack

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
and did he confirm that it's full of ghosts?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
no

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
I think the ghosts were like possessing

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
but they used to play like the

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
chill station from

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
on Sirius

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
so every time I go in

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Loki's unplugged for a minute I want to see if the chat says it's Loki's mic

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I'm trying to diagnose which mic is having the issues

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I don't need a mic

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
I talk loud enough to be picked up by all of them

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
and it's please

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
says I think it's Loki's mic

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
interesting so they say they keep hearing static

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
on their end

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
it's live radio

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
these things happen

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
it is not the Mac Mini

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
so I'm curious

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
if they're saying it's gone away

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
has it gone away at this point?

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
because I just unplugged Loki so if it's Loki's mic

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
the noise should have gone away

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
it's gone away so it's Loki's mic

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
don't make me sing

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I'm going to sub his mic out for another chord real quick

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
well Loki's got a story to do

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
well nobody has a hot mic but you

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I do

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
so this is the Dark Sakura Hour

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
and I'm going to go ahead and do my story for reasons

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
well I don't have another story

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
so I'm going to think of a story

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
and yesterday

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
you know that Burrito Week

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
National Burrito Day was last week

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
and Dan and I went out and got burritos

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
at Freebirds

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
and I ended up being

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
it was super good but they had

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
that alternate

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
meat thing, Rob, I'm just going to read your story

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
because fuck it

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
okay

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Rob's story is this

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
there is a working Mario maker

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
inside LittleBigPlanet 3

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
apparently

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
players in LittleBigPlanet 3

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
have

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
basically made their own version

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
it's so weird

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
because it looks actually completely right

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
so they can do

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
blocks, pipes, coins and elements

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
of Super Mario Brothers

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
it's not

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
and someone actually tried to recreate

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
the level

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
so they did the demo

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
of Super Mario Maker running in

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
LittleBigPlanet and it actually looks

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
pretty legit, I mean

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
some of the stuff is a little different

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
this is actually kind of

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
kind of cool

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
well it's amazing what they can do with LittleBigPlanet 3

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
and so I can only imagine what we're going to be able to do

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
when we actually get

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
he's actually talking quietly

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
so I'm impressed

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
different

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
different cable

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
same story

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
talking

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
talking in the yellow

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
so yeah it would be interesting to see

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
what actually is going to happen when Dreams comes out

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
because you can do a ton more stuff in Dreams

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
than you can in LittleBigPlanet 3

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
so I'm very curious to see what they

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
can do with that full on Mario Maker

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
in that one

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
but it looked neat, it's pretty impressive

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I haven't played LittleBigPlanet 3

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
even though we got it free

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
even though you cosplayed Sackboy

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
that was a long time ago

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
in a galaxy far far away

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
namely Rob's Old House

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
ok so live fixing

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
on the air, apparently I

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
tech supported the issue, the chat is happy

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
don't know you'll piss off

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
the electronics union Rob

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
like Bobby says

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
alright anyway

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
let's try to move back and talk about

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
the Loki story that we missed tonight

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
so there's one more we were going to do there

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
so unfortunately

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
speedrun.com has

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
had to revert their rankings

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
back to their April 1st date

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
because apparently

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
they had a security breach

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
which left many of the

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
leaderboards at risk of tampering

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
and so because of that

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
they had to roll back their data

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
and so unfortunately some of

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
these records that people may have set

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
have been

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
removed, so they said

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
about 3 to 5

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
counts moderating

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
prominent boards

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
were compromised and this

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
cause is still

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
understood to be only a few

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
users using

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
or reusing passwords that were compromised from

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
other sites years ago

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
and so because of that

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
they had to unfortunately roll back their

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
database

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
so that sucks

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
that's why you need these unique

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
strong and unique

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
strong passwords, symbols

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
and record your shit

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
yes

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
alright

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
the video cassette recorder

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
like they had to do in the days

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
of Donkey Kong

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
alright well this is, sorry

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
it's been a little awkward trying to get to the end here

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
with all the sound issues but we're finally all worked out

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I think this is going to come a point

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
when I have money

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
that I'm just going to

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
all new mics, all new cords

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
why not, we got a new mixing board

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
these mics were

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
graciously donated by Brad

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
from Pod Culture but that was a few years

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
ago at this point so I think our system

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
might have just kind of lived its life

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
so we might have to end up getting some new stuff

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
we'll see very soon

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
anyway

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
let's get to our listener

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
round table, so we're actually going to

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
open up our Discord server

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
if you want to join the green room over on

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Discord at the VOG Network Discord

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
which is vognetwork.com slash Discord

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
we're going to be taking some calls here

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
or if you have a question on chat

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
or something you want to ask you can ask

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
away in chat, while I get that all set up

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
is there anything that you

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
want to add here for Last Minute Stories

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Loki?

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
I don't

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
have anything

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
other than I have to say

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
one thing I didn't mention as part of my gaming week

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
the whole Labo thing

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
one of the things I like the best about

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
the Labo software right now

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
is the music in those

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
building menus, it's fantastic

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
it's some really

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
really

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
energetic

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
kind of jazzy tunes that they've got going on

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
there, so I really like the menu

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
that's like Wii U or Wii

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Shop music type stuff

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
really, really good stuff

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I dig that and also just like

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
some of the joking around

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
because a lot of the stuff you have to do the same shit over and over

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
now look, isn't that

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
relaxing to fold these creases

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
and stuff like that

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
it's kind of

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
I got a humor to it, like I really wanted my kids

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I really wanted my kids to

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
put this shit together, but they didn't want to

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
do any of it, so I'm like

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
do it, do it, do it, is it done yet?

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
I'm like, I just opened the box

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
it's not done yet, you see the stack of

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
cardboard here, Jesus Christ

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
alright, I know

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
we got one person waiting in the green room

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
so let's get to it, hello, you are on

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Orange Lawn Radio, who's this?

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Yeah, this is Metal Mayhem

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Hey Metal Mayhem, what's on your mind buddy?

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
No, hold on

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
just a very broad topic

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
for you guys tonight

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
seeing as that we're

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
all pretty much with the

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
same age range

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
within a couple of years and we've been gaming

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
for quite a long time

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I have a

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
general question for

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
the three of you

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
is there

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
even though

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
gaming magazines haven't been around

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
for roughly about ten years

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
give or take, because

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
that kind of killed off

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
gaming mags for better

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
or for worse

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
have there been any

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
in the past

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
that you

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
bought on a

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
regular basis

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
either at the newsstand or through subscription

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
so gaming magazines

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
what like gaming magazines were you guys

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
all into, like and what did you actually

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
subscribe to or consume

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
DarkSakura, did you have any magazines

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
that you got on a regular basis?

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Not really, I would just go steal them from the grocery store

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
You stole magazines?

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Yeah, like GamePro and EGM

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Oh my gosh, we have a criminal

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
in our midst

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I admit to it, they can't prove it, just me saying so

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
doesn't mean I actually did it

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
You just said it to look cool, even though stealing

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
is wrong, don't do it

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Don't steal from the magazine rack in your grocery

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
store

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Honestly, I had a subscription

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
in Nintendo Power for a long

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
time, I think I finally let it go when I went off to

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
college, but I had the very first issue in Nintendo Power

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I wish I hadn't thrown it away, I didn't realize

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
how valuable that thing would be

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
But I subscribed to Nintendo Power for a long

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
time, and that was certainly a go-to magazine

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I like EGM, I picked that up a lot

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Honestly, it was the type of thing

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
the grocery store used to have

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
a magazine section, which is where a lot

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
of gaming cards are now, and so like

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
every time we went to the grocery store, I would kind of be able

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
to be like, can I get GamePro?

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
So I would kind of like

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
catch up on a video game magazine

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
that way, and so I kind of rotated through

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
all of them. I remember once

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
GamePro had this thing where

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
like, you could be an

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
editor or something, it was like they were gonna

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
have a team of 75 winners

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
that were like editors, and I ended up getting

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
picked, like they sent me a thing that was like

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I got picked, I won the thing because I

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
had to send a little thing in writing or whatever, and then

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
nothing ever came of it

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
I never got anything else but the whole

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
congratulations, you got picked to do nothing

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Alright, I guess I get to sit there and look fabulous

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
So there was that

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Because we have

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
no editors here

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
They do nothing

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Yeah, I guess they went under after that

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
To do a throwback, even though it's not necessarily

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
100% video gaming

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I also remember, I was a big Commodore 64

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
enthusiast back in the day

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
because that was the computer that was in my family

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
so I loved those Compute Gazette

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
magazines that you could type the programs

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
in the back and like make your own stuff

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
I loved that stuff, and so there was

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
a lot of classic computing magazines I really

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
got into as well, VG&CE

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Video Games Computer Entertainment was another one

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Loadstar

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
was that only a disc thing, or was that

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
actually, I think it was actually a magazine for a short time

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Logie, what about you? What about you and magazines?

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
I did subscribe

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
to Nintendo Power

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
and GamePro

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
and then I used to pick

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
up a lot at the stores, especially when I had

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
like, I had

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
my own PC at that time

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
so like my first PC

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I would pick up PC Gamer

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
because they had the discs with like

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
full games in them sometimes

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
and so I would pick those up just for the games

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
and I used

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
to like also some of the import magazines

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
for different

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
things, because usually they had like

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I don't know

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Oh, the official PlayStation magazine

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
OPM, I did subscribe

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
to that as well, also for the demo discs

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
because that was awesome

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Actually, there was a magazine that Dan and I

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
were subscribing to for a while

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
We were subscribing to Retro Gamer

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Oh, and the

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Xbox game magazine, also for the demo discs

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Notice

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
the trend here, demo discs

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
that will get me to subscribe to your magazine

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Demo discs

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
are a good thing. Metal Mayhem, what about you

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
real quick?

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Well, I

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
personally didn't subscribe to it

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
particularly my father did, but

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
my father

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
multi-year subscription to

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Nintendo Power

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
and this is before

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
future publishing

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
or whatever the name of the company is to go over

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
and

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
to a certain extent that

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
magazine was alright, but eventually it kind of

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
dawned on me that, hey

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Nintendo's running this magazine

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
naturally, they're in the business of

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
selling games, they're not going to say, hey

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
our games are crap, don't buy them

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
it's Nintendo Power

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
So, like, eventually

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
It's that moment when you're younger

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
that you realize everything you loved

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
was advertising

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Yeah, so

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
eventually I started going to

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
the magazine

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
I also started getting all the magazines

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I initially started getting

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
game foam, which I loved

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
and then like

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Loki, I started getting

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
an official

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
PlayStation Magazine once I got

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
a PlayStation 1

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
I got that for the demo

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
mostly, but I ended up liking the magazine

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
itself

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
and eventually when I got a 360

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I got an

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
OXM as well for the demo disc

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
and I ended up liking the magazine

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
as well

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Yeah, I used to love those official PlayStation Magazine demo discs

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
I think if you still have, I think some of those demo discs

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
are kind of collectibles at this point

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Well, there was some that was pretty awesome

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
like the official Xbox magazine, they actually had

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
DLC for free on there, I remember

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
for Oblivion they had

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
a few Oblivion DLC packs

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
that were free in there, I was like, sweet

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Yeah, it was awesome

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Anyway, Middle Mayhem is a great question

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
but great question, and happy reading

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Alright, have a nice day

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
You too, take care

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
What's kind of cool is they had a demo in one of them

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
for Timeshift, the Atari

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
version of Timeshift because

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
they had changed publishers

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
at one time for that game, so they had

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
a demo that was of a game that never

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
came out, and they released later on

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
another demo for the actual version that came out

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
that was from another publisher altogether

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Alright, well let me

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
go to another call here

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Hi, you're on Orange Town Radio, who's this?

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Hey, what's going on everybody?

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Hey, Rama, how you doing?

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Not too much, I'm a little stuffed from dinner

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
and getting ready for a brand new work week

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
You know, and I learned tonight, I thought

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
only Bobby and I had privileges to

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
drag and drop people into other channels, but apparently

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
you do too

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
And you see, the funny thing is, I didn't

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
even realize, because I

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
barely used Discord on my phone

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
and I'm like, okay, this is it, I didn't

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
realize, so like, wait, why is this locked

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I was like, oh, oh

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
oh, and I was like, my bad,

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Rob, my bad

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
So for those that don't know, because you can't see it

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
behind the scenes, you can't see the Discord activity

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
but during that last call with Metal Mayhem

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
like, Rama kept dropping into the channel

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
and I was like, okay, Rama, I get it

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
you want to be on the show, but like, you need to, like

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I don't want background noise coming through, I'm like, you need to go wait

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
like everybody else, you know, and I keep

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
dragging and dropping him back in the channel

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
and then suddenly he disappeared

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
so I don't know if Rama, you dropped off, or Bobby

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
saw what was going on and was like, I'll show him

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
or what

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
No, I realized

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
after the fact that I looked in the room

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I was like, restricted channel, wait, that's not

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
the green room, oh damn, whoops

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Oh, oh, Bobby

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
said he revoked your access

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
what, what, what, it's like you

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
you were in the room and then the sirens started going off

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
woo woo woo

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
intruder alert, intruder alert

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Well, I look at it

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
this way, if something happens

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I have my papers, I'm good

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I know, I know, alright

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
all that joking aside, uh, what's

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Alright, I wanna talk about something in regards to

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
a comment you made last week

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
that I agree with you about

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Okay, good, you agree with me

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
sure, what is that?

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
The 3D Zeldas

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Oh, oh, when I

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
gave my hot take, the Ocarina of Time

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
and stuff, like, you guys, you guys

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
hyped those games up a lot

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I will say

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
this, I got a Nintendo 64

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
just for Ocarina

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
of Time, I saved up my money

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I got the console, I got the

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
game, a few hours into this

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
game, I'm like, what the hell is this?

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I felt like I got ripped

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
off, woo, okay?

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I don't know if I would go

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
that strong with it, but I, I

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
personally, I think Breath of the Wild is the best

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
3D Zelda they've ever made

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
and I don't know if that's just because

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
you know, maybe now I'm kinda more used to 3D

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
games, I've just accepted it as that's where we're

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
at, whereas, you know, when the Nintendo 64

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
was brand new, I was still, you know

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
I was kinda like, all these, these polygons are

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
so bulky, they're just like shapes

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
floating out there, and you know, all that type of stuff

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
I mean

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I do enjoy my fair share of 3D

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
games, I just

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
I just couldn't get into it, I'm like

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
I prefer my top

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
slash 2D Zelda games, now I

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
did play Breath of the Wild, and I did

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
like that, and

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
that game did one thing the other 3D

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
games did not do, it

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
actually mapped the button so Link could

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
jump

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Oh man, yeah

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I, I wish, uh

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
yeah, that, that's uh

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Link being able to jump is important

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Yeah

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I mean, this is a 3D game, he should be able to

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
like jump over, so I'm like, there

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
what do you mean, he can't

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
you know what, forget it

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
forget it, I'm like, nope

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
I, I, you know what, I even said

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
you know, I'm gonna give Ocarina

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Time another shot, so I went out

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
and got it on 3DS

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
I played it through

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
two hours in, I gave it the Mako

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
shot, I'm like here, you can have this, I don't

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
want it, I will play my 2D

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Zeldas till I can't play them anymore

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
What, what do you think about the whole

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
um, the announcement

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
or well, either the rumor I guess

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
that Legend of Zelda

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Link to the Past might be getting like

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
a 3D style

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
remake in the vein of the Link's

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Awakening remake, uh, what do you think

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
about that, like a 2D game kind of going to that

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
sub 3D type

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
of thing, what do you, what do you make of all that?

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Um, I don't know

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
if you saw my reaction, but when

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Nintendo announced uh, Link's Awakening

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
for the Switch, my,

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
I pretty much said, fuck

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I have to get a Switch now, fuck, I have to get a

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Switch now, it's like, there were

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
reasons why I needed, I was gonna get a Switch

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Yeah, um, I, you know, and we were talking

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
earlier about how like the Secret of Mana remake

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
you know, was kind of like a little bit hit and miss

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
but I, I kind of expect a certain quality

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
out of Nintendo, and so I think this

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
um, Link to the, you know, this Link's Awakening

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
for sure, but maybe even Link to the Past

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
is gonna be pretty, pretty

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
cool, it's gonna be up to a certain level, so I'm excited

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
about it

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Alright, for some reason

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I've lost your audio, are you still there with us, Rama?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Um,

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Okay, if you can hear us, we can't

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
hear you, I don't know if maybe

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Bobby's messing around with some permissions

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
live on air or what, but for some reason

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
we lost you, Rama, but thank you so much for the call

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
uh, and we'll talk to you next time, or everybody

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
should be listening to Anime Jam Session Tuesday night

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
here on the Voice Geeks Network

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Uh, meanwhile, I've got one more person

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
waiting, so let me bring this person in, hopefully this

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
person can talk, hi, you're on Orange Town's

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Radio, who's this?

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Hey, good, oh, we can't hear you

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
So that wasn't me

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
What's up, buddy?

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Hi, how are you?

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Yeah, it's been a while

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Uh, yeah, obviously you've noticed

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I haven't been on like

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
for god knows how long

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Probably more than a year, year and a half

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Everything's good, uh, just settling

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
in to my new digs

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I've been here for over

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
a year now

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
I mean, if you see the, yeah

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
I'm finally out of the city, I'm

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
excited about it

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
I'm in Westchester now, so

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
all things, you know, settling

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
in with my fiance and all

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
So, um, yeah, I just

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
uh, went to PAX last weekend

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
How was that?

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Uh, hit or miss

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Mostly, Thursday was probably the least

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
crowded day, I was actually able

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
to go to the show floor most, you know

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
hit up most of the booths, or a good

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
chunk of the booths

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
But it was mostly me just flying

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
and like, you know, just

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
But it was mostly me just flying and like

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
in Thrustmaster's booth

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
because they had DCS World in VR

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
And, you know

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
I love flying games, and I

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
won a headset because I shot

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
down, I shot down two

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Russian aircraft on an F-18

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
uh, simulator

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
with their fancy $500 joystick

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Oooh

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
That's like, that reminds me of the time

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
uh, it was years ago, it was when

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Final Fantasy XI was being

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
shown at E3

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
It wasn't new though, it was already out

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Maybe it was the year they were showing on 360, I don't remember

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
It was the first or second year I was ever at E3

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
But anyway, long story short, um, I won

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
some like, I think it was like a Ballista competition

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
or something like the PVTP they were doing

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I won some type of Final Fantasy XI thing, my team of eight

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
and then they spun a wheel to see

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
which person got to pick their prize first

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
and they thought for sure people would pick

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
the Nobuyamatsu CDs first

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
that were signed, but I was like, no

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
they were giving away a full on brand new motherboard

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
you remember that?

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
It was a motherboard processor thing

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
and I got that at E3

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
and that ended up being

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
the show computer later on

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
uh, at some point

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
so it was kind of funny the way that all worked out

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
so anyway

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Yeah, so, I mean, there was a lot of like

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
VR, most of the past couple of years

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
PAX has been mostly VR now

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
like, I don't know if you noticed

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
but a lot of uh

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
just lots of demo boosts

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
especially Facebook

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
you know, and their Oculus

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
their Oculus booths

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
like, literally capped almost every day

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
after Thursday

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I have to admit, I haven't been to PAX

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
in a little while because uh

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
you may have caught some of the shade I was throwing last week

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
but our feathers were ruffled a few years ago

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
and I wasn't super impressed with the show anyway

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
so I just haven't spent the money to go back in a while

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
um, I've been tempted to go to another one

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
but I would be curious to see

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
like, what it would

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
look like, and plus

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
honestly, like, a lot of my money

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
like, a lot of my convention money, I do DragonCon now

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
and I try to get to other, like, smaller conventions

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
so it's just, it's been hard to swing PAX

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
as well on top of all that, but never say never

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Yeah

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I mean, you're not missing much

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
all it is, is just like, it's a lot more

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
like, esports, uh

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
uh, you know, it's a lot more esports related

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
now, like, most of the boosts either

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
whether it's like, you know

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Twitch or Discord, they have

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
boots over there, apparently

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Facebook with, uh, Facebook Live

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
and Oculus, obviously, so it's a lot

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
more, it's a heavy emphasis on

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
esports now, and just streaming

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
So, so it's like

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
So go ahead

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I mean, I haven't gotten to that game yet

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
of whole, of streaming, I know

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
friends of mine who are definitely in that, uh

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
in Twitch, with their own channels and all

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
but, you know

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
that's what I've seen, it's like, either that

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
or TableTop

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Yes, I believe we're doing a Twitch show right now

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Um

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
But anyway, uh

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
So I, I kinda drug you into the conversation

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
about PAX and everything, but is there, is there something

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
you actually wanted to talk about tonight?

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Um, let me see

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Uh, I don't

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Uh, other than, uh

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Try to remember

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Like, I've been reading here and there, like

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I guess most of it is

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
just like, people, you know

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I remember, like

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
out of this whole, uh

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Me Too movement and the fact that actually

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
an incident similar to that happened last weekend

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
in PAX East, where

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
believe it or not, uh

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Magic the Gathering player got, like

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
one of the top players basically got dropped

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
out of the tournament

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
last minute because, uh, a lot of

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
uh, long story short, a lot of things

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
came out about his misogyny

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
and other nasty things

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
about women that he's, uh, the way he's treated

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
them, and so

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Yeah, and that, they didn't want that

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I, I haven't heard a lot of what's going on

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
but it sounds like the company, uh

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
didn't want to take the risk that this individual would win

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
and then some of that

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
is gonna reflect on them

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
because whoever wins that tournament is gonna

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
basically end up being an ambassador for the brand

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
and if there's a lot of these things that could

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
drag that down, you know

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
uh, I can see why the company wants

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
to make sure that doesn't happen

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Right, I mean, that's, that was

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I mean, I get it, like, you know

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
and then recalling, like, other

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I guess nowadays, it's like

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
you know, Twitch is

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
or, or, or just having exposure

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
in general just exposes you

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
you know, it

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
it scrutinizes all your actions that you make

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
like, it, if you were a dick

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
before streaming, then

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
chances are, you're walking on a tight

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
rope, basically

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
with your behavior, unless you change it

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
and, you know, obviously

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
with sponsorships and all

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
it's, you're putting yourself in a

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
precarious position where

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
any action that you may have done behind

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
the scenes before, you know

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
before streaming or becoming a

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
streamer, which I can't even believe that's

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
a profession now, and

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
and it's just like, you

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
you do things, it's your behavior

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
that ends up reflecting poorly

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
like, I don't know if you heard about this one

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
uh, you know, a couple of months back

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
where this streamer was playing Fortnite

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
and he was beating on the, on his

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
uh, I think it was his wife

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
or a significant other, while on the

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
stream, like literally being, like

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
off camera, just like beating the crap

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
out of, you know

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
just because he just, like he was

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
he was getting nagged by her and then he

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
was like, the way he's reacting

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
okay, so that's really gross and not something, I mean

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
it's, that's a gross, gross

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
incident, sure

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
yeah, it is, it's bad, it's

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
and it, and the thing is like

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Twitch only gave him a slap on the wrist

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
initially, until people

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
called Twitch out for the fact that

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
he wasn't, his channel

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
wasn't suspended permanently after two weeks

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
well, he also got arrested too

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
yeah, that too

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
but the fact of the matter is that Twitch gave him

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
like, you know, Twitch really

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
gave him a slap on the wrist initially

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
it wasn't until like, you know

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
public pressure

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
you know what's interesting, you know what's interesting is that there was a story

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
this week, and it didn't make our short roll tonight, but it was

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
about something about how like, Mixer

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
is really trying to figure out

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
how can we like, differentiate ourselves

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
from Twitch, and one of the things that

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Mixer is trying to put out there and kind of push

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
is that they want to be very much like an

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
anti-toxicity environment

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
and so they have some different rules

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
and was it, and you know, I, what's interesting

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
is that it would be interesting to see how Twitch

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
might ultimately respond to that, because I don't think

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Twitch necessarily wants to be known as like, we love

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
toxicity, I don't think so, I think it's one

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
of those, you know, maybe, and I don't

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
I don't know enough about the situation, I don't want to

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
defend it, or either way, but maybe just Twitch

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
needed a minute to kind of assess like,

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
what do we do, because maybe we haven't been in the situation

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
before, we don't have a clear policy

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
let's hope Twitch has learned from that

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
and on that note, we talk about learning from

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
things, I think that

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
you know, when we talk about what people have done in their

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
past versus what they're doing now

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I think a very important question to ask is

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
you know, we're considering, do we

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
cancel somebody over what they said 10 years

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
ago, and this whole thing, I think you're gonna

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
have to look at a situation like that and go, but it does sound like

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
the person like, wants to do better, are they

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
learning, are they apologizing, do they

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
realize why what they said was shitty

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
and now they're acting

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
differently, or do they

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
show that they don't give a fuck, and

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
that whole type of thing, and I think a lot of that

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
sometimes weighs into

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
how people might respond

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
to a particular situation

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
you know, obviously these issues

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
that you bring up are a way bigger

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
you know, cultural issue than probably something

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
we can really sink into in 3 hours

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
here on OLR, but you know

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
you are correct that we are moving

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
more and more into a time frame

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
where things are

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
documented, so why on

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
earth you'd want to

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
take physical action on your spouse

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
which why on earth you'd want to do that ever

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
is one question, but then to do that

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
in an environment where it's recorded

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
gross, even if it's a

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
joke, not funny, you know

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
it's like, what the hell, you know

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
I mean, if we're getting into the place where more and more

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
things are recorded, you have to kinda

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
make sure you're saying

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
good things, and being a good person

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
and putting positive stuff out there where you can

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
sociopaths don't care

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
well right, there's always gonna be a few bad eggs

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
but you know, I'm just

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
I don't know, I don't know, I mean

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
the way I see it is that we're at an age where

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
like, you know

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
probably like, like 10 years

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
ago you didn't have this type of scene

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
where people are making a living off

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
of just streaming and just playing Fortnite

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
for example, and then

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
it brings out the, you know

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
the bad elements, like you have certain

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
individuals who haven't

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
haven't been conditioned

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
to, you know

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
behave in a certain way, or they're

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
basically just assholes inherently

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
and as a result, you see their true colors

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
in the way they obsess over

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
what they're trying to do versus

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
you know, the other things that

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
kind of like, push them

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
to the brink and cause them to act out

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
differently in front of a

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
live studio, you know, live audience

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
from that, and we've, you know, hopefully moved on

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
and at the end of the day, trying to do

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
a positive thing, but anyway

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Zaku is good to hear from you, and I'm glad to

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
hear you had a good time at PAX

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
ish, and I hope to

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
hear from you again, don't be a stranger

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Yup, definitely

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Take care buddy, have a good one

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
You too, bye

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Alright, always good to hear from Zaku

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
here, so going to our

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
chat, let's see

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Oh

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Gosh, that's a really sick story, I don't even want to repeat

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
that story, it's really sick, alright, just what some

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
people do on

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
stream to maybe tug at people's heart

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
strings, and it's sad, because

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
then it like, ruins it for everybody else

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
It's just, blah, anyway

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Alright, well trying to do good things here at Orange

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Lounge Radio, we are the show where every gamer

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
has a voice, you know, as long as you're not

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
being a jerk and hurting

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
other people's feelings and stuff like that, you know, we

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
want positivity at the end of the day

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Doesn't mean we can't be critical of the things

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
we love, like EA insisting

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
on using that Frostbite engine

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
It's a bad decision, it's not

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
you know, we can call

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
that out, but it's all

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
in how you do it and what you say when you do it

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Anyway, hope

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
you guys enjoyed this episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
and if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Radio, please tell a friend or two

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
has a voice, but

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
you know, we can only share those voices if they're

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
actually here to share with other people

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
So we encourage you to tell a friend

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
or five about the show

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
The hosts on Twitch, like if you put

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
VoG network on your auto host list, that goes a long way

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Really appreciate that type of stuff

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
All the tweets, all that is great, and thank you guys

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
so much for helping to spread the word

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
So I think I'm gonna go around now

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
and get everybody's final thoughts for the night

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
My final thought is

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
I'm going to build

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
the Labo thing this week and

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
I don't know, I'll

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
try to get my

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
edits to work, that's really what

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
it's been down to, it's like

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
I know how that format works more than

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
probably anybody, and

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
yet it's not working

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
It's frustrating, because it should work

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
It's just not

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
My final thought is

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
sorry for the mic issues, but the joys of live

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
radio and what we do here, thank you guys

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
for participating in our live little radio

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
program, and

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
I can't wait for the Harry Potter

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
game to come out already, Wizards Unite

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
My location-based

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
gaming is ready for one more

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
They haven't said when

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
I'm hoping the summer time, but

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
yeah, and

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Darzaga, last but not least, your final thought

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
I'm happy that Star Trek Online plays on a Mac

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
and give me bursters

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Alright, can do

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange on Trado

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Thank you guys again so much for tuning in and participating

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
We will see you back here in 7 days

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
