00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
This week, the team behind Rage 2 lean into Walmart Canada's League with some advice

00:17.880 --> 00:19.760
in all its pastel spray-painted glory.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.320
This is just one embargo to turn Lemons into Lemonade.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.320
Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where

00:25.320 --> 00:28.000
every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.040
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:34.040 --> 00:37.680
and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.680 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 774, oh, title's wrong on Twitch,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.460
for this April the 28th of 2019.

00:48.460 --> 00:53.300
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio, welcome back to the show this week,

00:53.300 --> 00:54.720
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.720
Oh, hi.

00:55.720 --> 00:56.720
Hello, how are you?

00:56.720 --> 01:00.320
So you had a week off and how did everything go with that?

01:00.320 --> 01:01.700
It was really good.

01:01.700 --> 01:06.960
It was the 40th anniversary for the San Francisco Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and it was

01:06.960 --> 01:11.920
also our conclave so we had nuns from all over the world.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.400
I had a super fun time hanging out with French nuns.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.440
They were cool and we actually had a satyr for Passover in the middle of Hamburger Mary's.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.440
Oh, that's really cute.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.660
It was a really fast satyr and I had been holding onto the bag of stuff through like

01:25.860 --> 01:30.340
the Pink Moon ritual and all kinds of stuff that was happening and we just had a great

01:30.340 --> 01:31.340
time.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.340
It was really fun.

01:32.340 --> 01:36.100
I didn't go on like some of the big events but I went out for what I could and then I

01:36.100 --> 01:38.820
had my birthday on Friday last week.

01:38.820 --> 01:39.820
Happy birthday.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.100
Thank you.

01:41.100 --> 01:46.380
And I went to the Cherry Blossom Festival and got way overwhelmed with humans but I

01:46.380 --> 01:53.460
went to look at the Paper Doll exhibits and I watched JD play Karta and I ended up kind

01:53.460 --> 01:58.420
of playing a little bit with him over his shoulder just because I could read decently.

01:58.420 --> 02:03.220
And what's funny is that the people there, you can read, I'm like, a bit, a bit, see

02:03.220 --> 02:04.220
that much?

02:04.220 --> 02:05.220
Yeah.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.220
It's enough to squeeze Pikachu's head.

02:06.220 --> 02:09.220
But yeah, it was pretty fun.

02:09.220 --> 02:10.220
We had a good time.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.620
It was great hanging out with JD.

02:11.620 --> 02:15.700
I made good friends with their roommate Connie.

02:15.700 --> 02:19.020
She gave me a Lolita dress that fits me perfectly.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.020
It's beautiful.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.020
How fun.

02:21.020 --> 02:22.680
It's nice to make new friends through friends and all that.

02:22.680 --> 02:27.100
I wore a full Lolita at the park, at Dolores Park.

02:27.100 --> 02:31.440
I mean, in a way, you and I became friends through mutual friends at the time.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.800
So hey, it's a meeting, meeting friends through friends is the best way to do it.

02:34.800 --> 02:35.800
Nord stuff.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.800
Nord stuff.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.860
Also a friend that we met around that same time many years ago.

02:38.860 --> 02:40.920
Say hello to Techmaster Loki here in studio with us.

02:40.920 --> 02:41.920
Hello.

02:41.920 --> 02:42.920
Hi, how are you?

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
I'm fine.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.120
Are you enjoying this lovely soundtrack we have coming from next door's party?

02:47.120 --> 02:48.120
Yes.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.040
Someday I'll be invited to the party.

02:51.040 --> 02:55.240
So here's the deal, which by the way, we can't see Loki a little bit when you lean too far

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
forward.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.240
We don't need to see me.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.240
It's fine.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.240
You saw me last week.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
Most of the time.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.240
I'm just working on shit.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.240
So here's the deal.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
And I hope it's not picking up on the mics.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.040
I don't think it is because the mics gain, and you see this on Twitch, we have to get

03:07.040 --> 03:08.240
really close to the mics.

03:08.240 --> 03:11.880
So I don't think the music, but let me tell you, if you were sitting in this room, you

03:11.880 --> 03:16.800
could pretty much hear the song like it was playing softly on the TV or something.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.400
Our neighbors are having some type of raging party next door.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.800
I don't know what there is to celebrate.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.080
I don't know if it's like Game of Thrones or Avengers Endgame.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
Everybody's dying.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
Whoa.

03:26.080 --> 03:31.480
I think it's probably just like, maybe it's a, maybe it's early Cinco de Mayo, but like

03:31.480 --> 03:32.480
I literally, okay.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.080
So I literally like right at the end of Bobby's show there, right before he called us, I actually

03:36.080 --> 03:40.120
had to send Bobby a message that says, don't call me yet because I need to go next door.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.120
We have like an urgent situation.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.120
Cause it was even worse.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.320
Like it was louder a minute ago.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.520
And like, I knew I like, like, I'm like Jamie's closest to the window.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.520
It's going to drive her bonkers.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.720
I can't hear the music down, especially since I've been fighting off a headache all day.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.760
So I was like, all right, I'm just going to go over.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.760
So I went over there and like the, the fence was wide open.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.360
So I just walked right back there, invited myself to their party.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.200
And it was just like, hi, I'm the neighbor.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.320
We're trying to do some recording, you know, and I asked nicely and they did, I mean, it's

04:07.320 --> 04:11.000
still loud, but they definitely turned it down from where it was at, but yeah, good.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.520
I'm glad you guys in chat.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.520
Can't hear it.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.160
And of course we don't want to hear this shit.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.160
I know.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.160
It's just boom.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.160
Anyway.

04:18.320 --> 04:23.200
Of course we do tape live at Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network at six o'clock Pacific,

04:23.200 --> 04:27.440
nine o'clock Eastern every week, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.560
And we're, he's always kind enough to have us on at the very end of the show, even when

04:31.560 --> 04:34.040
I have to tell him, Hey, hold on a minute.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.600
I have to go be that crazy old man that yells at the neighbors to get to turn down that

04:37.600 --> 04:38.600
racket.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.600
So they're on the roof.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.600
I mean, are they up on the roof?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.600
They were on the roof.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.600
Yeah.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.600
Is that where they smoked their marijuana?

04:44.600 --> 04:45.600
No, they were dancing.

04:46.040 --> 04:50.680
Because you know, because you know, it's a party and we're crazy.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.240
I hope they die.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.240
You know?

04:53.240 --> 04:54.240
No, don't.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.240
We don't.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.240
I don't.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.240
I don't need a scene over at the neighbor's house.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.240
You don't need a scene.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
Yeah.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.240
Girl.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.240
I can make a scene.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.480
Anyway, you are making a scene over there.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.760
What do you need to tell the Twitch?

05:04.760 --> 05:09.080
And I apologize to the podcast folks, cause you can't see all this vibrant color and like

05:09.080 --> 05:14.280
tissue paper and cards and all these things that, so you are, you're not wrapping your

05:14.280 --> 05:15.280
own gifts.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
No, no, no.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.200
So, and y'all need to sign the card for mama, but, um, I will on a break, not while we're

05:21.200 --> 05:22.200
trying to do a show.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.800
It's Charlotte's birthday as in the Mel's little girl.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.800
She's going to be one.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.960
So of course she won't remember any of this shit, but I got her a little cute toy and

05:30.960 --> 05:36.560
some sensory goods and um, I got stuff for mom too cause mama could probably use some

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
chocolate.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
Yes.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
Oh, that's very kind of you.

05:39.560 --> 05:44.840
She, she works really hard and really, I usually say like the first birthdays are really more

05:44.840 --> 05:50.520
for mama and daddy than the baby because the baby is going to go, Ooh, I can smash

05:50.520 --> 05:51.520
this.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.520
And then that's it.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.840
I think, I think she had mentioned something too about not to like spoil everything at

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
this upcoming party.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
Sorry.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
Sorry if you're listening.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.480
Um, but I think she mentioned that the baby was getting their own cake.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.000
I think this is the thing they do.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.480
Like you get a cake, just a little like, it's like the, the one slice you might buy at the

06:07.480 --> 06:12.120
supermarket and that's specifically for the baby to smash while everybody else eats the

06:12.120 --> 06:13.120
real cake.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.120
Well, right.

06:14.400 --> 06:19.080
Usually it's, uh, I think we've done like a cupcake or like a smaller cake, but yeah,

06:19.080 --> 06:22.540
cause they're babies and they have no motor control and they're going to smash it into

06:22.540 --> 06:23.540
their face.

06:23.540 --> 06:24.540
Sure.

06:24.540 --> 06:28.680
So it's, it's just like, Oh, like how gross he is or she is to show them when they're

06:28.680 --> 06:30.560
18 and put in the high school yearbook.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.560
Yeah, sure.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.560
That's still a thing people do.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.560
Right.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.560
I don't know.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
Is that a, my show my age again?

06:35.560 --> 06:36.560
You never did that in my yearbook.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.560
Really?

06:37.560 --> 06:39.240
No, they did it in our yearbook and no one gave a shit.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.000
My mom always threatened to put the fig leaf picture in the yearbook.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.920
She always, she always said, I'm going to put the fig leaf picture in the yearbook if

06:44.920 --> 06:49.080
you don't behave because I guess they, you know, cause this is this, I mean now it sounds

06:49.080 --> 06:51.320
like kind of, but in the seventies, this is what people did.

06:51.320 --> 06:55.800
Uh, when I was like a year old, I was running around the backyard completely buck ass naked

06:55.800 --> 06:59.820
and somebody decided to take a picture of me with just a little fig leaf holding up.

06:59.820 --> 07:05.120
So um, yeah, so luckily that picture did not get put in the yearbook cause you know, Travis

07:05.120 --> 07:07.720
Donovan would have put it all over the air when he had a show.

07:07.760 --> 07:13.480
Uh, so that picture, um, is probably still at my parents' place and uh, if I have anything

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
to say about it, we'll be burned.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.920
But I was like, I was a year old, come on.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.720
So uh, they, they picked a different picture instead.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.400
Probably something, I think me on the computer at five years old and there's a picture of

07:23.400 --> 07:26.520
me at five years old sitting next to the Commodore 64 being such a nerd.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.640
I just have the, just the default senior picture that we had to take next, leaning against

07:30.640 --> 07:31.640
the tree, you know?

07:31.640 --> 07:32.640
Oh yeah.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.640
We didn't have anything like that.

07:33.640 --> 07:38.800
They put us in these like half dress things from the waist up and the men in like, like

07:38.800 --> 07:45.080
suit bibs and took our picture with that and it was just in front of like some stupid nineties

07:45.080 --> 07:46.080
background screen.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.120
But I was like, I don't care cause it's black.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.120
It was goth.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.120
That's all you needed.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.120
All right.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.680
Anyway, uh, we are of course a show that talks about video game.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.680
Believe it or not.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.680
I mean it's a long show though.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.160
So sometimes we get into our personal lives too.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.880
Uh, we talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.320
So let's get into some video game talk.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.640
And besides my senior year, I was working on yearbook staff, so none of that shit would

08:06.640 --> 08:08.640
have slid by.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
Well okay.

08:09.640 --> 08:13.680
My senior year, a video game that came out that, uh, everybody was talking about was

08:13.680 --> 08:16.320
Mortal Kombat on the Super Nintendo.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.640
And that's when they replaced all the blood with sweat, right?

08:18.640 --> 08:23.600
So here we are so many years later where that would have been like 96 and now here we are,

08:23.600 --> 08:25.880
maybe that was even like 95 might've been before my senior year.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.160
But here we are all these years later now in 2019 and we are now on the, if you can

08:29.160 --> 08:33.720
believe it, 11th Mortal Kombat game came out this week, Mortal Kombat 11.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.240
I watched the whole, uh, story mode.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.240
Yeah.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.720
I think a lot of people have been, uh, kind of playing that on Twitch, the story mode.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.920
I know, I know Alan's kind of been watching the story mode as well, which, um, that must

08:45.920 --> 08:49.240
be a thing that developers don't like so much.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.080
So I was just like, thank you.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.200
I kind of dug how they did it because the rest of this was like, what the hell were

08:55.200 --> 08:59.000
you thinking in all the previous Mortal Kombat, at least what were you thinking?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.280
So I'm pleased with this one.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.560
The last Mortal Kombat game I really played was nine or the, the reboot, if you will,

09:05.560 --> 09:06.880
that they just called Mortal Kombat.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.080
Um, and I liked how they kind of redid the story and you went through the first three

09:11.080 --> 09:16.160
games again, but it was with a, with a twist and, um, yeah, well the game is how old at

09:16.160 --> 09:18.000
this point, I'm not going to be spoiling anything.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.320
Uh, basically Raiden has a vision and so it kind of goes back and small corrections happen

09:23.320 --> 09:28.620
that caused this, like, you know, that butterfly effect sequence of events that change things.

09:28.620 --> 09:32.580
We turned the blood, the sweat, and then it just went right from there.

09:32.580 --> 09:35.900
So anyway, uh, and I, those of you guys have been listening to orange on studio for a while.

09:35.900 --> 09:41.320
No, like this last, like I played Mortal Kombat nine and I was like, okay, this is fun.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.740
It's a little nasty, but whatever.

09:42.740 --> 09:46.820
And then around the time of this last, this Mortal Kombat X, which the 10th game and they

09:46.820 --> 09:50.820
called it X, uh, even though I know that's one of Jamie's pet peeves, but no, because

09:50.820 --> 09:55.700
when people talk about an iPhone X, it's an iPhone 10 in marketing, right?

09:56.580 --> 09:58.580
Or Final Fantasy 10.

09:58.580 --> 10:02.220
But in, but in the case of nether realm, they said, we know it's Mortal Kombat 10, but we're

10:02.220 --> 10:03.580
calling it Mortal Kombat X.

10:03.580 --> 10:06.100
So they like specifically said, this is the name.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.380
So, um, that was the game when I started to see the fatality of it.

10:09.380 --> 10:12.920
So I was like, all right, look, this is a bit much.

10:12.920 --> 10:16.420
So I kind of, I ended up just kind of when you turned into your mom, I also just kind

10:16.420 --> 10:17.880
of just ended up passing on the game.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.880
I didn't.

10:18.880 --> 10:23.940
So the 11th game came out and you know, Alan really loves this stuff and he'll show me

10:24.180 --> 10:25.180
the YouTube.

10:25.180 --> 10:26.940
He'll make me watch the YouTube and I'll watch it.

10:26.940 --> 10:33.340
I saw the one just today where the dude kicks somebody into a big sand pile and then like

10:33.340 --> 10:36.860
rips off the whole front of the it's gross.

10:36.860 --> 10:38.860
It's so disgusting.

10:38.860 --> 10:39.860
But here's the thing.

10:39.860 --> 10:41.740
I actually kind of thought about it.

10:41.740 --> 10:42.740
Okay.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.180
I actually considered buying Mortal Kombat 11.

10:45.180 --> 10:46.180
I really did.

10:46.180 --> 10:49.040
Even though I'm, I'm kind of like, I think I might be over it.

10:49.040 --> 10:54.480
I still like it as a fighting game, which is why I really like injustice and injustice

10:54.480 --> 10:58.400
too, because that is basically Mortal Kombat, but without all of that.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
Right.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.160
And it's, you know, it's Batman and all the, all his friends.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.680
So, you know, it's a little bit different.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.560
So I like the injustice games quite a bit actually.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.980
But I thought about getting Mortal Kombat 11 because I was like, you know what?

11:07.980 --> 11:09.960
I don't have to do the fatalities.

11:09.960 --> 11:14.560
And even if I see one online, whatever, like it's, I think we blow it out of proportion

11:14.560 --> 11:17.540
a little bit on this show, how sensitive I really am to that stuff.

11:17.540 --> 11:21.700
It's not like I can't like just roll my eyes or, you know, look away if it's that nasty.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.020
It's like, whatever.

11:23.020 --> 11:28.340
But I got to tell you in hearing some of this stuff about Mortal Kombat 11, I, I, I had

11:28.340 --> 11:29.340
pause.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.540
I didn't end up wanting to drop $60 on this game.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.940
After all, I kind of ended up having pause with that.

11:34.940 --> 11:39.780
And part of that is this controversy going on with the grinding and the difficulty of

11:39.780 --> 11:40.780
Mortal Kombat 11.

11:40.780 --> 11:44.100
Uh, I don't know if you're up on this as well, Loki, or what you've heard about this dark

11:44.100 --> 11:47.180
Sakura because you said you were interested in this game to dark soccer, right?

11:47.180 --> 11:50.940
Well, because as to my favorite lady voice actors in it, well, I know it ain't Ronda

11:50.940 --> 11:51.940
Rousey.

11:51.940 --> 11:52.940
No.

11:52.940 --> 11:53.940
Oh, that she wasn't bad as Sonia.

11:53.940 --> 11:54.940
Really?

11:54.940 --> 11:58.260
You're the first person I've heard say anything remotely kind about her performance, but Jennifer

11:58.260 --> 11:59.260
Hale is Kronica.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.260
Okay.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.260
Well, okay.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.460
And Cetrion is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.460
Really?

12:03.460 --> 12:04.460
Yep.

12:04.460 --> 12:05.460
Oh, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

12:05.460 --> 12:11.020
Can't you just tell it from hearing her because she uses the same very sultry singing.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.020
I didn't watch the story mode.

12:12.020 --> 12:16.780
Like she, she talks like she does in the songs in silent Hill.

12:16.780 --> 12:17.780
Interesting.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.780
Well, that's pretty cool.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.780
Yeah.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.780
Three and four.

12:20.780 --> 12:21.780
Sorry.

12:21.780 --> 12:22.780
I should have said, so here's the thing.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.820
Most everybody is like, you know, it's a good game.

12:24.820 --> 12:25.820
It's Mortal Kombat.

12:25.820 --> 12:26.820
It's a good fighter.

12:26.820 --> 12:27.820
Yes.

12:27.820 --> 12:30.500
It's gross and over the top, but if you're playing Mortal Kombat, what all do you expect

12:30.500 --> 12:31.500
now?

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
Whole thing.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.500
Right.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.220
And I'm not talking about, there was, there was a review controversy that came up on discord

12:35.220 --> 12:41.940
about how one particular, um, reviewer said, uh, the fatalities were too much.

12:41.940 --> 12:45.100
But I, and then he went, the, the reviewer actually went back and corrected it to say

12:45.100 --> 12:48.360
the fatal blows because I think they were actually talking about that mechanic that

12:48.360 --> 12:50.620
replaced the x-ray attacks from the last game I played.

12:50.620 --> 12:51.620
Yeah.

12:51.620 --> 12:52.620
Yeah.

12:52.620 --> 12:56.440
And I was like, all right, well like in that context, I think the dude, but like of course

12:56.440 --> 13:00.340
everybody on Twitter is like, if you can't handle fatalities, what are you doing playing

13:00.340 --> 13:01.840
Mortal Kombat?

13:01.840 --> 13:03.620
And honestly, I got to say this.

13:03.620 --> 13:09.340
I think one of the reasons even I got burned out on the fatalities, like when I enjoyed

13:09.340 --> 13:14.360
fatalities and they made me laugh, like Mortal Kombat two, they were very cartoony.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.460
They were very stupid and they were very fast.

13:17.460 --> 13:18.460
That was the thing, right?

13:18.460 --> 13:24.900
Like uppercut fall in the pool of acid skeleton comes up, set up, execution done, right?

13:24.900 --> 13:25.900
It was fast.

13:25.900 --> 13:26.900
It was done.

13:26.900 --> 13:32.060
And now in like Mortal Kombat 11, these, these fatalities, they're drawn out.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.060
They're excessive.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.060
It is.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.060
It isn't open.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.060
What is this?

13:36.060 --> 13:37.060
Knights of the round?

13:37.060 --> 13:38.060
It is.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.060
It's Knights of the round of death.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.060
It is immortal combat.

13:40.060 --> 13:42.900
And I got to say, like, I kind of had that epiphany this week.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.940
I'm like, I think that may actually be a part of the problem I'm having with the fatalities

13:46.940 --> 13:51.820
is it's just so fucking drawn out and you know, it's this big thing.

13:51.820 --> 13:56.420
So when I initially read the review and even I was reading it in the context of like fatalities

13:56.420 --> 13:57.420
are too much.

13:57.420 --> 14:02.520
I'm like, actually, if you think about it, that maybe the fatalities are just too fucking

14:02.520 --> 14:09.760
long and just like, like, just maybe we've hit that line of like, it just wrap it up

14:09.760 --> 14:10.760
already type of thing.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.060
Like I can actually, I think the reviewer is free to make a point.

14:14.060 --> 14:18.900
It's not like they take the game out of it or said like seven out of 10, too much water.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.540
I think they ended up giving it a four out of five at the end of the day.

14:21.540 --> 14:26.100
So you know, whatever anyway, but here's, and here's the real problem.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.520
Why reviewers are deducting a star.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.520
This is the real problem.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.480
And the thing I think is worth talking about fatality thing, whatever y'all are going to

14:32.480 --> 14:35.400
have opinions on that, we're all going to have to agree to disagree on how I feel about

14:35.400 --> 14:37.000
the violence and all that stuff.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.840
But it's this thing about the towers of combat in Mortal Kombat and the currency that you

14:43.840 --> 14:48.080
get from these towers of combat that allow you to go to the crypt.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.000
And the crypt was in previous Mortal Kombat games.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.880
Like I remember a Mortal Kombat game I had on GameCube, I don't know if it was Deception

14:53.880 --> 14:54.880
or Deadly Alliance.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.400
And you go into the krypt and you can unlock, but you could go on the internet and look

14:58.400 --> 15:02.600
at the FAQ and it would tell you exactly what's in every gravestone in the crypt.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.960
So you would just go get what you want.

15:03.960 --> 15:08.760
And that's that you can't do that in Mortal Kombat 11 because they've randomized everybody's

15:08.760 --> 15:12.040
prey and some of the currency that you use.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.760
You get, you know, you get from playing the game, which you have to play a lot of the

15:14.760 --> 15:19.640
game and you get it in these, these time towers basically, and they're rotating challenges,

15:19.640 --> 15:23.080
but it sounds like a lot of the challenges, and again, I'm going to fully admit I haven't

15:23.080 --> 15:24.080
played the game.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.640
I'm only going off of what I read on the internet.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.880
And I want you guys to chime in, especially if you have played, is it sounds like a lot

15:29.880 --> 15:34.480
of these challenges are bullshit, like, you know, projectiles getting put, like things

15:34.480 --> 15:37.480
that kind of cancel each other out and don't make sense.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.480
And it's really hard.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.860
And so it's kind of nudging you to buy the currency to go in the crypt.

15:42.860 --> 15:47.160
And then it's like, you got to spend a ton of money to do this when it's a little bit

15:47.160 --> 15:52.720
shady on when you consider the fact that you've already dropped 60, 70, maybe a hundred dollars

15:52.720 --> 15:56.080
if you bought the version already has the DLC on this game in the first place, it's

15:56.080 --> 15:58.440
like, it just wants more money from you.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.440
Right.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.760
And now when I, Alan and I were discussing this earlier this week and he said, well,

16:02.760 --> 16:05.080
I mean, how's that different from Overwatch?

16:05.080 --> 16:09.140
Nothing you're getting in the crypt is, you know, anything but cosmetic.

16:09.140 --> 16:10.760
And it's just like loot boxes and Overwatch.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.760
Right.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.800
And I'm kind of like, whatever, whatever.

16:13.800 --> 16:19.260
But I mean, it's, it still feels like it's almost like the difficulty of it has left

16:19.260 --> 16:25.300
it to be a little bit exploitative almost now, to be fair.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.380
And I'm sure, and I, I'm not even looking at chat just yet.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.460
I need to bring that up because I'm sure some of you have comments to be fair.

16:30.460 --> 16:33.260
And nether realm has come out this week and mentioned, we hear the feedback.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.660
We know it's too difficult and they are starting to put out some patches that are a going to

16:37.660 --> 16:39.760
tone down the difficulty of this a little bit.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.500
And B I think it's going to reward players that already have the game with some like

16:43.500 --> 16:47.940
currency, just like free currency as a, you know, thank you for putting up with this bullshit

16:47.940 --> 16:48.940
type of thing.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.940
You know, a Goodwill gesture, but it's not going to be enough currency to buy everything,

16:51.940 --> 16:53.700
but it'll be enough to kind of like get a taste.

16:53.700 --> 16:59.100
So they're, they're kind of trying to balance that, but you know, I'm pretty sure these

16:59.100 --> 17:01.980
games are pretty extensively tested and so forth.

17:01.980 --> 17:07.740
You've got to think they didn't know that some of this was way too hard going into it.

17:07.740 --> 17:11.040
Like are the testers just too good at the game?

17:11.040 --> 17:13.940
It's weird that they didn't figure that out before the game hit the market.

17:13.940 --> 17:14.940
What's up with that?

17:14.940 --> 17:15.940
Any of you guys have thoughts on that?

17:15.940 --> 17:16.940
Oh, they knew.

17:16.940 --> 17:17.940
They knew.

17:17.940 --> 17:23.940
Well, first basically it's to push it as far as they can and it's, it's based on backlash

17:23.940 --> 17:29.640
really cause they can adjust that stuff on the flyer, make adjustments to it to kind

17:29.640 --> 17:35.820
of balance out the grind versus whatever, but in the end it's to basically, I'm assuming

17:35.820 --> 17:38.140
they sell the currency as well.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.740
You can grind for it or you can buy it.

17:39.740 --> 17:43.660
And so the whole point is to make it inconvenient so you want to buy it.

17:43.660 --> 17:44.660
Okay.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.780
And I need to, I need to correct something that in the way I explained it, thank you

17:46.780 --> 17:47.780
chat.

17:47.780 --> 17:51.240
And again, I said from the beginning, I haven't played the game and these are some of my reservations

17:51.240 --> 17:52.240
about it.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.240
This whole Crip thing.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.620
So I'm being corrected that the currency isn't to unlock things in the crypt.

17:57.620 --> 18:00.340
So a fifth dream today says you can't buy the currency.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.940
It's not possible.

18:01.940 --> 18:06.020
And a shad stars X and chat saying, yeah, currency is impossible to buy.

18:06.020 --> 18:11.500
Fifth dream says you buy the crystals to pay for a random selection of cosmetics.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.480
So you're not using the currency that you buy to open the stuff in the crypt.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.480
You use it to buy, essentially, it sounds like a loot box.

18:18.480 --> 18:23.400
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I, even though you guys are getting me on a technicality,

18:23.400 --> 18:29.240
I mean, come on, they're still encouraging you to use currency to get stuff, right?

18:29.240 --> 18:33.200
And you see all these articles about, Oh, if you want to buy stuff, it's thousands of

18:33.200 --> 18:37.640
dollars to get all the other DLC characters too.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.640
So that's going to be a thing that's coming as well.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.720
I'm sure this had a season pass.

18:42.720 --> 18:46.640
So there's, there's a lot of nickel and diamond going on here.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.720
That's just, it's, that's gaming nowadays.

18:49.720 --> 18:55.000
And ultimately, you know what, now we're back with where I was at with mortal combat X because

18:55.000 --> 18:59.960
all my drama about fatalities and that aside, I almost wanted to pick up mortal combat X.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.200
I ultimately didn't do it cause Alan got it.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.800
So I didn't have to, um, but I almost picked it up, but I was like, you know what, I'm

19:07.800 --> 19:12.600
going to wait for the inevitable end of the year edition or, or year gold year edition,

19:12.600 --> 19:13.600
right?

19:13.600 --> 19:14.600
Game of the year, the year that's it.

19:14.600 --> 19:18.260
You cause you know, and it's the same thing will happen here too come.

19:18.260 --> 19:22.240
And especially with it releasing kind of early this year, come November, they're going to

19:22.240 --> 19:27.760
put out a version that has all the DLC already included some of this cosmetic currency stuff

19:27.760 --> 19:28.960
and the base game.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.920
And that will cost maybe 50, 40 who knows, who knows?

19:33.920 --> 19:34.920
Sales.

19:34.920 --> 19:35.920
Absolutely.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.820
It'll be like half off probably in a few months.

19:38.820 --> 19:43.280
So I just, I don't feel the need to buy it now.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.420
And it's kind of, and I'm going to, I'm just putting it out there just because I feel it's

19:47.420 --> 19:52.680
worth saying if I hadn't heard about all this nickel and diming stuff, you know, DLC characters

19:52.680 --> 19:58.400
is one thing, but all this, I probably, I probably would have done it, but now I'm pausing

19:58.400 --> 19:59.400
a little bit.

19:59.400 --> 20:04.160
Now I'm pausing to say like, maybe I'm going to wait until I get a little more bang for

20:04.160 --> 20:06.200
my buck for that 60 bucks.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.200
Yeah.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.200
Thoughts.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
I mean, where, where's your head out with Mortal Kombat?

20:09.200 --> 20:10.200
Loki.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.280
I don't know if I'm not interested in it at all.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.760
So it makes no difference to me what it costs.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.760
So I don't want to play it.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.440
I, I'll be honest.

20:19.440 --> 20:26.360
I don't really have the, the hand strength to play a fighting game well anymore.

20:26.360 --> 20:33.720
Um, so for me, I I've gotten everything I want to see watching on YouTube, you know,

20:33.720 --> 20:36.800
if they did like, here's the movie version of it.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.880
That's a whole nother thing though, is about now it's, it's interesting because I feel

20:39.880 --> 20:44.640
like Mortal Kombat, I've heard more than any other game recently about how people are kind

20:44.640 --> 20:51.760
of just playing it on YouTube essentially, which to be fair, kind of lends credit to

20:51.760 --> 20:57.880
maybe why Netherrealm feels they've got to really milk the people playing it for a little

20:57.880 --> 21:01.280
extra cash here and there is because they're losing money on people just kind of watching

21:01.280 --> 21:02.280
the story.

21:02.280 --> 21:06.120
I don't think you're doing anything wrong, but it's just a reality of gaming in 2019.

21:06.120 --> 21:11.600
And how do we make a game that makes money anyway?

21:11.600 --> 21:16.160
Somebody buy me time because I want to, because the chat is saying, okay, go ahead.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.160
Yeah.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.000
But I'll be perfectly honest.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.360
Um, I, I don't necessarily see it that way because really most of the people who are

21:23.360 --> 21:28.400
going to be interested in playing it are putting out the money there and are buying the DLC.

21:28.400 --> 21:34.080
You know, it's like the same model where you have, um, in fact, we were talking about

21:34.080 --> 21:38.200
this at work just the other day where, you know, you've got all these free to play games

21:38.200 --> 21:43.440
and you know, you have 80% of the people out there who are not buying, you know, extra

21:43.440 --> 21:45.400
points or extra time or anything.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.440
And then you have the rabid 20% that are putting out all the money.

21:49.440 --> 21:55.280
And so they, they should take into account their in their price point, the portion that

21:55.280 --> 21:56.480
is going to pay for it.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.160
You know, you are going to have freeloaders like me, and then you're going to have people

22:00.160 --> 22:03.880
who are just base game and then you're going to have the people who are going to put out

22:03.880 --> 22:05.760
the money because they're enthusiasts.

22:05.760 --> 22:06.760
Okay.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.520
Let me make sure I represent this correctly.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.400
So I'm just going to read, I don't usually do this, I'm going to read word for word from

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
this article.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.080
So I'm going to give credit to VG247.com.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.080
Thank you.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.080
I'm sorry.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.080
I'm, but I just, I want to make sure we get it right.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
Okay.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
So here it is.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.960
So, uh, it will cost you plenty if you want to acquire every skin available in the game.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.960
There are 23 characters presently in each offer 60 different skins.

22:27.960 --> 22:31.360
According to someone who did the math over on Reddit, a poster crunched some numbers

22:31.360 --> 22:36.640
and according to the math, it will apparently cost you $6,440 in real money to buy every

22:36.640 --> 22:37.800
skin currently available.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.760
Four of the skins can be unlocked by playing through the character tutorials, story and

22:41.760 --> 22:47.280
basic towers that leaves 56 skins to unlock skins are unlocked just by playing the game

22:47.280 --> 22:52.280
or they can seemingly be purchased using in game currency called time crystals.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.880
Time crystals can also be earned through gameplay, but seem to amass slowly.

22:56.880 --> 23:02.400
If you are the impatient sort or just really want a particular skin, you can purchase 500

23:02.400 --> 23:07.640
time crystals through the in game store for $5, which is what each skin runs on average,

23:07.640 --> 23:11.600
but you still may not get the skin you want as they appear on a rotational basis.

23:11.600 --> 23:15.480
Every six to eight hours, a new set of five skins will become available on the store supposedly

23:15.480 --> 23:16.480
wants to leave.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.800
Once they leave the store, well prepare yourself for a grind fest.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.960
He goes on, the poster went on to say that he earned 760 time crystals after playing

23:24.960 --> 23:26.440
the game four hours.

23:26.440 --> 23:32.000
If you wanted to unlock every game skin through gameplay alone, it would take 3,390 hours

23:32.000 --> 23:35.720
of play time and cost 644,000 time crystals.

23:35.720 --> 23:42.100
So I don't think I misrepresented that because I said you can either play the game and amass

23:42.100 --> 23:46.440
things slowly or they're tempting you with this pay to unlock it right away, right?

23:46.440 --> 23:52.200
And this is not something exactly unique to Mortal Kombat 11 either, right?

23:52.200 --> 23:53.600
We've seen this in other games as well.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.600
Yes, we have.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.760
And it's the whole fear of missing out.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.880
So they, that's why it's on a limited time basis and they rotate amounts because it's

24:00.880 --> 24:02.200
like, Oh my God, that's what I want.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.680
And I got to get it right away.

24:03.680 --> 24:09.880
Ah, ah, well, I guess I better buy some stuff to unlock the thing that changes something

24:09.880 --> 24:10.880
slightly.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.880
Okay.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.720
So they are okay.

24:13.720 --> 24:17.600
So chatters are jumping in like Renji to do want to say, you can't buy all the costumes,

24:17.600 --> 24:18.600
right?

24:18.600 --> 24:19.600
Because the rotational thing.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.120
So you would, you know, you'd have to be patient and you have to, what?

24:22.120 --> 24:24.960
So can you not grind it out in the crypt then?

24:24.960 --> 24:27.600
That was the impression I was getting is that the other way to get the costumes is just

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
get them in the crypt randomly.

24:28.600 --> 24:33.760
I thought that was apparently it's been already being patched out or well, right.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.200
And I said that at the very beginning, they're already addressing some of this with a patch.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.460
But my big question was, how did they not figure out that some of these grindy things

24:41.460 --> 24:44.700
were a bit too much in some of the early testing that they did?

24:44.700 --> 24:49.480
You know what, it kind of makes you go, are they, do they really, or are they just doing

24:49.480 --> 24:53.260
it because there's enough bitching on the internet that you have people like me that

24:53.260 --> 24:55.700
are sitting there going, I was going to buy it.

24:55.700 --> 24:59.580
But when I heard about how grindy it was, I thought maybe not because it's the people

24:59.580 --> 25:03.160
are testing the game, aren't paying real money to unlock the stuff.

25:03.160 --> 25:07.460
So they're just testing the functionality of it, not whether, you know, it's annoying

25:07.460 --> 25:08.960
as crap.

25:08.960 --> 25:13.260
And also this also begs the question with you guys having to kind of explain it and

25:13.260 --> 25:14.260
read the article.

25:14.260 --> 25:16.740
Why is this so fucking complicated in the first place?

25:16.740 --> 25:21.080
Like it's complicated to make people not want to think about it.

25:21.080 --> 25:25.440
So Oh, so that people don't think about the distraction it's, I mean, a lot of these things

25:25.440 --> 25:33.580
are set up in this particular, like almost like a psychological manipulation where they

25:33.580 --> 25:37.260
know that a customer isn't going to stop and do the math.

25:37.260 --> 25:40.100
And the average customer will not stop and do the math on all of these things.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.000
They won't sit and look at the probability.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.380
And at the end of the day, they're like, Oh, I can give it a chance.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.360
It's like playing a lottery, right?

25:48.360 --> 25:49.360
Really it is.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.920
Well, you know, and it's interesting addicted to the gambling because you know, what I think

25:52.920 --> 25:57.460
of is I think of the Microsoft points and yes, I realized they've retired the points.

25:57.460 --> 26:02.160
They did that several years ago, but y'all know when the Xbox three 60 first came out,

26:02.160 --> 26:07.240
you bought Microsoft points and it wasn't one point was one penny.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.200
And it was almost the exact way you phrased it.

26:09.200 --> 26:14.700
You bought, I think it was, did you get less fuck, what was it like 400 points for $5 or

26:14.700 --> 26:15.700
something like that.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.700
Right?

26:16.700 --> 26:18.580
So it was, yeah, 400 points for $5.

26:18.580 --> 26:23.900
So you, so you, you would buy things for 400 points and maybe that your brain would think

26:23.900 --> 26:26.620
that was about $4, but it really was $5.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.660
Most people aren't thinking through the math again.

26:28.660 --> 26:33.700
Microsoft has changed that, but I mean, it does go to show our industry has kind of been

26:33.700 --> 26:34.700
here before a little bit.

26:34.700 --> 26:41.440
It's a little deceptive, but at the same time, it's, I reckon to them the financial deception,

26:41.440 --> 26:48.680
you know, it's not like a blatant deception, but, uh, uh, what's the word I'm thinking

26:48.680 --> 26:55.000
of a misleading, a little bit of misleading, you know, it's there.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.640
If you want to stop and look at it, it, it, if you give it a first glance and you're thinking

26:59.640 --> 27:02.140
with that common sense, 400 to five.

27:02.140 --> 27:08.500
So I'm actually paying, you know, um, like a dollar, a dollar 10 or a dollar, you know,

27:08.500 --> 27:14.420
whatever per, per point or, you know, per a hundred point or whatever it is.

27:14.420 --> 27:17.820
Um, then logically it's there in front of you.

27:17.820 --> 27:22.420
They haven't hidden a thing and just using that particular example, but when you are

27:22.420 --> 27:29.360
going to then use the points in the store, it's not giving you that point of comparison.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.460
It's not putting a dollar figure on it.

27:31.460 --> 27:35.140
You are using the points at that point that you have already paid for.

27:35.140 --> 27:38.780
What you paid for them is inconsequential for how you're spending the points.

27:38.780 --> 27:40.620
And that's where the misleading comes in.

27:40.620 --> 27:47.100
I don't want to call it a blatant deception cause it's not a blatant mortal combat deception.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.700
Keep that up.

27:49.700 --> 27:53.820
We'll have a mortal combat annihilation, total random tangent aside.

27:53.820 --> 27:56.500
I was trying to let you, the chat room saw me trying to get Louise.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.500
Is it just me?

27:57.560 --> 28:02.200
The music over there just suddenly like drop off very much, very much has dropped off.

28:02.200 --> 28:06.240
I wonder if there's, see if you can see flashing blue and red lights to the window or if somebody

28:06.240 --> 28:07.240
else went over there.

28:07.240 --> 28:11.720
Finally, I'll, I'll go take a look, go see if I'm going to look, go see the cops are

28:11.720 --> 28:12.720
here.

28:12.720 --> 28:16.440
Let me bring my tea with me so I can sip it in your yard.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.440
You don't, don't make it obvious.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.440
Don't just peek through the window.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.400
Be that, be that, be that old lady peering through the windows.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.060
Let's go see if they're on the roof.

28:24.060 --> 28:25.720
Maybe someone finally died.

28:26.660 --> 28:29.220
No, cause I can hear the music going a little bit.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.180
It's just like way down from what it was.

28:31.180 --> 28:33.380
Anyway, I can't believe she went outside.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.380
Anyway.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.780
Um, some other comments from chat, uh, Chad stars it, who I know has been playing mortal

28:37.780 --> 28:41.700
combat 11 and would probably be excited to hear if I actually finally got in and played

28:41.700 --> 28:47.260
it, uh, said it's all artificial time barriers to make you sink way too much time into this,

28:47.260 --> 28:49.900
which is where I see most people get mad about this game.

28:49.900 --> 28:52.860
Plus the difficulty in the towers and the randomness of the crypt.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.420
And fifth dream today says, what's the verdict?

28:55.440 --> 28:57.840
I didn't see any lights, but I did see people start to walk out.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.320
Oh, so maybe parties already may just be over.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.840
Maybe they're done with their day drinking.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.840
All right.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.440
Well, game of thrones is on, I guess maybe for some, who knows?

29:06.440 --> 29:08.400
I hear the not that you should change the channel.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.960
You can DVR it or use HBO.

29:09.960 --> 29:10.960
Go.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.960
I can hear the music.

29:11.960 --> 29:12.960
Yeah, it's, it's still there.

29:12.960 --> 29:13.960
It's just like way down.

29:13.960 --> 29:14.960
Anyway.

29:14.960 --> 29:15.960
All right.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
Shut up about the neighbors.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
No one can hear it.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.960
I know.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.960
I know.

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
But it's just, you guys, you guys don't understand if you were here in the studio, it'd be driving

29:20.960 --> 29:21.960
you bonkers.

29:21.960 --> 29:22.960
All right.

29:23.020 --> 29:28.540
Fifth dream today says I view microtransactions like impulse purchases at the store, grab

29:28.540 --> 29:31.340
a candy bar, a magazine, get fries with that.

29:31.340 --> 29:32.340
How often a week?

29:32.340 --> 29:33.620
Well, $5 now.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.660
And then it's the same thing.

29:35.660 --> 29:36.900
Very interesting.

29:36.900 --> 29:37.900
Very interesting.

29:37.900 --> 29:41.900
Anyway, now something else to note about this whole ordeal.

29:41.900 --> 29:46.260
One other thing I want to talk about when mortal combat is that, you know, modders are

29:46.260 --> 29:47.980
going to mod, right?

29:47.980 --> 29:49.940
Hackers going to hack modders going to mod.

29:49.940 --> 29:50.940
This is a little bit of both.

29:50.940 --> 29:52.460
I don't know if you would call this a hack or a mod.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.080
I guess technically it's a mod.

29:54.080 --> 30:00.440
But anyway, there are characters that appear in Mortal Kombat 11 story, Cyrax and Sektor.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.480
I know those names from Mortal Kombat 3 way back in the day, right?

30:03.480 --> 30:04.880
The robot ninjas, right?

30:04.880 --> 30:10.280
So apparently they show up in the story, but they are not actually playable as part of

30:10.280 --> 30:13.280
the roster, which Mortal Kombat's done this before.

30:13.280 --> 30:18.040
I remember Mortal Kombat 9 had Rain, and Rain is awesome, but Rain was in the story, but

30:18.040 --> 30:21.200
you couldn't play Rain as a selectable character.

30:21.540 --> 30:27.060
I'm sure somebody on the PC back then made it able to play Rain on the PC.

30:27.060 --> 30:28.700
Sure enough, what's happened now?

30:28.700 --> 30:33.340
Somebody has enabled it so that you can play Cyrax and Sektor on the PC with their new

30:33.340 --> 30:36.240
character models, all the moves and all that stuff.

30:36.240 --> 30:41.220
This also goes for the boss character, the boss character of course, Kronika in the game.

30:41.220 --> 30:44.660
You can actually play as Kronika thanks to this mod as well.

30:44.660 --> 30:50.380
Although for Mortal Kombat to not allow you to play the boss characters is not as unusual.

30:50.380 --> 30:52.360
That goes all the way back to Goro in the first game.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.680
They just don't want you to play something that's going to be completely unbalanced.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.520
It sounds like Kronika, that might be a little bit of the issue there as well, but surprise,

30:59.520 --> 31:03.160
surprise, that the PC players have already managed to move the boss.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.520
So do they have all their moves, or is it just kind of mimicking other...

31:06.520 --> 31:07.520
No, they have the...

31:07.520 --> 31:09.080
Because in the story they do these moves.

31:09.080 --> 31:13.680
So the yellow ninja does the bombs that throw...

31:13.680 --> 31:17.160
Sorry, I can't remember the difference, but throws out the bombs, right?

31:17.180 --> 31:19.940
I think Cyrax has the bombs and Sektor has the missiles.

31:19.940 --> 31:21.820
So they have those types of moves.

31:21.820 --> 31:23.580
And they don't look like pallet swaps either.

31:23.580 --> 31:25.700
At least when I looked at it, they did look different.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.420
So yeah, it's interesting.

31:27.420 --> 31:30.740
And people are wondering if it's, oh, is it DLC?

31:30.740 --> 31:35.260
But apparently the DLC list is leaked and I do not believe these guys are on the DLC

31:35.260 --> 31:36.400
list.

31:36.400 --> 31:42.180
So just like in Mortal Kombat 9 with Reign, it appears that there are no plans to make

31:42.180 --> 31:43.180
these characters playable.

31:43.200 --> 31:48.520
That's clearly true because they could have them on the list as like characters.

31:48.520 --> 31:52.360
Like if there's a list of all the characters in the game and they may not suspect that

31:52.360 --> 31:56.240
they're DLC because they're technically in the game as story characters, it doesn't mean

31:56.240 --> 31:59.800
that they can't have them as also DLC playable characters.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.960
So maybe?

32:01.960 --> 32:04.800
I guess we'll see.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.840
Some folks in chat are chiming in as well about a reptile in Mortal Kombat 1 being a

32:08.840 --> 32:12.680
very hidden thing that you could fight, but you couldn't really play as.

32:12.680 --> 32:17.060
Although wasn't there a thing, wasn't there like a code or something you did on Super

32:17.060 --> 32:18.060
Nintendo?

32:18.060 --> 32:19.060
It was a Game Genie.

32:19.060 --> 32:20.060
That's probably a Game Genie code.

32:20.060 --> 32:23.740
Yeah, where like you could play as reptile, but you had to really jump through hoops.

32:23.740 --> 32:29.800
And all reptile was in the Mortal Kombat 1, all reptile was was Sub-Zero and Scorpion

32:29.800 --> 32:31.340
stuff at the same time.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.540
That's all reptile was.

32:32.540 --> 32:36.700
Reptile didn't get the stuff like the ball that makes, you know, the acid spit and all

32:36.700 --> 32:37.700
that stuff.

32:37.700 --> 32:40.460
That didn't come to Mortal Kombat 2 when they made reptile his own character.

32:40.460 --> 32:44.280
So believe it or not, guys, I used to the old school Mortal Kombat games.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.840
I used to love those games.

32:46.840 --> 32:51.200
I loved like Mortal Kombat 2, especially Katana, Molina.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
You know it.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.200
I played that.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.200
I still remember this day.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.200
Katana.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.200
Finish him.

32:56.200 --> 32:59.080
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick, easiest fatality

32:59.080 --> 33:00.080
in the world.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.700
Just slam the block button, high kick.

33:01.700 --> 33:03.320
That's the fan chopping off the head.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.040
But it's it's two seconds and then it's over.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.920
And it's cartoony and stupid.

33:09.900 --> 33:15.580
And yeah, Fifth Dream says there's always seasons two and three or excuse me, there's

33:15.580 --> 33:16.580
always seasons two.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.100
And he makes that bunny face.

33:18.100 --> 33:21.900
But that comment very well could be seasons two and three.

33:21.900 --> 33:25.640
Shad Starsick says, I'll take a season two if I get characters I want.

33:25.640 --> 33:31.100
So Tiger Claw also with a random aside here, but I think this is is a worthy note.

33:31.100 --> 33:35.640
Tiger Claw mentioning that Arcade One Up has, you know, they're doing all those stand ups

33:35.640 --> 33:37.580
that kind of look like a Mortal Kombat one.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.580
Well, they're there.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.360
They just announced recently they're doing a Mortal Kombat one.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.980
They're going to do a Mortal Kombat one, two and three all in one cabinet.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.320
And y'all ready for a twist?

33:46.320 --> 33:49.440
That's the one I kind of want, like really bad.

33:49.440 --> 33:53.200
Like I think having a Mortal Kombat one, two and three little mini cab, I think that would

33:53.200 --> 33:54.200
be fun.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.200
Mortal Kombat two is the best, though.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.200
No, it really is.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.200
It's my favorite.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.120
I do have a soft spot for Mortal Kombat three.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.920
Mortal Kombat one I don't think is very fun to play anymore, just because I think it got

34:02.920 --> 34:04.480
superseded by the later game.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.480
Slow.

34:05.480 --> 34:06.960
Yeah, it's kind of it's kind of clunky.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.420
But it's like, all right, we respect it for what it is.

34:10.420 --> 34:15.620
We tip our hat, you know, but then it's like, OK, Mortal Kombat two is like superior in

34:15.620 --> 34:16.620
every way with the characters.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.460
Yeah, in every way.

34:18.460 --> 34:19.460
So anyway.

34:19.460 --> 34:20.460
Yeah.

34:20.460 --> 34:24.540
And Tiger Claw says the Mortal Kombat three is ultimate Mortal Kombat.

34:24.540 --> 34:28.740
And that game was just fun because of all the freakin characters.

34:28.740 --> 34:31.780
There were so many characters in that game.

34:31.780 --> 34:34.580
So it's interesting now that, you know, Mortal Kombat style back a little bit.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.080
What if they did a Mortal Kombat tag?

34:37.080 --> 34:38.080
Like tag tournament?

34:38.080 --> 34:39.080
Kind of.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.080
Yeah.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.080
Or like a tag team?

34:41.080 --> 34:42.080
Yeah.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.080
Wasn't that a mode in Ultimate Mortal Kombat?

34:43.080 --> 34:45.920
I don't remember because I didn't really play too much of Ultimate.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.960
I thought there was a 2v2 in one of those Mortal Kombat three clones.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.960
Maybe it was a home version only or something like that.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.680
Maybe somebody in chat knows what I'm talking about.

34:52.680 --> 34:55.800
But I really feel like the tag team thing was in one of the games.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.280
It might have been a Mortal Kombat cross Tekken.

34:58.280 --> 35:04.480
Well, they they for it to for what it's worth, Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe was

35:04.480 --> 35:05.480
the thing.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.480
It was kind of their response.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.900
They also made injustice.

35:07.900 --> 35:08.900
Yeah.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.860
Well, that's I think where injustice came from.

35:10.860 --> 35:13.620
And minor spoiler alert about the DLC.

35:13.620 --> 35:16.860
But I would imagine most of you have heard by now, but if you don't want a minor spoilers

35:16.860 --> 35:22.780
get forward 30 seconds, apparently Joker, not persona Joker, but or Mass Effect Joker,

35:22.780 --> 35:26.500
but Joker from DC is in the DLC.

35:26.500 --> 35:32.140
So that's kind of interesting in a way, especially consider all the fatalities because they kind

35:32.140 --> 35:33.140
of censored.

35:33.140 --> 35:35.200
They made him brutalities in Mortal Kombat DC Universe.

35:35.200 --> 35:40.080
I remember it was like Joker had the gun and he'd point the gun at the head, but the camera

35:40.080 --> 35:43.480
zoomed just enough so that it was out of range by the time he pulled the trigger so he couldn't

35:43.480 --> 35:44.480
actually see it.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.540
So that was the type of stuff that Mortal Kombat DC Universe did.

35:47.540 --> 35:52.680
So anyway, OK, Loco Poco says Mortal Kombat nine had two versus two.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.680
I knew there was a game.

35:53.680 --> 35:54.680
I played it in.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.680
Thank you, guys.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.760
Sia Tabiri suggests King of Fighters and Mortal Kombat.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.120
Hey, I'd be into that.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.120
Yeah.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.380
So there you go.

36:02.380 --> 36:03.380
So Mortal Kombat 11.

36:03.380 --> 36:07.720
So again, I apologize that we haven't all gotten our hands on it, but I think it's it's

36:07.720 --> 36:09.540
also worth discussing here.

36:09.540 --> 36:12.540
You know, we all hold down day jobs.

36:12.540 --> 36:14.300
This podcast is a labor of love.

36:14.300 --> 36:18.580
You all know that we have to be picky and choosy about how we spend our money to like

36:18.580 --> 36:19.580
we're not getting comped.

36:19.580 --> 36:23.500
All these games from some some very sweet indie studios and so forth have done that

36:23.500 --> 36:24.500
here and there.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.860
But, you know, as far as Triple-A title goes, we don't get those for free.

36:26.860 --> 36:29.460
So we have to think about how to spend our money, too.

36:29.460 --> 36:32.480
And do I want to drop sixty dollars on Mortal Kombat 11?

36:32.480 --> 36:33.760
I don't know if I want to right now.

36:33.760 --> 36:34.760
I don't know.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.760
We'll see.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.880
I feel like my husband will inevitably get it again.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.520
And then because he gets paid in a couple of days.

36:41.520 --> 36:45.320
So I bet he'll buy it and then I don't have to worry about it.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.400
That's always that's always a nice, nice way to do it.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.400
All right.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.060
Anyway, let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week

36:51.060 --> 36:55.780
in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week, where we talk about what we have, if not Mortal

36:55.780 --> 36:56.780
Kombat, then what?

36:56.780 --> 36:58.400
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
I'm playing this crap.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
Y'all see it?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.620
No, but the podcast listeners sure can't.

37:02.620 --> 37:07.980
Yeah, that's well, yeah, that's I'm playing idle pouring and playing I'm playing Ingress

37:07.980 --> 37:08.980
again.

37:08.980 --> 37:10.980
We took the work portal.

37:10.980 --> 37:15.860
I still need more stuff for the anomaly.

37:15.860 --> 37:16.860
We are.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.860
What else am I doing?

37:18.860 --> 37:19.860
Yeah.

37:19.860 --> 37:20.920
Pokemon Go.

37:20.920 --> 37:27.040
I'm playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp because a super freaking one in Animal Crossing.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.900
I played DDR last week.

37:30.900 --> 37:37.220
I actually played Superstar and failed it because, you know, I haven't played in a long

37:37.220 --> 37:38.900
time, but I did pretty OK.

37:38.900 --> 37:41.020
I like some of the mid difficulty ones.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.980
It was how did you just get my bearings again?

37:42.980 --> 37:43.980
But it was fun.

37:43.980 --> 37:47.300
I played a game with JD that was really fun.

37:47.300 --> 37:50.020
And then I played like some piano keys game.

37:50.020 --> 37:53.220
It's like a ticket spitter, but it was kind of fun, too.

37:53.220 --> 37:55.420
It was like really super easy.

37:55.420 --> 37:58.560
Is that what like the supersize piano keys or whatever?

37:58.560 --> 38:02.720
It's like just like a single, you know, like a half octave.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.720
It was pretty fun.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.720
Yeah.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.720
I like that gigantic one.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.720
They have around one that.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.720
Well, we played at Dave and Buster's.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.720
OK.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.720
Yeah.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.720
We also.

38:11.720 --> 38:19.120
I didn't really play a whole lot else because it's just too busy all that week, but I'm

38:19.120 --> 38:23.560
playing my phone stuff and, you know.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.140
We got a Dr. Who pinball.

38:26.140 --> 38:32.100
We we traded monopoly stir monopoly and got a Dr. Who.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.840
And it turns out that one of our boards is bad.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.020
So Dan is ordering anyone to put it back in.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.020
I mean, it's just one board.

38:39.020 --> 38:40.020
So it's fine.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.500
It's not I think that super crazy.

38:41.500 --> 38:45.640
But Dr. Who is a really good pinball with like one of my favorite multi balls.

38:45.640 --> 38:49.260
And so I played the shit out of that.

38:49.260 --> 38:52.180
And then, of course, more Ghostbusters, which we have Ghostbusters pinball.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.200
Yeah.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.720
I think a lot of our audience is going to be jealous that Dr. Who acquisition, in fact,

38:55.720 --> 38:59.200
Bobby Black Wolf is saying Dr. Who pinball is one of my is my one holy grail.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.320
If I could have one table in my house, it'd be that one.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.640
Then, Bobby, I will take pictures and put them up for you.

39:04.640 --> 39:08.000
Our play field is immaculate.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.080
It's been fully restored.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.960
Our side art is not so great.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.660
It could use some touch up.

39:13.660 --> 39:17.300
But the board plays like brand new board, like it was a home use only, which I'm pretty

39:17.300 --> 39:21.020
sure it wasn't home use just in some of the wear and tear on some of the ramps.

39:21.020 --> 39:23.380
But the board, the play field has been fully restored.

39:23.380 --> 39:24.380
It's really nice.

39:24.380 --> 39:27.400
We need to go record a midpoint break at your house at some point with some pinball.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.400
Yeah.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.720
We need like three fucking cameras for it.

39:29.720 --> 39:30.720
We'll figure it out.

39:30.720 --> 39:31.720
Yeah.

39:31.720 --> 39:39.240
But at any rate, that's been been my gaming weeks since I was sure it's in a boot.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.240
Loki, how about you?

39:40.240 --> 39:41.800
How was your gaming week?

39:41.800 --> 39:43.540
I didn't play a whole ton of things.

39:43.540 --> 39:45.040
I tried out.

39:45.040 --> 39:49.840
Well, first off, I finished building the last few things for the Labo VR stuff.

39:49.840 --> 39:57.640
So I built the thing called the wind pedal and there's like a elephant thing, which

39:57.640 --> 39:59.900
you can use to draw and stuff.

39:59.900 --> 40:00.900
It's all right.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.460
It hasn't worked out great.

40:02.460 --> 40:07.140
It's hard to tell depth on it, but it is what it is.

40:07.140 --> 40:10.320
And then the wind pedal things kind of it's all right.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.940
The mini game that they have with that, it works better though with the bird though,

40:12.940 --> 40:14.680
because it makes your bird go faster.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.340
So that's kind of cool.

40:16.340 --> 40:19.420
And I beat the bird game.

40:19.420 --> 40:20.420
And what else?

40:20.420 --> 40:29.300
I tried the Labo VR stuff for, um, Mario Odyssey and that was really lame.

40:29.300 --> 40:35.080
So yeah, unfortunately I won't be playing much of that.

40:35.080 --> 40:40.800
My son likes it, but I completely expected the Nintendo VR stuff, which I think is coming

40:40.800 --> 40:41.800
up later.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.800
So maybe we don't want to get in too much into it.

40:42.800 --> 40:46.800
I was completely expecting the Nintendo VR stuff was going to be more cute than it was

40:46.800 --> 40:49.560
going to be like actual like depth to it.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.560
You know what I mean?

40:50.560 --> 40:52.320
Well, it's, it's just like all the other stuff.

40:52.320 --> 40:58.480
I mean it more the, the Super Mario Odyssey stuff is basically you're running around with

40:58.480 --> 41:00.120
a fixed camera basically.

41:00.120 --> 41:06.060
So you have, you're just kind of like different levels and get to find three things and like

41:06.060 --> 41:10.840
collect a hundred coins and you're just going around as a fixed camera.

41:10.840 --> 41:16.040
So it's like sometimes Mario gets really far away from you and I don't know, there's just

41:16.040 --> 41:21.480
not much to do in it and the, the 3D effect and it's just not that great.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.480
It's okay.

41:22.480 --> 41:29.000
Um, I did pick up the finally, um, Zelda Breath of the Wild because my son's been wanting

41:29.000 --> 41:30.080
that for a while now.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.280
So it's such a good game.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.280
Um, I picked that up.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.840
You had it on Wii U, right?

41:33.840 --> 41:34.840
I had it on Wii U.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.520
I never played it though on Wii U very much.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.520
I did.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.520
Okay.

41:38.520 --> 41:39.960
I only played like five, 10 minutes.

41:39.960 --> 41:43.280
We did not go all this time without you like ever playing Breath of the Wild.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.480
No, I've played Breath of the Wild, but I just haven't played it for a very long time.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.480
Got it.

41:47.480 --> 41:52.520
Um, but my son likes playing that when we go to the, um, GameStop or whatever the demo

41:52.520 --> 41:53.520
station.

41:53.520 --> 41:58.560
So I'm like, Oh, we just buy the damn game and like then complete through the whole game.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.040
So I finally bought it and then he doesn't want to play it.

42:02.040 --> 42:06.120
So we ended up learning Julian, our Wii U so he could play through Breath of the Wild.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.880
He's been too busy playing Roblox crap.

42:07.880 --> 42:13.080
So you know, whatever he plays this doing all that coding stuff, right?

42:13.080 --> 42:15.000
Well, no, it's because he likes the Roblox stuff.

42:15.000 --> 42:21.440
So he's been playing this Five Nights at Freddy's sim thing where he, he's, he gets, uh, be

42:21.440 --> 42:24.440
the animatronics or something.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.440
I don't know.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.720
He won't shut up about the goddamn game.

42:27.720 --> 42:31.680
So he plays that in Raft and, uh, not Fortnite though.

42:31.680 --> 42:34.000
Cause I haven't told him like, Hey, the Thanos stuff came back.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.320
You know, he's like, um, you should introduce him to Pirate 101 seriously.

42:39.320 --> 42:43.040
Cause Julian is still playing this game six years later.

42:43.040 --> 42:49.360
So I don't know, but yeah, so that's pretty, Oh, and the Pokemon go a little bit.

42:49.360 --> 42:50.360
Sorry.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.360
I'm ruining all your stories.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.360
I know.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.400
Um, no, I'm just going to say, I'm actually saying, Oh shit.

42:54.400 --> 43:01.880
Because I'm apparently has short, but Oh Ray, all of this happens to me.

43:01.880 --> 43:02.880
I know.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.880
Right.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.920
Can you, can we, Oh, you can use my mic to finish your stuff.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.160
Here you go.

43:08.160 --> 43:12.480
We just need new mics.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.040
Maybe that's what I should buy.

43:14.040 --> 43:24.200
Um, so yeah, so I just played basically that stuff this week and then is it gone?

43:24.200 --> 43:25.200
Is it gone?

43:25.200 --> 43:26.200
No.

43:26.200 --> 43:29.560
Yes, it's gone.

43:29.560 --> 43:30.560
It might be me.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.640
I'm just very buzzy.

43:31.640 --> 43:32.640
I'm electric.

43:32.640 --> 43:33.640
Yes.

43:33.640 --> 43:54.840
Everyone's going to complain because it's me anyways, so last week I didn't touch anything.

43:54.840 --> 43:55.840
It's back.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.840
All right.

43:56.840 --> 43:57.840
I guess I just have to leave the show.

43:57.840 --> 43:58.840
We're just out of mics.

43:58.840 --> 43:59.840
Figure it out.

43:59.840 --> 44:05.600
No, but here, here take my mic.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.600
So that's it.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.600
I'm pretty much done.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.000
I didn't really play that much else other than that.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.520
I did work on, um, some of my game, which I can talk a little bit about what I've been

44:15.520 --> 44:18.840
working on and be just in specifics.

44:18.840 --> 44:25.820
So I've been working on a health bar that mimics, um, like the Capcom fighting or not

44:25.820 --> 44:28.120
fighting games, but beat them up games.

44:28.120 --> 44:34.240
You know, the ones that like change color from, uh, I think it goes like white, purple,

44:34.240 --> 44:37.780
blue, green, yellow, and then counts down.

44:37.780 --> 44:42.760
So I've been working on that, but I'm not going to tell you for what and something necessarily

44:42.760 --> 44:44.760
a beat them up.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.240
There you go.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.200
That's all I'm going to lose.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.200
It's your mic.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.200
Uh, it's all the mics.

44:51.200 --> 44:54.920
All right, I'm done.

44:54.920 --> 44:57.080
Here you go.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.640
Here's your mic.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.200
I blame gremlins.

45:01.200 --> 45:07.480
Someone said the Mogwai after midnight, you know, they're gremlins.

45:07.480 --> 45:10.120
So you're going to have to share with me now.

45:10.120 --> 45:11.120
Loki.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.120
All right.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.480
I think we're, I think we're getting, we're do a shopping trip.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.200
Yeah, it's going to have to happen.

45:16.200 --> 45:19.440
Just don't let me forget this week that cause I can't, I, the first time this happened,

45:19.440 --> 45:22.120
I said, you know, I'm just going to buy cause we've been using these hand-me-downs for a

45:22.120 --> 45:23.120
little while now.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.240
They've probably gone through their life.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.960
So I keep saying, Oh, we're just going to buy a new set and then something comes up.

45:26.960 --> 45:27.960
I forget to do it.

45:27.960 --> 45:32.440
So just at some point this week, remind me Thursday night when I'm off work.

45:32.440 --> 45:36.800
So you and I are going shopping when you were off work, you and I are going shopping cause

45:36.800 --> 45:37.800
I'm off on Thursdays.

45:37.800 --> 45:40.120
So anyway, Loki, we're going to have to try to share tonight best we can.

45:40.120 --> 45:43.620
So we'll, we'll do our sharing is caring, right?

45:43.620 --> 45:48.240
So anyway, or I could try it, but the problem is, see, here's the thing you say it's, well,

45:48.240 --> 45:49.240
we did sub out.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.240
You know what?

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
I could try subbing out my cable.

45:51.240 --> 45:54.680
Because we did sub out your cable and we didn't need to.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.600
So I should be able to pull up the cable that you have before.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.600
Yeah.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.600
Live tech issue.

45:59.600 --> 46:00.600
Rob's going to pull it out live on air.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.600
I'm going to try to fix my mic issue live on air.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.600
We'll see.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.440
Um, anyway, but first I want to talk about my gaming week.

46:05.440 --> 46:10.080
So during my gaming week this week, I, uh, played still more final fantasy 14.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.160
I have every healer at level 70.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.480
I've hit everything on max level.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.040
I can't remember if that was something I did yesterday right before the show or not, but

46:16.040 --> 46:17.600
that was the thing I did this week.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.940
And then I was playing the final fantasy 15 crossover event when I finished all that.

46:21.940 --> 46:26.120
And I did the Easter event and, um, I've just been trying to up the gear level on my character

46:26.120 --> 46:28.680
because now you can get 900 tombstones in a week.

46:28.680 --> 46:29.960
So I've just been kind of grinding away.

46:29.960 --> 46:33.660
I even did PVP today, which I don't usually do, but I was just, you know, grinding for

46:33.660 --> 46:37.040
extra tombstones so I could kind of catch up on some of the last time I've been having

46:37.040 --> 46:38.040
on Final Fantasy 14.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.680
I am still playing Borderlands game of the year edition.

46:40.680 --> 46:46.560
Um, I got to the second area, but just to, just to show you how, like, uh, how, why it's

46:46.560 --> 46:51.040
taken me so long to get through it, I just dinged the achievement for completing every

46:51.040 --> 46:54.320
single quest in Arid Badlands, that first zone.

46:54.320 --> 46:59.480
So now I'm in the second zone because that's how I roll is I do like every single fricking,

46:59.480 --> 47:01.220
uh, thing.

47:01.220 --> 47:03.080
So there you go.

47:03.080 --> 47:06.960
By the way, speaking of MMOs, Star Trek Online is going to start happening this week and

47:06.960 --> 47:07.960
I might even stream it.

47:07.960 --> 47:08.960
Oh, fun.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.280
What made you decide to get into that?

47:10.280 --> 47:12.160
Well, I've missed playing it a whole lot.

47:12.160 --> 47:16.480
Um, I just was also going back and reading on the Wiki and finding how many original

47:16.480 --> 47:18.160
series voice actors they've got.

47:18.160 --> 47:22.400
Well, by original series, I mean the TV series, you know, up to deep space nine and all that.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.600
And there's a lot of good deep space nine content, which is usually where my characters

47:25.600 --> 47:26.600
hang out.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.680
So I figure it's time to dust off the old rear Admiral and see what I can do with her.

47:30.680 --> 47:31.680
All right.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.560
So anyway, um, that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

47:33.560 --> 47:37.080
I'm going to hand the mic back to Loki and I'm going to try to sub out a cable here,

47:37.080 --> 47:39.640
live tech repair, but that's the joy of doing a live show.

47:39.640 --> 47:40.720
It makes for interesting TV.

47:40.720 --> 47:41.720
It is what it is.

47:41.720 --> 47:42.720
It interesting.

47:42.720 --> 47:47.760
She also knows to complain about watching you run around.

47:47.760 --> 47:48.760
All right.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.400
Well anyway, yeah, I keep like bending over.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.400
See my plumbers.

47:51.400 --> 47:52.400
Everyone.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.400
Look at Rob's butt.

47:53.400 --> 47:54.400
Anyway.

47:54.400 --> 47:55.400
No, don't.

47:55.400 --> 47:56.400
Um, anyway.

47:56.400 --> 47:57.400
Uh, it will.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.400
And the thing on top of that too is that I've been losing weight.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.920
So my pants are already like not staying on so much.

48:01.920 --> 48:02.920
We promise not to.

48:02.920 --> 48:03.920
I'm down five pounds.

48:03.920 --> 48:04.920
Where was that?

48:04.920 --> 48:05.920
Yeah.

48:05.920 --> 48:06.920
All right.

48:06.920 --> 48:09.680
Anyway, I'm going to hand the mic to Loki and just, you have to excuse me on Twitch

48:09.840 --> 48:13.120
while I dig around like crazy trying to fix the other mic.

48:13.120 --> 48:15.040
That's okay.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.200
So how about some news Loki?

48:17.200 --> 48:19.880
I guess we'll talk news.

48:19.880 --> 48:27.160
So the 3DS is going away because it is, it's just inevitable.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.160
It's time.

48:28.160 --> 48:32.280
So apparently Nintendo held a briefing for their investors, which they talked about,

48:32.280 --> 48:37.320
um, that it would continue the 3DS business, but it was preparing for new software release

48:37.360 --> 48:39.920
and, uh, for 2019 and beyond.

48:39.920 --> 48:46.600
But, um, basically said that, you know, there's not really a lot in the pipeline other than

48:46.600 --> 48:48.640
a few more games for the system.

48:48.640 --> 48:53.000
Um, nothing basically said we have nothing new to announce regarding, uh, first party

48:53.000 --> 48:56.240
software for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.

48:56.240 --> 48:59.420
We can't confirm that new software is coming from third party publishers.

48:59.420 --> 49:03.120
So third parties will support, but it looks like all the first party support is going

49:03.120 --> 49:07.360
towards the switch right now, which makes sense.

49:07.360 --> 49:11.000
So I have two handhelds out there to compete with each other.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Right.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.240
And I mean, I know that they had, um, shot down some rumors about news.

49:17.240 --> 49:22.080
I think we may have talked about last week about new switch hardware that was rumored,

49:22.080 --> 49:28.520
but, um, that's been kind of shot down as far as like a smaller switch that's going

49:28.520 --> 49:29.680
to be coming out.

49:29.680 --> 49:33.120
So I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they actually announce.

49:33.120 --> 49:35.840
Maybe at E3 we'll learn something or maybe later on.

49:35.840 --> 49:40.800
Um, I think there will be a new revision to the switch at some point, but I'm not sure

49:40.800 --> 49:42.320
about a smaller version.

49:42.320 --> 49:45.400
I can't even imagine what they would do with, how would they would do a smaller version

49:45.400 --> 49:46.400
of the switch?

49:46.400 --> 49:52.160
Well, the, they could go down as low as any one of the DS screens, you know, and still

49:52.160 --> 49:53.160
have it work.

49:53.160 --> 49:55.000
But with the joy cons, I don't know.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
That'd be just really weird.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
We'll see.

49:57.680 --> 50:04.600
Um, but yeah, so no first party support, unfortunately, um, going forward aside from the already

50:04.600 --> 50:06.080
announced games.

50:06.080 --> 50:11.640
Um, but I guess that means a lot more games coming to the switch, hopefully excite truck

50:11.640 --> 50:12.640
is one of those.

50:12.640 --> 50:17.500
I'm not holding my breath though, but, um, you and your excite truck more like Nelly

50:17.500 --> 50:22.560
and excite truck, or just bring like some support for Wii games, like some of the Wii

50:22.560 --> 50:26.080
games that use like a tilt, I guess some of those games might be a little bit hard to

50:26.080 --> 50:30.640
play, but yeah, you probably could play that game, has the same number of buttons.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.040
It's not impossible.

50:32.040 --> 50:33.040
Yeah.

50:33.040 --> 50:38.280
So I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see, um, what they announce.

50:38.280 --> 50:42.000
But 3DS stuff, of course, um, from third parties.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.760
So I know that they support like the DS stuff for a long time, so I'm sure we'll, we'll

50:47.760 --> 50:49.760
get some new games pretty soon.

50:49.760 --> 50:54.000
Completely off topic and this is stupid, but every time I or someone says it's not impossible,

50:54.000 --> 50:55.480
Tom Jones starts appearing in my head.

50:56.080 --> 51:03.040
Instead of, you know, instead of seeing it, it's not impossible, my brain's doing remixes.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.040
What do we have?

51:05.040 --> 51:08.480
Just seeing if they can still hear it or what's going on.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.480
Is it busy sounding?

51:10.480 --> 51:11.480
Yeah.

51:11.480 --> 51:12.480
They say it's really bad.

51:12.480 --> 51:14.480
They don't have to edit the podcast.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.480
Oh, that's not good.

51:16.480 --> 51:18.480
We'll just share it.

51:18.480 --> 51:19.480
We'll just share.

51:19.480 --> 51:20.480
It's fine.

51:20.480 --> 51:21.480
That's okay.

51:21.480 --> 51:25.120
That means that Rob and I can go shopping and, or Matt, if you are off, you can go shopping

51:25.120 --> 51:26.120
with us too.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.120
We all go shopping.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.440
I'm off for the next two days.

51:28.440 --> 51:35.440
I'm off Thursday for, well, I wanted to take time off on Friday, but then I got called

51:35.440 --> 51:40.400
back into work because only I can solve problems apparently.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.440
And then it just all went downhill from there.

51:42.440 --> 51:46.160
How do you solve a problem like Loki?

51:46.160 --> 51:49.300
I had the worst back massage the other day.

51:49.300 --> 51:50.520
Like it jacked up my back.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.240
I hope you didn't tip.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.240
I did.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.240
All right.

51:54.240 --> 52:01.360
I was a massage therapist and if I gave a bad massage, I wouldn't expect a tip.

52:01.360 --> 52:04.520
I'm going to attempt to move on to the next story here while I'm, I believe it or not,

52:04.520 --> 52:06.960
I have more cords to test and more mics to try.

52:06.960 --> 52:12.040
So we'll see if I can get through this, but anyway in the meantime, do not mix up my piles.

52:12.040 --> 52:13.040
That is all broken.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.040
Okay.

52:14.040 --> 52:19.560
Anyhow we're going to move on to a story that talks about something that's got a lot of

52:19.560 --> 52:23.160
people talking in the industry, especially, um, you know, the past couple of years, I

52:23.160 --> 52:28.160
think you've heard more and more talk about, does this gaming industry need to unionize?

52:28.160 --> 52:33.080
And one of the things that's very controversial in the industry is crunch time.

52:33.080 --> 52:36.680
And the reason why I think this is relevant right now is because we've had a couple of

52:36.680 --> 52:41.060
stories this week, this very week that have discussed crunch time in the industry and

52:41.060 --> 52:43.400
how it is affecting things that are going on.

52:43.400 --> 52:47.200
And one of them has to do with the mortal combat development cycle and mortal combat

52:47.200 --> 52:48.200
11.

52:48.200 --> 52:52.240
Um, so a report came out this week that talked about, it was actually some allegations on

52:52.240 --> 52:57.320
Twitter, apparently from like a former developer who said, um, on mortal combat nine crunch

52:57.320 --> 53:01.300
time officially began after new year's day 2011 of course we did a bit of pre crunch

53:01.300 --> 53:03.980
before that just to make sure we were in a good spot for crunch.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.360
This was on schedule documents.

53:05.360 --> 53:08.720
This was not a wink, wink, nudge, nudge, passionate, hardworking thing.

53:08.720 --> 53:09.720
This was mandate.

53:09.720 --> 53:12.900
And that was according to James Longstreet who was a software engineer at nether realm

53:12.900 --> 53:13.900
for two years.

53:13.900 --> 53:18.940
I took one day off between January 1st to 2011 and the day, the day one patch was approved.

53:18.940 --> 53:23.900
It was my birthday and it was on a Sunday, so it was okay if I was just on call.

53:23.900 --> 53:24.900
So yeah.

53:24.900 --> 53:25.900
Wow.

53:25.900 --> 53:30.420
Um, a lot of time going into this stuff and even, uh, some of our folks who've worked

53:30.420 --> 53:34.380
in the industry in our chat, uh, shad stars, like in our chats as I remember doing crunch

53:34.380 --> 53:41.020
time at Konami on ultra mix two, nine to 11, Monday through Friday, nine to five Saturday.

53:41.020 --> 53:43.980
That happened for only a couple of weeks though.

53:43.980 --> 53:48.100
But in California, it's illegal to have mandatory overtime.

53:48.100 --> 53:54.820
I don't, I think you can pay as long as you pay for it, but I know you cannot make a company.

53:54.820 --> 53:56.980
You cannot make overtime mandatory.

53:56.980 --> 53:57.980
Well, right.

53:57.980 --> 54:00.100
And they don't make overtime mandatory.

54:00.100 --> 54:05.020
The way it works is they basically say, you know, they kind of make it seem like you're

54:05.020 --> 54:10.020
not going to be a team player if you don't put in these hours and they're not saying

54:10.020 --> 54:15.140
and they're saying it's optional of course, but then when it comes time to being rehired

54:15.140 --> 54:20.860
after the, your time is up as a contractor, you're going to be less likely to be hired

54:20.860 --> 54:22.500
if you don't take that time.

54:22.500 --> 54:23.820
That's only for contractors.

54:23.820 --> 54:28.640
If you were a regular employee, which some people are, they're supposed there.

54:28.640 --> 54:34.580
It's actually, I think illegal to have punitive, uh, measures for people who don't work quote.

54:34.580 --> 54:37.260
Most of them are contractors though.

54:37.260 --> 54:42.780
And I'm also sorry to say what we're hearing here is, is exactly what you're saying shouldn't

54:42.780 --> 54:43.780
be happening.

54:43.780 --> 54:44.780
Punitive measures and pressure.

54:44.780 --> 54:45.780
Exactly.

54:45.780 --> 54:49.980
So what they're doing is they're breaking California labor law in California.

54:49.980 --> 54:53.260
Uh, I don't know if nether realm is, nether realm is in these other places.

54:53.260 --> 54:57.100
And I honestly, from, from what Shane is saying is much different.

54:57.100 --> 55:00.480
I mean, even though, you know, you got two weeks of these crunch time, that seems much

55:00.480 --> 55:04.340
more like at least it's like planned out, you know, exactly that kind of like what time

55:04.340 --> 55:07.900
period is as opposed to what we're hearing here where it's like months and months at

55:07.900 --> 55:08.900
a time.

55:08.900 --> 55:13.420
And, uh, Fortnite is the other big one we're hearing about is that, you know, Fortnite's

55:13.420 --> 55:18.820
been super successful, but because they're doing patch after patch after patch that these

55:18.820 --> 55:21.220
guys are in like a nonstop crunch.

55:21.220 --> 55:25.460
And so what's really frustrating to me about this whole thing and reading it is that it

55:25.460 --> 55:29.280
sounds like, and isn't this, isn't this the way it always goes, right?

55:29.280 --> 55:34.560
Is that the supervisors and managers are barely doing any of it.

55:34.560 --> 55:38.320
It's all, they're the ones that are leaving because it's the, you know, that their job

55:38.320 --> 55:39.320
is to supervise and manage.

55:39.320 --> 55:44.120
They're not the ones that are actually putting in the work, but then go figure this time

55:44.120 --> 55:47.040
as it goes on and on and on for months and months, we're talking about much more than

55:47.040 --> 55:48.040
two weeks.

55:48.040 --> 55:52.160
It's going on and on for months and months is that people feel like, like that less time

55:52.160 --> 55:54.280
at the time isn't being as effective than that.

55:54.280 --> 55:57.840
They're sitting there for hours waiting for a new build and so on and so on.

55:57.840 --> 56:01.160
It's just, it's really kind of gross and I think that's why a lot of this stuff is kind

56:01.160 --> 56:06.640
of coming to light now, but it's also a double edged sword because you know how gamers are

56:06.640 --> 56:07.640
in this industry.

56:07.640 --> 56:13.000
If they don't make certain deadlines, that game's got bugs that aren't fixed, it's going

56:13.000 --> 56:14.800
to get torn the fuck apart online.

56:14.800 --> 56:21.740
That's why I super, though I'm supportive of workers unionizing to improve those conditions

56:21.740 --> 56:24.680
and to remove this expectation from the industry.

56:25.680 --> 56:37.960
Especially since we've had so many other unionizations occurring, especially for example, our teachers

56:37.960 --> 56:44.880
as of late, you know, and if you know your history, you know that here in the US, companies

56:44.880 --> 56:51.240
were quite abusive of their employees until unions made those changes.

56:51.240 --> 56:55.600
So I'm fully in support of the industry unionizing, absolutely.

56:55.600 --> 56:56.600
No hesitation.

56:56.600 --> 57:00.080
And it sounds like there's just some kind of like a lot of like piss poor jobs planning

57:00.080 --> 57:01.120
and so forth.

57:01.120 --> 57:05.000
And I think if the supervisors and managers aren't there during all of this time, that's

57:05.000 --> 57:11.320
kind of bullshit for one, you know, like, I don't know, maybe I'm just, maybe I'm being

57:11.320 --> 57:14.800
naive on how corporate culture, but certainly I've been in the positions where I have to

57:14.800 --> 57:18.400
work overtime, but it's, you know, planned out.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.320
It's not nonstop.

57:20.400 --> 57:25.560
I'm able to have time to adjust things so I can, you know, and usually all the companies

57:25.560 --> 57:29.320
that have made me do it have been pretty good where it's like, if you put in a lot of time,

57:29.320 --> 57:33.280
it's like, we're just going to give you a free day off later once the thing is met.

57:33.280 --> 57:37.360
You know, it's been reasonable, much more reasonable as opposed to, well, if you don't

57:37.360 --> 57:42.200
do it, you know, you're going to get a nasty review next time you have a one-on-one or

57:42.200 --> 57:46.880
what have you, you know, or there's, we could just fire you and there's 10 million of you

57:46.880 --> 57:49.360
out there looking for a job in the industry and all that crap.

57:49.400 --> 57:53.720
Well, the other thing is they also don't expect people to know the labor laws in their state

57:53.720 --> 57:58.920
either, to know them well, to know them well enough to be able to bring them into a conversation

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
to protect themselves.

57:59.920 --> 58:00.920
No.

58:00.920 --> 58:06.320
Anyhow, also it should be mentioned, I noticed Bobby is kind of alluding to an Apex story.

58:06.320 --> 58:12.520
It should be noted that, you know, Respawn has kind of said some things sort of in response

58:12.520 --> 58:17.680
to this because they outlined how they were going to handle Apex updates going forward.

58:17.720 --> 58:22.600
Drew McCoy stressed in an update that he wrote about where the team is going, that the battle

58:22.600 --> 58:27.360
royale game will still be alive and thriving, but they were not going to pursue updates

58:27.360 --> 58:32.960
so aggressively that it will require crunch time that can prompt burnout or worse.

58:32.960 --> 58:36.600
So if you want to make a long story short, he's saying you're going to be waiting longer

58:36.600 --> 58:42.040
for Apex updates because we're not putting our team through crunch and TBH, I'm good

58:42.040 --> 58:43.120
with it.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.120
Like that.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.400
People need to learn some fucking patience.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.480
And you also know you're going to get quality stuff.

58:48.480 --> 58:54.360
Whereas, you know, we heard a very similar story not that long ago that involved BioWare

58:54.360 --> 58:58.280
and look where that crunch got them with Mass Effect Andromeda and all the issues that it

58:58.280 --> 58:59.280
had.

58:59.280 --> 59:03.080
And they're still behind in Anthem updates as well, their roadmap that they put out there

59:03.080 --> 59:04.920
of all the things that they're going to add to the game.

59:04.920 --> 59:08.920
They haven't even come close to doing that on time.

59:08.920 --> 59:13.760
Now Bobby in chat to read his full comments said that the consumer response to Respawn

59:13.760 --> 59:18.400
saying that they won't crunch for Apex Legends, so they won't get any updates until the next

59:18.400 --> 59:21.160
patch was, well, looks like you don't care about the game.

59:21.160 --> 59:25.480
Like Epic going back to Fortnite where they respect me and give me content constantly

59:25.480 --> 59:29.640
will allow me to say, not this consumer, fuck that.

59:29.640 --> 59:36.060
And I think what we as gamers can do is we can embrace companies that say that this is

59:36.060 --> 59:38.480
going to be the policy and say, you know what?

59:38.480 --> 59:39.480
It's okay.

59:39.480 --> 59:42.060
Oh, a game is going to take a little longer to come out.

59:42.060 --> 59:43.060
It's okay.

59:43.180 --> 59:44.620
People only care about themselves.

59:44.620 --> 59:45.620
Yeah.

59:45.620 --> 59:50.460
So to that, I say, if you're those gamers, you're causing this problem.

59:50.460 --> 59:51.620
Screw you.

59:51.620 --> 59:56.540
Like you sit down and shut up, make your own fucking game, see how easy it is.

59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.580
That's what I say to those gamers that, you know, are not gonna, you know, say, oh, you

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.580
don't care about me.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.060
You need to stop being part of the problem.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.060
Yeah.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.060
You know what it is.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.660
So, um, and I, so what I can do for the industry is to those gamers, I can say, I will fight

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.840
you.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.980
Not literally, obviously, because I don't want to get banned from Twitch.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.820
I'm using hyperbole.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.740
I will cooking mama fight you.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.740
I play dirty.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.940
I will challenge you to a kitchen battle royale.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.860
I am the iron chef.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:24.860
So but here's the thing.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:31.340
And you know what guys hasn't Nintendo delayed smash brothers games a million times.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.660
Wasn't Zelda delayed twice.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.260
Didn't grand theft auto get pushed back?

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.220
Aren't they quality products?

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:42.100
And those games came out a okay at the end of the day and we're all just fine for it.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.340
I'll point this out.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:48.380
How many people go to buy a shelf at Ikea and it's next to say one that was built in

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:54.780
the fifties by hand, which shelf falls apart sooner than you Ikea piece of shit.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:00.780
The things that were, that people took their time with, built sturdy and used good material.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.940
Those are the things that are still standing.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.700
You know, how about all these old houses down in the, in the deep south, you know, we're

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.140
back East, these buildings that have been around since the 17 hundreds.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.500
They're still standing.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.500
Why?

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500
Quality material, quality effort, quality time.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.780
They didn't roll them out on a cookie cutter.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.620
The same thing goes with your games.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.100
What games are we still playing today?

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.900
The one for our classic names are playing the ones that people put time and real effort

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:31.100
into and didn't just whip it out, you know, because it was going to be a moneymaker, right?

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:36.340
They put a lot of effort and made sure when it was ready for release, it was ready.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.340
Yeah.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.340
Anyhow.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.540
Um, so, uh, and I want to, I didn't get off my lawn.

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.660
I didn't think to really define this better, but in our chat, there's even a little bit

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.660
of confusion.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.660
What does crunch really mean?

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.720
Um, because I, Kaijuta says, I thought crunch meant like numbers, coder updates.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.260
So is crunch the rush and yeah, crunch crunch is like the slang term they give to this mandatory

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.420
overtime just heard in general crunch time.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.420
It's it's the time that you have to finish stuff up before your deadline.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.100
Sometimes, you know, remember everybody's got their different backgrounds and that's

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.540
like a fairly classic term that's been around since the fifties.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:16.020
Well I'm thinking like, I think the term comes from like a college students crunching for

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.020
like an exam.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.020
I know I've heard that before.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:22.660
So yeah, I've always used it in regards to my deadlines, you know, Hey, I'm sorry, I

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.660
can't go out.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.980
It's crunch time on this poster.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:25.980
You know?

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.980
Yeah.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.320
So if you have never been around people that use that word, you may not know it.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.700
So I'm, I'm happy to define those types of things so that we all understand what the

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.780
industry is doing to the people that make our games.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.420
So anyhow, I think we should move on though, Dark Soccer.

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.900
You have other news out of Epic, right?

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.100
Yeah, greedy fuckers.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.100
Kidding.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.100
Maybe.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:56.700
The Epic Games dude, Tim Sweeney, tweeted that the company would end its exclusivity

01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:02.700
agreements if Steam raised its revenue cut for developers.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.380
The direct quote, if Steam committed to a permanent 88% revenue share for all developers

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:13.060
and publishers without major strings attached, Epic would hastily organize a retreat from

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:18.980
exclusives while honoring our partner commitments and consider putting our own games on Steam.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.380
So basically you don't get it on Steam because we don't give them money.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.380
That's it.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:33.460
Unless, you know, the other thing is then, you know, is it that they want to be guaranteed

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:38.100
making a certain amount of revenue to cover the cost of putting it on Steam, but I don't

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.100
know.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.100
It's kind of shady.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.900
It just, it just seems really icky.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.420
And then he said in a followup, such a move would be a glorious moment in the history

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:54.140
of PC gaming and would have a sweeping impact on other platforms for generations to come.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.780
And then stores could go back to just being nice places to buy stuff rather than game

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:01.120
developer IRS.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.980
This is the weirdest flex.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.420
Like this is the weird, I don't know if I can think of a time in the gaming industry.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.040
Maybe y'all want to correct me, but I'm not sure if I can think of a time where one company

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.140
is essentially trying to bully another company into what to do and how to set its revenue

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.140
is and all this other stuff.

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.340
It's a really weird flex.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.740
It reeks of like 1920s business practice.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:29.340
You might try to claim that maybe when PlayStation Sony got up there on stage at E3 and undercut

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.880
Microsoft by a hundred dollars, but they didn't exactly get up there and say, but if Microsoft

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.300
will do this, then we'll cut the prior.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:41.700
I don't, you know, I just, it seems really, this whole thing is very bold and you know,

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:45.540
here's the thing, Tim Sweeney, I appreciate you for what you've done for the industry,

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.740
especially like ZZT and all that stuff.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.740
You know, I have a lot of love for that game and all this stuff, but honestly, when it

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.880
comes to stuff like this, you just got a big spotlight showing on you with this crunch

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.000
time stuff and everything that, you know, the Fortnite staff is going through.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.300
So making himself out to be a really big bully miser sort of Scrooge, in my opinion, fix

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.980
your own shit before you tell other companies how to fix theirs.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.140
Like I know you might think you're trying to get gamers on your side by flexing your

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:15.320
dick like this with this whole trying to, you know, well, if the steam would come down

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.160
to the rate, you know, the word pan and all this stuff, I just, you need to fix your

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.360
own fucking problems first.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.880
Don't, don't throw rocks when you live in a glass house.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.000
It's honestly some Wall Street in the recession level bullshit.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You know what I mean?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.440
That, you know, he's like, we've got all this power.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.840
We've got so much over the industry right now that it would do, do you well to be on

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.560
our good side and do business the way that we want to, which is exactly what the banks

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.640
were doing with the government at that time.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.440
And when you put these two stories side by side, which is why we did that in our show

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440
world tonight.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.120
When you put these two stories side by side, it kind of gets gross.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:06:00.040
It's grosser and grosser, honestly, because it's like, well, Epic, we got the costs down

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.040
and all that.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.080
At what cost, Epic?

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.240
At what cost?

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.960
There's no morality anymore in business.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:11.440
I mean, well, there wasn't really morality in business anyway, but this is why we have

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:17.760
to have regulations and have them kept in check or else they're going to do this shit

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.000
on a larger scale.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.720
You know, people like, oh, you leave business unregulated, then they're going to do the

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720
right thing.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720
Bullshit.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.720
They won't.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.720
You want some examples?

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.080
Look to the early business models of US.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.960
And to be clear, I am all for steam having competition.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.240
And I honestly, I don't think I've said a bad thing about the Epic game store on the

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:45.280
show previously, you know, when it comes to this whole price war thing going on in

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.760
the exclusives and all that stuff, that is capitalism, I suppose, love it or hate it.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.240
That is the competition that would allow both of these companies to thrive and so forth

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.800
where I have a problem.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.840
And what's making me kind of come out here and say, you know, Tim Sweeney dial it back

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:07.720
is when now he's trying to like, he needs to let these negotiations and let these price

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.240
reductions and so forth.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.680
He needs to let that do the talking.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.200
He needs to not come out and say, oh, but if valve does this, then we'll even give them

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.760
our games to put on the store.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.480
And he's like, so trying to get that rabble rabble.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.840
We're the good guys here.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.840
And if they just, if they, if the bad guys would just turn around and do what we're doing,

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.320
because we're all about the developers that did it, well, guess what?

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.220
What about your own developers?

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.760
Are you really the good guy there?

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.360
Well, especially think about how much work that's going to cause for their developers

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.920
bringing it out on another platform.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.120
I mean, seriously, they're the he's really painting himself out to be just like, you

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.960
know, a twirling mustache, you know, bad businessman.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.240
But if you make is easy to I'll shut the fuck up.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.280
No, you won't.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.320
And that, though, that type of shit, though, in all seriousness, is what businesses rely

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.640
on is like, hey, here's your bone.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640
Are you happy now?

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.920
And trying to just, you know, I'm not really going to say I would make a game in ZZT about

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.000
how to treat your workers.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.760
That's that's the that's the petty crocker I aspire to be.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:19.960
The thing is, is that all of this is what we have going on in the government right now.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.000
A lot of smoke and mirrors.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.480
Oh, this big, terrible shit's going on.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.560
But here's this thing to distract you.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.440
And that's that's what the company.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.640
I didn't do it. I'm not lying.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.040
You're lying. I didn't do anything.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.480
Well, by the way, did you read it?

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.120
I didn't do anything. I'm not lying.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:35.560
You're lying.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.560
Stop talking over me, please.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.840
But by the way, you know, with all of this, this is the you know, I'm sure this is really

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.880
bad, but look at this other bad thing that's happening.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.680
That doesn't make the one bad less bad.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.600
And the companies are trying to do this shit, too, because we have an enabler.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, if steam would just stop having such a punchable face, we'd

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.120
stop punching them. But you know what, to be fair, and I know you're just saying that very

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.840
tongue in cheek, but to be fair, like we have heard from folks on this show that say at

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.720
the end of the day, even if they're getting less of a cut from steam, there's things that

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.040
steam offer them that are more attractive right now.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:22.240
Right. Haven't we had folks that have said, I still prefer steam because of the integrated

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.280
leaderboards, the online that's there, you know, these other things that steam will do

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.560
that maybe that is worth it to them to have that greater cut of the game.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.600
And that's fine. That's a developer's choice to make at the end of the day.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.080
Right. So competition.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.120
That's great. Competition is good.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.440
I mean, especially it's pretty much the model for capitalism right there.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:49.080
But at the same time, again, they need to not pull those bullying tactics to try to get

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.320
the companies to do what they want them to do.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:57.800
They should let it the market control itself in terms of making that competition saying,

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.160
hey, this business practice is working better.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.960
Maybe we should modify our model.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.440
Instead of, you know, online bullying.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.600
Sia Tabiri, and I'll let him have the final thought here in our chat, says that's part of

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.560
the problem with the 24 hour news cycle.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.280
There's too much going on out at the same time.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.280
And by the time there's any actual understanding of what's going on, people are tired or

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.120
no longer interested because it's been repeated and pulled in 50 different directions.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.160
And, you know, you might think that comments about politics and it very well could be.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.560
But I think that comment also very much applies to social media and gaming.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:36.600
And, you know, gaming blogs and Twitter and Facebook and so on.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.200
I agree with absolutely applies.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:46.680
So are we're so used to having everything just instant and that's well and not not to go

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.560
too crazy on this.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.960
We can move on after this, but it's also having a psychological effect on on how we

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.360
translate information on how we disseminate it.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.160
But I think it's also going back into that instant gratification I was talking about

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.240
earlier, how everyone wants their stuff now.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.760
There needs to be a big change, but that's a topic for another day.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.360
All right, so this is pretty awesome.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:18.200
So as I mentioned, I just picked up Breath of the Wild for the Switch and I still haven't

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.600
got a chance to play with the Labo VR mode, but there may be a better way to do the

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.920
Labo VR.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:32.760
And actually, if you don't have Labo VR, but you have a PlayStation VR, you may actually

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.120
get to play it in VR with both.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.360
So how exactly will you be able to do this?

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:47.000
Well, it's a little bit of it's a little bit of some complicated, I guess, rearranging of

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.680
cables, but you can do it.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:55.640
So what you basically do is you reroute the video signal from your Switch into your

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.480
PlayStation VR breakout box.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.880
And then with changing some of the cables around, you can actually get to output to your

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.280
TV and to the VR headset.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:09.480
And because the VR mode works when docked, which I'm sure is just an oversight by the

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:17.720
folks at Nintendo, that now you can actually kind of play it in at least 3D on the VR

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.840
headset. So, yeah.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.600
Sorry, I just have to jump in with a chat comment because Bobby is and he was talking a

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.800
little bit about Zelda VR on his show tonight, but he's saying you don't want to play Zelda

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:28.720
in VR, trust me.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.600
And he's talking about that it kind of makes you sick, like it's just it's just not very

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.760
good the way it's done.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.560
And I'm sure it probably has to do with the fact that, you know, it's really meant to be

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.480
done in like short spurts as well.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.160
But it just it really just sounds like it was kind of like an afterthought.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:47.320
And it's just like like even though, lol, we can hack it to run on the PlayStation VR, it

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.880
really just sounds like it's just not worth your fucking time.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.560
I'm still going to try it once just for the hell of it, because why not?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.080
Because I have a PlayStation VR, it's not being used for anything.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:00.960
Just don't eat lunch first.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.240
I don't know, the motion stuff doesn't really bother me too much, like just like how they

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.240
had I used to play on the Gear VR, the Minecraft on there and they have, OK, you can

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.960
teleport around or you can move around.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.720
We don't recommend the moving around because it might make you motion sick.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.080
And I'm just like, I'm running all over the place.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.240
And it just it doesn't bother me too much.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.000
So we'll see.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.120
And I'm sure that there's no head tracking with it because obviously it's just the video.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.120
So the video would be in 3D, but I don't know.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.520
It I'll try it once and then I'll be done with it.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.320
Well, Bobby is saying you wouldn't try it because you don't like puking, but also it's

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.720
saying is it's a jittery frame rate seems to be the really big problem.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.640
And I can see I can see where that gets really annoying really fast.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.480
And it just it really just feels like this whole thing was tacked on us.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.560
And afterthought, yay, cute.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.200
But like seriously not.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.120
I have a feeling most people are going to be in the try once cap like, you know, somebody

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.880
can say don't do that. You shouldn't do that.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.800
But of course. And Bobby, you know this.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.040
You tell somebody don't do that.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.920
It's make you sick. And what's somebody going to say?

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.680
I'm going to do it because somebody told me not to and fuck the law feeling cute.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.480
Might throw up later.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:20.800
But I mean, that's fine if you don't want to do that, at the very least, you got some

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.120
better load times out of it because apparently people are finding that the load times have

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.080
been reduced thanks to this newest update.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.760
So you can enjoy that.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:36.720
And I guess that's also working out good for the speed running community because it's

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.400
cutting down their times as well because there's less load time.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:40.760
Neat.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.720
All right, well, let's talk about other Nintendo stories, and this one is kind of putting a

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.400
definitive foot down on some rumors and things that we've been hearing previously is that

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.520
Nintendo was going to show off some new hardware at E3 this year.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.360
At first it was there's going to be a more powerful and a less powerful Switch console.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.440
And then that got dialed back last week.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.240
The rumors were, well, now they're just going to do the less powerful one because the more

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.440
powerful one's not ready yet.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.720
Well, guess what? Now, Shuntaro Furukawa, that is Nintendo's president, has come out and

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.320
basically put his foot down and said none of that.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.320
So in a meeting with investors, he mentioned that the company does not have plans to

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.920
announce any new hardware at E3 this year.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.120
That is not happening.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.240
So that was from Twitter.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.600
Basically, during an investor conference call, a person from Reuters who is on Twitter

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.600
says Nintendo CEO says no plan to announce new hardware at E3 show.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.640
Nintendo CEO said nothing announced on possible new hardware, but it is always

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.520
developing hardware internally.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:47.160
That part's not really news because we've said this a million times before.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.600
The minute the PlayStation 4 came out, Sony was already working on PlayStation 5.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.840
That's how long these types of things take to develop.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.720
So is Nintendo working on a different Switch console?

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.080
Oh, abso-fucking-lutely.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.520
Is there more than one of them based on these rumors?

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.520
Probably. Is it happening this year?

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.880
Well, sounds like nope because they just they just came out very for the president.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.040
Nintendo said ain't happening.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.080
Well, they didn't say specifically E3.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.720
So maybe they'll do their own direct.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.640
They could. They could do something, you know, around the time of Tokyo Game Show or

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.720
something like that. I know Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, but that hasn't

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.680
stopped them from doing announcements around that time.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.760
But I I think the good news out of this is that this means that E3 well, for one, I'm

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.200
I'm totally OK with the Switch having another year just as it is like I wasn't all

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.880
about the hardware refresh right now.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.400
So I think a hardware fresh in another year will be even better and it'll be more

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.080
attractive to want to buy at that time.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.640
But that means E3 is going to be all about the games.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.640
So I'm really hoping and Dark Sakura are relevant to your interests.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.600
Animal Crossing ought to dominate the conversation at E3 this year, along with I

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.440
wish along with, I assume, Metroid Prime 4.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.400
And we should get an E3 that's going to be games, games, games, games and less about

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.720
hardware since now they're not going to be trying to sell new consoles.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:09.040
So that will be I don't think this is such bad news at the end of the day, to be

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.360
honest. Now, OK, you know, other other thoughts, though.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:18.360
Shad Starzik in chat says, I was hoping to get a new revision for Pokemon.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:25.440
That's an interesting perspective because, you know, Pokemon would be a great time to

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.520
pair up with new hardware, and I think that's why a lot of people were thinking

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:32.040
Nintendo might go in the direction of a smaller Switch console.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:37.160
After all, was it Pokemon X and Y or was it Sun and Moon when the 2DS came out?

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.240
Right. I think it was X and Y.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.840
The 2DS came out right when like X and Y came out.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.680
And that was kind of a thing to try to put out, like a lower budget model for the kiddies

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.960
that want to play Pokemon.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.360
Although is it really just kids to play?

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.760
I don't know. I think it's just me looking at my Twitter feed on who all wants to go see

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.440
Detective Pikachu next week is definitely kids and adults.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.440
It's yeah, for sure. Let's go.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.880
I didn't even like I haven't seen Endgame yet.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.320
I don't mean to see that, too.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.600
Girl, I haven't seen a Marvel movie since the first Avengers.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.800
Captain Marvel is great.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.600
So I'm sure it was. And Black Panther, I'm sure was great, too.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.360
I haven't seen any of them since.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.640
I just it's not that I have anything against this particular movie.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.240
I've been treating all the movies the same.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.440
I just haven't had time. But I do really want to see Detective Pikachu.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.520
I will say that I just I'm just I'm really hoping and praying they didn't fuck this up.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.760
And, you know, there's there's that buzz online that's saying that some of the early

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.520
press screening reviews are saying they didn't fuck it up.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.240
So we'll see.

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.640
Grain of salt, grain of salt.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:39.720
Anyway, SSU 100 Matt says, I would like to see them talk and show more Nintendo online

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.480
exclusive stuff, you know, that would definitely be an asset and something to help

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.200
sell more Nintendo online stuff.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.800
Maybe E3 is the time they're going to put out the Super Nintendo stuff.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.360
I would sure make a lot of sense.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:59.080
But also, I think Tetris 99 has turned out to be a much bigger deal than anyone thought

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.120
it would be necessarily.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:05.680
So I would expect we're going to see something else, something that's like small but powerful,

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.640
like Tetris 99 kind of was for the online setup.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.640
I don't know. We'll see.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.520
Loki, what are your thoughts on all this?

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.040
I just hope there's some good game announcements.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.680
I'm sure they'll show more of the new Pokemon games.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.320
And of course, Animal Crossing, but I guess I just want to see what else is coming up.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.000
Metroid, too. I don't know.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.000
We'll see.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.600
All right, let's move on to our next story, Dark Sakura.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.560
We're going to get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.080
But first, I actually found this like super randomly, too.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:42.960
But it was there's this hacking that took place in 2018 that targeted the Asus Live update

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:49.120
tool. So it would affect various pieces of software with malware as it was figured out.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.720
Basically, there's reports from ESET and Kupersky that says the same group is also

01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:03.240
responsible for infecting a video game development tool that has infected several video

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:08.200
games on the programming level, meaning it's not because they're bootlegs, you're

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.480
downloading it from any third party source.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.280
The direct versions of these are infected.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.480
About 92,000 computers were exposed to malware.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.600
They're all PCs.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:26.880
But to be to be fair, all the or not all of it, but the majority of it so that our

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.000
listeners don't get freaked out.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.960
The majority of this is happening in...

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.720
I was going to be getting to that.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.320
Just making sure, because I'd be freaking out, maybe.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:40.360
I know. Basically, it did occur mostly in Asia, especially in Thailand.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.560
But there have been more reports outside of the region.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:50.480
Two of the studios who were affected in particular are Electronix Extreme and Zepetto.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:56.760
Their games affected was Infestation and Point Blank.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.920
All one word, not to be confused with the Namco one.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.600
And so if you've got those games, just be careful.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.200
Run a malware search on your computer.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.840
The malware does not affect functions on computers that are set to use simplified Chinese.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:17.480
So that means that likelihood, that means that it was a Chinese developer that put out

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.720
that particular bit of malware.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.680
And it actually spreads.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.040
I mean, like I said, normally malware will spread through third party tampering

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.680
afterwards when you're getting a bootleg game.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:34.080
But in this case, it is all through the legitimate copies of those particular games.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.040
Those two in particular.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.040
So just be careful of them.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.400
Interesting. You know, I was just I was kind of thinking while you were talking about that

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.360
when we talk about like game development and thinking about like where games are headed.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.840
Isn't it going to be interesting, though, when we start getting into more cloud gaming

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.360
where it's not necessarily going to be something that you necessarily download on your

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.280
own computer or laptop or other device that you're playing games on anymore because so

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:58.160
much, you know, between Stadia and, you know, and so forth will be up in the cloud.

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.840
Look at the source. And people what people just say, oh, the cloud, whatever, is that

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:10.240
these particular services are highly encrypted and meant to work on the device that they

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:16.360
connect to. What you have on your computer will not affect the cloud based service.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.240
What they're going to deliver is what they deliver.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:26.000
Even if you had and I know this from experience, even if you had like a bajillion pieces of

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.560
malware on your computer, it's not going to affect the content that you put on a cloud

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.520
based service because they have their own local protection and local encryption.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:42.080
Right. So and so my kind of whole point is that this method of attack is not going to be

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:48.560
able to really work on the cloud, although I'm sure I'm sure there are evil people out

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:52.000
there, for lack of a better term, that would love to hack the cloud.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:23:00.000
Absolutely. And again, the Amazon Web services and these big Web providers.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.400
Right. Keep in mind, it's not a the cloud.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.720
It is cloud service for this provider.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.720
The cloud is a concept.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.920
Not really. Not really.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:17.800
The cloud itself, the term of a cloud is going to refer to each individual service when

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.560
people say, oh, I don't trust the cloud.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.520
Well, which one do you not trust?

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.240
Is it Google services?

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.440
Is it iCloud?

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.080
Is it going to be Microsoft's cloud based service?

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.720
Is it going to be Amazon's cloud based service?

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.040
Which fucking cloud are you talking about?

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.080
There are how many clouds in the sky?

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.560
Well, I'm afraid the cloud is going to rain.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.880
Which cloud? Is it the black one over there that looks like it's going to rain?

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.040
Or is it this white fluffy one over here that's doing jack shit to you?

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.280
I don't like cloud either.

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.120
His hair is too big.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.640
Girl, but I'm saying is that people have this, like, concept of a cloud and it's not a

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.800
concept anymore.

01:23:54.120 --> 01:24:00.560
It is a working system for each provider of this cloud service.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.880
You're the cloud is not something up in the air.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.760
It's a computer sitting a computer server sitting in some closet in whatever company's,

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.520
you know, IT location.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.000
I got to read some good comments from our chat here.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.360
Bob Coffee in chat says it's like the claw from Toy Story, only it's the cloud.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.880
Bonds 006 in chat says, thank you, Jamie.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.200
So many times I hear people say that exact.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.480
I don't trust the cloud.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:29.720
Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.560
But but you'll put all your money in a bank.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.080
You don't trust the cloud, but you put all your money in a bank.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:41.400
Same diff. Well, on top of that, most of our money isn't physical money, per se.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.840
It's in line with money is just a concept.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.760
Well, it's how it's becoming, at least here.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:54.920
I know in other countries they're still very much, you know, physical money based, but a

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.760
lot of our fundage is, you know, people were like poo pooing on cryptocurrency.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:08.440
But how much of your do you get a do a lot of people get a physical cash sum of money

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.560
into their hand and individual bills and coins that they are going to then put in a box

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.360
somewhere to save? Or are you getting direct deposit?

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.840
Are you getting a check? You're getting a representation.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.160
That's anyway.

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.040
No, it's fine, because a Bobby, but not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but Bobby

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.520
Black Wolf in chat says money here is just a concept.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.600
Yes, it only has value because everyone agrees it has value.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.280
Social contract. You you just defined Bitcoin.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.880
Exactly. That's what I brought up.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.200
Cryptocurrency is the same difference, really.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.040
You know, it's just the only reason that cryptocurrency was having such a thing is

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:47.240
because they told you flat out, no, this is your virtual money.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.960
You know, they don't need to have cryptocurrency because their own currency is

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:58.640
digital. You can pay me and Travis Donovan fun bucks if you want, but the bummer is

01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.880
Starbucks don't take it.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:07.920
Exactly. We have no need for cryptocurrencies because our currency is already in the

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.120
ether. Shouldn't OLR have a currency, though?

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.160
Carl, do you know what a actual tax burden that would be for us?

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.840
Just we would have to register as it was a joke.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.240
It was it was just a concept.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.360
All right. Anyway, I know, but you know me.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.320
I think actual logistics when for half a moment, I think something might be a good

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.520
idea. All right.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.200
Well, before we scare people too much, let's move on to our next story.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.840
Loki, I would, by the way, be paid in blood or in just Questbuster, just saying.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:41.880
Well, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Game Boy, as we talked about last

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:51.640
week, there was this wonderful post by GitHub pointing out this GB Studio by, I

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.080
guess, Chris Molti or Moltby.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.200
Yeah, Chris Moltby.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:03.000
So what he did is he created this he created a game for a game jam called

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.200
Untitled GB Game.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:11.800
And with that, he also built tools to basically build Game Boy ROMs without any

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.720
coding. And so he's actually releasing those tools to allow anybody to go ahead

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.280
and make stuff with it.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.600
You can make actual Game Boy ROMs.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:27.440
So if you're interested in checking it out, you can go download it at GB Studio dot

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:36.120
dev. And yeah, and it looks like it's pretty straightforward as far as like an

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.040
editor for games and stuff.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.440
And maybe you can make something out of it.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.840
And it looks like he made an adventure game out of using those tools.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.840
And I think that's pretty cool to be something fun, kind of fun to mess around

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:53.600
with. And since it actually makes real Game Boy ROMs, that'll be handy when that

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.880
Game Boy Classic Edition comes out someday.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.000
So, yeah, I'm going to check it out.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.440
Are you going to start and never finish a game in GB Studio?

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.440
Probably will never start.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.000
I think I think it's great, though.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.760
I love it because we kind of have there was this and there was something at GDC

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.120
about the NES and you can make your own game.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.280
So I'm kind of loving this whole like, hey, it's like the Unreal Engine, but you

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:22.240
make Game Boy games with it or you make Nintendo games with it.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.640
Speaking of Unreal Engine, when you're talking about ZZT earlier, I was

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.840
wondering, like thinking about, oh, man, wouldn't it be awesome if they, like,

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.120
remastered ZZT in the Unreal Engine?

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.240
It's just super, like, super well textured and lit text characters.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.080
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:45.880
Something else I think some people are going to be hyped about is the upcoming

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:48.120
mobile title, Mario Kart Tour.

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.040
Mario Kart Tour is anticipated in the summer of 2019.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.160
But if you want to get your hands on it early, they are opening up a beta test.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.760
So you can sign up for a beta test from now.

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.920
It already started through May 7th.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:08.440
And the beta test is planned from May 22nd through June 4th.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.960
So I bet we're going to get a lot more information about what Mario Kart Tour

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.480
is around that time when the beta opens up.

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:20.920
Unfortunately, though, the beta is limited to Android, so it will not be a beta on

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.480
the iOS platform.

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:29.120
I'm going to assume that could be because I cannot remember the name of the

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:32.080
application that allows you to beta test over there.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.800
But I used it because Niantic, you had to have the test wheel or something.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:39.040
I don't remember the name of the app, but there's like a there's a side app that you

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.000
load on your phone that allows you to basically run the beta test stuff.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.120
And I think you're limited to like a thousand deploys or something like that.

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.640
I want to say that's the thing I've heard somewhere.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:53.440
So I imagine that Nintendo does not want to just open that up for an open beta test.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.520
They're probably still testing on iOS, but they're probably just doing that

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.360
internally instead.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.280
They're going to open this one up.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.680
They're stress testing to Android will probably be a little bit easier to get it

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.480
out there to folks.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.640
So that is my thought anyway.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.920
I certainly don't know anything concrete on that.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:11.160
So but I imagine those because you're the only Android person here, right?

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.400
So maybe are you going to sign up for that?

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.520
You can check out the already did or he did it.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.720
So all right.

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.040
Cool. All right.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.040
Well, let's move on.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.880
We're going to take a trip down memory lane.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.160
We're going to go back to a time when you didn't beta test games.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.000
There was no there was a you know, if something screwed up in-house testing, it

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.640
was a feature, not a bug.

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.200
It's the classic game of the week.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:36.760
And Dark Soccer is going to walk us down memory lane and visit a classic game from

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.640
her vault, her archives.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.960
And this is an interesting one you picked this week.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.880
I think Dark Soccer.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.600
I tried to go for something a little bit different.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.120
It's actually a game I didn't get a lot of play in myself.

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.080
I played the sequel a good bit more than this one.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.440
All right. Well, I want to hear all about it.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.520
What is the classic game of the week?

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:55.520
The game is Pool Radiance is one of the AD&D games.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.120
If you don't know, it's Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.600
But it's a role playing video game that's put out by Strategic Simulations Inc.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.120
SSI in 1988.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.040
So some of you didn't exist.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.080
And that makes me sad.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.640
It is the first of TSR's AD&D games.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:17.120
This is back when TSR owned Dungeons and Dragons.

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:25.160
But it was the first adaptation of the tabletop game for a home computer.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:29.480
It was the first episode in a four part series of these.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:35.760
It was the gold box series that used the game engine that was created for this one.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:39.520
And it was used in later D&D titles, including Neverwinter Nights.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.800
But the game is Pool Radiance.

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.640
It takes place in the Forgotten Realms.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:46.560
If anyone did, you know, Forgotten Realms D&D.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.600
I didn't do a lot of Forgotten Realms myself.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:53.560
I played a little bit in it on tabletop, but mostly it was it was...

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.880
What did I play? Oh, Planescape and...

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.600
Great. Now I can't remember.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.880
Dragonlance because I love Dragonlance.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:08.760
Anyway, just a quick note, too, for those that are watching on Twitch and you can hear

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:09.880
the background noise as well.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.160
I'm sure Darcic will talk about the multi platform, but you're going to see the Amiga

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.360
version of this for a couple of minutes.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.360
It's going to flip over to the NES version here in a moment.

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.520
OK, because, yeah, it's hard to find gameplay that people aren't blabbing over.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:24.760
Well, we took that gameplay and then we just put the soundtrack music over it.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.840
So it worked out. Yeah, we're easy that way.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:37.960
Anyway, it takes a part in around the port city of Flann, P-H-L-A-N, Flann.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.880
You can make your party up to six characters.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:46.800
You decide your race, your gender, your class and your ability scores.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.120
You basically are just doing questing, really, because isn't that what D&D is?

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:58.320
Where you go on a quest and you do shit and then you get money for it and then you try

01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.760
not to die when a dragon shows up.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:06.120
But at any rate, you move around from the various characters, you know, for various

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:11.640
areas, you battle, you know, enemies as you do, and then you grow with experience points

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:16.120
that let you increase your capabilities again, just like D&D.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.880
And then you have different perspectives in the games.

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.760
You usually start with a first person perspective, with the screen divided into

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:30.880
sections with pertinent information, and then combat is done in a top down what's

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.560
called video game isometric view.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:38.280
At any rate, it was a very well received game for what it was.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:44.320
Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for best fantasy or science fiction computer game of 1988.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:51.000
Some people said it was a little bit too similar to other games, but the graphics and its role playing

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.120
and combat aspects were very, very, very well lauded.

01:33:54.120 --> 01:34:00.280
And of course, you could export your player characters from Pool of Radiance to the

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.440
subsequent games in the series.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:09.960
And it used that same AD&D set, so this was more like 1.5 era of D&D, maybe second edition.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:15.440
And then, of course, you know, you had your exploration mode that uses that first person perspective.

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.280
You had, you know, different characters that you would meet, you would see your people lined up,

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.240
you had your character stat information.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:30.320
In combat, it was diametric projection, where you would decide the actions that the character

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.880
would take place in each round.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.120
Of course, you know, designed by your hit points, you would have different combat options,

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.240
depending on class, like your melee and ranged weapons.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.640
Magic users have spells.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.360
Thieves can do backstab by positioning themselves.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.520
So it had like all kinds of different points from multiple different types of game systems.

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.720
But again, it was set in Forgotten Realms in the around the city of Flann.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:04.640
It was located on the northern shore of the Moonsea, along the Beren River between Zentilkeep and

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:10.160
Melvant, if anyone still remembers their geography from Forgotten Realms.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:16.160
So at any rate, it was, again, the first game built on AD&D rules.

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:22.600
The scenario was created by several of the big TSR designers, Jim Warr, David Cook,

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.720
Steven Winter, and Mike Brault.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.920
And then it was programmed by the special projects team at SSI.

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:38.240
It was meant to be, it was actually created to play on Apple II and Commodore 64.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.000
And then the game engine was used again for other series that were in the Gold Box series.

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:51.960
It actually did have books that came out later, so it brought out more manuals.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:59.600
And it brought information from some of the other core D&D books, including The Unearthed Arcana and Monster Manual II.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:08.600
And then, of course, there were books that came out afterwards, but there also were so many different versions that came after that.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:14.080
So it was first on Commodore 64, Apple II series, IBM PC compatible computers at the time.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.600
It was announced for Atari ST.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:25.720
The Mac version came out in 1989, and it had a slightly different interface that was meant to work on the black and white Macs as well, like the Mac Plus and Mac Classic.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:33.960
And then there was also an Amiga version that came out, as we were looking at, PC 9800.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.960
In Japan, it had a fully translated version and had full color graphics.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:45.160
There was the version on the NES that came out as Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Pool of Radiance in 1992 when it came out.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:51.680
And it was the only version to have a complete soundtrack that was composed by Toda Seiji.

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:59.400
And he was also signed to Pony Canyon's label at the time, so there was a soundtrack release.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.440
The same soundtrack also came on the PC 9801 version.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:10.800
The Amiga version had extra music, but while the other versions just had like one song that would play through it.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:19.160
It came with a 28 page booklet that talked more about the concepts behind it and the character creation, just the how to.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:27.200
This is a 38 page adventure journal that had the game's background, so it really came with just a bunch of stuff for those PC versions.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.680
Back in my day before I had to go to an Internet site to see it all.

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:37.680
Well, and then there was a copy protection that used lined up pictures, so you had to use a decoder wheel.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.720
And after three unsuccessful attempts, the game would shut itself down.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.280
So there were later versions.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:52.960
The other ones that came out was Curse of the Azure Bonds in 1989, Secret of Silver Blades in 1990, and Pools of Darkness in 1991.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:01.440
There's also a game called Hillsfar that was not in the Pools of Radiance series, but it was another D&D game.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.040
And it actually, all these games got good write ups in Dragon Magazine as well.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:09.040
You can import your Pools of Radiance characters into Hillsfar as well.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.960
But they were just reduced to basic levels and didn't have any of their magic abilities or magic content.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.080
It was really just such a big package, Pools of Radiance was.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.120
And then, of course, there were novelizations that were released as well.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:36.520
D&D put out a game module called Ruins of Adventure that used the same adventure scenario in Pools of Radiance, including the plot, everything.

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:45.080
And it actually has clues that would be useful in the computer missions as well.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:54.000
And then, you know, Ruins of Adventure had linked many scenarios, which the whole thing is the core of Pools of Radiance.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.200
So it was very, like I said, very, very well received.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:06.440
And of course, it was compared to Might and Magic and Bard's Tale, both use very similar formats.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:18.680
But in the long run, this game was really considered just one of the, I'd say, cores of that tabletop style of computer gaming.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:25.160
And really, it was just, you know, one of the best.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:31.800
And then, of course, the one that I played the most of, though, and I might bring this up later, was Pools of Radiance, Ruins of Myth Draenor.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.400
So that came out in 2001 as released by Ubisoft.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.000
So, but we'll go into that one for another classic game.

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.000
All right. But there you go.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:43.720
There it is.

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.360
Pools of Radiance.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.440
Your classic game of the week.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.840
Where my D&D nerds at?

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.320
Second edition for life.

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.400
You got some people in chat that are shouting you out from that pick.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.040
Yeah.

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.000
I remember that.

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.440
That was a huge series.

01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.080
It really was.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.000
Like on the home computing systems.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.040
You're a Commodore dude.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.600
I didn't even realize, oh yeah, I remember all those games on Commodore.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:01.560
I didn't really play them.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.840
I didn't super get into them.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.680
Ultima was more my jam.

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:13.200
But I digress because, well, it was really the NES versions of Ultima that sucked me in because I played Ultima Exodus and Ultima Quest the Avatar.

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.520
I played those games on NES.

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:20.120
But what's funny is that as much as I was well aware of the AD&D series on computer, I never knew there was an NES version.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.640
I somehow missed that they ported that to the Nintendo at one point.

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.600
And it came out, you know, a couple of years later.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:36.720
So, yeah, it was very late in the the line of, you know, the Nintendo stuff and that is in the series of the game.

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:37.120
That is.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:43.240
And I think you referenced it in your spiel, but that is early, early Ubisoft that we're looking at basically with that.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:53.360
And that's kind of like I said, Ubisoft had the licensing for the release of the Ruins of Mythtron or later, which now when any Forgotten Realms thing that I

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.840
did, Mythtron or was the shit.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:02.080
It's really interesting how many of those companies from back in the day are actually still around, especially when you look at the rest of the world.

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.680
And it's like, wow, all the stores we shop that as a kid are closing.

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.160
But Ubisoft still around Activision, still around.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:13.880
ECA dropped the C at some point, became EA, but they're still around.

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.520
So it's just kind of interesting how a lot of those like old school computing game makers run at computer entertainment.

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:20.080
They were.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.000
And they put out like a piano construction set and pinball construction set.

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.280
Those are racing deconstruction set.

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.880
And they had a whole bunch of games.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.840
Those are my jam back in the day.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.840
So anyway, but I digress.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:45.440
Let's well, actually, I'm glad you brought up Commodore a little bit here because our break tonight has to do with Commodore 64 and a recent like kind of homebrew type

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:48.720
demake, if you will, that's been going around a lot.

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.720
This past couple of weeks.

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.320
So I decided to take a closer look in this quick little break segment tonight.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:54.640
Enjoy.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.200
OK, hello, everybody from my other studio, the office.

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:06.840
I thought for our break in the main studio this week, we could take a look at this this new kind of release for the Commodore 64.

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:10.600
Yeah, system that's well over 30, almost 35 years old at this point.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:18.320
There's this new release of an old game, Super Mario 64 and or Super Mario Brothers 64.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:23.360
Not to be confused with, of course, the Nintendo 64 version, but more the Commodore 64.

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:27.160
So as you can see on the title screen here, this is Super Mario Brothers 64.

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:34.600
I've actually muted the music here because we're on what's called what you would see a lot in the old Commodore 64 games, a loader screen.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:38.320
And sometimes it has its own custom music.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.440
And this particular one is very dark and ominous.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.560
I'll unmute it for a minute.

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.960
But you can hear it's just like this really kind of like low, like like kind of scary sounding thing almost.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.600
So I'm not sure and I will confess I'm running it through the emulator.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.880
I'm not sure if the emulator is butchering it somehow or something, but I think it's just kind of a little bit of a weird launcher.

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.080
But it looks really nice.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:05.360
So I'm going to mute that again for a minute while I set this up, because I'm sure Bobby's show tonight, I know he went to a classic computing show in the Atlanta area.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.080
And I think he got his hands on this as well.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:15.800
But I know a lot of people out there have been talking about this game a lot this week just because of the fact that, oh, this is kind of like a new release of an older game.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:22.600
But it's not that we haven't necessarily seen stuff like Super Mario Brothers on the Commodore 64 before.

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:30.960
Folks have definitely done hacks of the great Gianna Sisters, which was a game that was very similar to Super Mario Brothers.

01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:38.760
In fact, so similar that it was pulled from the market at one point and Nintendo shut it down, just like folks are saying they're shutting this one down, too.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.520
But is anybody really surprised?

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.200
Probably not.

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.080
But this one's kind of new.

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.080
You know, it just came out.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:49.160
And you see even here on the splash screen, it's been worked on for seven years by this zero page.

01:43:49.360 --> 01:44:00.480
And, you know, considering the technology we're talking about here, the fact that this will run on an actual Commodore 64, this is very impressive how much of the Nintendo game that kind of shoved into this.

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.000
So let's actually take a look at this here.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.440
So I'm going to unmute this so we can do the launcher screen again.

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:13.440
I'm going to use my joystick to start to get to make sure I'm in the right window here and start the game there.

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:16.320
Let me move my mouse out of the way just so it's not getting in the way.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.360
And there we go.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.920
You can see it's loading their little cute little loading.

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:20.840
And look at that.

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:24.040
The intro screen Super Mario Brothers, just like you might see it on the Nintendo.

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:26.080
And I'm going to hit my fire button to start.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.000
And I apologize.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.360
You can hear the clacking of my mechanical keyboard in the background.

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:41.200
But you'll notice one thing I noticed right off the bat is that it has a very faithful sound adaptation to the NES, which is interesting because the Commodore 64 SID chip was really nothing like the NES.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.600
So they've really reproduced it faithfully in this.

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:53.760
One interesting difference between the Commodore 64 and the NES is that the Commodore 64 only has one fire button on the joystick.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.480
And of course, the NES had the A button and the B button.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:59.080
So that doesn't necessarily translate very well.

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.600
What they end up doing is that the up key ends up being your jump.

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:07.600
So when I say key, of course, here I am playing in an emulator.

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.400
So it is mapped to a key because I'm playing on the keyboard.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:25.680
But if you were to be playing with an actual joystick, I'm sure you can imagine if you were actually using up to jump, that might control a little weird compared to what you're used to when you're actually playing on an NES where, you know, you have A and B and B is your run and A is your jump.

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.160
And you can kind of, I think, I think control things a little bit better that way.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:37.040
So having up as your jump, I'm sure if you're using a legitimate Commodore joystick, it's probably going to it's going to cause you to probably jump at times you don't really want to.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.760
But for emulation, it works pretty well.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.200
It is interesting to note that the great Gianna sisters actually did the same thing.

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.640
Great Gianna sisters used up for its jump as well, because, of course, there's only one fire button.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:52.560
But in the Gianna sisters, you couldn't run.

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.720
So controlling this is your run button slash oops.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:03.160
You'll notice I threw one fireball before I screwed up there while I was talking and I threw my one fireball.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.520
And that was that was the control key that did that as well.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.120
I think that did that shell just clip through those monsters.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.840
I didn't even pay enough attention there.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.560
So it's probably not a perfect oops, I died.

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.120
Not a perfect translation.

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.840
If it was perfect, I wouldn't have died right then.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.400
But still, again, very impressive considering the technology, how faithful it is.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:23.960
I mean, sure.

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:32.560
It's, you know, those question mark blocks are a little, you know, not quite the same fidelity that you would see on the NES, the goombas especially.

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.160
You can probably see how different they are.

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.040
Let's see if I can remember.

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:40.960
And notice that slowdown when there's all the animations of the blocks, everything.

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.920
Let's see if I can probably really slow it down with the superstar here.

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:49.320
Oh, yeah, there's that slowdown about that.

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:54.960
I'm sure you could do some tricks in the emulator to help the game through some of that.

01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:02.480
I'm just trying to make a beeline for the end here because I want to see if we can get the warp zone in this version.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:08.720
But I think since this is a pretty faithful adaptation, I'm expecting to see the warp zone.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.440
So let's take the lift up there.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.160
And there we are running on top, running on top.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.360
We did it.

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:20.200
We worked level four because every does anyone ever pick two or three?

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.400
I'm sure somebody out there is raising their hand.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:23.680
Well, I did it this one time.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.480
Most people would just want to go straight to world four to continue on.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:37.240
But anyway, yeah, I mean, you know, considering that some versions of Mario that were on the Commodore 64 previously might have hacked like the first four stages or something.

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:46.320
The fact that somebody went out there and actually reproduced the complete game is pretty awesome and is pretty likely to be shut down by Nintendo already.

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.880
But you know what they say once on the Internet, always on the Internet.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:57.160
So I can't exactly tell you where to get this yourself, but I'm sure if you know where to look, you'll find it pretty easy.

01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.560
Anyway, there it is, a look at the ROM that everybody's talking about this week.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:07.000
Very old game, very old system, but very cool to see these types of things remade.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.240
You know, you love it when you see things like Halo on the Atari 2600.

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.560
Come on, demakes are awesome.

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.400
Anyway, that's going to do it for me.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.960
Let's go back to the studio live.

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.880
Let's go back to the studio live.

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.320
Thank you, me, for that look at Super Mario Brothers on the Commodore 64.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:25.720
Some comments in the chat.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.160
Orange Right says, this is cool.

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.640
Quest Buster says, the person behind this did a really good job.

01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:30.600
Yeah, for sure.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.320
Darticuia says, I go three just to get all the one ups.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.240
Oh, OK.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.280
Yeah. When I was doing the warp zone there at the end, you can get all those one ups in world three.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.640
OK, fair enough. And some conversation there.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:43.680
Darticuia asking about the C64 Mini.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.120
Bobby Block was saying, I haven't tried it yet, but I have it.

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.120
The C64 Mini and this ROM.

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:54.880
Bobby also adding, I'm still skeptical if Nintendo actually sent a C&D or if they just said they got C&D to get press.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.880
Who knows? Well, if that was the case, it worked, that's for sure.

01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:03.880
But as I kind of referenced earlier, you know, Nintendo would certainly be well within their rights to do it.

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.600
But it is still an impressive feat nonetheless.

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:13.200
Anyway, speaking of like cease and desist and so forth, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here in a moment.

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:21.120
But in the past few weeks at this part of the show, Dark Sakura has usually promoted a podcast or hyped something up.

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.960
I don't know if you have something this week, but I have something.

01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.280
Why don't you go ahead and do it?

01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.480
Well, because I have something on the other side of it.

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.760
I have something. I have something I'm going to demote this week and tell you what.

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.400
Go for it. Oh, Loki has something to promote?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.600
OK, it's not really promotion, but we'll just go ahead and say it.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.760
Happy birthday, Naoki.

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.200
It's his birthday today.

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.920
OK, well, I'm all about promoting Naoki.

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:53.920
Naoki of course, from Konami, who did pretty much all the in-house music in the early DDR and our roots in the old school dance dance revolution.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.520
We did. We got to meet him once.

01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.040
I think actually I think I met him more than once.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.720
I met him once at that. You and I met him at that Konami thing where they unveiled Supernova.

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:06.080
Right. Because people don't know Loki was like the first person outside Konami to play Supernova in the U.S.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.960
And let's see.

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.320
Also, and that was second.

01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.200
And what was going to say?

01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:16.040
Oh, E3 that year, that year they did the Kinect game, whatever that thing was called.

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:19.800
It was like the Para Para sorta with the Kinect was there that year.

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:23.760
Was that also the year like I just pretty much followed around Igarashi the whole time?

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.440
Yes. Dance Dance Evolution.

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:29.400
But like, yeah, I remember like everyone's like, oh, my God, Metal Gear Solid 3 or something like that.

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.920
I'm like, oh, my God, Supernova, who cares about your Super Metal Gear Solid 3?

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:34.320
I don't want to play that.

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.600
Everyone's like, I'm not playing that.

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.640
I think there was a particular reason we were because, you know, we did.

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.760
That was like the first time you and I got invited to something.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:47.240
And you were, of course, I say you and I, but Jamie just had a conflict with the work or something and couldn't go.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:53.480
We were all invited. But like you and I, we had to like sign stuff and like all this thing, because like that was

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.960
the first big thing we got to do.

01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.920
And I think because that's what they were showing and they knew who we were.

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:03.720
Yes. And then then we also learned that apparently even though we all signed an NDA, everybody,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.960
they had deals with certain outlets to break that NDA early because, you know, we're not IGN.

01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:13.480
Yeah, we got a lesson in some harsh realities in the industry.

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:16.960
Anyway, I want to I actually I wanted to talk about this at some point.

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:19.760
So I'll talk about it during our segment. We usually talk about other podcasts.

01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.920
So there's a big app that came out this week and they've been doing a lot of advertising.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.600
And you might have heard about this on some different like websites and stuff.

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:31.360
And I really didn't want to name it by name to give it any additional press.

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:36.800
But I think I'm going to have to just to tell you to basically stay away from it and why I'm really unhappy with what they're doing.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:40.640
It is called Luminary. And you've probably seen this on some billboards.

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.440
You've probably seen about it on Twitter and so forth.

01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:47.480
And basically what they're trying to do is they're wanting to be the Netflix of podcasting.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:51.120
So they are basically going to be offering a variety of podcasts.

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:57.480
And, you know, when they first kind of pitched it, they said they're going to be putting out like what, like 40 celebrity podcasts.

01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:01.000
So like, I don't like Trevor Noah has a podcast on there.

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:07.080
John Cameron Mitchell, who was Hedwig and the Angry Inch and all that, has a show on there.

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:10.800
Lena Dunham, sigh, has a podcast on there.

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.760
So it's this, you know, new thing.

01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:16.880
And they want to charge you basically a monthly fee to listen to these premium podcasts.

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:25.640
And that was my first problem when I first heard about this thing, as I said, well, OK, y'all, that's not like that's not really a podcast.

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:28.280
Now, if you're charging for it, right, you're charging people eight dollars a month.

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:31.160
That's like an audible dot com competitor.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:38.720
That's what you are. You're an audio, you know, you're selling songs like iTunes or or one of those types of sites.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:41.880
You're not really podcast when you're charging for it.

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:46.560
But whatever, because I kind of looked at the whole thing and I was just like, I don't know, I whatever.

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.920
We'll see what they do. But then the app came out this week.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:59.000
And guess what, y'all? They added a ton of free podcasts, regular podcasts to this app without asking.

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.800
Really? Mm hmm.

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.320
Guess guess who's there?

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.080
Us? Mm hmm.

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.760
Well, we send them a cease and desist.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.880
And we can we've you know, and I've I've thought about doing it.

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.360
Here's why I haven't done it yet.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:16.160
I'll get to that point in a minute here, because here and I'm going to tell you why this pisses me off.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:23.840
Because luminaries come from this perspective where they're saying, oh, well, all these free providers, we're just kind of like helping them get out there and all that stuff.

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:27.160
And, you know, they're we want to we want to spread their their free providers and all this stuff.

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:29.640
And I'm like, hold on, hold, wait, wait a fucking minute.

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.320
That's not what you're doing. You're using us to promote your patient.

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.000
They're not giving us any money.

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:40.640
Exactly. Here we pay to do what we do.

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:44.040
Are you saying Lena Dunham is more special than I am?

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:45.080
Fuck you.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.160
That's what I have to say about that.

01:53:48.640 --> 01:54:04.080
Like, I'm sorry, you're not going to use this show or any show to promote some type of like fee based gateway, as if there's these podcasts that are more premium, that are greater than others for whatever reason, because one, that's not a podcast.

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:12.400
You're selling a fucking audio book, audio, you're selling a spoken song, you're selling not a stand up comedy album, but you know, something like that.

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.600
We need to do a cease and desist and publish it.

01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.960
Well, girl, it's start the drama.

01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:24.600
It's done been started, like, you know, large podcasts that are already free, like Joe Rogan and all that stuff.

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:28.000
I have already sent those types and gotten delisted from the platform.

01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:32.560
The only reason I haven't held up from anyone for a while or yet, as I've said, you know what, I'm going to give him seven days.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.040
I'm going to give him seven days to say, how am I going to get paid?

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.920
Here's that. And I have never asked for money from doing all this stuff.

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:49.000
But in my opinion, Luminary, if you are going to use free shows to promote Lena fucking Dunham, then I want to know, where's my cut?

01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:50.880
I'm going to tweet them right now.

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.160
You and hundreds of other people.

01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:58.480
It's going to be like, where's the, when are you going to pay us back for the money that we put into our show if you're going to put it out there for free?

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:04.040
So anyway, please, when you see these types of things go on out there, please question them.

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:07.280
And when you see them like, I just, that's the part that pisses me off.

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.840
They're using all of these free shows and they're saying, oh, it's promotion and all this stuff.

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:20.960
And we didn't even get into the part where they were like, for a hot minute before they really got in hot water, they were like streaming it to their own servers.

01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:25.160
And like, so that people, we couldn't even track stats if people were listening for Luminary.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:25.640
Good.

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:27.960
I don't think anybody is listening through Luminary.

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:30.600
And I don't think, I think they've fucked this launch so hard.

01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:33.280
They had like a million dollars investment or something like that.

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:34.280
They've fucked this so hard.

01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.520
They're going to, they're going to go under.

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.400
Loki, I'm sorry, you look like you were dying to chime in.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:37.760
I'm sorry.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:39.760
Oh no, I wasn't chime in.

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:44.120
I just looking at their website, which seems stupid.

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.080
We give you access to all these podcasts.

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:47.240
I'm sorry.

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:50.320
Except you're not really giving people access to the podcast.

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.680
You can download their app on the app stores, which you can also download podcasts on those app stores.

01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.480
I'm not really sure.

01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:57.800
That's stupid.

01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:58.440
Here's what I said.

01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:01.480
If you were listening, OLR, then you need to ask for our permission.

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:05.480
If you were going to use us to make money for your paid content, then you need to pay us for our work.

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:06.920
Fair enough.

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.200
That's, that's all I'm asking.

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:09.040
Absolutely.

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.680
So anyway, I'm going to tag it with, uh, respect podcasters.

01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:23.320
I do want to remind everybody the official outlets for this show where we have asked to be listed are iTunes podcasts and Google play podcasts.

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.000
There are some other apps out there as well, uh, that also carry the show.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.960
And because they're not charging you money and they're, you know, for, you know, a tune in, I think actually is, would be one I would endorse as well because we did ask to be on there.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.160
Uh, and there's a few others that aren't coming to me in the moment.

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:45.880
Um, but, uh, and I, I, uh, I have heard the request to get this on Spotify and I'm there's, I, I actually am a Spotify premium person myself.

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:50.840
I have no problem with Spotify and asking to be on there, uh, will be fine.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:54.960
It's just a, I need to do some behind the scenes changes before we do that move there.

01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.000
It's, um, nothing important or anything, but just it's, I don't want to do that yet.

01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:03.040
Well, I do have a podcast to promote and they are Sacramento podcast.

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:03.640
Okay, cool.

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:03.880
Yes.

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:05.560
Let's send this on a positive note, please.

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:09.920
It's called our tour, our turn gaming for everyone.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:11.520
It's our turn podcast.com.

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:21.760
Looks like they do board games and tabletop gaming, and they also highlight, um, and encourage the views and accomplishments of women, um, queer people and people of color.

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:29.200
So definitely, and I'm, I'm just going to say queer people instead of the acronyms, just because we're all a little queer.

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:33.120
So, um, but yeah, definitely give them a check out.

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:41.160
They've been here for a little bit, not as long as us, cause we old, but, um, I found them through, um, through, uh, brief.

01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.280
So definitely check them out.

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:45.400
I miss her.

01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:46.720
I hope she comes back to the show someday.

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:47.600
All right.

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.600
She's doing mommy stuff.

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.080
I know.

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:49.440
I know.

01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:52.360
Hopefully she can get a break from that at some point when the kids 18.

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.040
All right.

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.080
We'll, we'll still be here.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:54.640
All right.

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.800
Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:57.200
Loki.

01:57:58.600 --> 01:57:59.000
All right.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.880
Well, Sega ages is doing some more games for the switch platform.

01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:21.560
Um, on the eShop right now, you can actually find Sega ages, Virtua racing, and they've got some pretty cool features in here, including they've upped the FPS of the single and a two player modes to 60 FPS, which is, you know, far better than it actually ran originally.

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:34.360
And then, um, they also have for anything above that, when that can be anything from three to eight players on one console, you can actually do split screen there and that's a six or 30 FPS.

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:39.480
But, uh, looks, it's kind of funny the way they have the screen set up for that.

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:42.600
You like, it's literally just like three by three by two.

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:47.280
So, um, pretty neat, but yeah, you can check that out.

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:52.440
Um, I wonder if it's going to be coming out over here as well, but you know, we can get the eShop stuff as well.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:59:02.080
I think if you have a way to purchase that stuff, um, and then of course we have a date now for shakedown Hawaii, which is a game I'm looking forward to.

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:10.920
It is the kind of followup to retro city rampage, and it's going to be coming out on May 7th for $20 on PlayStation four switch.

01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:11.800
And guess what?

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:16.720
That system that everybody seems to forget about the Vita, it is coming out there as well.

01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:22.680
And they're also going to be doing a physical version of, uh, retro city rampage as well on May 3rd.

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:26.800
Um, and you can get that for $29.99.

01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:27.880
It's going to be limited though.

01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:31.080
Only 4,800 units are going to be available for that.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.320
Um, I am looking forward to this.

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:38.200
This one's actually, you see the retro city rampage is more like an NES GTA game.

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.320
In fact, that's actually how it started originally.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.120
They were trying to create a GTA game and like an NES style.

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:51.400
Well, actually it was GTA on the NES, but then they found out that the system couldn't handle what they wanted to do.

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:56.800
So they ended up making a GTA style game on, um, PC and stuff.

01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:02.000
And now this one's like a super Nintendo style 16 bit game, but same type of stuff.

02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:02.960
It looks awesome.

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:05.520
All right.

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:13.920
Well, uh, speaking of things that have limited runs, um, the, uh, the company limited run, uh, games has announced that they're going to be putting out a limited physical runs of

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:19.280
luminous remastered, which of course was the, uh, you know, redone version of the first luminous game.

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:23.600
Uh, they're going to be putting out a special limited run on PlayStation four and Nintendo switch.

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.480
So if you are looking for a physical media version of this, uh, that would be pretty awesome.

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:36.360
There's going to be a regular release and a $140 ultimate edition for the ultimate luminous fan, which I may or may not be.

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:36.920
So I don't know.

02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:37.960
I don't know 140 bucks.

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:42.880
That's a lot of money, but they're trying to tempt you with a special light up presentation box.

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:43.320
Ooh.

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.080
Vinyl soundtrack.

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:45.360
All right.

02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:45.880
That's pretty good.

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:52.600
A key chain, an enamel pin, and a collector's certificate hand signed by Mizuguchi himself.

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:53.400
Ooh.

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:55.320
So kind of charging for an autograph as well.

02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.000
That's pretty good.

02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:58.120
Anyway, uh, the pre-orders already went up.

02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.760
They went up on April 26.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:01.320
I'm assuming it's probably already sold out.

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.200
It probably went out like that.

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.840
So even if I wanted it, it's probably already gone.

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.480
Uh, so, um, yeah, that's pretty cool that they're actually doing that though.

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:16.400
Um, also something that was announced that people have to look forward to persona five, scramble the Phantom strikers.

02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:29.640
This is a game that is going to be coming out for PlayStation four and switch, which is interesting because they still haven't confirmed an official release of play a persona five for switch, but whatever there's going to be this, at least this is going to be a Musso type of game.

02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:31.480
It was announced during a persona concert.

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.200
Uh, they showed a trailer for it.

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:34.480
So yeah, it's going to be interesting.

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.680
That means like, uh, what that's, um, what's the, what's the Musso game?

02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:38.880
Dynasty warriors.

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:39.240
That's it.

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.800
The one was like kill the mobs and mobs and mobs of people.

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.920
So that's going to be kind of fun that a persona is getting a version of that.

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:48.320
I'm sure, uh, fans will check that out as an aside.

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:53.720
It's neat that persona gets all these kind of like side games, you know, because there's dancing games and you know, so on.

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:55.600
Anyway, uh, dark soccer, what do you have for us?

02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:00.000
Um, well more Fortnite bullshit, but this is good bullshit.

02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:02.440
Um, Thanos is back.

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:14.240
Um, so you will be, this is a tie in with end game, but you will be able to, um, control the Chitauri from the movie, from the first movie or whoever came with them.

02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:16.840
I didn't really watch all the way through the, whatever.

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:20.760
But anyway, the reality stone, uh, gives you health and shields doubled.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.320
Uh, the soul stone is siphon for Thanos.

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.840
Uh, mind stone is jump height doubled.

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:30.440
Space stone is ground pound AOE tripled.

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:37.160
Time stone is knockback added to each hit and power stone is laser damage power.

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:39.200
And an awesome game on the Dreamcast.

02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:39.720
Yes.

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:50.200
And then in other news, uh, Walmart in Canada, uh, basically they had a little bit of fun with the Rage 2 League with a special pre-order box art.

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:58.680
And, um, it says, uh, written around it, like incorrect key art, wrong font, and all all caps.

02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.000
And it was just pretty funny.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.040
They're saying like, here, hey Walmart, Canada, here's some, it's basically pretty funny.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:10.120
So, um, cause they had, uh, unexpectedly leaked the list of games.

02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:13.320
And so they're having fun with themselves.

02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:22.640
So it's actually, um, the Walmart is the, uh, the, the thing where they were called out for it.

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:23.400
So it's pretty funny.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:25.440
That's it.

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:29.640
All right.

02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:34.240
And let's talk a little bit about what is coming out.

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:40.800
Not much because we're in April and it's, it's pretty, pretty slow at this time of year.

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:49.480
So, uh, we've got Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age that's coming out on Switch and Xbox One and U-Boat on PC.

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:50.760
And that is it.

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:52.920
Enjoy your Final Fantasy 12.

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.240
Um, if I'm not mistaken, it is golden week in Japan this week, if I'm not mistaken.

02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:06.800
So it's, um, it is the, as far as releases go, there really isn't anything you can get some third party peripherals and things like that.

02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:08.400
Um, but that is really about the new stuff.

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:09.960
I think last week was your last big week.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.480
So Japan is now I really got nothing to note this week as far as release dates.

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:21.880
Um, in the UK on 29th, uh, there's Final Fantasy, uh, 12, the Zodiac Age fade to silence.

02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.680
Um, also on May 2nd is wasteland two uppers.

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:30.440
Um, sounds like a party there.

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:34.400
Um, the legend of heroes trails of cold steel too.

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:35.440
And that's it.

02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:38.920
All right.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:40.880
Let's go to the mail bag then I guess.

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.520
Full of cookies.

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:42.200
There's no mail.

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:43.520
There's no emails?

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:45.560
No, it's a promo thing.

02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:48.640
Oh, well then that's, yeah, we don't, we don't read spam on here.

02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:55.080
Um, but, um, well that means we get to talk about Drag Race if we didn't get any emails that participate at orangeonshooter.com.

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:56.360
Silky needs to go.

02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:57.880
I didn't watch this last week.

02:04:58.360 --> 02:04:59.760
I'm only up through snatch game.

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.680
Who do you want to win at this point?

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:09.000
Well, I don't know, cause Evie kind of disappointed me.

02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:16.240
Um, and knowing what I know about this episode, I don't really don't want to spoil much, but I'm still down for Evie.

02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:25.360
Um, my prediction for top four, and this is going to be excluding Silky from anything that exists.

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:28.000
So, I mean, I'm sure that bitch is going to make it, but I don't want to name her.

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:43.480
As I'm thinking Evie, Brooklyn, um, Vanjie and, um, she's probably going to be there, but I'm actually going to more, cause I don't know.

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.400
They're not, she's not saying enough good about Nina.

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:48.440
And I think they might have a kind of a bone to pick.

02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:48.880
I don't know.

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:51.440
Just that she's still too quirky or something.

02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.120
People don't really respect the campy queens.

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:56.360
I'm getting really irritated with Drag Race and the judging this season.

02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:58.120
It's really inconsistent.

02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:09.240
And I really feel like queens like Nina and sugar cane really notably like I, I find that I really stand sugar cane and like she's completely invisible on the show.

02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:11.320
And it's like, it's at the point where it's pissing me off.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:17.560
Like, especially for somebody that had like the best dress in the show's history that came down the runway a couple of weeks ago.

02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:21.320
Like it's just, it blows my mind that she's just getting slept on completely.

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:23.320
And it's just like Naomi Smalls and all stars.

02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:30.160
But the other, the other thing too, though, is that, I mean, if you think about though in the past queens that like, they're like, oh, you need to change your silhouette.

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:30.720
You need to do different.

02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:31.480
You need to do different.

02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:35.560
What bitch didn't change her look at all and is the best winner ever?

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:37.120
Bianca Del Rio.

02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:37.400
No.

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:41.800
Anyway, if you want us to not talk about Drag Race next week, you can send us an email.

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:44.240
Participate at orange lounge trader.com.

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:47.800
Cause otherwise we're just going to assume you want to hear more about our opinions on Drag Race.

02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:50.200
So from there, Loki, you can wake up and get it.

02:06:50.200 --> 02:07:02.000
I'm just saying, uh, Sia Tabiri says, I think Nina has been doing much better than Vangie, but I feel like Vangie has been carried a lot and I agree Vangie has been carried a lot, but she's so addictive.

02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:03.560
Like she's just her personality.

02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:04.440
You just want to be a friend.

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:05.880
They compared her to Alyssa Edwards.

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:12.200
She's got that Alyssa factor where she could be a hot fucking mess and still you want to pay attention.

02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:13.200
She's going to get her own show.

02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.440
Anyway, I promise we move on.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:15.080
So let's move on.

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:15.640
All right.

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.200
Uh, Loki.

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:18.120
Yeah, we'll just spoil it.

02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.200
And Game of Thrones instead next time.

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:22.680
Just kidding.

02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:23.320
I wouldn't do that.

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:24.880
All right.

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:28.960
So let's talk a little bit about, um, some new stuff coming to Overwatch.

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:29.880
So this is kind of cool.

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:36.960
They have this new Overwatch workshop mode, which allows you to create new game types in Overwatch itself.

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:42.160
So I guess kind of, um, fun ways to just mix up some of the rules in the game.

02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:47.600
So one example map that they create or game mode is basically the floor is lava.

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:53.840
So if you are, I'm sorry, they're calling it molten floor, but you know, the rules of the floor is lava.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:57.880
So you touch the ground, you catch on fire and that's the rule.

02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:04.560
And so, um, there's a bunch of other fun things you can do and different, um, stuff you can script out in there.

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:06.520
But it's pretty neat.

02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:12.520
I saw another example where there was one where people have to do emotes to kill each other or insta kill people or something like that.

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:14.840
So that was something that was interesting.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:19.320
Um, but I'm curious to see what kind of fun game modes come out of this.

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:22.800
You know, maybe I should fire up Overwatch. I haven't played it in a long time.

02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:26.600
Yeah, I haven't played Overwatch in a hot minute either.

02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:28.560
And, uh, this kind of sounds interesting though.

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:34.920
I like, I like these, um, there's just, it's just begging to like have these silly YouTubes and silly contests and competitions.

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:37.080
This is really right up your alley is what I'm saying.

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:38.800
Yeah.

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:42.160
I mean, it sounds interesting some of the stuff they're going to be able to do with this.

02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:44.760
So I can't wait to see in a couple of weeks what we have.

02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:46.560
All right.

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:52.560
Well, if I'm making things in Overwatch isn't up your alley, perhaps making things in Super Mario Brothers is.

02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:55.160
Uh, I know I'm looking forward to Super Mario Maker 2.

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.720
I'm sure a lot of you guys are as well.

02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:57.600
And we have a date.

02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:00.800
Mario Maker 2 will be out on June 28th.

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.640
It was announced in a tweet this past week.

02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:05.120
Hey, that's my birthday week essentially.

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:06.600
Cause my birthday is June 26.

02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:07.840
It's not too early to start planning.

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.000
It's a y'all birthday week.

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:10.480
So, uh, what do you mean?

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:11.120
You and Alan?

02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:15.200
Uh, Alan is two weeks after me, so close because he's July 8th.

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:20.160
We usually celebrate together around the 4th of July makes a really good time to celebrate.

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:28.080
So anyway, um, Mario Maker 2 was dated and, uh, apparently some other things that were announced is that there's going to be a stylist.

02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.000
So it's going to be a special official stylist that will go with Super Mario Maker 2.

02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:35.040
It's going to be a pre-order bonus in Japan and Europe.

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:39.160
Uh, we haven't heard about the U S yet, but we're going to hope that that's a thing.

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:40.960
Uh, we haven't heard anything official yet.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.240
I don't see why would they leave us out?

02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:43.040
That'd be very mean.

02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:43.480
I don't know.

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:53.200
But, uh, what should be noted about Europe and the release of Super Mario Maker 2 over there is that it's going to be bundled with a year of Switch Online.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:10:00.920
If you pre-order Mario Maker 2 in Europe, uh, you get the online, um, Switch Online as well for a whole year.

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.080
I don't believe Europe is getting the Twitch Prime thing that we're getting here.

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.400
Granted Twitch Prime isn't free.

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:17.520
But it is interesting that maybe it's a different way to kind of at least give that same perk to the folks over in Europe where they can get a year of a Switch Online.

02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.320
So there is that.

02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:20.840
Um, you guys looking forward to Mario Maker 2?

02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:21.360
I know I am.

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:22.280
I'm definitely picking that up.

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:23.840
That's like a day one release for me.

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:25.040
Uh, what about you, Logie?

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:26.760
Yeah, I'm getting to day one.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:27.480
Definitely.

02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:29.720
All right.

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:32.120
Anyway, I'm sorry.

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:33.400
I have a mouthful of cookie again.

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:35.160
I make some good fucking cookies though.

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:35.440
Right.

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:41.320
Anyway, it'd also help if I had the right window pulled open.

02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:49.520
So, um, at any rate, Kingdom Hearts 3, um, uh, Remind DLC has been announced with new secret endings.

02:10:50.200 --> 02:11:01.520
Um, so basically, um, it was announced during the Kingdom Hearts Orchestra World of Tress concert that, um, uh, Nomura, uh, announced that there would be additional DLC.

02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:04.080
It's similar to a final mix thing.

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:14.440
And the scenario is called Rii colon mind, and it's going to have a limited cut episode and bosses, optional English voiceovers for the Japanese version, a secret episode and a boss.

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:18.800
You'll also receive a new form and a new key blade as a free download.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:24.800
Um, no date yet, but, um, you know, the last thing that we got was the free critical mode.

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:28.640
So that was for more challenging, more challenging gameplay.

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:29.720
There you go.

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:31.200
All right.

02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:36.360
Um, so this is kind of a cool thing, especially since we are fans of Katamari Damacy.

02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:45.200
So we talked, um, probably months ago about, I think it was a few months ago about this website called noclip.website.

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:50.000
That allowed you to kind of fly through different 3d games to kind of check out the levels.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:57.400
So, um, they had, you know, I think there was some of the, I want to say F-Zero was in there, but I know like they had a, maybe it was Wipeout.

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.440
Several different maps that you can fly through.

02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:12.320
Well, one of the games that the creator of the website, Jasper wanted to have included on there, but was unable to figure out the file format was Katamari.

02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:25.240
And of course he offered a $500 bounty to any buddy who could reverse engineer, uh, the Katamari Damacy file formats to be able to port that into his website.

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:32.160
Well, thankfully now that has happened and he was able to get, um, the data in there.

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:41.960
So now you can actually fly through, um, several of the levels from the game, thanks to some help from some friendly modders.

02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:44.080
So that's pretty cool.

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:47.680
This is me now that we're gonna get modded levels because I want modded levels.

02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:48.920
I'm hoping.

02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:50.840
I sure hope so.

02:12:50.840 --> 02:13:00.760
I think that would be, I'm surprised that hasn't already happened where Katamari Damacy PC has been like altered to add these new levels and things, but this, this maybe is a step in that direction.

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:01.080
I don't know.

02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:02.760
Hopefully.

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:06.520
All right.

02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:09.320
Well, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up discord.

02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:15.680
So if you want to join us live on the show, you want to talk to us, uh, just join our discord server, vog network.com.

02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:20.960
That's vog network or voicegeeksnetwork.com slash discord, uh, to get your invite.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:21.880
And it's all free.

02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:22.520
It's discord.

02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:24.120
I think many of you are using it at this point.

02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:30.560
Um, you can join in there and then you just head on over to the green room and just a shout out in the orange on studio channel, what you want to talk about.

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:35.560
Uh, and we'll be pulling you guys on air, uh, to talk with us if you are interested.

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:39.640
So anyway, um, before we get there though, I want to talk about Snapchat.

02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.120
That's right.

02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:41.480
Snapchat.

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:44.160
Do you guys actually use Snapchat at all?

02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:45.600
Probably, okay, probably not.

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:53.000
I think it's more a thing that kids, even I barely use Snapchat, but it's because I found that more people were watching Instagram stories and Snapchat stories.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.280
So I kinda, I kinda went over there, which by the way, follow me on Instagram.

02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:57.280
It is at Mr.

02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:58.360
Rob Roberts, Mr.

02:13:58.360 --> 02:13:58.920
Rob Roberts.

02:13:58.920 --> 02:13:59.200
Anyway.

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:05.160
Um, but you know, Snapchat and bitmoji are like tied together.

02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:06.080
They own each other.

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.240
Have you ever used bitmoji at all?

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:08.680
Is that a thing?

02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:09.880
No, I've used bitmoji.

02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:16.240
You create silly little avatars of yourself and then you can like copy paste them in, in certain poses and text messages.

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:18.720
My sister uses it all the time when she sends me messages.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.800
So anyway, interesting.

02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:26.040
We've kind of heard rumblings that Snapchat might be doing something involving gaming and perhaps this is a sign of that.

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:32.200
I don't know, but Snapchat earlier this week launched a bitmoji for games SDK.

02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.960
This will let game developers replace characters with bitmoji.

02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:45.920
So that way, if somebody has downloaded that bitmoji and created a little cartoon version of themselves, which that does, now you can insert that in a game.

02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:59.920
Essentially, it's basically like the Miis on Nintendo, but what bitmoji is doing and Snapchat as, as the owners of that, what they're doing is basically opening that up to other people to make a game where you would feature the bitmoji as the stars.

02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:03.240
It's kind of, kind of an interesting way to try to push that concept further.

02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:15.200
In a little pull quote here, they say, our vision is for gamers to open up their favorite game regardless of what device it's on and easily scan and play to bring their bitmoji directly into the game.

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:26.040
At the option to choose an avatar or character, gamers will be shown a snap code on screen, prompting them to scan the code via Snapchat to link the account and play as your own bitmoji.

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:33.720
So there is support right now for Unity, Unreal and PlayCanvas, which is a British VR company already in Snapchat.

02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:38.680
That's, you know, especially what's interesting about that is that essentially they're saying that's not limited to just phones then.

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:44.120
You would be able to do this on like, if you wanted to, I guess, a PlayStation 4 game or a PC game.

02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:53.240
And by scanning that link, then it's going to like, it's kind of like when you, I don't know, validate Netflix or something using a device code instead of actually signing in.

02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:54.680
So it sounds kind of neat.

02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:57.400
I don't know, Loki, you think you think developers may actually use this?

02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:59.800
You think this is a good move for bitmoji?

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.880
I'm sure someone will use it.

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.840
I just don't, I don't know.

02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:08.040
I don't think it's going to be like a must have thing.

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:10.000
But I'm sure someone will use it.

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:13.000
Obviously, they think someone's going to use it.

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:20.440
Bonds 006 in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, I actually like that bitmoji concept.

02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:22.320
And Dart Tetsuya says, doesn't Mr.

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:24.400
Smoosh have an Instagram or am I remembering wrong?

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.520
And he does.

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:26.400
And so does Midna.

02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:27.840
Sia Tabiri got it right.

02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:28.760
It's at Mr.

02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:30.280
But the Mr. spelled out for Mr.

02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:31.520
Smoosh, M-I-S-T-E-R Smoosh.

02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:34.000
And Midna is at, what is it?

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.680
Middle Patittles, Patittles, Patittles, P-A-T-I-D-D-L-E-S.

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:38.080
There you go.

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:39.360
Because her nickname is Middles Patittles.

02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:39.640
Yeah.

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:39.920
Okay.

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.720
I knew it was like some type of play on that.

02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:45.200
So anyway, if you want to follow all the pets of OLR, you can do that.

02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:51.640
So, uh, Dart Tetsuya talking about the bitmoji says, remind me of what Nintendo and Microsoft did with their avatars.

02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:52.360
Oh yeah, of course.

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:54.320
Microsoft had the avatar stuff too.

02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:00.800
Couldn't you play like, couldn't you put avatars in, um, the, uh, Xbox XNA games?

02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.920
That was the thing you were able to do for a short minute.

02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:03.240
Yeah.

02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:06.120
Cause I remember like a lot of the big downloads were avatar based games there.

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:12.440
So, uh, kind of interesting that bitmoji is kind of bringing that back, but not necessarily, uh, just on one platform.

02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:13.760
So that's pretty cool.

02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.920
Anyway, let's open up the listener round table.

02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:21.320
So if you would like to participate with the show, you sure can.

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.880
Uh, you can just join our discord server.

02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:29.280
Um, you can also, uh, send us a question in chat if you so desire that as an option as well.

02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:33.840
So let me bring up discord here on the computer, uh, while we wait to see if anybody wants to call a Loki.

02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:37.400
I don't know if you have any last minute stories, but I'm going to hand you the mic just in case.

02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:38.760
Cause I'm trying to multitask here.

02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.600
And I don't, unfortunately.

02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:47.120
So I guess, I guess we'll just have to sit here in silence.

02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:53.680
No, I was just reading up on that luminary site and how people are.

02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:54.720
Jump and chip on it.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:56.480
I don't know.

02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:58.640
I think it's going to be a hot flash and then gone.

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:00.000
I think so too.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.360
I think they botched it way too hard.

02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:06.040
It's a, it's a bummer because they could have partnered with some of us perhaps and maybe been a little more successful.

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:08.360
And it's not even, it's not even about the money.

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:16.120
It's about the whole, like not asking and like, uh, anyway, I don't, I don't want to go out to a negative space.

02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:22.400
I'm not going to, but I see you're on a gaming forum, so I assume we're not the only gaming podcast bitching about it.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.200
So I'm sure there's other people as well.

02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:32.720
So anyway, some, uh, thoughts and chat, uh, some folks following up on talk about bitmoji, uh, Kaijuto says one versus a hundred use the avatars.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.560
Um, Tigerlaw says my Samsung Galaxy S9 has a thing called AR emojis.

02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.400
Basically you take a picture of yourself and the software and the phone will create an emoji based on what you look like.

02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:45.400
Um, the 3DS did that too, right?

02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:48.360
Like it wasn't great, but it did have a version of that, I think.

02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:51.080
And dark Tetsuya says, I think one of the key flings games.

02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:51.480
That's right.

02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:54.520
The kingdom of keflings or whatever it was called use the avatars.

02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:58.840
So the concept of having you in a game certainly isn't new.

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:00.280
I think every me fighters.

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:00.680
Hello.

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:01.720
Everybody knows that one.

02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:04.520
So, um, that, that concept isn't particularly new.

02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:06.360
Well, I have an announcement.

02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:07.200
Okay.

02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:15.320
If you are in Northern California for the week end of May 17th, 18th, and 19th, it's a golden state pinball festival.

02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:16.560
Oh, fun.

02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:18.320
We will have some, we should go there.

02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.160
Yeah, we should go.

02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.720
I went last year after drag con.

02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:21.480
It was really fun.

02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:22.200
Thankfully.

02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:23.920
It's not the same weekend as drag on.

02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:25.280
We should film some movies there.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:26.600
Absolutely.

02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:33.600
But I just wanted to make sure to mention it that, uh, I will be all there all day, Friday, half a day, Saturday, and to help wrap up on Sunday.

02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:34.720
Where's that?

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:36.240
Is that in Dixon or is that the one?

02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:36.680
Lodi.

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:37.280
Lodi.

02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:39.160
Like it moved from one place to another.

02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:39.360
Okay.

02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:44.400
Well, because it used to be the same thing as Pinagogo and then Pinagogo became a separate thing still in Dixon.

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:46.000
Oh, I didn't even know they were separate.

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:48.720
I don't like to go to Pinagogo because of the corn pollen.

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:49.960
Oh, okay.

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:51.440
And no air conditioning.

02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:53.200
This place is air conditioning and has good food.

02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:56.800
You know, where I still have never been that we really need to take an OLR trip to.

02:19:56.800 --> 02:19:58.160
And I'm just like, I've shocked myself.

02:19:58.160 --> 02:19:58.640
I haven't been there.

02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:01.360
The Alameda, no, the Alameda pinball.

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:01.720
Yeah.

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:02.040
Yeah.

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:03.680
I almost went there the other day.

02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:04.840
Um, we should go.

02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:05.800
Yet.

02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:10.240
I went to that place in Vegas and I have it there.

02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:14.640
Oh, T-ara took me there to their old location across from the Liberace museum.

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:15.000
That's right.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.120
Cause they moved and I had played pinball circus.

02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:20.960
Were you here at the week I brought back video or were you not back from your hiatus yet?

02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.520
I remember probably still in hiatus.

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:29.320
Tiger Claw just sent a picture from his, uh, what his phone, uh, took him.

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:32.120
That's not a bad, it's, it's not bad resemblance.

02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:33.880
You don't have enough scruff, Tiger Claw.

02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:40.040
I don't know if the thing didn't pick up your facial hair or maybe when you took the picture, but, uh, otherwise it's not too shabby.

02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:41.160
I wonder what mine would look like.

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.800
Alan is supposedly getting a new phone.

02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:45.360
Do you know why Alan has to get a new phone?

02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:49.480
He dropped his old phone so many times that the screen is flickering so bad.

02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:50.960
He can't play Pokemon go.

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:52.440
So he has to get a new phone.

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:53.960
One of us, one of us.

02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:57.240
No, he's, he's not going to jump ship to the apple front.

02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:58.120
I roll so hard.

02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:03.000
I don't mind, I don't mind being a bi-phonal household.

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:05.840
We, we get the best of both worlds here in this house.

02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:06.480
It's all good.

02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:07.800
All right.

02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:14.280
Well, unfortunately nobody is, uh, wanting to call in, so that's okay.

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:25.200
That's, yeah, people are doing that or the, yeah, if it's, if it's not in, uh, movies or TV shows, they're, they're watching the end of the world in one place or another.

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:26.080
So whatever.

02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:27.320
It's fine.

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.440
I'm not going to be personally hurt or anything.

02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:33.160
No, but anyway, uh, let's, uh, let's get everybody's final thought.

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:40.560
So, um, and wrap up the show first, let me say, um, as I always say here at OLR, thank you so much for downloading this show and checking us out.

02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:44.600
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:51.040
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to put out there for all the consumes.

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.280
So please help us spread the word.

02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:53.080
We really appreciate it.

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:59.440
Hosting on Twitch, adding VOG network to your auto host list goes a long, long way.

02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:00.160
Let me tell you.

02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:05.880
So if you really, if you don't mind doing that, that is like probably one of the biggest things you could do for us is putting us on your auto host list.

02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:07.600
I know some of you have already done that.

02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:08.400
So thank you.

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:08.680
Thank you.

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.600
Thank you very much for that.

02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:12.040
Um, that's it.

02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:13.600
I think it's time for final thoughts.

02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:16.520
So, um, since I have the microphone, I'll start.

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:21.640
My final thought is, um, that music sure died 15 minutes into the show tonight.

02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:29.280
I hope, I hope it's not going to be awkward between me and the neighbors now, but you think the party was just planned to be, who ends a party at six 30?

02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:35.480
Maybe as a football game or maybe football or baseball or some, maybe they really were going to go watch game of thrones.

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:36.000
I don't know.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:37.880
Is it that maybe, maybe who knows?

02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:38.600
Maybe that shit.

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:39.360
Yeah, who knows?

02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:40.920
Anyway, dark soccer, your final thought.

02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:44.640
I've been sitting here reorganizing the time off that I've taken at work.

02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:47.000
Cause I realized I took a whole day when only have five hours.

02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:54.400
So I now have my time off planned clear up until, uh, July 1st.

02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:57.720
And by the way, I won't be here June 30th for San Francisco pride.

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:09.840
Uh, my final thought is that I'm going to try to work more on games and playing them and making them.

02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:11.120
Yeah.

02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:17.160
Since you brought up pride before I pulled the plug for tonight's show, are you going to Sacramento pride?

02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:18.800
Um, one of the days.

02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:21.840
Did you, did you hear who they have closing the show on Sunday?

02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:25.080
I'm so upset that we have this show.

02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:28.880
I was actually told on Twitter, cancel the show and go see Lizzo.

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:35.760
And I'm, I thought about, but it's, it's like, it's like two weeks after we're already off for Chicago.

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:37.600
So, or for me, Chicago, you drag con.

02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:42.520
Listeners, would you be mad at Rob for going to see Lizzo?

02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:44.320
No, here's the, here's the, here's the, no, no, don't answer that.

02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:44.720
Don't answer that.

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:48.360
Because the reality is we're going to be in Sacramento heat by June.

02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:51.640
All those people, all that heat outside.

02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:53.680
It's just, it's not the environment for me.

02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:54.000
Girl.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.280
That's why you sit in the Depot and lean out the window.

02:23:57.320 --> 02:23:58.800
Cause you will have a view of this.

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:00.040
Oh no, that's right.

02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:01.840
Because it's not the rainbow festival.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:03.480
It's going to be on the lawn.

02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:03.960
Shit.

02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:05.800
So it's fine.

02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:07.480
I'm I'm in, I don't like Lizzo that much.

02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:09.160
I'm a piece of, Oh, how dare you?

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:10.480
I love her.

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:12.200
Well, but she's also a Coachella supporter.

02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:13.160
So I'm mad at her.

02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:14.840
Well, yeah, but anyway,

02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:20.760
because remember the owner of Coachella supports anti gay charities as well and

02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:24.080
has personally donated Coachella proceeds to it.

02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:28.200
I went to Coachella in 2002, long before like any of this was brought to light or

02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:29.360
whatever it was.

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:33.720
Um, and it was speaking about hot being in the sun too long and being over it.

02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:37.440
If that was Coachella for me, that's why I've only gone once.

02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:39.920
But I'll tell you what you're going to say.

02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:40.520
Worth it.

02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:40.960
Okay.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:43.440
When I went to Coachella, I'm sure I've told you this story, but I'm gonna remind

02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:46.720
you, it was, uh, the chemical brothers for the last performance.

02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:52.960
Bjork was, oh no, get this before Bjork, Susie and the Banshees.

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:54.280
Ooh, okay.

02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:54.800
I would have done that.

02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:55.040
Yeah.

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:55.440
Right.

02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.360
Oh, we found your ZZT.

02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:03.120
And on that note, that's it.

02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:03.640
Everybody.

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:06.960
I wouldn't go to Coachella for Susie because that means that she'd be doing a

02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:07.640
tour anyway.

02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:08.640
Yeah, that's true.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.200
And I think they were that year.

02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:12.080
So anyway, that's it.

02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:12.600
We're out of here.

02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:13.680
Have a good night, everybody.

02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:15.960
Um, what, what would Susie say?

02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:17.280
Uh, kiss them for me.

02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:17.640
I don't know.

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:18.120
That's it.

02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:20.520
She would raise an eyebrow.

02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:25.720
One of her finely manicured, thick, black as death eyebrows.

02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:27.080
Goodnight fade to black.

02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:30.320
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:36.880
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show.

still true.

02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:58.560
See you next week.
