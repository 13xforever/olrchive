7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	This week, Sony's next console announcement is actually a new console!
17000	19000	Not a refresh, not a remote service, no change of course!
19000	21000	Hope you wanted to buy a new TV!
21000	27000	We'll tell you what to start saving up for as well as the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice!
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 773 for this April the 21st of 2019.
45000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, as usually is the case, in studio here, Techmaster Loki!
52000	53000	Yes, I'm here.
53000	57000	Not here tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, she has the night off.
57000	63000	She is doing some Easter events with the charity organization, she works with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.
63000	68000	She's in San Francisco today, it's a big day for them because I think it's the 40th anniversary so there's a lot going on.
68000	74000	She'll be back with us next week, but it's just Loki and myself here in the studio along with all of you guys who watch us
74000	77000	because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
77000	86000	You can follow along at twitch.tv slash vog network and we come on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
86000	87000	How you doing, Loki?
87000	88000	I'm fine.
88000	89000	Yeah, good week?
89000	91000	Yeah, I've been suffering outside.
91000	92000	Oh, like allergies?
92000	95000	Yeah, because there's just pollen everywhere.
95000	98000	I've always been sick for two weeks with different things.
98000	101000	And all the trees are in bloom that smell like sex.
101000	103000	Yes, the sex trees.
103000	105000	I don't know if they smell like sex.
105000	107000	No, they smell like, it's a thing.
109000	111000	You don't know until you know.
112000	113000	I'm just saying.
113000	115000	Yes, because I've never had sex before.
116000	117000	Ever.
117000	118000	Wait a minute, don't you have kids?
120000	123000	Maybe the stork is real. Anyway, topic change.
123000	126000	Easter, did you guys do anything for Easter?
126000	128000	We did stuff for Easter like on Thursday.
128000	130000	Oh, well that's not Easter.
130000	131000	Easter enough.
131000	133000	We're just going to hide the eggs early.
133000	139000	Well, it's because like they did like a thing at their school that they're at.
139000	141000	So they did an Easter egg hunt there.
141000	145000	And then we went over to my mom's house and they did Easter eggs or a hunt there.
145000	155000	Because my cousin or my niece is with her dad on the weekends or this weekend.
155000	157000	So they couldn't get together for that.
157000	159000	And also because my mom's birthday is this weekend.
159000	160000	So she's going to be out of town for that.
160000	162000	So everybody just did stuff on Thursday and stuff.
162000	165000	Okay, so it's not like one of those things like when I was younger my mom would say,
165000	168000	you know, you got to be good or Santa's not going to bring presents or whatever.
168000	172000	And then suddenly on December 23rd all the presents from Santa are just suddenly under the tree.
172000	175000	And I'm like, but I thought Santa didn't come till Christmas Eve.
175000	178000	And my mom would just be like, well, I guess he came early.
179000	180000	It's just kind of like...
180000	181000	Do you want your gifts or not?
181000	182000	Yeah, exactly.
182000	184000	Shut up. Stop asking questions.
184000	187000	I think she said that one year. I think she said, do you want me to send them back?
188000	190000	You're right, this is a mistake. Let me throw these away.
192000	195000	Anyway, all right, let's get into some gaming news and gaming talk.
195000	200000	Because, of course, we are here to talk about video games on Sunday nights for two hours, three hours,
200000	201000	however long we feel like it.
201000	204000	We're not bound by time constructs here on OLR.
204000	207000	We go as long as we feel like it with you guys in our chat.
207000	209000	Some would say too long.
209000	213000	Do you know how many a podcast panel I've attended where it's like,
213000	217000	well, you know, you should strive to make your podcast one hour long.
217000	220000	One hour is a good length for podcasts.
220000	223000	And I'm like, who came up with that? Who invented that? Why one hour?
224000	225000	When this show started.
225000	230000	Well, you see, that's all the funds we have in our Patreon to support.
230000	233000	And if we don't have the money, we can't do the podcasting.
233000	236000	So, therefore, one hour is all that we can muster.
236000	237000	I see.
237000	238000	If only we had the more money.
238000	242000	Our audible.com and HelloFresh or whatever those things are,
242000	245000	sponsorships only are able to let us go for an hour tonight.
245000	250000	No. Well, when we originally started this show 17 years ago at this point,
250000	254000	it was more modeled off of a like Sirius XM type of show or, you know,
254000	255000	satellite radio type of show.
255000	258000	And usually those shows, believe it or not, are about three hours long.
258000	261000	Now, granted, back in the day, we used to take music breaks because,
261000	263000	you know, this was a show based on music games.
263000	266000	So we actually took music breaks, but we had to get rid of those
266000	268000	because copyright reasons quite some time ago,
268000	270000	around the time we went into a podcast form.
270000	272000	So, yeah, it's a new show now,
272000	275000	but we can still look back on things and memories.
275000	277000	And one of the things people are looking back on today,
277000	281000	and I didn't even realize that this was having a birthday today
281000	286000	and turning this age, but the Nintendo Game Boy turns 30 today.
286000	288000	It's actually April 21st, the day we were recording,
288000	291000	was the Japanese release of the Game Boy.
291000	294000	We didn't have to wait that long for it here in the States, though.
294000	298000	Europe had to wait because it's very clear that Nintendo hates you, Europe.
298000	300000	I'm sorry. I don't write the rules. I just report them.
300000	302000	But Europe got it, like, the next year.
302000	305000	We got it, I think, in, like, August of that year.
305000	309000	So, you know, all things considered, though, the Game Boy is 30 years old.
309000	312000	So I'm curious from you, as well as folks in our chatroom
312000	316000	over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, did you own a Game Boy?
316000	317000	No, I never did.
317000	318000	You never owned a Game Boy?
318000	321000	No, the only thing I owned that was of the Game Boy family
321000	328000	was I had purchased a used Game Boy Advance that I briefly played.
328000	331000	I still have it, but it's just a regular Advance,
331000	334000	not the good kind with a backlit screen,
334000	337000	no, the kind that you need, like, a flashlight attachment.
337000	342000	I actually had a friend that modded my Game Boy Advance like that.
342000	346000	Like, you could put a back screen in it, and that's, like, technology
346000	348000	and things I don't do very well.
348000	351000	But he, like, for my birthday one year, he, like, modded it.
351000	352000	That was pretty cool.
352000	353000	Yeah.
353000	355000	My Game Boy Advance is special, wherever it is, because I haven't...
355000	358000	I mean, I played the Game Boy. I played my friend's Game Boy.
358000	359000	Okay.
359000	361000	But I never owned one.
361000	364000	Although, I mean, it wouldn't say I wouldn't purchase, like,
364000	367000	a Game Boy Classic Edition if they were to do that.
367000	370000	Do you remember any of the games on Game Boy that you enjoyed?
370000	374000	Super Mario Land, Tetris, obviously.
374000	379000	I played Metroid II.
379000	380000	That's pretty much it.
380000	383000	I didn't play any of the Pok√©mon games.
383000	386000	Not bad for someone who didn't even own a Game Boy.
386000	390000	I got one... See, the reason why I thought it was, like, next year
390000	394000	is because I thought I was 12 when I got one, but I guess...
394000	397000	Because I seem to remember I got one not long after they were out.
397000	398000	I think I got it that holiday.
398000	399000	So I think they came out in, like, August.
399000	401000	I think I got one for Christmas that year.
401000	405000	And mine came with Super Mario Land and Alleyway.
405000	406000	Remember Alleyway?
406000	408000	All Alleyway was was basically just Breakout.
408000	409000	It was Breakout.
409000	410000	I don't remember.
410000	411000	Yeah, I remember.
411000	413000	I like the capsule drops like they do in Arknoid.
413000	415000	I think there might have been, like, a little bit of that.
415000	418000	But I don't think it was a very, like, you know,
418000	421000	very full version of that game.
421000	425000	But obviously I played a crap load of Super Mario Land.
425000	427000	This is going to be, like, a real deep dive.
427000	428000	You guys ready?
428000	431000	So I love the music in Super Mario Land so much
431000	434000	that one year myself and my friends were participating
434000	436000	in this thing called Odyssey of the Mind.
436000	438000	Have you ever heard of this?
438000	440000	There's going to be, like, one or two people out there
440000	441000	who know exactly what this is and be like,
441000	443000	oh, my fucking God, Odyssey of the Mind.
443000	444000	So it was this thing.
444000	446000	It was, like, it was the Olympics for smart people,
446000	447000	is basically what it was.
447000	449000	It was the thing that gifted and talented people would do.
449000	451000	I was just thinking when you said Odyssey of the Mind,
451000	453000	it made me think of, like, Journey to the Mind's Eye thing,
453000	456000	those stupid, like, early, like, computer graphics set
456000	459000	to, like, music things that they had.
459000	462000	Like, it's like, oh, hey, I remember that from Lawnmower Man.
462000	463000	That's a thing that they had.
463000	465000	So you had, like, these different competitions
465000	467000	and all these teams would be made at different schools.
467000	469000	So I'm really trying to keep this short.
469000	470000	So we had, like, an elementary school.
470000	474000	And I remember one year we did a play about, like, Greek gods.
474000	476000	I think I've told this one on the show before.
476000	480000	But one year we did, you had to make a structure out of balsa wood
480000	483000	that would hold as much weight as possible.
483000	485000	You would put as much weight on the balsa wood structure,
485000	488000	which is probably a thing that they do in, like, Boy Scouts and stuff, too.
488000	492000	It's a pretty common kind of, like, construction type of challenge.
492000	495000	But it wasn't just about how you put the structure together.
495000	497000	It was about the presentation.
497000	500000	So we actually put our thing together.
500000	502000	And, yes, this is a Game Boy story. I'm getting there.
502000	505000	So we actually put the structure together and we did the presentation
505000	511000	and we did an ancient Egypt-style presentation.
511000	513000	So we were all dressed up, like, you know, like Cleopatra
513000	517000	and people that you would see in, you know, like, books and pictures
517000	519000	in that time and all that stuff.
519000	520000	And so we did this whole thing.
520000	525000	And for the music, get this, I learned how to patch my Game Boy
525000	529000	into my tape recorder to actually record the music off my Game Boy.
529000	531000	And we used the dungeon music.
531000	533000	So for anybody that's ever played Super Mario Land
533000	535000	and knows that dungeon music that's like that,
535000	537000	doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
537000	539000	It sounds very, like, stereotypical, like, ancient Egypt.
539000	543000	Because I think you're actually in, like, that type of dungeon sort of thing.
543000	546000	We actually recorded that music and we used that music.
546000	548000	But because there was, like, a little, like,
548000	550000	so when the recording would stop and loop over,
550000	552000	like, it made, like, a little, like, crack in it.
552000	554000	So what we did is that we had, like, I don't know,
554000	557000	one of my, I think the one girl we had in our group,
557000	559000	we dressed up as Cleopatra, she would crack the whip
559000	562000	every time that that little crack happened in the recording.
562000	565000	Isn't this ridiculous?
565000	567000	These are the things that, like, 12-year-olds do.
567000	569000	So, no, but that is, that would not have happened
569000	572000	if it wasn't for the Game Boy and the music specifically.
572000	575000	Because the Game Boy, the music in that thing was actually kind of,
575000	577000	because it had the full, real stereo sound.
577000	581000	You remember you could plug in, the NES didn't have stereo sound,
581000	582000	but the Game Boy did.
582000	584000	You plug in the left and rights and, you know,
584000	587000	you'd get that full stereo experience,
587000	590000	which I think Super Nintendo ended up doing later on.
590000	592000	So, there it is.
592000	594000	I noticed in chat VidPowers573 says,
594000	596000	Game Boy Tetris was my jam,
596000	598000	and I'm sure lots of other people's jam as well.
598000	603000	Oh, gosh, yes, I mean, Game Boy Tetris was, like, the game.
603000	607000	That was, like, of that era when the Game Boy first came out.
607000	609000	That was, like, your Minecraft or something like that.
609000	611000	Like, that was the game everybody was talking about.
611000	614000	And the game that was kind of breaking through to pop culture
614000	619000	and making video games something that wasn't just for basement nerds
619000	622000	and, you know, your stereotypical nerds and things like that.
622000	623000	Yeah.
623000	625000	So, Tetris really broke through,
625000	628000	and a lot of people that may otherwise not necessarily play games
628000	630000	were playing Game Boy Tetris.
630000	634000	And in this, you know, very kind of Nintendo way,
634000	636000	because, I mean, I mentioned that my Game Boy,
636000	638000	I got Super Mario Land and Alleyway,
638000	640000	but, of course, the packing game was Tetris, right?
640000	641000	Yeah.
641000	643000	Everybody had Tetris, and that was important
643000	647000	because Nintendo has been very good about picking the right pack-in game
647000	649000	to sell off their console many times.
649000	651000	They haven't done it all the time, obviously.
651000	653000	I don't think the Switch came with the game, right?
653000	657000	I mean, it launched with a stellar title, but it wasn't a pack-in game.
657000	663000	They tried to get 1-2 Switch to be the game.
663000	665000	Oh, well, we don't talk about that anymore.
665000	667000	They're still selling it for $50.
667000	669000	I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
669000	671000	I'm never buying it for that much.
671000	674000	$5? Never.
674000	676000	Nintendo sold 11 billion Switches,
676000	678000	so maybe they've just found a different model for it now.
678000	681000	But I remember, you know, the NES, like Mario Brothers,
681000	683000	Super Mario Brothers, and Duck Hunt,
683000	685000	you know, those were great pack-in games.
685000	689000	Duck Hunt was great at showing off the laser, you know, the light gun.
689000	691000	No, it wasn't really a laser, but a light gun.
691000	693000	Even though I think Hogan's Alley was a better game,
693000	695000	just saying, don't at me.
695000	699000	And then what the Super Nintendo...
699000	701000	Was that packed in with Mario World?
701000	702000	Yeah.
702000	704000	I think it was, and that was obviously one of the all-time greats.
704000	707000	But then they also had the Super Scope 6 bundle that you could do, I think.
707000	709000	Oh, I think that was later.
709000	712000	Super Scope 6 didn't come out until a couple years after the launch of the system.
712000	716000	Wasn't it like Mario World, Dr. Mario, or they didn't have Dr. Mario?
716000	719000	No, there was like Mario All-Stars later, but anyway.
719000	722000	And then, of course, there was the Wii and Wii Sports,
722000	727000	which, again, I think the Wii and Wii Sports is the closest analogy to the Game Boy and Tetris,
727000	729000	because people weren't buying a Wii for the Wii.
729000	731000	They were buying it to play Wii Tennis.
731000	734000	And I think a lot of people were buying the Game Boy at the time to play Tetris,
734000	737000	because that was everywhere at that time.
737000	739000	And, you know, in many ways, still is,
739000	743000	as Tetris is in some ways experiencing a renaissance,
743000	746000	thanks to things like Tetris Effect and Tetris 99,
746000	750000	and even deeper cuts on the internet and the fandom behind things like the Grandmaster and stuff like that.
750000	753000	So, you know, Tetris, obviously, is huge.
753000	755000	But that was a big thing on the Game Boy.
755000	759000	Link cable, right? You could actually play against your friends,
759000	762000	and it made Tetris a competitive game, which it really wasn't before,
762000	766000	because most people hadn't experienced the Tengen Tetris game.
766000	767000	That's just the reality.
767000	771000	I know probably many of you know all about that and how it did have a versus mode,
771000	774000	but for the most part, because of Nintendo shutting that down fast,
774000	776000	most people weren't aware of that.
776000	779000	So it really wasn't until the Game Boy Tetris that, you know, that was everywhere.
779000	782000	But some other games I remember on the Game Boy,
782000	784000	I remember a pinball game that I used to play with my friend
784000	787000	that we used the link cable on all the time called Revenge of the Gator.
787000	789000	We played the shit out of that game.
789000	791000	And that was, it had a versus mode in it where, like,
791000	793000	it was supposed to be a pinball table that, like,
793000	796000	you're supposed to imagine it was, like, a tent type of thing.
796000	799000	And so you could knock the ball so much it would actually go on the other side.
799000	802000	Kind of like air hockey, I guess, but like a pinball table.
802000	805000	And so that game was a lot of fun. I liked that game a lot.
805000	808000	And then I didn't get into Pokemon when it first came out,
808000	812000	but when they did a bundle later on that they I think the first Game Boy color
812000	816000	I ended up buying was the Pikachu Game Boy color,
816000	819000	where when you turn it on, the little power light was his cheeks,
819000	822000	because adorable, right? So I bought that.
822000	826000	And then that either came with Pokemon Yellow or it was really cheap to get them both.
826000	829000	So I bought that years later when I was in college.
829000	831000	So but I have good memories of the Game Boy,
831000	834000	even if, you know, you were talking about with the Game Boy Advance,
834000	837000	the lighting, right? You could not play those things in the dark.
837000	840000	They sold little, like, did you ever have like, oh, you didn't own a Game Boy.
840000	841000	Did you ever see anybody?
841000	844000	No, I saw that in the magazine.
844000	849000	The magnifying glass thing with the additional speakers on the sides and the light.
849000	852000	Yeah, I saw the pictures.
852000	857000	I love this story from Mir Muse in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOC Network.
857000	862000	My mom is 80. Yesterday, she was telling me about a game on her phone
862000	866000	where different colored shapes fall from the sky and you fill in lines
866000	870000	and they disappear. She just discovered Tetris.
870000	872000	I love that, though. That's cute.
872000	877000	And it also goes to show the staying power of such a, like, simple concept.
877000	883000	Like Tetris is to video games like what chess is to board games,
883000	885000	I think in many ways, like it's or checkers.
885000	888000	I mean, I guess not everybody necessarily knows how to play chess.
888000	892000	It is a little more complicated, but or maybe maybe a better analogy would be something like,
892000	897000	I don't know, like blackjack or basic five card poker is to a deck of cards.
897000	901000	Like everybody kind of experiences that one at some point. Right.
901000	905000	Yeah. Whereas maybe not necessarily everybody plays something like,
905000	908000	you know, cribbage with a deck of cards.
908000	911000	You got to really find or learn or what's the what's the one with the specialized deck?
911000	913000	P. Knuckle. You're play P. Knuckle.
913000	917000	No, not a lot of people have because I'm not elderly.
917000	919000	See, my grandparents taught me how to play all these games.
919000	925000	You're not helping the argument, but not everybody necessarily knows things like,
925000	930000	oh, I don't know, Far Cry five or, you know, those types of things.
930000	932000	But see, that that's the thing with like even like Far Cry five,
932000	936000	like now that we bring it up and I was complaining about it on Bobby the wrong game.
936000	941000	It's so like, you know, we're talking about games getting better and better graphics and stuff.
941000	945000	And that's kind of what the industry seems to be trying to do to push things forward.
945000	952000	But like Far Cry, it's been the same damn game for like the last three games, three or four games.
952000	956000	It's been the same damn game, just like reskinned in a different theme.
956000	958000	And it's the same thing all over again.
958000	963000	It's the match three equivalent of the FPS genre, I guess.
963000	969000	Or Madden, which everybody jokes is roster update, which is why EA tries so hard to show,
969000	972000	hey, here's what we're doing in like the single player campaign and all these other features.
972000	976000	Then everybody yells at EA for why are you showing off all this bullshit when we just want to play football?
978000	982000	Well, Madden is the only football game period that you can buy, so.
982000	989000	Well, it's the only official NFL because what, Mutant Football League is a football game, right?
989000	991000	You know, you know, I guess.
991000	995000	Yeah, that's what I thought. That's what I thought. All right. Anyway, so I don't know anything else to say about the Game Boy.
995000	1000000	I mean, if you think about it, the Game Boy is really like the derivatives that we have to today
1000000	1005000	with the 3DS or even in some ways mobile phones.
1005000	1012000	You know, I've seen and I don't I don't know why I don't have one, but I've seen so many cases for mobile phones that look like Game Boys,
1012000	1016000	you know, because honestly, the shape is not I mean, Game Boys are even heavy.
1016000	1019000	They have a thing that works with the Game Boy emulators.
1019000	1023000	They can actually plug your phone into that looks like it has the buttons and everything.
1023000	1027000	So, yeah, that's that's silly, but fun. Yeah, no, no, it's cool.
1027000	1030000	I mean, probably cost the same amount as buying a Game Boy, but yeah.
1030000	1032000	You think Nintendo will do a Game Boy Classic at some point?
1032000	1040000	I'm sure they could. That's a little bit more engineering because they can't just use the same thing that they were using for the SNES Classic and stuff like that,
1040000	1043000	because, well, that is powerful enough to run it.
1043000	1048000	You have to run it off battery now and fit it into the size that it would be.
1048000	1055000	So I don't know if they would do that or maybe just skip ahead to like a Game Boy Advance Game Boy.
1055000	1057000	I don't know.
1057000	1065000	VidPower573 in chat says that feeling of not being able to see the Game Boy screen at nighttime when in a car except under a street lamp.
1065000	1067000	Yes, I know that feel very well.
1067000	1076000	But, you know, they actually they really encourage or they encourage people at the time not to play in the car because I guess it's supposed to make you sick or you're more if you're more prone to motion.
1076000	1077000	Yeah, you get motion sick.
1077000	1080000	I mean, I guess that's technically still a thing today.
1080000	1081000	Yes, it is.
1081000	1084000	But I don't know if it's just a thing that like we condition kids at a younger age.
1084000	1088000	Have you done this to your kids where like you're in the you're driving the broccoli farm.
1088000	1090000	OK, right. And are we there yet?
1090000	1092000	Are we there right over there? Shut up and watch this.
1092000	1094000	No, they had screens the entire time.
1094000	1095000	The way down there are fine.
1095000	1098000	On the way back, my youngest son threw up because he got car sick.
1098000	1101000	Oh, no, because I was going to think maybe we're just conditioning him at a younger age.
1101000	1102000	No, no, no.
1102000	1103000	It can happen.
1103000	1104000	It can still happen.
1104000	1106000	But they somehow they're on the way back.
1106000	1107000	We've done it before.
1107000	1110000	Like they've we've driven down to the Bay Area and they've been fine.
1110000	1113000	So that's why I thought, OK, well, they're fine this time.
1113000	1115000	They're fine when we came up.
1115000	1117000	You know, they should be fine going back.
1117000	1121000	But for whatever reason, like he said that he was not feeling well here.
1121000	1125000	He knew he wasn't feeling well, but he didn't say anything until it was too late.
1125000	1129000	Because if he said like, I don't feel well, I said, put your screens away right now.
1129000	1131000	And I would open the window or something for him.
1131000	1135000	But like he waited too long and he made himself sick.
1135000	1141000	So yikes is some other folks in chat confessing they've been motion sick as well.
1141000	1144000	Why we are saying I definitely got motion sick playing Game Boy games.
1144000	1145000	That's what I'm saying.
1145000	1147000	Oh, yeah, I discovered Carson is playing Game Boy in the car.
1147000	1148000	That never happened to me.
1148000	1152000	The only time I ever got motion sick was when I was on a boat because I went on a cruise at a younger age,
1152000	1159000	which is funny because now I'm going to be going on a cruise for the very first time in my adult life early next year.
1159000	1163000	But everybody's already telling me about like there's this patch and there's these there's like a wrist.
1163000	1166000	So there there's already all these tricks people are telling me like.
1166000	1169000	And I don't know if like modern like cruise ships rock as much.
1169000	1173000	Probably not. I mean, the boat we were on in the 80s was a boat.
1173000	1176000	It was a boat. We'll leave it at that.
1176000	1181000	And I seem to remember doing other things like I don't know if you ever did these weird type of trips in school,
1181000	1187000	but I remember in like sixth grade, we spent the night on a boat in like the San Francisco Bay.
1187000	1188000	No, I did that.
1188000	1189000	I remember something like that.
1189000	1193000	But I remember there was one thing that one time, though, I did take a fit.
1193000	1198000	We were taking a ferry to Alcatraz and I felt seasick on that.
1198000	1202000	I didn't get sick, but I felt nauseous on that one.
1202000	1206000	Yeah, I've done those. I've done like the ferry to Victoria Island in Canada.
1206000	1212000	But like I've also taken a ferry around like everything and I was fine.
1212000	1221000	But I think the difference was the ferry to Alcatraz inside, whereas, you know, going there just around Alcatraz,
1221000	1226000	I was outside in that like. So I think the air probably did.
1226000	1229000	You know, you can detect the motion a little bit better, maybe.
1229000	1233000	Whereas when you're inside, you think it's supposed to be like flattened, but it's really rocking suddenly.
1233000	1235000	And so it throws you off. I don't know.
1235000	1240000	I normally don't get like sick on boats either, but I haven't been on a cruise ship before.
1240000	1242000	So I don't know. Well, I'm I'm sure it'll be fine.
1242000	1244000	You know, and even Bobby's and Chaz and you're going to be fine.
1244000	1246000	No, I'm sure I'll be. I'll take the precaution.
1246000	1251000	I'll get the little bracelet and have some drip because, you know, I'd rather buy the Dramamine cheap in advance.
1251000	1258000	Oh, yeah. Try to buy it. Oh, yeah. My wife, she took that going down to the or we we took it.
1258000	1263000	We bought it going down and she took some of that. She's like, oh, yeah, I feel great after taking this stuff.
1263000	1267000	So that's the way to go. Interesting. All right. Well, you know, I'll I'll be prepared.
1267000	1272000	There's nothing wrong with that. Right. Anyway, I don't know how we got from Gameboy discussion of that, but we did.
1272000	1276000	I actually had to kick off topics tonight because obviously we have the Gameboy celebrating an anniversary.
1276000	1280000	But today is also Easter for many people celebrating the Easter holiday today.
1280000	1284000	So happy Easter to those that are indulging in the holiday today.
1284000	1290000	But of course, Easter. The funny thing is when you kind of think about video games and the word Easter
1290000	1295000	and something that's kind of synonymous with Easter, Easter eggs, that definitely means something in the gaming world.
1295000	1304000	Right. That means hidden gems, hidden little things that you love in video games, little secrets, probably to kind of start off.
1304000	1312000	And I'm going to ask, of course, what are your some of what are some of your favorite Easter eggs that you've come across in video games or something you'd like to show off or what have you.
1312000	1323000	And of course, one of the first probably the first one was way back on the Atari 2600, a game called Adventure, where you played a hero that was noted by a little yellow square that would go around.
1323000	1327000	And I'm sorry, I wasn't able to get B-roll video in time today, but I had a very busy weekend.
1327000	1332000	But you played this little yellow square that went around and, you know, went around mazes and things.
1332000	1334000	But there was a certain combination of things you could do.
1334000	1339000	You could kind of walk through one of the walls and you would actually see created by.
1339000	1341000	And I think the initials, I remember it showed the whole name.
1341000	1342000	No, it was the whole name.
1342000	1345000	Was the whole name because I scroll you scrolled like vertically. Right. Yeah.
1345000	1355000	Yeah. So but that was a big deal at the time because Atari was kind of infamous for not really giving the game designers any credit, which certainly isn't the case now in games.
1355000	1358000	Right. Like some of our game designers have turned into like celebrities. Right.
1358000	1362000	Like, remember, like Cliffie B and Gears of War and all that stuff.
1362000	1366000	And, you know, some of our or Sid Meier, like I'll play anything with his name on it.
1366000	1370000	Right. You know, it's kind of it's almost like with movies, like a Spielberg.
1371000	1377000	Or. Well, yeah, sure. So anyway, but back in the day, Atari was like very big on the input like you.
1377000	1379000	It was an Atari. They were paying you to make a game for them.
1379000	1385000	So and this is why many people left Atari for a rival company that was.
1385000	1391000	Well, that was making games for Atari, but a different, you know, game maker named Activision at the time.
1391000	1397000	And believe it or not, believe it or not, there was a point in time, Loki, when Activision was like the more progressive, cool.
1397000	1403000	You want to be their company in video games because they would credit their designers in the manual.
1403000	1409000	And, you know, they were putting things out like David Crane's Pitfall, you know, and things like that.
1409000	1415000	So now the only credits they care about the ones that you pay for with real world money to buy in-game loot.
1417000	1422000	Let's see. Bobby Blackwell points out Tom Clancy, famed game designer.
1422000	1429000	Sometimes the source material, the author, James Bond, his name shows up in a lot of games, too, right?
1429000	1435000	GoldenEye, 007. Yeah, he did. They did some PlayStation 2 games.
1435000	1439000	Yeah, I mean, I guess the only one that people really loved was GoldenEye. But anyway.
1439000	1444000	But anyway, Easter eggs. What are some of your favorite little hidden things in games?
1445000	1455000	I remember the old Apogee games they used to have on the designer's birthdays and during certain holidays.
1455000	1462000	I think April Fool's Day was also they would kind of do an alternate version of the theme song for like during the credits roll.
1462000	1466000	It would be like them singing it almost, but really terribly.
1466000	1473000	And then they would have like there is one of the games they played that they like lizards and stuff replacing the spaceships.
1473000	1481000	And like silly things like that. Yeah, I remember talking about Apogee made me think of like all those shareware games back in the day.
1481000	1485000	And one of the biggest shareware games out there was Doom. And I think it was in Doom 2.
1485000	1490000	There was a secret room you could go in and like the creator's head was on a pike in the room. Remember that?
1490000	1496000	Yeah. Oh, speaking of heads popping up, Mortal Kombat. That was like Mortal Kombat 2 specifically.
1496000	1499000	It was that was one of the most infamous ones. Right. When you would, you know, do the uppercase.
1499000	1504000	And like once in a once in a blue moon, the little guy would come out of the corner toasty. Right.
1504000	1512000	Ed Boon was Ed Boon. Yeah. Yeah. But like it was one of those things that everybody would be like, I swear I saw it like I swear this thing happened.
1512000	1517000	Because you know why I think that kind of happened was because with Street Fighter.
1517000	1525000	Do you remember like everybody was like, there's the move in Street Fighter where like you can handcuff somebody to you if you dial.
1525000	1530000	Remember how like every kid was convinced that was a thing. In reality, that was not a thing.
1530000	1537000	Unless there was like a Chinese bootleg hack that I think had a sprite motion that looked like that.
1537000	1543000	So it's like either the kid was making it up or they had a friend that played the Chinese bootleg,
1543000	1549000	which is probably also explains the red fireball in the early editions of Street Fighter.
1549000	1553000	Obviously, they made that can the black belt edition, all the knockoffs, all the bootlegs.
1553000	1559000	But I think that's funny that like Mortal Kombat did the very intentional, like, you know, toasty thing in it,
1559000	1566000	as well as Pong showed up in the arcade. Right. If you played like what, 250 times or something, it's a lot of quarters.
1566000	1571000	You would get Pong that would show up. And I think that was in the Super Nintendo version as well.
1571000	1575000	Yeah. Remember, it's been a long time. I don't think I ever sat down with the game long enough to unlock it.
1575000	1580000	That takes a lot of work, but that was the thing that you could do. Let's see.
1581000	1586000	Bobby Black Wolf says the sim copter Easter egg. Oh, I do.
1586000	1590000	I do remember this one being pretty infamous, but I don't remember the story off the top of my head.
1590000	1594000	So now he's making me go to the wiki to look it up. I just. Yeah, it's a lot of it.
1594000	1598000	Was it the gay sex one? Oh, it was.
1598000	1603000	That was sim copter. I thought that was in power. Sim copter. Oh, OK.
1603000	1607000	Why did I think it was Sim towers close? OK, so. OK, is that OK? Well, then, no.
1607000	1611000	How have I never seen that one? I knew of that. The game.
1611000	1620000	It was discovered that designer Jacques Servin inserted an Easter egg that generated shirtless himbos.
1620000	1624000	Male bimbos. That's a new term I've learned today to a himbo.
1624000	1632000	You ever heard that? A himbo in speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other and appeared in great numbers on certain dates,
1632000	1637000	such as Friday the 13th. Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special rendering module,
1637000	1644000	usually reserved for a fog piercing runway landing lights so they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weather.
1644000	1650000	The egg caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd around the helicopter where they would be slashed up by the blades
1650000	1654000	and then need to be airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.
1654000	1658000	The egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.
1658000	1662000	Well, you know what? Jacques Servin, wherever you are, you're the MVP of the week.
1662000	1666000	That's it. I need to go look that one up on YouTube or something. That sounds hilarious.
1666000	1670000	I knew that was a thing, but I thought that was in Sim Tower for some reason.
1670000	1673000	But I mean, there were like a million Sim games at the time, right?
1673000	1679000	We because one Sim City did really well. Not only did we get Sim Earth, but we got Sim Ant.
1679000	1685000	That was an underrated classic, though. Sim Ant was badass. But anyway, I'm curious what other games that guy made.
1685000	1690000	It sounds like he doesn't really make it. No, he's a former Maxis employee and that's really the only...
1690000	1697000	He started a bulletin board called RTMark. That's really all the other things I noticed that are mentioned there. Interesting.
1701000	1704000	Bobby Blackwolf is asking, were their nipples ray traced?
1705000	1708000	Well, we didn't have the technology then, but maybe in the future.
1708000	1709000	We do now.
1709000	1710000	Stay tuned, everybody.
1710000	1712000	We have the technology. We can remake it.
1713000	1716000	Alright, what other Easter eggs do you remember?
1716000	1720000	Actually, there's a new one. This is back in the news today specifically, right?
1720000	1725000	Because there's a brand new one that was just admitted to by the developers of Spider-Man, right?
1725000	1733000	Yes, and it was that if you were to play the game on certain holidays, any Jewish holiday,
1733000	1742000	you would find that there would be Orthodox Jews appearing like some of the citizen models or whatever.
1742000	1746000	Was it the reverse that they don't appear on those days because they're staying at home?
1746000	1753000	That's why nobody figured this out is because it wasn't about what you do see. It was about what you don't see.
1753000	1761000	And so the little Easter egg is that those NPCs are nowhere to be found on those religious holidays because what's being inferred...
1761000	1762000	That's stupid.
1762000	1764000	What do you mean that's stupid?
1764000	1765000	I don't know. That's lame.
1765000	1767000	Wow, that's a lot of detail.
1767000	1773000	That's not so much an Easter egg. That's like detail. That's unnecessary detail. Like horse testicle shrinking.
1773000	1776000	Fine. You want himbos with fluorescent nipples getting chopped.
1776000	1778000	That would be more interesting than...
1780000	1785000	Honestly, nowadays, I would expect that to be a title of a game that's on the Steam storefront, you know.
1785000	1786000	What, himbos?
1786000	1788000	Fluorescent himbos being chopped up by rotor blades.
1788000	1790000	You want that on the dream game list?
1790000	1792000	You want to see if YYR's plate is full this month?
1792000	1797000	Let's not. That's Steam store fodder right there.
1797000	1801000	Honestly, Loki, it probably already exists, to be fair.
1801000	1804000	That is their simcopter, apparently.
1804000	1812000	Let's see. SSG100Matt is saying, still trying to track down Stephanie Fargo from SimCity Action News.
1812000	1815000	Yes, the CD-ROM remake that came later on.
1815000	1819000	What about other Easter eggs? Any others that you remember?
1820000	1829000	I seem to think that the little letter that you dipped in water in StarTropics, in some ways...
1829000	1831000	It's not really an Easter egg, though.
1831000	1834000	I kind of put it in the same category, though, because it was one of those things that jumped off the screen.
1834000	1836000	But I guess you're right. It's not exactly hidden.
1836000	1842000	But it was kind of one of those, like, oh, it's different, or it's like only certain people know how to do it, you know, type of thing.
1842000	1847000	Because not everybody put that together, either. Especially if you rented the game, you couldn't.
1847000	1853000	Yes, I know. I bought my news at a flea market, so I was unable to do that.
1853000	1857000	I was like, I don't know what the code is! Nintendo Hotline, what's the code?
1857000	1859000	Well, you dipped the letter in water. I bought it, you!
1859000	1861000	Finally, code 747.
1861000	1864000	I'm paying by the minute here, come on!
1864000	1868000	It's like an airplane, 747, done. Anyway.
1869000	1880000	I don't know, like, there's, like, Driver 3 I know had, they did a parody of the character from Vice City in there,
1880000	1885000	because they thought their game was cooler than Grand Theft Auto, even though it's garbage, but they had that.
1885000	1890000	Would you consider cheat codes Easter eggs? Like, IQQD, things like that.
1890000	1894000	Obviously, those don't exist anymore, because, you know, they sell them all.
1894000	1898000	But back in the day, when you would type them in, or, as somebody in chat said when we first started this segment,
1898000	1904000	up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start. I mean, the infamous Konami code is an Easter egg of sorts.
1904000	1907000	Well, they have the Pac-Man level in Wolfenstein 3D.
1908000	1910000	Oh, they, I don't remember that.
1910000	1911000	It was a bonus level.
1911000	1912000	I don't even remember that.
1912000	1914000	The ghosts, you couldn't kill them.
1914000	1915000	Oh, interesting.
1915000	1917000	But you had to collect, you know, um...
1917000	1919000	I remember you could make your own levels.
1919000	1922000	Money, but yeah, they had Pac-Man ghosts in there, and you couldn't kill them.
1922000	1924000	They would kick your ass pretty fast.
1924000	1925000	Interesting.
1926000	1929000	Oh, Pixel Pacas is bringing up the cow level in Diablo 2.
1929000	1931000	That's a pretty infamous one.
1931000	1935000	In fact, they had to go to such lengths to say in Diablo 3, there was no cow level.
1935000	1938000	But then they did some type of cow event later on, and they still had like a rainbow.
1938000	1943000	They have Whimsy Dale and Whimsy Shire, and, you know, they kind of did a similar thing in Diablo 3.
1943000	1944000	So, anyway.
1944000	1945000	Easter eggs, they're fun.
1945000	1948000	Tweet us some of your favorites over at O-L-R.
1948000	1951000	I thought, what better day to talk about Easter eggs than on Easter.
1951000	1953000	Alright, well, here's one, actually.
1953000	1956000	There was that, um...
1956000	1958000	It sucks that they patched it out, too.
1958000	1962000	On the Switch, there was the whole thing where you could play golf.
1962000	1965000	Or they think they called it, like, vlog or whatever.
1965000	1972000	You had to do the gesture on the certain day to unlock it.
1972000	1973000	It was like a lotus birthday or something.
1973000	1974000	Yes.
1974000	1975000	Yeah.
1975000	1976000	And you had to do the gesture.
1976000	1977000	The Nintendo Direct gesture.
1977000	1978000	Yes.
1978000	1981000	Oh, that's a system-based Easter egg.
1981000	1982000	Yeah.
1982000	1983000	That's a good one.
1983000	1984000	Um, like, uh...
1984000	1988000	Well, this isn't so much a system-based Easter egg, but you remember, like, if you take your
1988000	1991000	Castlevania Symphony of the Night CD, and you put it in a regular CD player?
1991000	1993000	Like, the first track would just be blank.
1993000	1995000	Like, those PlayStation discs, somehow...
1995000	1996000	Well, sometimes...
1996000	1998000	The second track would play.
1998000	2002000	Unless you had a CD player that was really old and didn't understand that that was a
2002000	2003000	dated thing.
2003000	2004000	They would just sound like crap.
2004000	2005000	But, yeah, you have that.
2005000	2006000	That was kind of cool.
2006000	2012000	Or, wasn't there something you could do the Nintendo 64 logo or GameCube logo?
2012000	2015000	Wasn't there something, like, you could hold a button and it did something weird or something,
2015000	2016000	play different sounds?
2016000	2017000	Yes, you could.
2017000	2020000	I think with the other controller or something, you move it around and it plays different
2020000	2021000	sounds and stuff like that.
2021000	2024000	Anyway, uh, we'll close on this one, though, because this is a great one.
2024000	2031000	Bobby Blackwolf says, how about a Namco collection that had OLR in the game High Scores?
2031000	2032000	Yeah, that is...
2032000	2033000	That is...
2033000	2034000	Yes, you're right.
2034000	2035000	OLR is an Easter egg.
2035000	2036000	Also, there is the game, uh...
2036000	2037000	That's when we peaked, quite frankly.
2037000	2041000	There was a PlayStation 2 or 3 game called the Poona that had it.
2041000	2042000	It's a Wii game.
2042000	2043000	Wii game.
2043000	2044000	Yeah.
2044000	2045000	That reference was much more subtle.
2045000	2047000	It was our old, uh, orange logo.
2047000	2050000	Um, but our names, our names aren't in it.
2050000	2055000	But in this, it's, so it's the Namco collection on PlayStation 3 and it's the digital one.
2055000	2059000	It has, uh, Dragon Spirit, I think, Dig Dug and Pac-Man.
2059000	2062000	So it has, like, a, it's like a collection of, like, five Namco games.
2062000	2066000	When we first booted up, it shows, like, now you can compete with your friends.
2066000	2070000	But if you actually look at the scoreboard, it actually shows, like, OLR and then I think
2070000	2073000	it actually says Sky, Loki, Dark Soccer.
2073000	2075000	It, like, actually says the names on the high scoreboard.
2075000	2076000	Yes.
2076000	2078000	So, that is a great Easter egg.
2078000	2079000	I think that's a good one to close on.
2079000	2081000	So, that's fantastic.
2081000	2084000	Alright, well, let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've
2084000	2087000	been playing this week, whether they be Namco or otherwise.
2087000	2089000	I didn't play a whole lot of stuff this week.
2089000	2094000	We went, um, to Chuck E. Cheese for, like, an hour, um, earlier this week.
2094000	2100000	So, I played the, um, was it Luigi's Mansion arcade game?
2100000	2102000	So, that was alright.
2102000	2104000	Ah, man, it's, it's okay.
2104000	2107000	Um, and then, what else?
2107000	2110000	I played a little bit of Borderlands, Game of the Year edition.
2110000	2113000	Um, didn't really play it very long because it's still crashing on me.
2113000	2116000	Um, even though I tried, like, walking back some of the stuff I did to it.
2116000	2120000	And then, um, what else?
2120000	2121000	Pokemon Go.
2121000	2124000	I did a little bit more, uh, Labo VR.
2124000	2128000	I put together the elephant thing and tried out that.
2128000	2132000	They have, like, this, like, marble maze thing that's, it's alright.
2132000	2136000	And then, the drawing was kind of neat, but not very accurate because it's hard to tell
2136000	2138000	depth-wise where you are.
2138000	2142000	Um, but, I mean, it's a neat, like, proof of concept, I guess.
2142000	2144000	And then, uh, what else?
2144000	2147000	Um, that's pretty much it.
2147000	2148000	Yeah.
2148000	2149000	Okay.
2149000	2152000	Um, my gaming week was a little dialed back because, um, there was a lot going on this
2152000	2153000	week.
2153000	2155000	I hosted shows both Friday and Saturday night.
2155000	2158000	So, pretty much this weekend has all been doing hosting gigs.
2158000	2160000	But I did play some games earlier in the week.
2160000	2162000	Um, I have been playing Pokemon Go.
2162000	2166000	I mean, while I go, while I walk to these things, like, in Old Town and stuff, I'm
2166000	2167000	playing Pokemon Go.
2167000	2169000	So, I caught one of the blue shell chuckles.
2169000	2170000	Those are so useless.
2170000	2173000	I mean, not the shinies, but, like, the shiny ones.
2173000	2175000	Not the shinies, but, like, the chuckles are just useless.
2175000	2176000	Like, I-
2176000	2180000	Their defense is surprisingly strong for the CP they have, but I wouldn't exactly consider
2180000	2182000	them, like, great gym defenders.
2182000	2187000	But their CP is deceptively, like, understates how good defenders they are.
2187000	2189000	But it's not, like, like, again, because-
2189000	2191000	Do they evolve into anything later on?
2191000	2192000	Is it-
2192000	2194000	I don't remember if they do in future gens or not.
2194000	2197000	So, yeah, the chuckles themselves are not exactly the most useful Pokemon in the world,
2197000	2198000	but I think the blue ones look cool.
2198000	2200000	So, you know, that's all going on.
2200000	2203000	I just got a push notification, too, that said it's only, what, like, four more hours
2203000	2204000	in that whole thing.
2204000	2205000	So, yeah.
2205000	2206000	Better get one.
2206000	2207000	I still don't have a pink bunny, though.
2207000	2208000	I've been looking for those, too.
2208000	2209000	I didn't get anything.
2209000	2210000	But, yeah, I've been-
2210000	2213000	So, I've been doing that with Pokemon Go, of course.
2213000	2216000	And then, as far as, like, the more traditional games, I've been still playing some Beat Saber.
2216000	2219000	It's a good way to get a little bit of a workout midweek, especially if I don't get to the
2219000	2221000	gym in a particular day.
2221000	2224000	Good way to kind of make sure I'm still getting some cardio in a little bit.
2224000	2228000	And then, I've been also playing Final Fantasy XIV still.
2228000	2231000	I kind of went back, like, remember I was on WoW for a little bit?
2231000	2232000	Yeah.
2232000	2234000	And I kind of went back to Final Fantasy XIV at this point.
2234000	2237000	And, now, I have all of my healers at max level.
2237000	2241000	So, Astrologian, White Mage, and, as of today, Scholar are all at level 70.
2241000	2242000	So, I did that.
2242000	2244000	And, I've also been playing Borderlands Game of the Year.
2244000	2247000	I haven't played as much this week as I did, like, in previous weeks, just because I have
2247000	2249000	had the other stuff going on.
2249000	2251000	But, I did clear a few more quests.
2251000	2253000	I'm up to level 18, I think.
2253000	2256000	So, I still got a ways to go.
2256000	2258000	But, I'm also, I'm really slow.
2258000	2259000	I take my time.
2259000	2261000	Everything respawns.
2261000	2262000	I have to kill everything again.
2262000	2265000	You know, it's like, it's kind of a chore every time I sign into the game.
2265000	2268000	You can teleport, you know, between different locations, right?
2268000	2272000	Well, every time I go to one of those teleporters, it only offers me the DLC areas.
2272000	2275000	It doesn't allow me to teleport to something within the same map.
2275000	2277000	Unless that's an ability you get later on or something.
2277000	2278000	I don't know.
2278000	2281000	I think you can do it once you get more than one of those.
2281000	2283000	I'm pretty sure I've visited at least, like, four or five.
2283000	2285000	And, I don't have the ability to teleport between them.
2285000	2288000	Maybe it's something that opens up the story, like, after, maybe I just haven't opened it up yet.
2288000	2289000	Maybe.
2289000	2293000	Like, I've been doing every, like, there's a boss very clearly that I need to be killing.
2293000	2296000	But, I've been doing, like, every side quest that keeps popping up first.
2296000	2299000	Yeah, I was Sledge, I think is who I was.
2299000	2301000	Yes, Sledge is who I need to go kill.
2301000	2302000	Yeah.
2302000	2305000	But, I've been doing all these, like, I just did this arena quest.
2305000	2306000	I just did.
2306000	2310000	Well, I had to do, like, was it, they're one of the side quests is I get the sniper rifle pieces or whatever.
2310000	2312000	So, I went to go collect those.
2312000	2314000	And, one of the markers was in the middle of the air.
2314000	2317000	And, I actually did collect it. It was in a different spot.
2317000	2320000	The piece was in a different spot, but the marker is still there and it won't go away.
2320000	2323000	So, obviously, the quest is bugged.
2323000	2324000	Thank goodness.
2324000	2332000	So, I'm going to have to do something else or else it's just never going to get unbugged, I guess.
2332000	2333000	I don't know.
2333000	2334000	Alright.
2334000	2336000	Or, maybe I'll find the pieces somewhere else.
2336000	2339000	Well, otherwise, that's been pretty much it for my gaming week otherwise.
2339000	2343000	So, nothing new this week yet, but maybe next week I'll be able to change that a little bit.
2343000	2345000	So, because next week will be a little less crazy.
2345000	2347000	I only have one show to host next week.
2347000	2350000	So, but everything's been going great in that department.
2350000	2351000	I really can't complain.
2351000	2355000	So, anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's news stories.
2355000	2360000	Again, if you want to participate along with our show, head on over to our chat, twitch.tv slash vog network.
2360000	2365000	If you're listening out there on our podcast feed, because we are available in lots of popular podcasting apps,

2377000	2379000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2379000	2385000	For a holiday week, in which most people have been on spring break, there's not a lot of news this week.
2385000	2389000	I would have, going into this week, I figured it would be a pretty dead week.
2389000	2391000	But we got some pretty big things this week, right?
2391000	2396000	Yeah, so Mark Cerny sat down with Wired and did an interview about the PlayStation 5 or whatever we're going to call it.
2396000	2398000	The next PlayStation, basically.
2398000	2400000	Which is, how are they not going to call it PlayStation 5?
2400000	2402000	That would be so weird.
2402000	2407000	How are they going to call the Xbox 360 successor the Xbox One, because that made no sense.
2407000	2408000	I guess.
2408000	2411000	Whatever, you know, I don't give a shit. I think they should be PlayStation 5 or whatever.
2411000	2413000	That's just a name.
2413000	2416000	Anyway, so they were talking about some of the features that it's going to have.
2416000	2420000	They said that it's going to basically be backwards compatible with the PlayStation 4.
2420000	2422000	It's going to have a solid state drive.
2422000	2427000	They were talking a little bit about the actual specs of the console.
2427000	2436000	It's going to be based on the Ryzen chipset, so third generation based on their 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture.
2436000	2442000	They have a GPU that's based off the Nvidia Navi family and it will support ray tracing.
2442000	2454000	And also they're going to use that ability to kind of track light or track basically beams to also enhance sound design as well.
2454000	2456000	So that's kind of cool.
2457000	2464000	They're saying that it's going to support the up to 8K resolution and that...
2464000	2467000	Which TVs don't even really do yet, right?
2467000	2468000	Right.
2468000	2470000	We just kind of assume it's coming.
2470000	2477000	Also that the VR is apparently pretty important to them and it will support the original PlayStation VR.
2477000	2481000	I assume that they're going to have their own VR thing that would come out along with it as well.
2481000	2483000	Well, why?
2483000	2485000	Why not just the same VR headset?
2485000	2491000	Because I think that by then you're going to have a VR headset that's going to be able to take in...
2491000	2494000	Because the resolution on the headset is not that great.
2494000	2496000	And so I would think that they would want to bump it up.
2496000	2498000	Comparatively not that great.
2498000	2499000	Yeah.
2499000	2501000	So I would think that they would want to bump it up.
2501000	2509000	Plus I'm assuming that while they may support the PlayStation Move controllers, those things are a few generations old already.
2509000	2512000	They're probably going to become something different.
2512000	2515000	I don't know. I don't know if I would bank on that so much.
2515000	2516000	I would.
2516000	2519000	I was very pleased to hear that they were planning to support.
2519000	2521000	Like that was kind of the most...
2521000	2524000	Considering most of this news is basically spec porn, which is fine.
2524000	2526000	You know, people want to know.
2526000	2532000	And to my point, you know, I made earlier is that I don't necessarily trust anything that they're telling me right now.
2532000	2538000	Because you may remember that like a while back when they were talking about the PlayStation 3 and what it could do.
2538000	2544000	They were touting that all games on the console are going to run at 1080p and it's going to be at 120 frames per second.
2544000	2546000	We know that wasn't the case.
2546000	2549000	Like a lot of games barely got up to that 1080p mark.
2549000	2554000	A lot of them ran at 720 or upscale or whatever to 1080.
2554000	2557000	And nothing ran at 120 frames per second.
2557000	2558000	I get it. I get it.
2558000	2561000	At the end of the day, and we've been saying this forever on this show, right?
2561000	2563000	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
2563000	2565000	We've been saying that for years and years on this show.
2565000	2567000	And nothing is going to change here.
2567000	2574000	And it even, you know, and if you want to compare it to the PlayStation 3, you know, look at the games that they announced when they announced the PlayStation 3.
2574000	2577000	Sure, they're announcing all this cool shit and then they come out on stage.
2577000	2579000	Give me Ridge Racer, goddammit. I need a new Ridge Racer.
2579000	2583000	You're going to fight giant enemy crabs with historical accuracy in this.
2583000	2586000	I want Ridge Racer cars.
2586000	2590000	People weren't really looking at these games going like, oh, I mean, obviously there's exceptions to every rule.
2590000	2594000	Because I know there's going to be that person in chat going, well, I thought Ridge Racer was awesome.
2594000	2599000	Fine. But, you know, obviously the marketplace as a whole kind of rejected it in the beginning.
2599000	2606000	And it wasn't until later on when Sony started getting things like LittleBigPlanet and then some of these other big things that they're really known for now at this point.
2606000	2613000	Like Uncharted and, you know, Last of Us and things like that that came along later on where the PlayStation 3 really started to leave its mark.
2613000	2625000	So my point is this spec porn is great, but I will agree that with your reservation, Loki, about, you know, sure it says it does all this, you know, 8K ray tracing on stuff.
2625000	2630000	For me, it's not so much about like, I don't believe it'll do it, although I think your reservation is fine.
2630000	2633000	It's just like, OK, show me, show me what that looks like.
2633000	2640000	And really, like, let's be honest, like I haven't seen an 8K television, but I've seen 4K televisions and they look great.
2640000	2643000	What more is 8K really going to do at that point?
2643000	2649000	Here's the thing, though. You know, it's funny because I feel like we've been saying that since forever, right?
2649000	2653000	Since we saw games on Nintendo. How can games get better than this?
2653000	2658000	Well, no, I mean, like we're getting to the point of getting to the point of diminishing returns.
2658000	2663000	Like on a 4K TV, you can't really see the pixels too well anymore.
2663000	2670000	It's still going to be, I think that the technology, it's better to, I don't know, like even with 8K, I think,
2670000	2676000	I don't even know if that chip could drive 8K. I mean, they're saying that it can, but can it drive it actually well?
2676000	2684000	I think 4K with better details, better use the extra oomph for, you know, processing more detail.
2684000	2690000	Not necessarily needing the resolution to be higher. I can see them maybe upscaling it to 8K or something like that.
2690000	2698000	But there's no way that driving a game 60 FPS at 8K is going to be a thing that's going to happen with a Ryzen chip.
2698000	2701000	And here's the other thing, and I think this is important to say, is that to be fair,
2701000	2713000	we're all talking about all this news that's come out of a, you know, a discrete unveiling to one reporter from one online magazine.
2713000	2717000	This was not intended to be some big curtain unveiling AAA event.
2717000	2721000	So to pass judgment on the PlayStation 5 at this point is premature.
2721000	2727000	I think it's fair to say that because Sony hasn't taken the opportunity to show us the games.
2727000	2732000	That's not what they wanted to do with this little slip. I don't know what their intent was behind this.
2732000	2736000	I don't know if this was something to kind of needle Microsoft ahead of E3.
2736000	2742000	I don't know what the long-term plan was to kind of let some of this slip now, to maybe not let Sony drop off the news rate.
2742000	2746000	I mean, here we are talking about PlayStation, which we probably wouldn't have been otherwise.
2746000	2749000	You know, so I don't know what the strategical maneuver was there.
2749000	2755000	But the reality is we really can't judge this thing until we see some games, right?
2755000	2763000	And we got to say, okay, if it's 8K, show me like why 8K is going to like blow my fucking mind.
2763000	2767000	Well, first off, they're not going to be able to show you because no way to show you is ever going to be able to come through.
2767000	2769000	Tell me which Best Buy I'm going to have to go to.
2770000	2774000	Because they don't have like you can't. My Internet is not going to handle 8K.
2774000	2777000	I don't have any 4K monitor to watch that crap on.
2777000	2783000	I do have a 4K TV, but like I just think at that point, it doesn't it's not going to matter.
2783000	2788000	Like, you know, jumping that resolution is not going to be like, oh, my God, this looks so much better.
2788000	2791000	I think it's just going to be it's going to look nice as it is. It's going to look more realistic.
2791000	2796000	But I think the ray tracing would help more than the 8K is going to help.
2796000	2801000	And even the ray tracing, I don't well, that may make things look more realistic.
2801000	2806000	Gameplay wise, it's not going to matter. And, you know, you really I don't know.
2806000	2810000	I just want to see what they're going to do with this other than make the car shinier in Gran Turismo.
2810000	2813000	I think the solid state drive thing is is worse.
2813000	2815000	Yeah. And I realize we kind of don't know.
2815000	2820000	And I you know, some of you want to get way more technical on which type of solid state drive and all this other stuff.
2820000	2824000	But I think at the end of the day, what they're really trying to show is, hey, we know that,
2824000	2830000	like when we talk about 8K graphics, some people are sitting there thinking about the loading times that are going to be atrocious, right?
2830000	2835000	No, not the loading times. The download size is going to be atrocious.
2835000	2836000	There is that, too.
2836000	2842000	That's that's what's going to be the thing, because if we're talking like, you know, what kind of media are they going to put on this thing?
2842000	2847000	Where are you going to put those 8K textures? Are you going to store them on a Blu-ray disc?
2847000	2850000	I don't think you're going to be able to fit them on a Blu-ray disc.
2850000	2857000	Do you think that there's probably another type of either disc or or other maybe not even a disc anymore, maybe some type of cartridge?
2857000	2860000	Well, but then how would it be backwards compatible?
2860000	2866000	It's got to have a disk drive, but like the thing I can I just.
2866000	2871000	Pushing 8K, I don't think it's going to be a thing that's going to be out the gate.
2871000	2876000	I don't see it as even a thing you'd want to do, because there's nothing that supports 8K right now.
2876000	2879000	There's no 8K content other than your games.
2879000	2885000	I don't think there's 8K TVs out there. There may be some. I don't think there's a there's definitely not a lot of them.
2885000	2891000	YYR in chat says many current games on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro still don't run at 60 frames per second.
2891000	2898000	More power should help with that. Yeah, sure. So maybe it's probably going to be less about 8K and more about smooth 4K.
2898000	2904000	Yeah, I would say smooth 4K. Let's not push 8K. Let's just make it look good on 4K, because 4K is fine.
2904000	2908000	I don't think anyone's looking at 4K. Oh my God, that's so fucking ugly.
2908000	2915000	I mean, no one's like this resolution. Oh my God. I can see the pixels if I put my face inch from the screen.
2915000	2924000	I mean, I don't think it's going to be an issue there. I think just getting it to run smoothly with more detail is going to make it look better than trying to push 8K.
2925000	2934000	Let's see. Mr. Rhizos in chat says, also speaking of 8K, does it really make a difference to the human eye if it's not experienced on a big screen?
2934000	2941000	And some people are kind of talking about the whole fact that, you know, at a certain size, like, for instance, I have a 4K monitor, but it's only so big.
2941000	2947000	Like, if that monitor were to be 8K, it's probably not going to make a difference. My eye can't see it.
2947000	2956000	And maybe, I think when you were kind of talking about the whole, like, how can graphics get better than they already are, and I kind of joked with you about we've been saying that forever.
2956000	2962000	I think where you were kind of really going with that is that we're getting, like, closer and closer to, like, what the eye can process.
2962000	2969000	Like, we're at a point where it's like, you can't really move much faster. It's not going to matter. Your eye doesn't see that fast.
2969000	2977000	Yeah. And, like, right now they're saying, you know, like, I was looking up, I'm like, well, how much does an 8K TV cost? $5,000.
2977000	2984000	Okay, but that, okay, you know what, though? But I remember back in the day when a big screen TV over 40 inches would cost that much.
2984000	2991000	And it was like a projection type thing. Like, the point is, the price of technology will come down.
2991000	2999000	And I feel like Sony's designed this before. I feel like this is the exact same conversation we were talking about 4K in the PlayStation 4.
2999000	3007000	Like, and, fuck, this show's been around long enough, it's probably documented somewhere, that, like, when the PlayStation 4 was coming out, we were probably saying all the same shit about 4K.
3007000	3015000	That, well, what's the point? Nobody's got a four screen TV. What four 4K TVs are $5,000? Nobody fucking has those in their house.
3015000	3024000	Or 3D televisions are this much. Nobody has those in their house. And then, sure enough, the price of that stuff always comes way down as technology advances and things get cheaper.
3024000	3031000	So, yes, it's $5,000 now, but this PlayStation 5's not even gonna be out until 2020 at the earliest.
3031000	3036000	And then even from there, you can expect that Sony's banking on a 10-year life cycle, whatever that means.
3036000	3042000	But you can be assured that a part of that is, most people won't get one until two years into it.
3042000	3048000	You know, so, what is that price gonna look like in four years? It'll probably come way down.
3048000	3051000	If your eye even cares. I don't know.
3051000	3055000	I don't know. We'll have to see. I mean...
3055000	3064000	Now, quickly, some folks in chat were also bringing this point up, and I do want to mention it, but also there is the sound that they were emphasizing as well.
3064000	3067000	And certainly graphics isn't just the big thing, but there's also sound.
3067000	3071000	I also found it was interesting that they were talking about supporting a lot of the same peripherals.
3071000	3076000	So, like, if I have the Bluetooth headset for PlayStation 4, that means it should work on PlayStation 5, right?
3076000	3078000	It's Bluetooth. Why not?
3078000	3079000	Capable of delivering...
3079000	3081000	It's Bluetooth. It should.
3081000	3082000	I guess so.
3082000	3086000	Just like controllers are Bluetooth, you know, so of course it would.
3086000	3090000	Yeah. I wonder if that means it'll use the same controllers. Maybe we don't have to...
3090000	3092000	Probably. I don't see that they're gonna redesign that.
3092000	3095000	Only that they've done it every single time, Loki.
3096000	3101000	They've redesigned that controller. Remember Sixaxis? That was the must-have thing in the PlayStation 3, Sixaxis.
3101000	3106000	And then of course there was the touchpad. The touchpad was new on PlayStation 4, or the share button and all that stuff.
3106000	3109000	Yeah, the touchpad, no one really uses that.
3109000	3112000	So you think maybe they'll eliminate that in favor of something else?
3112000	3119000	I mean, they use it in some games, like as a click button, but I don't think it's gonna be anything like we needed the touchpad for anything.
3119000	3127000	And YYR does point out regarding Bluetooth and the controllers, the PlayStation 3 controllers are Bluetooth also, and the PlayStation 4 didn't support those.
3127000	3134000	So the controller support is far from guaranteed, and I kinda tend to side on that. I think PlayStation 5 will come out with its own new controller,
3134000	3139000	and we'll be lucky if it supports PlayStation 4 controller, quite frankly, or anything before it.
3139000	3141000	Well, the 3.8 supports PlayStation 3 controllers.
3141000	3146000	Actually, I'm gonna dial it back a little bit, because since we have the backwards compatibility...
3146000	3149000	Or maybe I'm thinking the PlayStation 3 supports PlayStation 4 controllers.
3149000	3156000	Yes, you are. But maybe with the backwards compatibility, maybe it will use the PlayStation 4 controllers for that? I don't know.
3156000	3161000	I mean, again, this is really early on. It's one article and one preview that...
3161000	3166000	No, I will make all my decisions now based on this very little information.
3166000	3168000	But that's...
3168000	3171000	So you find it day one for $800, yes?
3171000	3175000	Of course, because I'm a consumer whore, of course I am. Of course I am.
3175000	3177000	I don't know if I want to buy Sony this time around.
3177000	3179000	Oh my.
3179000	3181000	They...
3181000	3186000	Why don't they show the games? They'll show Grand Theft Auto or whatever, and you'll just be like...
3186000	3188000	I'll be on both platforms.
3188000	3190000	Earth Defense Force 17.
3190000	3192000	I don't need it.
3192000	3193000	Twisted Metal.
3193000	3195000	I still haven't bought Earth Defense Force Iron Rain yet.
3195000	3197000	Oh no, what kind of world do we live in?
3197000	3202000	Because it's $60. That game is like a $20 game. I don't pay $60 for that.
3202000	3207000	Alright, let's move on to the types of games that you're going to be able to purchase on these platforms,
3207000	3213000	because there's some talk about what's going on with the PlayStation 4 marketplace
3213000	3217000	when it comes to sexy games, because apparently...
3217000	3221000	I didn't even realize the PlayStation kind of had a sexy game problem, so...
3221000	3228000	Anyway, Sony apparently has rolled out a new set of guidelines for regulating sexually explicit content
3228000	3231000	for games that are sold on the PlayStation website and the store and all that.
3231000	3233000	This is all according to the Wall Street Journal.
3233000	3236000	So a report done by them says that, quote,
3236000	3240000	A Sony spokeswoman confirmed the company has established its own guidelines
3240000	3244000	so that creators can offer well-balanced content on the platform,
3244000	3249000	and gaming does not inhibit the sound growth and development of young people.
3249000	3250000	So...
3250000	3255000	Apparently, some folks at Sony are a little worried about the rise of sexually explicit games,
3255000	3258000	and this would hurt their reputation.
3258000	3262000	We've had this conversation certainly before many times in the industry, for example,
3262000	3266000	when Nintendo said Night Trap would never be on one of their platforms,
3266000	3269000	and then didn't they just release it on Switch finally?
3269000	3271000	25 years later, I think, but...
3271000	3277000	And ironically, the GameCube version of BMX Triple X was uncensored versus the Xbox.
3277000	3278000	That's right, huh?
3278000	3280000	It was either the Xbox or PlayStation version.
3280000	3282000	I think it was the Xbox version that was censored.
3282000	3285000	I remember that because you owned the GameCube version of BMX Triple X.
3285000	3286000	Because I did.
3287000	3290000	Oh, no, I need the most porny one that's out on the market.
3290000	3292000	I will not settle for just...
3292000	3294000	It's a semi-porny game.
3294000	3296000	We're going to get the full...
3296000	3299000	If I'm going to buy BMX Triple X, we want the full experience.
3299000	3300000	We want all three Xs.
3300000	3304000	We're not going to settle for anything less than Triple X.
3304000	3305000	Anyway...
3305000	3310000	Apparently, a big driving force of the concern is the software sold in Japan
3310000	3313000	because traditionally, they've had more tolerance for near-nudity
3313000	3317000	and images of young women who might appear underage.
3317000	3320000	And I think we've all heard of the visual novel games where,
3320000	3322000	okay, these girls are supposed to be in high school,
3322000	3324000	so they're only, like, 16, and...
3324000	3326000	This is why these games sometimes don't come out.
3326000	3328000	They're all of consenting age.
3330000	3331000	Anyway...
3331000	3333000	You may not actually want to say that.
3334000	3335000	Let's see.
3335000	3338000	They're cartoon characters. They have no age.
3339000	3342000	And also, I guess, part of what's playing into this,
3342000	3344000	is streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube,
3344000	3347000	so these games that are coming out in Japan
3347000	3349000	with these kind of questionable things
3349000	3351000	are being played where, you know...
3351000	3354000	Again, it's more like the globalization, basically, of the market, really.
3354000	3357000	You know, it used to be easier and easier to keep the Japan games in Japan
3357000	3358000	and keep the U.S. games here,
3358000	3360000	but because of the YouTube, because of the Internet,
3360000	3361000	it's the Internet's fault,
3361000	3364000	now it's so easy for us to see these Japanese games
3364000	3365000	and talk about them.
3365000	3367000	And so maybe some of these,
3367000	3370000	what's okay here doesn't fly so well here,
3370000	3371000	and they're worried about the reputation here.
3371000	3372000	So, anyway.
3372000	3374000	Oh my God, think of the children.
3374000	3376000	Now, isn't this interesting?
3376000	3379000	Because Nintendo has told the Wall Street Journal
3379000	3383000	that sexually explicit games can be sold on the Switch
3383000	3386000	as long as they receive a rating from a national agency
3386000	3388000	like the Entertainment Software Rating Board.
3388000	3391000	Nobody has yet to release an AO game,
3391000	3393000	at least on the console front.
3393000	3395000	You know, I realize there's some minor exceptions,
3395000	3397000	what with Oblivion having its...
3397000	3399000	The 3DS had a lot of...
3399000	3401000	You guys know that, generally,
3401000	3405000	these games are not sold on consoles if they're AO.
3405000	3406000	We know that.
3406000	3407000	But M rating games,
3407000	3409000	you can have some sexual content and get away with it.
3409000	3412000	Well, there's all the Senran Kagura stuff that, you know,
3412000	3419000	big titty, you know, ninja girls who, you know,
3419000	3424000	are very put in certain situations.
3424000	3428000	Lots of foam and phallic things in their mouth, yeah.
3428000	3429000	All right, anyway.
3429000	3433000	So, apparently, it's been noted.
3433000	3434000	Let's see.
3434000	3437000	Last October, the publisher XSeed mentioned
3437000	3441000	that Senran Kagura Burst Renewal would be delayed on PlayStation 4
3441000	3444000	because they had to remove the intimacy mode
3444000	3445000	because of the platform holder.
3445000	3447000	As I just talked, Senran Kagura.
3447000	3450000	You know, the game that was appropriate for the 3DS,
3450000	3451000	but not the PlayStation 4.
3451000	3455000	And then later, Japanese game studio Light said
3455000	3458000	that a PlayStation 4 port of the 2017 visual novel,
3458000	3462000	Silverio Trinity, was waiting on approval from Sony
3462000	3464000	in a quote from one of the representatives.
3464000	3467000	Right now, Sony seems to be moving towards disallowing ports
3467000	3469000	of ages 18 and up titles worldwide.
3469000	3471000	And this game is ages 18 and up,
3471000	3474000	so it's being subjected to a very strict inspection,
3474000	3476000	and we're getting all these questions.
3476000	3480000	Isn't this interesting how now Nintendo is the porting platform of choice
3480000	3481000	all these years later?
3481000	3483000	Who would have thought Nintendo would be progressive?
3483000	3484000	Let's be real.
3484000	3487000	It's really the PC at the end of the day.
3488000	3490000	Anyway, I don't know.
3490000	3494000	I understand, especially when it comes to some of the age things,
3494000	3498000	I understand why Sony does not want to be associated with that,
3498000	3503000	so, you know, I get some of their reservations and concern.
3504000	3507000	Locopoco in our chat points out,
3507000	3510000	visual novels with the 600-year-old dragon
3510000	3512000	that looks an axe eight years old.
3513000	3515000	That is a trope, isn't it?
3516000	3518000	Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf points out,
3518000	3521000	I think Devil May Cry 5 had some J.J. Abrams lens flares.
3521000	3524000	They did. I was looking in the article, actually.
3524000	3527000	They did show it side by side between the Japanese version,
3527000	3529000	which showed, oh my god, a woman's butt.
3529000	3532000	And, you know, they had to cover it up with a lens flare
3532000	3534000	in the North American version,
3534000	3537000	because, god forbid, it'll corrupt somebody if they see a woman's butt.
3537000	3539000	How old was a woman supposed to be?
3539000	3542000	I think it was an actual adult.
3542000	3545000	Well, then a butt's a butt, whatever.
3545000	3549000	But if it was somebody that looked and acted like a 16-year-old girl,
3549000	3551000	then, uh, yeah, you need to know.
3551000	3555000	This is pretty rich coming from a company
3555000	3559000	whose one of their mainline character franchises
3559000	3561000	has sex minigames in it,
3561000	3564000	with naked, tittied women.
3564000	3565000	Oh, God of War?
3565000	3566000	Yes.
3566000	3569000	So, I'm surprised that, you know, now they're like,
3569000	3572000	wait, we must take the high road here.
3572000	3576000	This is naughty. Why do we have this on our platform?
3576000	3580000	Shame on you guys for putting this kind of crap on here.
3580000	3583000	Who cares? It's a goddamn game.
3583000	3585000	You have age restrictions. You have parental controls.
3585000	3588000	What's the fucking problem? I don't understand.
3588000	3590000	Let's move on. We've got more controversy.
3590000	3592000	Bonds006 says, tonight's tea is hot.
3592000	3595000	Oh, we're not done yet. Let's get into another controversy,
3595000	3596000	shall we, Loki?
3596000	3599000	Yes, let's talk about using emulators
3599000	3602000	for your console, your classic consoles.
3602000	3604000	Wouldn't be the first time.
3604000	3607000	Yes, so, Capcom, and yeah, it isn't the first time,
3607000	3609000	because, you know, the PlayStation Classic
3609000	3615000	did use an emulator that was publicly available out there.
3615000	3619000	The difference here, though, is the Capcom Home Arcade,
3619000	3622000	which is this ginormous plug-and-play fighting stick
3622000	3625000	that's shaped like the Capcom logo,
3625000	3631000	it uses the emulator FB Alpha, which is an arcade emulator,
3631000	3635000	and apparently, though, originally FB Alpha, I guess,
3635000	3639000	is based a little bit off of MAME and some other stuff,
3639000	3642000	but FB Alpha, while it being open-sourced,
3642000	3646000	it's distributed under a license that strictly prohibits
3646000	3651000	it being used in commercial applications for profit.
3651000	3653000	But they're fucking doing it anyways,
3653000	3657000	because what are they gonna do, like, fight them about it?
3657000	3661000	So apparently, you know, Amazon is selling,
3661000	3668000	they're selling this already for 299 euro, or 260 bucks,
3668000	3672000	and yeah, and they're just doing this right now.
3672000	3675000	Apparently, some people that are on the development team
3675000	3680000	for FB Alpha, which I guess is one guy, Barry Harris,
3680000	3684000	he tweeted that FB Alpha has been licensed by Capcom Home Arcade,
3684000	3688000	but then there's other developers as well.
3688000	3690000	This guy, IQ132, says,
3690000	3692000	I'm strongly against the camp on this as well.
3692000	3695000	I am very against someone profiting off my work,
3695000	3696000	unless it's me, of course.
3696000	3699000	I've never accepted payment for my emulation work,
3699000	3703000	and I'm considering pulling all of my code I wrote and ported for FBA.
3703000	3708000	This would effectively make FBA back to just a CPS and Neo Geo emulator.
3708000	3710000	Okay, here's the thing.
3710000	3712000	I'm not really interested in this thing.
3712000	3715000	For one, I'm gonna be honest, this thing is just fucking ugly.
3715000	3719000	Like, it is like that gigantic Capcom logo.
3719000	3720000	It's not cute.
3720000	3723000	Like, it's not a good-looking piece of hardware,
3723000	3726000	and they want way too much money for it.
3726000	3727000	Way too much money for it.
3727000	3730000	I understand, you know, it's nicely made,
3730000	3732000	it's arcade-quality materials,
3732000	3734000	and that's why they've got to charge a little more for it.
3734000	3737000	Not my cup of tea, quite frankly.
3737000	3742000	However, that being said, Loki, a lot of people have got to be thinking this.
3742000	3746000	Somebody's got to say it, even though I know y'all aren't gonna like it.
3746000	3749000	I know you're not gonna like it, but I'm still gonna say it.
3749000	3753000	Like, surely, surely somebody sees the irony
3753000	3756000	in people that are developing an emulator
3756000	3760000	getting upset that, you know, their code is getting used
3760000	3762000	for a different type of purpose.
3762000	3765000	Meaning, what were the emulators designed to do?
3765000	3770000	To play these games, and sure, I know, yes, of course, of course.
3770000	3774000	We all own the boards, and this is just about preserving the boards.
3774000	3778000	That's our sole reason for doing this, 100% cross.
3778000	3781000	We're just, you know, we all have copies of these boards in our basement.
3781000	3785000	We're just trying to, yeah, sure, this has nothing to do
3785000	3789000	with trying to get everybody out there playing these games
3789000	3791000	and those sorts of things.
3791000	3793000	You've got to see some irony in this.
3793000	3797000	Okay, I'll see the irony, but then if Capcom's basically saying,
3797000	3801000	buy this, and this isn't necessarily Capcom, this is Koch Media doing this,
3801000	3803000	so let's just assume that,
3803000	3807000	let's just assume for the argument's sake that Capcom said,
3807000	3812000	we are okay with using this emulator because people steal our ROMs,
3812000	3815000	you know, to play them through the emulator.
3815000	3818000	We think it's okay that we're doing this, then that's fine.
3818000	3821000	Then if that's the agreement, then you cannot fucking be mad at me
3821000	3823000	to play your stupid ROMs.
3823000	3826000	The argument done will allow this to happen,
3826000	3828000	but then you've got to allow it to happen the other way.
3828000	3831000	You can't bitch that people are playing your games illegally
3831000	3833000	if you're doing illegal acts as well.
3833000	3835000	It's a wash then.
3835000	3837000	But that's not what's going to happen, of course.
3837000	3839000	Of course not what's going to happen.
3839000	3841000	And here's the thing, too.
3841000	3843000	Here's the thing that's really dicey, because to be fair,
3843000	3848000	you mentioned as part of this, Capcom did license the emulator, but...
3848000	3850000	Well, they licensed the ROMs.
3850000	3853000	But due to the open source nature of the emulator,
3853000	3856000	you have all of these contributors to it,
3856000	3859000	so some people that have worked very hard on volunteering
3859000	3861000	and contributing to these as emulator
3861000	3863000	now feel like their work is being profited off of.
3863000	3864000	Which it is.
3864000	3865000	And so forth.
3865000	3867000	So they're feeling pretty salty about it,
3867000	3870000	like that guy that said the comment that he's thinking about pulling out.
3870000	3876000	But to be fair, Capcom tried to license from the entity.
3876000	3878000	That is a part of this as well, right?
3879000	3881000	So Capcom isn't just stealing it.
3881000	3883000	Well, Capcom tried to license it, but yeah.
3883000	3886000	So apparently they've gotten permission from somebody,
3886000	3890000	but maybe that somebody wasn't the person that actually owns this,
3890000	3892000	since it's a group of people doing it,
3892000	3895000	so you need kind of everybody's permission to do it.
3895000	3898000	Honestly, I just kind of feel like at the end of the day,
3898000	3904000	this is just a harsh reality of playing in the emulator game.
3904000	3908000	Well, MAME's open source, and MAME can be used for commercial purposes,
3908000	3910000	so why don't they just use MAME?
3910000	3913000	Oh, it's because it's not as good as this other one?
3913000	3915000	Is what it is?
3915000	3917000	I don't know.
3917000	3921000	Whatever. I'm not going to buy it anyways, so no big deal.
3921000	3922000	Let's see.
3922000	3924000	Going to chat, DJ Rama S says,
3924000	3925000	Here's the million dollar question.
3925000	3928000	How long before this Capcom arcade stick is hacked?
3928000	3931000	Before the sentence left your mouth.
3931000	3936000	It's running an openly available...
3936000	3939000	Yes, it'll be hacked immediately.
3939000	3944000	It's using an emulator that it's obviously running off of just the straight ROMs.
3944000	3948000	I'd be curious, though, if these ROM dumps are going to be any better
3948000	3951000	than the ROM dumps that they have already,
3951000	3953000	since they would be done by Capcom, I'd assume.
3953000	3955000	I don't know. You can only dump a ROM so many ways, I guess.
3955000	3956000	YY Orange Chat says,
3956000	3959000	It's like they're finally bringing us Alien vs. Predator.
3959000	3963000	What an amazing game, but it's locked behind having to buy this huge, ugly thing
3963000	3964000	and keep it in my house.
3964000	3967000	Sell the collection on consoles and I'll buy it.
3967000	3970000	And honestly, at the end of the day, despite everything else I've said,
3970000	3973000	and maybe playing Devil's Advocate, I suppose, on this a little bit,
3973000	3976000	even though nobody asked me to, but I'm a gamer.
3976000	3978000	At the end of the day, I'm kind of with you.
3978000	3982000	The reality is, I'm not paying that much money for that.
3982000	3985000	I'm pointing at Loki's laptop, because he's got a picture of it up on his laptop right now.
3985000	3988000	It's ugly. It is ugly.
3988000	3990000	And that doesn't cost $260 to make.
3990000	3991000	No, of course it doesn't.
3991000	3992000	No, it's wood.
3992000	3996000	I wouldn't be surprised if that's classic.
3996000	3997000	But I'm with YYR.
3997000	4001000	If they were to release this collection for, I don't know, $30 or something, I don't know,
4001000	4006000	on a console, then I would be much more open to picking it up.
4006000	4009000	Because the collection of games is pretty good.
4009000	4011000	You've got things like Mega Man Power Battle in there,
4011000	4013000	although I think that was in a recent collection, wasn't it?
4013000	4017000	But anyway, there's a variety of different fighting games and stuff in here.
4017000	4022000	It's a pretty decent collection, but not for $260.
4022000	4026000	I like this last comment, though, out of the community that's around FBA.
4026000	4030000	They were saying that it's bad enough with the shady use of FBA.
4030000	4036000	They didn't have to make the product hideous on top.
4036000	4038000	Tigerclaw is asking an interesting question.
4038000	4041000	I'm not sure we would know the answer, but it's worth repeating.
4041000	4044000	The Alien vs. Predator game, don't they need to get the license for that,
4044000	4049000	given now that Alien and Predator are owned by Disney?
4049000	4054000	Perhaps there was something written into the agreement
4054000	4056000	that maybe some other gaming companies didn't think of.
4056000	4058000	And I don't know, I'm just theorizing,
4058000	4060000	maybe Capcom had something written into their agreement
4060000	4064000	that when they made the game, they have the rights to it
4064000	4067000	and to keep putting out that game for so many years,
4067000	4070000	that they would not have to, despite whoever owns it.
4070000	4072000	I don't know. That's just my thought.
4072000	4075000	Maybe it's their agreement just being different,
4075000	4077000	that they're allowed to do that without having to go back to Disney
4077000	4078000	and try to get money.
4078000	4080000	But if they did have to go to Disney and Disney wanted money,
4080000	4082000	that would explain why this thing's $260.
4082000	4085000	Maybe. I don't know.
4085000	4086000	It's just not worth it for that price.
4086000	4087000	It isn't.
4087000	4090000	For how many? $260 for how many games?
4090000	4093000	Emulator controversy aside, it's just not...
4093000	4095000	No, that's a no from me, dog.
4095000	4097000	That's what it is at the end of the day.
4097000	4099000	It's just not something I desire at all.
4099000	4101000	How many games here? So like 16 games?
4101000	4102000	16 games.
4103000	4105000	No. Well, okay.
4105000	4107000	Why am I that guy tonight?
4107000	4109000	I'm being that guy tonight.
4109000	4113000	To be fair, they sell those things at Walmart
4113000	4115000	that are like these type of cabinets,
4115000	4120000	the tabletop cabinets that are a replica of the old arcade machines
4120000	4122000	and they want, what, like 200 bucks for those
4122000	4124000	and there's maybe four games in them?
4125000	4126000	You know what I'm talking about, right?
4126000	4127000	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
4127000	4129000	Yeah. I mean, those are only like four games.
4129000	4130000	They want $200 for those.
4130000	4132000	Granted, there's a TV in them or some type of display.
4132000	4134000	There's a monitor in there.
4134000	4136000	You know, a nice looking set with that,
4136000	4140000	but I mean, talk about value.
4140000	4142000	You don't get a lot of games for that either,
4142000	4144000	but I guess maybe that's more about the presentation.
4144000	4146000	Those look nice.
4146000	4150000	This gigantic Capcom logo looks really bad.
4150000	4152000	It's just...
4154000	4155000	Arcade 1-Up. Thank you, Bobby.
4155000	4157000	Thank you, Bobby. That is the name of that.
4157000	4160000	All right. Let's move on, shall we?
4160000	4162000	Maybe to something less controversial?
4162000	4165000	Ha ha ha. Nope. Still more controversy.
4165000	4168000	Super Smash Brothers got updated this week.
4168000	4170000	Big new update in Super Smash Brothers
4170000	4173000	because Joker is now not the Batman guy,
4173000	4176000	but the Persona guy, is now an official DLC character in the game
4176000	4182000	and the other big thing that people are talking about is the stage builder.
4182000	4184000	So, you can now create your own stages,
4184000	4186000	which is basically...
4186000	4189000	I admittedly have not had the time to play around with it,
4189000	4191000	but the things I'm seeing, it's like,
4191000	4194000	oh, it's like Mario Paint, but you're painting stages.
4194000	4197000	It's like Little Big Planet, sort of.
4197000	4202000	Okay. But obviously, if you allow people to paint whatever they want,
4202000	4207000	people are painting things like dicks, boobies,
4207000	4210000	you know, Princess Peach, Spread Eagle,
4210000	4212000	things like that. These are the types of levels
4212000	4215000	that people were making within seconds, right?
4215000	4218000	So, now Nintendo has a content moderation problem.
4218000	4221000	I almost forgot that the Wii version had a stage builder as well.
4221000	4222000	Remember that?
4222000	4223000	Yeah, it did. Yeah, yeah.
4223000	4226000	Because you couldn't share them as easily on that one.
4226000	4228000	Yeah. You had to use codes or something.
4228000	4231000	Yeah. Well, I don't even know if that really worked on the Wii one.
4231000	4232000	Like, if it was easy sharing.
4232000	4234000	Oh, we had to lay it as a website.
4234000	4236000	I remember now because I made a question block one
4236000	4241000	and had to go to some site to get it.
4242000	4246000	So, anyhow, of course, Nintendo has been, like, removing these,
4246000	4248000	but it's also led to some controversy
4248000	4252000	because there's been some things that were, you know, a little more like,
4252000	4257000	I was reading something about somebody had made a stage out of a trans flag
4257000	4259000	and it got pulled for being political.
4259000	4263000	I'm hoping that's just a one-off and not some type of direction.
4263000	4265000	Well, and you know, of course, what the response was.
4265000	4270000	Now there's 5,000 of those stages that are out there on the platform.
4270000	4273000	It's like Nintendo's never been to YouTube before.
4273000	4278000	Or it's like Nintendo has never dealt with online before.
4278000	4282000	Honestly, in my honest opinion, they should just,
4282000	4284000	and this is not going to be the popular,
4284000	4286000	they should just not have the public facing thing.
4286000	4288000	Just leave it so that you can see what your friends make
4288000	4291000	and you can use codes to get whatever stages you want.
4291000	4293000	Just get rid of the public facing store.
4293000	4296000	It's not going to do you any favors.
4296000	4298000	Just get rid of it.
4298000	4299000	There's no way.
4299000	4301000	I mean, I think that the trans stuff,
4301000	4304000	they're probably just catching it based off of the name.
4304000	4307000	There's no way a person's going to be able to go through all of this stuff
4307000	4308000	and actually view these.
4308000	4309000	Right.
4309000	4312000	Or that there's going to be any sort of like consistency between it
4312000	4316000	because I really hope something like the flag thing getting taken down
4316000	4319000	is just because somebody with an itchy trigger finger
4319000	4321000	didn't know what they were doing, basically.
4321000	4323000	That unfortunately, you know, that's the one that gets reported.
4323000	4326000	Now, you know, gets run everywhere on the internet
4326000	4329000	because, you know, it's it's just it's it's it's just a flag.
4329000	4330000	It's not offensive.
4330000	4335000	So but anyway, but with the dick levels of those are pretty funny.
4335000	4337000	I've seen some because you can make stuff move around.
4337000	4339000	So, of course, did you see the one that one of my friends made?
4339000	4342000	One of my friends made that one of my friends made a goat's a level
4342000	4346000	and the little the little I don't get banned from Twitch.
4346000	4347000	No, let's talk about it.
4347000	4348000	Come on.
4348000	4355000	The arms, as they do in the picture, will kind of like expand and collapse
4355000	4358000	and the legs will expand and collapse with it.
4358000	4364000	And that's the question, though, is, is the butthole like if you were the stage,
4364000	4366000	what would happen? I'm not doing that.
4366000	4369000	But you know how they have like the hazards, like they actually have like lava
4369000	4373000	or whatever is the hazard was they butthole a hazard because I need to know.
4373000	4377000	I don't know, I I told them to delete his his account
4377000	4382000	and then I moved on to the next post, as you do on the Internet, Loki.
4382000	4385000	That's awesome.
4387000	4392000	A dark to see in chat says, I know they were trying to police the level gallery,
4392000	4393000	as shown here.
4393000	4397000	Matt says there were some very elaborate stick figure fornication stages going on
4397000	4399000	and the Internet ruined everything.
4399000	4401000	Yes, the Internet tends to do that.
4401000	4404000	The Internet completely ruined the complete shock to no one.
4404000	4408000	On a related note, but a little a little more wholesome.
4408000	4412000	The Switch got a firmware update right around the same time.
4412000	4416000	So even if you aren't a Smash person or have zero interest in these stage builder stages,
4416000	4418000	which, quite frankly, I don't blame you.
4418000	4421000	But the Switch switch firmware got an update to 8.0.
4421000	4425000	And it sounds like a lot of like bug fixes and things like that.
4425000	4427000	But there are some new icons.
4427000	4430000	So Splatoon 2 and Yoshi Craft a World have some new icons.
4430000	4435000	There's like some the way you view the news, a way to transfer your save data.
4435000	4437000	There's a zoom feature that's on.
4437000	4439000	That's kind of neat because that's an accessibility thing.
4439000	4441000	If you think about it, it's pretty cool.
4441000	4445000	You can prevent the system from waking up when the AC adapter is disconnected.
4445000	4448000	I guess it's probably a battery saver type of thing.
4448000	4452000	And then there's a VR mode restriction in parental controls.
4452000	4458000	So if you are afraid that VR will warp your children's eyes, you can disable it.
4458000	4463000	I've actually played because they do have that in, ironically enough, in the Labo VR,
4463000	4467000	where you can disable VR for anyone under seven.
4467000	4473000	And so what it does instead is you actually have a separate thing you build for the screen.
4473000	4478000	It's basically kind of like an AR camera type thing.
4478000	4483000	So you don't put the actual goggles on, but it still shows you an image of what you're seeing.
4483000	4487000	So you can still play all the games without it being right up against your face.
4487000	4491000	And I'm assuming that's what it is as well.
4491000	4493000	It's kind of neat that they're going to have that.
4493000	4497000	So I would assume that other things will work without the VR stuff.
4497000	4499000	All right. Well, there you go.
4499000	4504000	So you can update your Switch firmware, even though the Zoom feature might be kind of neat to play with.
4504000	4507000	Especially maybe you'd want to zoom in on things in some of these custom stages.
4507000	4509000	I don't know. But anyway.
4509000	4512000	Actually, to that note, because I was just trying to make sure it wasn't in our show role.
4512000	4517000	So I know for a fact that, speaking of not needing VR,
4517000	4524000	the VR stages that they're doing for the Super Mario Galaxy will not require VR as well.
4524000	4527000	So you can play that without the VR mode on there.
4527000	4533000	I still think the Zelda thing does require VR, though, because it's just making the game 3D.
4533000	4536000	So what would be the point if it wasn't VR? It'd just look the same.
4536000	4541000	So that'll be a thing. But we'll find out next week. Or later this week.
4541000	4543000	Yeah, it's pretty soon. It's coming out.
4543000	4545000	So I'll have to check it out and see how it is.
4545000	4550000	I'm tempted, yeah. I'm actually kind of tempted to get the Nintendo VR thing.
4550000	4558000	I never thought I would say that, but that Labo, the stuff that comes with that, there's so much.
4558000	4562000	I'm actually so impressed. And the fact that they're going back and updating these other games,
4562000	4566000	even if they're silly things, they're just silly things.
4566000	4568000	And they're fun to build, but here's the weird thing.
4568000	4573000	I saw someone actually playing, somehow, and I was trying to figure it out because I saw it on my phone,
4573000	4578000	that they streamed themselves playing one of the Labo games.
4578000	4584000	Now, I could tell that they weren't in VR mode for it, but somehow they were getting the video capture out of it.
4584000	4591000	Because I don't think you can play it docked when you're doing the Labo stuff, unless you can.
4591000	4597000	I don't know, because that would be odd that you have somehow shoved the dock in there,
4597000	4600000	and you're holding the dock while tilting everything around.
4600000	4603000	I don't think that would work, but I don't know.
4603000	4606000	There's probably some way to split the signal that's not being thought of.
4606000	4607000	I don't know.
4607000	4608000	Without hacking the system.
4608000	4611000	Or maybe it is hacking the system, who knows.
4611000	4612000	But anyway.
4612000	4614000	All right, well, let's move on.
4614000	4618000	I think we've talked Sony, we've talked Nintendo, let's not leave anybody out.
4618000	4619000	Let's talk Microsoft.
4619000	4623000	Now, I know this is going to sound a lot like kind of just talking about the same stuff we talked about last week,
4623000	4628000	but it's basically just confirming all the things we were rumored last week.
4629000	4631000	As our pricing and the official details, right?
4631000	4640000	So, they did confirm during their Inside Xbox video that they are going to be doing that Game Pass Ultimate.
4640000	4646000	It is going to be $15 a month, and it's going to be out apparently later this year.
4646000	4651000	They didn't say if they're going to offer a better deal for annual subscription,
4651000	4658000	because apparently you could sub them by month, I guess, for $60 a year anyways.
4658000	4663000	It says both sub separately can be $60 for a year or so.
4663000	4664000	Yeah, and what do we do?
4664000	4668000	I already have Xbox Live on a yearly thing right now.
4668000	4671000	What's my incentive to jump in and get Game Pass?
4671000	4673000	I would think that they would need to offer a discount for something like that.
4673000	4674000	I would think so too.
4674000	4676000	So, we didn't really get the full scope of that.
4676000	4682000	But, you know, it's still a start in kind of bringing these things together in one price for everything.
4682000	4687000	Then, of course, they officially announced the all digital version of the Xbox One S.
4687000	4689000	It's going to have a one terabyte hard drive.
4689000	4691000	It will be priced for $250.
4691000	4693000	I'm sorry, but the acronym is so great.
4693000	4696000	The Xbox One S, all digital.
4696000	4698000	The Xbox One, sad.
4699000	4702000	Wow. Wow, Microsoft.
4707000	4710000	Maybe it was intentional. It's kind of funny.
4710000	4716000	It's going to be $50 less than the standard Xbox One S.
4717000	4721000	And right now, you're saying the game is going to come with three games.
4721000	4727000	Just like we had originally said, Minecraft Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 3 are going to be pre-installed.
4728000	4733000	And then they're also going to have, apparently, trials to Game Pass and Gold.
4733000	4738000	Which I think, are they saying a trial for Game Pass and Gold for like a dollar?
4738000	4741000	But that's currently what's available for anybody.
4741000	4745000	So, that's not really an exclusive thing for any way that buys this.
4745000	4747000	But, whatever.
4747000	4752000	Yeah, they said option of paying $1 for a three month subscription to Xbox Game Pass.
4754000	4755000	You can do that anyways.
4755000	4759000	Here's the thing. I don't want to sound anti-Microsoft because I'm really not.
4759000	4761000	There's a lot of things I'm really rooting for out of Xbox.
4761000	4762000	Oh, and it's coming out May 7th.
4762000	4768000	I'm probably more excited to see what they're going to unveil pretty soon for the future than probably anybody else.
4768000	4770000	Because I do think Microsoft is going to go in a different direction.
4770000	4773000	All that being said, I think this is a miss.
4773000	4775000	Because the price is low enough.
4775000	4779000	It's $50 less than what's out there.
4779000	4786000	Which means you can get a used Xbox One regular thingy out there probably for cheaper.
4786000	4788000	If you just walk into a used game store.
4788000	4794000	I was at the game store the other day, yesterday actually, and they had Xbox.
4794000	4796000	I was even joking about that.
4796000	4807000	Why would I buy this new all digital system when I can buy a used system and these games and get it even cheaper?
4807000	4810000	Or, you don't even have to purchase the games.
4810000	4814000	You just subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass for three months and you get them anyways.
4814000	4816000	What's the point?
4816000	4818000	I really think they should have just bundled in a year.
4818000	4819000	They should have.
4819000	4820000	Ride it off to move some consoles.
4820000	4821000	No games.
4821000	4823000	I don't even know how much those games would be.
4823000	4824000	The value of those games.
4824000	4826000	But no games in a year of Game Pass or something like that.
4826000	4833000	Because they can say you get 200 games in your library and all those games were included anyways.
4833000	4836000	Pre-owned Xbox One consoles.
4836000	4838000	$149.99.
4838000	4842000	They are pre-owned of course.
4843000	4849000	I really feel like the fact that they couldn't get this down to $199.99 is the most sad thing about it.
4849000	4850000	Unfortunately.
4850000	4856000	The Xbox One is a fine console and obviously some of the things they are bundling in there.
4856000	4858000	Especially things like Forza 3 was a fantastic game.
4858000	4860000	Minecraft is obviously a must.
4860000	4862000	Sea of Thieves is pretty cool.
4862000	4868000	I understand they are trying to bundle them in and give some exclusives.
4868000	4870000	They didn't get the price low enough.
4870000	4872000	To be fair, a one terabyte console.
4872000	4874000	We are going to tip for tat.
4874000	4876000	$199.
4880000	4882000	It's a bummer they couldn't get it lower.
4882000	4884000	But at the same time.
4884000	4888000	It's not like this is a make or break console for Microsoft.
4888000	4890000	This is very much a bridge.
4890000	4894000	And probably what's going to end up being a very short bridge into June.
4894000	4898000	And the major hype that's about to begin for whatever Microsoft has next.
4898000	4904000	Whether they make this holiday or they are targeting I think would be more likely March next year might be something they are targeting.
4904000	4907000	So they are going to get a little jump on next year but not a big one.
4907000	4909000	That's my guess anyway.
4909000	4911000	They will put it in the fiscal year but they are not going to put it in the holiday.
4911000	4922000	Because the Nintendo Switch and so many other things in gaming have shown that the holiday calendar is no longer like the definitive guide to a game release schedule that it used to be.
4922000	4927000	So I would say Microsoft is going to show something in June that they are going to put out in March.
4927000	4934000	And that's going to be far more exciting than this bridge system to close out this era of the Xbox.
4934000	4938000	I would say hold off on getting anything.
4938000	4944000	Honestly at this point you might as well wait until the next generation or buy used.
4944000	4947000	If you really want to get in on that.
4947000	4951000	Honestly this isn't interesting to me at all.
4952000	4957000	I'm just going to play stuff on my PC because I get the Xbox games that I want on there.
4957000	4959000	All the first party stuff.
4959000	4966000	I wish they had Game Pass on my PC so I could run all those Xbox One games on there.
4966000	4969000	But they don't have that yet.
4969000	4973000	And I'm not getting anything less than an Xbox One X.
4973000	4980000	And it would be pointless for me to get it now because anything I would probably plan there would be a multiplatform anyways and I would already own it.
4980000	4988000	Well Johnny Wu-Fei in our chat kind of echoing some of this here saying I haven't had much of a use for it since I can play the Xbox One games on PC.
4988000	4994000	And Bobby says well Microsoft says the Xbox is a platform and not necessarily a console.
4994000	4996000	You know not to build the hype too much.
4996000	4998000	We have one more little bit about E3 for Microsoft right?
4998000	4999000	Yeah.
4999000	5000000	I want to bridge into this.
5000000	5002000	So tell us what to expect for E3.
5002000	5008000	So E3 they're going to be doing their Xbox conference on June 9th at 1pm.
5008000	5011000	So that's going to be a Sunday.
5011000	5013000	Let's see here.
5013000	5016000	Look at my calendar here.
5016000	5018000	June 9th is a Sunday.
5018000	5019000	So Sunday at 1.
5019000	5021000	That's going to be a big day for OLR.
5021000	5022000	Yeah.
5022000	5025000	And so they're going to be doing something.
5025000	5028000	This is the same day as Bethesda.
5028000	5031000	I think that was the same as last year as well.
5031000	5035000	And yeah.
5035000	5038000	So that's going to be they're going to make their announcements then.
5038000	5042000	So we'll have to wait and see what they announce.
5042000	5045000	Do not forget y'all.
5045000	5048000	One of the biggest news stories that came out of this previous E3.
5048000	5053000	Just how many game studios Microsoft has working for them right now.
5053000	5057000	I don't want to set the bar too high.
5057000	5062000	But I'm fully you know Microsoft is going into this E3 essentially uncontested.
5062000	5065000	I mean you could say Nintendo is going to be doing their thing.
5065000	5067000	But Microsoft and Nintendo are now kind of buddy buddy.
5067000	5069000	Yeah they're kind of like winking at each other.
5069000	5071000	You know that they're hooking up on the side.
5071000	5072000	You know it you know they fuck it.
5072000	5073000	We got we got.
5073000	5076000	There's so many fan wank ideas out there.
5076000	5077000	It's like.
5077000	5080000	So here's here's the thing is that.
5080000	5081000	Oh my God.
5081000	5083000	What if Reggie's going to Microsoft.
5083000	5084000	No no put.
5084000	5087000	Take that out of the universe and put it back in your mouth.
5087000	5089000	He is not going to Microsoft.
5089000	5092000	He's taking a well-earned fucking vacation which by the way is on Twitter now.
5092000	5093000	Did you notice that.
5093000	5094000	I did.
5094000	5095000	I'm following him.
5095000	5104000	So anyway I'm fully expecting we're going to get it any three or it's just we're just going to have game pow game pow game.
5104000	5107000	I think we're going to have a Nintendo partnership pow.
5107000	5111000	I don't know if I go that far but I mean we I don't know.
5111000	5113000	I don't even want that would be pretty awesome.
5113000	5117000	I don't I don't want to get into that kind of fan wank here on O.L.R.
5117000	5124000	But I mean certainly people are thinking the new powered switch game pass on the switch something like that.
5124000	5133000	I mean you know even something like rare replay come into the switch would be like a huge deal and Cuphead just came out on the switch this week.
5133000	5136000	I know that's a game a lot of people have been playing so who knows.
5136000	5142000	But anyway that all kind of ties back into what Bobby said we're like Xbox is more of a service if you think about it that way.
5142000	5146000	So it's like you know even though we keep talking about next console next console next console.
5146000	5154000	There's a very distinct possibility Microsoft could be coming out to this E3 to say all right we're here to show off what our game developers are making and we've got a lot.
5154000	5156000	So it's going to be interesting.
5156000	5157000	I'm very excited.
5157000	5161000	I'm very exciting for June.
5161000	5168000	Mr. Rizos in our chat says agreed with Rob if Microsoft doesn't come to E3 with a load of games it's going to be a miss.
5168000	5173000	Bobby says a game game game game no sports no TV game game game.
5173000	5179000	Akuma JP in chat says developers developers developers developers.
5179000	5184000	Yes except this time they're all Microsoft developers essentially.
5184000	5188000	All right anyhow let's move on and talk about let's talk about why not.
5188000	5193000	We're talking about all the modern consoles let's talk about retro consoles because everything retro is new again.
5193000	5195000	The Sega Genesis Mini.
5195000	5197000	I know some of you all are excited about that.
5197000	5203000	Well some more titles are coming to the Sega Genesis Mini or the Mega Drive Mini depending on where you live.
5203000	5209000	Ten more were announced and that that's going to be Thunder Force 3 Super Fantasy Zone.
5209000	5213000	Musha World of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.
5213000	5214000	I'm surprised about that one.
5214000	5226000	Yeah Streets of Rage 2, The Hybrid Front, Landstalker, Contra Hardcore, Dinah Brothers 2, and Gamaeno Kanzume Otokyo.
5226000	5232000	So those were only Japan titles over there so the US I guess is getting different games.
5232000	5235000	Oh yes no they did announce the US differences.
5235000	5238000	So US is also going to get Castle of Illusion.
5238000	5239000	Let me just start the list over.
5239000	5241000	God it's like completely different.
5241000	5254000	Good lord. Earthworm Jim, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Castle of Illusion World of Illusion, Contra Hardcore, Streets of Rage 2, Thunder Force 3, Super Fantasy Zone, Shinobi 3, and Landstalker.
5254000	5260000	So I mean as far as like definitive Genesis game collections go this is shaping up pretty good.
5260000	5264000	You know what they need? They need the Lion King and Aladdin and those other. Why not?
5264000	5270000	If they got Castle of Illusion why not go in on those other Disney Genesis games.
5271000	5274000	Yeah. Why not Jurassic Park on the Genesis 2? Shoot.
5274000	5280000	So I don't I yeah here we go again with how did they get the licenses for those things back where they can put out a Mickey Mouse game.
5280000	5288000	Either they worked out a deal with Disney or it's part of the original agreement that they get to put out as many rehashes of the same game as they want.
5288000	5299000	But remember if I remember right the Castle of Illusion got an HD retreatment at one point on the 360 and they already well and PlayStation 3 and I think at that time.
5299000	5304000	So they already worked out all those arrangements at one point so anyway.
5305000	5313000	Bobby does point out the downside for me on the Sega Classic all the games I want to play I already have on the Xbox 360.
5313000	5316000	Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. True.
5316000	5322000	YYR follows that up with the same question I would have asked but do you still have your 360 hooked up at the moment? I don't.
5322000	5327000	Well at some point it's not going to matter if your console is hooked up because Xbox is a service.
5327000	5335000	But we're not talking about Xbox anyway. This is about the Sega Genesis Mini. Does this sound like something you might be interested in picking up?
5335000	5345000	Maybe. I mean I have the SNES Classic which I don't play very much at all. So I don't know. Maybe.
5345000	5353000	I'll see what the retail release kind of full thing all the games and how much they want for it and all that good stuff.
5354000	5360000	I just need to get a better set up for all that stuff because right now it's just kind of sitting next to my TV. It's not hooked up.
5360000	5369000	I need to hook it up to my actual like monitors that I use my computer on to I think it'd be better that way.
5369000	5378000	Alright well speaking of classic games why don't we take a moment to take a break and take a trip down memory lane with our classic game of the week. Sound good?
5378000	5379000	Yep.
5379000	5387000	Alright so we're going to open up the portal of time and take a trip down memory lane in a segment that we call the classic game of the week.
5387000	5396000	But as I mentioned earlier in the show Dark Sakura she is out of town right now so she is unavailable today to take us into the vault for the classic gaming week.
5396000	5408000	But I called on one of our good pals here at Orange Lounge Radio another host of a show here at the voice geeks network of vognetwork.com and one of my long time gamer buddies to help fill in the segment for tonight.
5408000	5412000	Say hello everybody to from gamebuoy.org Captain Spike.
5412000	5416000	Hello hello hello thank you for having me tonight Rob.
5416000	5420000	Thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it. How are you?
5420000	5424000	You know I am doing lovely tonight. How are you doing?
5424000	5427000	I am doing good. Did you have a good holiday?
5427000	5431000	It has been a lovely holiday weekend for me. How about yourself?
5431000	5437000	Good of course I'm talking about Easter I wouldn't be talking about any other times holidays going on this weekend of course.
5437000	5440000	Of course of course all the children were walking in nature.
5440000	5452000	Of course. Anyway Spike you know the drill so every week Dark Sakura usually picks a game from her collection or otherwise in the past to highlight as the classic game of the week.
5452000	5461000	And you know what I know over at gamebuoy you guys like to highlight a lot of things that might not necessarily be in the mainstream kind of off the off the radar.
5461000	5468000	So and I know you've also played a lot of games over the years you know a lot about your classic games your modern games.
5468000	5475000	So I wanted you to pick something for tonight. So Spike what do you want to highlight as the classic game of the week this week.
5476000	5483000	Oh my gosh. Well of the three people that I told I was going to be doing this this weekend.
5483000	5490000	Literally all three guess what game I was going to be picking. So I get that you probably guessed too Rob.
5490000	5498000	I'm highlighting Demon's Crest. This is a classic Super Nintendo game Super Famicom in Japan obviously.
5498000	5513000	I was released there as demons plays on. It's a spinoff of the classic ghosts and goblins series as well as an indirect follow up to the spinoffs of that series gargoyles quest and gargoyles quest 2.
5513000	5525000	It was released in Japan in October of 1994 in North America of November of 1994 and in the PAL regions in March of 1995.
5525000	5533000	The reason why I picked this game this week in particular is because while it is my very favorite game of all time.
5533000	5549000	And I think a real underappreciated gem right this very moment in gaming where I think there's sort of this real focus on games that merge sort of classic 2D elements along with like world exploration.
5549000	5558000	A lot of like metroidvania interconnected like environmental interactivity kind of game design elements.
5558000	5566000	The thing is all these things are like super popular now, but demons crest was doing them in 1994.
5566000	5573000	Oh what a hipster choice. My game was doing this back in 94. No but you're right. You're right.
5573000	5587000	Like there's a lot in common with one of my favorite Super Nintendo sleeper hits Actraiser right where you kind of go between like over the world and then you have like side scroller elements like you know it's kind of a little bit everything.
5587000	5616000	Well exactly and you know it's funny that you bring up the Actraiser comparison because you know they both very similarly for world navigation use a sort of top down style perspective looking down on the world using in fact the Super Nintendo's much vaunted mode 7 effects to rotate you know like a giant sprite of the world map around you really to create that really cool looking visual effect that was I think at the time really unique to Super Nintendo games.
5616000	5620000	I don't really think you were seeing those kinds of visual effects on any other hardware.
5620000	5631000	No and funny enough mode 7 is also all over the news this week with that emulator that is like rendering the more HD images of the mode 7 stuff kind of neat.
5631000	5634000	I was literally just going to say that.
5634000	5637000	Oops my bad I'll stop stepping on your toes.
5637000	5660000	No no it's perfect in fact I was going to say I would actually like to run this game in an emulator I just thought about it while I was talking about it like oh wait, I have something exciting new to see now because I would really like to see that world map rendered in that higher resolution and see maybe what kind of details I've been missing in one of my all time faves.
5660000	5666000	But because I'm already getting a little long in the tooth and I've literally not even described the game itself.
5666000	5688000	I will note, for those of you who have played the ghosts and goblins ghouls and ghosts any of those games in that series in demons crest, along with gargoyles quest and gargoyles quest to actually take control of one of those red armor enemies you know the the flying little baddies with the gargoyle wings.
5688000	5694000	And basically, you're sort of almost like the review of demons.
5694000	5706000	You're playing this red armor you're named fire brand, and you're basically just out there looking for, you know, the biggest challenge you want to test your powers you want to become you know the most powerful demon.
5706000	5710000	And if you can save the world while you're doing that. Awesome.
5710000	5718000	Which is actually kind of like my favorite like anti hero type stories because I'm very 1990s because of when I was born.
5718000	5721000	It is what it is.
5721000	5733000	So following this you basically take fire brand on this adventure through the world to find you know six different magical stones that are going to combine to form you know the demons crest it's a whole thing.
5733000	5746000	But the neat thing is as you find these stones which you would be forgiven for thinking they were the Infinity Stones from powerful universe because it's like the time stone the heaven stone that earth stone that air stone.
5746000	5759000	But the really neat thing is when you get each of these stones you actually unlock a new form for your gargoyle. So, each of these forms has completely different abilities so one of them has the ability to freely fly.
5759000	5776000	One of them has a really cool tackle ability that can destroy, you know freestanding obstacles within the world. You know, one of them can swim incredibly well and can can breathe underwater which none of the other forms can do, which enables you to explore all the underwater areas.
5777000	5782000	Basically, this, this was Capcom very much having a how do we put mega man in this moment.
5782000	5793000	No, I'm just kidding. Maybe exactly and I was actually going to note you know a lot of the people who worked on this game did in fact work on the mega man revitalization of mega man x.
5793000	5808000	When you look at the staff listing of mega man x and compare it to demons crest. You see a lot of names in common among the two, and this really does feel like almost the mega man x version of a ghosts and goblins game.
5809000	5827000	So it becomes this very challenging metroidvania style almost maze where there's just tons of like hidden stuff and optional things that if you really just want to like beat the game you can actually play this game through in like two hours and 30 minutes, but if you want to find everything
5827000	5839000	and unlock like the most ultimate gargoyle form, then yeah mega man x style expected to a lot of exploration, a lot of platforming and ultimately to see some really cool hidden stuff.
5839000	5849000	So what is it about this game that makes it your fave because to call something you know your absolute favorite you've played a lot of games I hope our listeners understand this you've played a lot of games.
5850000	5862000	What is it about this one especially when you consider that the critical reaction I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't you know it wasn't a 40 in famitsu either. You know what is it about this game really that makes it yours your fave?
5863000	5874000	Well I'm sorry it wasn't a 40 in famitsu not every game can be nintendogs, but that game got a 40 in famitsu and I bring that up every time.
5874000	5878000	I know I did it's it's it's a plus shade it's great.
5878000	5884000	I will say, I actually am team famitsu on the nintendogs thing it's just convenient shade.
5884000	5894000	When they gave nintendogs that a they basically said it was the best virtual pet simulator they could imagine. I can't really disagree with that at the time.
5894000	5896000	Okay, but Demon's Crest.
5896000	5904000	Okay sorry the thing is with Demon's Crest first I think it has some of the most interesting sprite work I've ever seen.
5904000	5917000	The sprite work in this game it's very detailed but it's um in that like super nintendo capcom high detail type so it's all very like textured and gritty and dark.
5917000	5927000	Lots of really interesting uses of the super nintendo's color palette to really sort of sell this like brooding dark gothic fantasy.
5927000	5933000	And the thing is when you say brooding dark gothic fantasy that is literally my exact jam.
5933000	5935000	It really is.
5935000	5943000	Right and then you marry you know this game has like a ton of like really challenging giant beautifully animated boss encounters.
5943000	5956000	This soundtrack is just this like really low key atmospheric creepy like japanese malice miser like visual kei goth rock type atmosphere I just.
5956000	5968000	For me, if you were to ask me to design my ideal game I would say oh why don't you take Castlevania symphony of the night, fill it with more demons and spooky shit.
5968000	5974000	Make it a much harder game, and give me a more fun upgrade system.
5974000	5983000	And that's what this game is to me symphony of the night but better. And that's why it's my favorite, except it was before most of those things you mentioned which made it like hipster and awesome.
5983000	5997000	Well, and that's, that's actually the thing is, um, you know, people will often say to me, like, Oh yeah, you know, after symphony of the night like what's my next step I'm like no actually you have to take a few steps back.
5997000	6010000	And that's actually also I always try to call attention to this game you know it's been, it's gotten virtual console releases on the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS which is delightful obviously it is still on the market, you can still access it.
6010000	6024000	But I'm also always trying to raise hell about this game, pun fully intended, because I would really really like it if this could get back on somebody's radar over at Capcom so, you know, wink wink.
6024000	6036000	So for all those hundreds of people at Capcom that are listening right now but I'm an all seriousness like how can somebody revisit this game, legally, like, is, I mean, I guess you can find the Super Nintendo cartridge.
6036000	6048000	It was on the Wii Virtual Console right is there any other like collections or anything. Well yeah as I just noted it was released on the Wii U Virtual Console, and it was released on the 3DS Virtual Console.
6048000	6058000	Got it. But unfortunately I think that's only on the new 3DS that you can do the Super Nintendo games. Yeah, that's right.
6058000	6070000	Well I think we all kind of forget that the 3DS can do that in the first place. So right, right now this is, I think, kind of a harder title to play legitimately but it's one that is absolutely worth it.
6070000	6078000	The easiest way probably the Wii U Virtual Console second easiest probably 3DS Virtual Console, and there's not really a third way presently.
6078000	6087000	Alright well there it is, your classic game of the week, Demon's Crest, great choice, underrated soundtrack, all those things you already mentioned, it's great.
6087000	6097000	Before we get back to the live show tonight, Spike, I know you co-host a show with our pal Slidekick called gamebuoy.org video game podcast.
6098000	6108000	And you've been on a little bit of a hiatus but you're kind of like, you're back, you're like back and bigger and better than ever, right? Tell us a little bit about gamebuoy.
6108000	6124000	That's correct, in fact we'll be recording an episode either later today or tomorrow night, but gamebuoy is your sort of weekly, we're still working on our schedule, but we are your port of call for gaming news and views that maybe aren't on your radar but most definitely should be.
6125000	6139000	And what that means in practical terms is we like to take games and news stories that we think maybe aren't getting enough attention or getting enough light or viewpoints, you know, alternative takes that we are just maybe not seeing yet enough light.
6139000	6153000	And we sort of try to shine a light on those things and you know just sort of make the gaming space a little more equitable for everybody and ideally, you know, just maybe talk about some serious issues while enjoying our weird hipster games.
6153000	6161000	I love it, great pitch and it's a great show, I do, I highly recommend it and I'm not just saying that because you guys are my buddies but that's part of it too for sure.
6161000	6172000	Well thanks for that, I do truly appreciate your support, we wouldn't even do what we do if not for Orange Land Radio, y'all really inspired us and made our lives better.
6173000	6187000	Oh stop, thank you so much, that's the ultimate compliment. Well Spike, thank you for being on Orange Land Radio tonight and highlighting one of your faves here for the Classic Game of the Week, I know Dark Soccer would be very proud and best of luck with everything over at gamebuoy.org.
6187000	6199000	Gamebuoy.org, thank you so much, thank you for having me, have a happy Easter and to the OL Army, I love y'all, I hope to see y'all over on the SS Buoy and thank you for having me.
6200000	6212000	Alright thanks again very much to Spike for helping out with the Classic Game of the Week while Dark Soccer was unavailable, I was hoping to bring in some more guests, I know it's fun when you and I get to do it but it's also really fun to let some of our friends of the show do that.
6212000	6224000	So obviously we don't like not having Jamie here but you know, breaks and vacations, those types of things are going to happen so big thanks to Captain Spike over at Game Buoy for stepping in with the game.
6225000	6237000	I've known Spike for some time, over 10 years, probably much longer and I already knew Demon's Crest was one of his favorite games, I was just more surprised Jamie had never picked that one herself quite frankly but it's a good pick, it's a very good pick.
6237000	6250000	And one of those games that wasn't super well reviewed when it came out as we kind of addressed there in the clip but definitely has things that feel influential in games that were after it, it was really a whole package of a game.
6250000	6261000	And I noticed in our chat She-Hulk says, looks fun, I'm sold on it, and yeah, I think Spike would be very happy to hear that, that you're sold on it.
6261000	6268000	Alright, well let's get back into some rapid fire news and talk about some other news going around around the industry this week.
6268000	6288000	Yes, and as alluded to in the classic game segment, there is a brand new mod for BSNES that allows HD Mode 7, so it actually improves the quality of Mode 7 up to 4 times horizontally and vertically.
6288000	6292000	Which we referenced in the bit there because Demon's Crest used that, yeah.
6292000	6305000	And it looks quite good, so they have several comparison screenshots showing everything from Pilotwings, Super Mario Kart, F-Zero, and just the difference is pretty crazy.
6305000	6317000	Yeah, over at our Discord, a cheap plug for vognetwork.com slash Discord, some folks had posted articles about it and I was looking at some of the screenshots that they were posting too, it just looks like the F-Zero one you've got up right now, the F-Zero.
6317000	6326000	Oh my gosh, it looks great. I mean, for a Super Nintendo game, it's not suddenly going to make it 8K, but it's like, wow, you really see the difference.
6326000	6336000	Yeah, so it does look quite a bit different, especially with Mario Kart where the whole game was pretty much just Mode 7, so it does look pretty nice.
6336000	6348000	So you can go check that out, they had a link on the emulator, or emulation subreddit on Reddit there, so I'm sure you can find it, or Google, you know, and check it out.
6348000	6354000	Yeah, BSNES version 107.1 Beta 1, the HD Mode 7, so looks cool.
6354000	6375000	And then another game that might benefit from enhanced resolution, Minecraft. Still no 4K output for it, or HD or version with better lighting and stuff, but we're going to be getting that movie at some point soon.
6375000	6384000	So, March 4th, 2022, Warner Brothers and Mojang will release Minecraft the Movie. They said it's about a teenage girl and her unlikely group of adventurers.
6384000	6385000	Oh, so it's not even Steve.
6385000	6395000	Yes, it's after the malevolent Ender Dragon sets out on a path of destruction, they must save their beautiful blocky overworld.
6395000	6402000	And unfortunately, I know that they've had a change of director and writers on this, so...
6402000	6405000	Yeah, things changed hands a few times at this point.
6405000	6409000	Yeah, so we'll have to see what it's like when it comes out.
6409000	6417000	Well, moving on to other news happening around the world, Mortal Kombat 11 is out, is that this week or next?
6417000	6418000	It's next.
6418000	6421000	Yes, it's pretty soon though, and I think early retail copies...
6421000	6423000	I'm sorry, this week, this coming week.
6423000	6430000	This coming week. So, but the retail copies are already making their way out there, so of course, you know, early copies are leaking and so forth.
6430000	6440000	And apparently what happened is that the Switch version of Mortal Kombat 11, apparently the Switch version, some data miners went to town on the Switch version and guess what?
6440000	6448000	Figured out all the DLC characters already. So not only did we get the whole roster spoiled for us, but now we know all the DLC characters.
6448000	6449000	So at your own risk?
6449000	6450000	Allegedly, yeah.
6451000	6461000	Well, allegedly, but like, I don't, like, this is a pretty solid way of doing it. So anyway, if you don't want to spoil yourself, just mute for about 30 seconds. I am going to read the list here real quick.
6461000	6465000	The list includes Shang Tsung, Joker, I'm assuming that's...
6465000	6467000	Probably not Persona 5 Joker.
6467000	6468000	Probably not Persona 5 Joker.
6469000	6473000	Nightwolf, Sindel, Terminator, that's pretty rad.
6473000	6476000	Spawn, Ash, that's very rad.
6476000	6479000	Fujin and Shiva, so not to be found.
6479000	6484000	Molina, unfortunately, it looks like Molina really, really is dead, so she won't be coming back.
6484000	6488000	But that's pretty cool about Fujin. I don't think he's been in a game since, like, what...
6488000	6492000	Well, Mortal Kombat Annihilation, I think everybody was in that, but like, I don't remember him since 4.
6492000	6495000	He was the Air God, like Raiden's the Thunder God, so...
6495000	6497000	Yeah, so very, very interesting.
6497000	6498000	Ash is awesome.
6498000	6499000	Yeah, heck yeah.
6499000	6507000	So, alright, well, we'll see if that holds true or not. It's going to be interesting to see how they respond to it.
6507000	6519000	Anyway, also, something to talk about is the upcoming Final Fantasy concert, specifically a Final Fantasy VII concert.
6519000	6526000	This Final Fantasy VII official concert, a symphonic reunion, is going to take place on June 9th in LA.
6526000	6529000	Hmm, what else is happening right around that time frame in LA?
6529000	6532000	A lot of people will be there for in the game industry. Oh, yes, E3.
6532000	6536000	What's happening during E3, okay, or right around, well, June 9th is the same day as...
6536000	6537000	Bethesda and Microsoft.
6537000	6541000	Yeah, so basically this is happening at the same time as Bethesda's conference.
6541000	6547000	And you know what's funny? I remember at my very, it was my very first E3, my very first one,
6547000	6553000	Jason, who does our voiceovers here, and he's a great guy who helps out so much behind the scenes here at OLR.
6553000	6561000	Him and I went to the first Dear Friends, like the first Final Fantasy concert that was at the Walt Disney symphonic thing.
6561000	6566000	That was the first E3 we went to, so that was like, that was a while ago, it was probably about 15 years ago at this point.
6566000	6572000	So it's kind of interesting they're doing this again kind of all these years later, but this one is specifically for Final Fantasy VII.
6572000	6579000	So it will, they're boasting a massive orchestra, over 100 musicians, HD video projection of all the games.
6579000	6585000	Arnie Roth is conducting, which I remember he did the one like 15 years ago, so he's still doing it, so that's great.
6585000	6592000	They're going to be doing, the tickets are on sale now if it's not already sold out, but they went on sale yesterday.
6592000	6597000	And get this, they start at $77.77.
6597000	6599000	Get it? Because of Final Fantasy VII.
6599000	6604000	Anyway, if you're going to be in LA and want to check out that concert, I'm sure a lot of people will be wanting to go to that.
6604000	6612000	It'll be interesting to see if maybe any CDs or other types of official soundtracks, digital soundtrack, if nothing else, on Spotify, Apple Music, things like that.
6612000	6614000	Makes its way out there, it'll be pretty cool.
6614000	6620000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some video games that are going to be coming a little sooner than the Final Fantasy VII remake.
6620000	6625000	Well, this week we've got Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen on the Nintendo Switch.
6625000	6630000	Mortal Kombat 11 on PC, Switch, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
6630000	6634000	A game called Cytus Alpha on Nintendo Switch.
6634000	6641000	Let's see, Imperator Rome, it looks like.
6641000	6643000	That's going to be on PC.
6643000	6648000	Steam World Quest, Hand of Gilgamesh on the Nintendo Switch.
6648000	6654000	And Umehara Kawase Fresh, that's also on Switch.
6654000	6658000	Box Boy and Box Girl, that's on Switch.
6659000	6661000	Days Gone on Playstation 4.
6661000	6663000	Oh hey, finally that's coming out.
6663000	6667000	Finally check one off the list of games that they show us at every E3.
6667000	6669000	That's finally making its way out.
6669000	6671000	That's out on Playstation 4.
6671000	6681000	And last but not least, Super Meat Boy Forever on PC, Linux, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android.
6681000	6683000	No Mac.
6683000	6691000	Speaking of games they show us every E3, what did you think about that buzz, rumor, people on the internet speculating,
6691000	6696000	what do you think about all that talk that Death Stranding might actually end up on Playstation 5 at this point?
6696000	6700000	I don't think it will end up on Playstation 5.
6700000	6703000	We'll see. I had to ask, sorry.
6703000	6705000	I mean, it'll be disappointing if it is.
6705000	6709000	Alright, let's move on and take a look at Japanese releases, then I'll have Loki take care of Europe.
6709000	6716000	So over in Japan this week, several games still coming out this week, even though I think Golden Week is next cycle,
6716000	6719000	but we still may be trying to get all the games out before then.
6719000	6724000	Eve Rebirth Terror is out this week in a regular limited edition on the Playstation 4.
6724000	6730000	The Starlink Starter Edition, yeah, is finally coming out in Japan on the Playstation 4.
6730000	6733000	I didn't realize they had to wait for it, but I guess they did.
6733000	6736000	Maybe they're just taking all the unsold ones here and putting them out in Japan, I don't know.
6736000	6740000	Anyway, that's not what they're doing, it's localized I'm sure.
6740000	6745000	Satsujin Tantei Jack the Ripper comes out in Japan this week as well.
6745000	6750000	And guess what, Days Gone is the same date that we get it, as well as I believe Europe.
6750000	6756000	That is also out this week in Japan, so if you're looking forward to Days Gone over there, this is your chance.
6756000	6762000	I should also mention the Nintendo Switch releases this week because they have some big stuff on Japan this week, actually quite a bit, wow.
6762000	6767000	Cytus Alpha is out this week, Starlink Battle for Atlas, also in Japan this week.
6767000	6775000	Sword Art Online, Hollow Realization, a deluxe edition supporting several different languages is out this week in Japan on the Switch.
6775000	6787000	Dragon's Dogma, Dark Arisen, and probably the biggest title here, the Final Fantasy XII Zodiac Age Switch release is out this week in Japan, so that is on April 25th.
6787000	6795000	Also, that Jack the Ripper game I referenced a moment ago, also out this week, there's a new Yu-Gi-Oh! game, Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution.
6795000	6799000	Konami is still putting out Yu-Gi-Oh! games, so that's out in Japan as well as this week.
6799000	6808000	And if you need something maybe a little less stressful, Pixel Puzzle Pack 3-in-1 from Rainy Frog is out this week.
6808000	6811000	So there you go, that's what Japan looks like. How about Europe?
6812000	6817000	Europe, we have Mortal Kombat 11 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
6817000	6820000	The Wizards on PlayStation 4.
6820000	6823000	Bomber Crew on PlayStation 4 and Switch.
6823000	6826000	Dragon Marked for Death on the Switch.
6826000	6828000	And Days Gone on PlayStation 4.
6829000	6837000	Alright, so pretty busy week, especially with the always-rumored, always-speculated Days Gone.
6837000	6842000	I mean, you know, obviously we knew they were actually making it, but it's like, whoa, it's finally here. Finally.
6842000	6848000	And actually, I'm sorry to correct myself, because I just assumed that it was out at the same time.
6848000	6855000	Mortal Kombat 11 is only out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next week. The Switch version doesn't come out until May 9th.
6855000	6856000	Is that a Europe thing?
6856000	6857000	That's a Europe thing.
6858000	6863000	Interesting, I wonder what... Boy, Nintendo. I wasn't kidding earlier, Nintendo really does hate you guys, I'm sorry.
6863000	6866000	Alright, anyway, I wonder what that's about.
6866000	6871000	Alright, AkumaJP is confirming, because I know he's over in Japan, Golden Week.
6871000	6876000	We have 10 days holiday this year, so, yeah, all these games are coming out in a bit.
6876000	6879000	It's kind of like Christmas for us, in a way. You got all these holidays back to back to back.
6879000	6885000	So, what's happening, it's like they're getting all the games out before everybody's gonna be home for an extended period of time.
6885000	6888000	That makes sense. Alright, anyway, let's go to the emails.
6888000	6895000	Every week, you guys email us, participate at orangelandtrady.com, and we read our favorite emails and respond to them here live on the air.
6895000	6900000	So, again, if you want to email us, participate at orangelandtrady.com, and we actually have quite a few emails this week.
6900000	6902000	Well, three, that's a lot for us, so we're gonna...
6902000	6903000	Better than none.
6903000	6907000	That's right, it's better than none, so it means you all get spared a week of Drag Race talk, and I had a lot I could've talked about this week.
6907000	6908000	But, nope, we're gonna go to emails.
6908000	6910000	I appreciate it.
6910000	6914000	So, Loki can start by thanking Robert M. for this first email, who says,
6914000	6919000	I just got to the part of my music library with Anamanaguchi, the chiptune artist, right?
6919000	6920000	Yes.
6920000	6927000	And thought the title Airbrushed RAC Remix looked familiar, but couldn't place it until I actually heard it.
6927000	6931000	I instantly recognized it from when I tried out LittleBigPlanet Racing.
6931000	6935000	Sony really hasn't done much with the character Sackboy, who raises the question,
6936000	6942000	Who's your favorite video game character who is fundamentally designed to be a blank slate?
6942000	6944000	That's a tricky question.
6944000	6948000	The only other example I can come up with is Steve from Minecraft.
6948000	6950000	Does his name still use the question mark?
6950000	6952000	I prefer to keep it to myself.
6952000	6957000	I assume Commander Shepard from Mass Effect is too much his own personality to fit the concept,
6957000	6962000	and I would correct you, because for some people, Commander Shepard is very much her.
6962000	6966000	So, I think Shepard works as a blank slate character, so to speak.
6966000	6970000	It just depends. I think it kind of depends what you mean by blank slate.
6970000	6973000	Do you mean a character that you're really kind of designing to be your own,
6973000	6978000	or do you just mean a character that you kind of paint up and costumeize and all these sorts of things?
6978000	6981000	So, that is from Robert M.
6981000	6986000	Well, mine would have to be...
6986000	6990000	Well, it depends on which game you're referring to, because in the earlier games,
6990000	6995000	he was the player, but in the later games, he's the boss.
6995000	6997000	So, Saints Row.
6997000	6999000	Bobby Black Wolf called it in chat.
6999000	7001000	There is Saints Row for you, of course.
7001000	7002000	Yes, of course.
7002000	7003000	Favorite blank slate character?
7003000	7005000	I don't know. I mean...
7005000	7008000	Really, it's Troy Baker. He's my favorite blank slate character.
7008000	7011000	I play so many MMOs.
7011000	7016000	I kind of feel like the generic MMO archetype is kind of like my favorite blank slate character.
7016000	7019000	I do really like the characters that I roll in different MMOs,
7019000	7023000	both World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, XI, you name it.
7023000	7025000	I've always enjoyed MMO characters.
7025000	7028000	I mean, I'm not really the type to go and write a backstory to my character and all that,
7028000	7031000	but some people do that and really get into it,
7031000	7035000	and that's a really big blank slate for some people as MMOs.
7035000	7038000	Anything else that comes to mind, Loki?
7038000	7040000	I guess the...
7042000	7044000	Dragonborn, Skyrim.
7044000	7046000	Skyrim? Okay, yeah.
7046000	7049000	I was going to read some answers from chat.
7049000	7051000	AkumaJP suggested Elder Scrolls.
7051000	7053000	AkumaJP also said Fable.
7053000	7054000	That's a good answer.
7054000	7059000	Fable was kind of infamous for that, especially when we got into Fable 2, especially in 3.
7059000	7061000	And then, let's see, Questbuster says,
7061000	7064000	any RPG where you make your own character.
7064000	7065000	To be fair, there are a ton...
7065000	7070000	I mean, so many RPGs where you make the hero yourself in your own making.
7070000	7073000	Johnny Wu-Fei suggests Dark Souls.
7073000	7078000	So, for some people that like those insane difficulty type of games, yes, certainly.
7078000	7081000	So, yeah, those are some good answers, guys.
7081000	7083000	So, there you go. Thanks for the email.
7083000	7086000	Next email from Rettertainment.
7086000	7088000	Hello, peoples.
7088000	7090000	By the way, I love this because the subject is
7090000	7093000	weird shit you've seen at a con, so we know where this is going, right?
7093000	7095000	So, here we go from Rettertainment.
7095000	7100000	Hello, peoples. I'm currently at FanX Salt Lake Comic Convention,
7100000	7104000	which is what they call it now that San Diego has apparently gotten the trademark on a common term.
7104000	7107000	Well, they can't stop me from saying it, so I'll say Comic-Con Salt Lake City.
7107000	7109000	Is that what they call it? Salt Lake Comic-Con?
7109000	7110000	That's what they used to call it.
7110000	7111000	But, okay.
7111000	7115000	I've been passing by a booth on the vendor floor all day,
7115000	7118000	which is selling something that I've never seen in real life,
7118000	7120000	much less on sale in the real world.
7120000	7125000	This makes me wonder, what's the weirdest fucking thing you've seen at a convention?
7125000	7129000	Can you top a wide selection of waifu pillowcases?
7129000	7133000	And we got a picture to go along with it of, I think if I just...
7133000	7135000	I'm doing the technology, sorry.
7135000	7138000	And unfortunately, I can't show it. It's a very low resolution image anyway.
7138000	7141000	But you can see there's all these pillowcases that just have, you know,
7141000	7145000	waifu maids, costumes, catgirl costumes, and everything you would expect.
7145000	7146000	It's not that weird.
7146000	7148000	I know, I'm kind of like, that's kind of normal.
7148000	7150000	But yeah, if you don't go to conventions a lot, you probably don't see that sort of thing.
7150000	7154000	They sell, I think Bioware might even officially be doing it.
7154000	7155000	There's like a Garris one now.
7155000	7158000	Because you know that got posted to Jamie's Facebook wall like five times.
7158000	7159000	Yes, I saw that, yeah.
7159000	7162000	So, it's not just waifu maids.
7162000	7164000	I mean, I thought it like, if you're saying weird stuff,
7164000	7167000	I thought you're gonna have like dragon dildos or something like that, you know.
7167000	7172000	That's kind of weird, but even that's not that weird anymore.
7172000	7176000	I honestly, I thought, because I laughed when I first saw this for the first time.
7176000	7179000	I want to say it was at PAX, actually.
7179000	7185000	Is I saw those mouse pads, but the part, the wrist rest part are boots.
7185000	7186000	Oh, the booty mouse.
7186000	7187000	The booty mouse pads.
7187000	7190000	I think those are commonplace now, but the first time I ever saw one of those was at a convention.
7190000	7195000	And what's funny, now where I think it's funny, now obviously it's a lot of the same waifu stereotypes
7195000	7199000	that you see like on those mouse pads, but now you're starting to see really funny shit.
7199000	7203000	I've seen a Deadpool one where it's Deadpool boobs.
7203000	7204000	That's awesome.
7204000	7208000	And then I saw one, not that long ago, online somewhere where somebody took Reaper from Overwatch
7208000	7214000	and made a mouse pad with Reaper, but with the giant cleavage.
7214000	7219000	And that's the stuff I think is funny, is when you take those sorts of stereotypes
7219000	7223000	and apply them to characters that were not meant to be stereotyped in that way,
7223000	7225000	but that's what makes them funny.
7225000	7227000	So, I mean, well Deadpool is...
7227000	7233000	I don't know, like some of the early anime conventions I went to,
7233000	7236000	we used to hang out with some of the artists at the artist's row or whatever,
7236000	7243000	and I remember talking with one of them and we were there when they were talking about
7243000	7247000	some of the weird requests and commissions that they got,
7247000	7250000	and there was one that someone had to do a...
7250000	7256000	I think it was a sexy Stalin or sexy Abraham Lincoln or something like that,
7256000	7257000	and that was kind of funny.
7257000	7262000	I had to pull this up because somebody in chat mentioned at the ACT DEV said there's an Isabelle,
7262000	7266000	but instead of it being breasts, it's fruit from Animal Crossing.
7266000	7268000	So it's Isabelle like holding up fruit.
7268000	7269000	At least that's wholesome.
7269000	7272000	Yeah, it's very wholesome, but it's the same idea.
7272000	7276000	To get that for like Jamie and just wrap it up and so she'd think that it's like boobs and...
7276000	7278000	Oh my, oh that's a good idea.
7278000	7280000	Shh, don't tell her, don't tell her. We're gonna do it.
7280000	7281000	We're gonna prank her with that gift.
7281000	7283000	But she'd love it because it's Animal Crossing, right?
7283000	7284000	Yeah.
7284000	7286000	Or, I'm sure there's a Geras.
7286000	7288000	Is there a Geras one? Hold on, I gotta Google that.
7288000	7289000	Fill time.
7289000	7290000	Alright.
7290000	7292000	While you're shopping online there.
7294000	7297000	Yeah, I mean, that's the only weird thing I could think of.
7297000	7299000	No, I didn't find a Geras boob.
7299000	7301000	Just a heart-shaped mouse pad with Geras.
7302000	7303000	Anyway.
7306000	7308000	You knew that's something I had to look for.
7308000	7311000	ActDeftInChat says those mouse pads are actually really great for your wrist.
7311000	7317000	I mean, all joking aside, yes, that's the type of mouse pad I use at work.
7317000	7325000	And not the booby ones, but obviously just the very generic like Office Depot type of like gel pad and mouse pad type of thing.
7325000	7327000	They really are great to use.
7327000	7328000	So, anyway.
7329000	7331000	Moving on, we got one more email tonight.
7331000	7333000	Thank you very much, Redertainment, for that email.
7333000	7337000	We got one more email tonight from frequent contributor YYR.
7337000	7339000	Always good to hear from him.
7339000	7343000	Hello, LR. Just wanted to say hello and offer my thoughts on last week's show.
7343000	7345000	There was a piece of Destiny 2 news.
7345000	7352000	Bungie messed up and offered some items on non-PlayStation platforms that were still supposed to be timed PlayStation exclusives.
7352000	7361000	Players who obtain these items simply can't use them until the exclusivity window closes.
7361000	7368000	You suggested that players could consider filing a lawsuit over the fact that they are able to obtain items that can't be used.
7368000	7369000	I feel like I didn't...
7369000	7372000	No, I think we said it would be ridiculous to do that.
7372000	7376000	No, I think I said, how long until this is going to happen?
7376000	7379000	More like one of those, we live in this type of society.
7379000	7381000	But I said, you know, it's not going to probably happen.
7381000	7383000	Or I wouldn't be surprised if...
7383000	7388000	Because by the time that they do end up filing a lawsuit or it goes through, it's already going to be out and who cares.
7388000	7391000	Or who knows, maybe I did say it, I don't know.
7391000	7397000	If Bungie were to simply let players use these items, I believe that a lawsuit absolutely would happen.
7397000	7401000	Only it would come from Sony, who would be suing Bungie for breach of contract.
7401000	7405000	I am sure they paid a pretty penny to put the PlayStation logo all over the marketing.
7405000	7411000	And to get that item, exclusivitsity, you need to stop using that word in emails.
7411000	7413000	I don't know why it trips me up every time.
7413000	7415000	Exclusivity?
7415000	7419000	Exclusivity.
7419000	7421000	I don't know why I can't say it.
7421000	7423000	It's like my Achilles heel of talking.
7423000	7429000	I can talk for like 10 hours a day and I often do, but that's the one word that will slaughter me.
7429000	7433000	Anyway, that word is officially banned from emails. Don't use it.
7433000	7439000	You can say exclusive window, exclusiveness, exclusive time, you can use any other combination.
7439000	7445000	If they're not getting what they paid for, I'm sure they'd get their lawyers on it right away.
7445000	7451000	So as stupid as it sounds that players obtain items they can't use, I believe there's a good enough reason why not.
7451000	7458000	Look, it's not that I disagree with you, but the problem is here we are siding with the corporation.
7458000	7465000	And it's not that what you're saying is wrong, but I also just kind of feel like, hello, it was a mistake.
7465000	7470000	They closed up the mistake as fast as they could in good faith and stopped selling the items.
7470000	7474000	Sony should, because of that reason, just let it fucking slide in good faith.
7474000	7476000	Mistakes fucking happen.
7476000	7479000	Do you think Sony's never made online mistakes before in their life?
7479000	7484000	So that's kind of like ultimately the point I was getting at is that, you know what, let it fucking go.
7484000	7493000	Because, again, if people bought something that they ultimately can't turn around and use, that's where I kind of think people are going to be like, this is fucked up.
7493000	7495000	Like, this isn't my fault.
7495000	7499000	So it just kind of sucks that we're siding on the side of the consumers.
7499000	7502000	I'm not faulting your logic.
7502000	7508000	You make a very logical argument, and it is ultimately what's probably going to persevere in this scenario.
7508000	7511000	But I just feel like it's fucked up.
7512000	7515000	As a gamer, don't I get to complain about things that are fucked up?
7516000	7517000	Alright, anyway.
7518000	7519000	Moving on.
7519000	7521000	Because there's more to this email.
7521000	7522000	So YYR continues on.
7522000	7524000	I'll just mention a couple more things.
7524000	7527000	First, yes, Jackal is awesome.
7527000	7529000	That was last week's soundtrack of the month.
7529000	7533000	My father and I both played the heck out of that on the NES.
7533000	7536000	Years later, I tore through the whole thing, and I still enjoy the game today.
7536000	7538000	And yes, the music is fantastic.
7538000	7540000	Finally, don't worry.
7540000	7544000	Buzzer is still on the air, running the same old game show as usual.
7544000	7546000	You did worry me a bit for a minute, though.
7546000	7551000	They are streaming from their website 24-7 at buzzerplay.com.
7551000	7554000	So try that on the web browser on your favorite devices.
7555000	7557000	But they're done on Twitch.
7557000	7559000	That's unfortunate.
7559000	7563000	The thing I liked about Twitch, though, is all the portability, because I can watch that on the PlayStation 4.
7563000	7565000	I can watch that on the Xbox One.
7565000	7570000	I mean, sure, I could watch it in a browser window on my PC, on a tablet, on my phone.
7570000	7572000	I could do all those things.
7572000	7574000	I'm only losing it, I guess, on the consoles.
7574000	7576000	But I thought it was kind of a fun thing to have on Twitch.
7576000	7580000	I liked having something to host when literally nothing else was streaming.
7580000	7585000	I could always fall back on 70s game shows, and now that's gone.
7585000	7587000	Oh, well. Thanks for the update, nonetheless.
7587000	7589000	I'm glad the channel is still around.
7589000	7593000	I guess there's just always Bob Ross.
7593000	7595000	That's true. There's always Bob Ross.
7595000	7599000	Or, God, they're probably still running the old Pokemon stuff.
7599000	7602000	I was also going to say, I'm sure there's probably rights issues.
7602000	7605000	You know, when things, you know, we want to get into legal talk again.
7605000	7608000	There's probably rights issues, because I know Buzzer recently got, like, Supermarket Sweep.
7608000	7612000	Well, they were never showing that on Twitch, because they probably didn't have the rights to be able to do it on Twitch.
7612000	7617000	I'm sure if they are just putting out there on their own site what they're putting out over the air,
7617000	7619000	they're probably more allowed to do that.
7619000	7624000	And so they're probably actually able to show more game shows doing them on their own website.
7624000	7627000	But I still liked it on Twitch. Anyway, that's it for now.
7627000	7629000	I'll have a few announcements soon.
7629000	7630000	Ooh.
7630000	7631000	We always hear...
7631000	7632000	Oh, my gosh.
7632000	7633000	Enjoy hearing stuff from YYR.
7633000	7637000	Hopefully it involves fluorescence and helicopters.
7637000	7639000	Just kidding. I'll look forward to whatever it is.
7639000	7642000	So please look forward to those. Have a great week.
7642000	7644000	We sure will, YYR. Thank you for the email.
7644000	7651000	And if you want to send an email in the future, you can send an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7651000	7657000	Pixel Kvaka says, they did have a marathon, a Supermarket Sweep, on Twitch a while ago.
7657000	7659000	I think when they got the show.
7659000	7660000	Oh, I didn't realize that.
7660000	7666000	YYR says, I listened to VOG Network Radio and my Xbox One browser when it existed.
7666000	7669000	Yeah, Xbox One, I think, also had TuneIn, if I'm not mistaken.
7669000	7672000	Because I still remember listening on my Xbox One as well.
7672000	7677000	Regardless, now Twitch, obviously, I think Twitch is even easier in that capacity.
7677000	7681000	But yeah, you could listen to the old Shoutcast and a lot of different things.
7681000	7683000	But it's the future, y'all.
7683000	7685000	So anyway, there you go.
7685000	7687000	That's it for our mailbag this week.
7687000	7691000	Again, we hope we get more over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7691000	7694000	Let's get to some more news stories and then we'll see if we get any calls on Discord tonight.
7694000	7698000	So apparently there is an SNK investors event in South Korea.
7698000	7702000	And the exec, I'm going to butcher this name.
7702000	7713000	But it looks like Jizihui had reported that they're in the planning stages for Neo Geo 2 and Neo Geo 3.
7713000	7719000	Apparently that these are not going to be successors of the Neo Geo Mini that they did.
7719000	7723000	Also that there's a new Metal Slug in development as well.
7724000	7730000	So that's interesting that they're going to come out all of a sudden with new game consoles.
7733000	7735000	And they're saying, what other stuff?
7735000	7739000	This is kind of translated so I'm not really understanding a lot of it.
7739000	7743000	But they're talking about VR and blockchain or something that they're interested in as well.
7743000	7744000	Oh boy!
7744000	7746000	Everybody's interested in blockchain.
7748000	7752000	Yeah, interesting though to see what comes of this.
7752000	7754000	I'm surprised that they would even see it too.
7754000	7757000	And we're developing a console and the sequel to that console.
7757000	7760000	Plus the fact that we're talking about the Neo Geo.
7760000	7764000	We're not talking about something like PlayStation where you know they're already developing the next one.
7764000	7766000	The one before it comes out.
7766000	7769000	Is it just everybody getting into the console market nowadays?
7769000	7770000	You got Atari.
7770000	7772000	Whatever happened to the Atari console?
7772000	7773000	Is that ever coming out?
7773000	7774000	It's probably still a thing.
7774000	7776000	Well it's kind of like Intellivision.
7776000	7778000	It's quiet on that front.
7778000	7780000	I thought they've announced a date next year.
7780000	7785000	But it's in 2020 so of course they're not going to say anything about it until closer to next year.
7787000	7790000	And I imagine Atari's probably in a similar boat.
7790000	7796000	Although honestly, I just feel like based on what we've heard so far the Amico will at least kind of have that.
7796000	7798000	Maybe I haven't seen that before kind of factor to it.
7798000	7803000	But anyway, as far as Neo Geo goes, to me is this more of just banking on classics?
7803000	7805000	Because SNK does really love their classics.
7806000	7812000	When I heard Neo Geo 2, my first thought honestly was it's probably like a classic console.
7812000	7817000	But that they can kind of maybe expand on with maybe some games that they never finished.
7817000	7820000	Or some games that didn't come out in certain regions.
7820000	7823000	Honestly that's what my gut kind of was like.
7823000	7825000	Maybe that's what they're talking about with Neo Geo 2.
7825000	7827000	I just don't see SNK suddenly getting back in the console business.
7827000	7834000	Unless maybe it is a console developed for the Korean market or with a different market in mind.
7834000	7836000	After all that happened in Korea.
7836000	7840000	It would be cool to see them and just develop new games with that old hardware.
7840000	7842000	There's a new Samurai Shodown coming out.
7842000	7847000	But it's on the standard Playstation 4 and all those consoles.
7847000	7849000	I would like to see a next gen Metal Slug.
7853000	7856000	Bobby Blackwell points out by the way since we got off track a little bit there.
7856000	7859000	Pointing out that Intellivision has an E3 press conference this year.
7859000	7860000	Cool.
7860000	7866000	Interesting. I imagine it's probably not on the same level as what Bethesda is doing or anything.
7866000	7868000	It's probably a little bit of a smaller thing.
7868000	7873000	But maybe they're going to show us the first game concept screenshot.
7873000	7875000	I don't know what the hell Bethesda is going to show us this year.
7875000	7876000	Curious.
7876000	7877000	Well I meant Intellivision.
7877000	7880000	No I know. I'm just saying to be on the level of Bethesda.
7880000	7882000	I don't even know what they're going to even show us this year.
7882000	7884000	And the reason why I say that.
7884000	7886000	I'm not trying to poo poo what Intellivision is doing.
7886000	7892000	But we know that Bethesda, Microsoft, we're talking about the AAA level, huge budget games.
7892000	7894000	When Intellivision has kind of come out and said,
7894000	7899000	RMO is lower budget type of titles that are going to be cheaper.
7899000	7904000	So obviously that's why I'm saying the expectation level is going to be very different between those two press conferences.
7904000	7905000	We'll see.
7905000	7906000	Yeah. For sure.
7906000	7910000	Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk about Apple getting into things as well.
7910000	7913000	We talked about that a few weeks ago when Apple did their big conference.
7913000	7918000	They talked about how the Apple games service is going to be coming soon.
7918000	7920000	And we don't know the pricing details on that yet.
7920000	7926000	But there are some rumors about how much Apple may be spending to make this happen.
7926000	7936000	The Financial Times reported that Apple is apparently expected to exceed a half billion dollars in funding for these games.
7936000	7942000	But you know what? We know that Apple's done very well with a lot of the products that they have out there.
7942000	7946000	And so they probably have the cash on hand to be able to do this. And in some ways it's a risk, right?
7946000	7949000	I mean, those shows on Netflix weren't made for free.
7949000	7953000	Somebody had to put up the money to fund that first season of Orange is the New Black, you know?
7953000	7962000	And so this is what it takes to, you know, really get your foot out and to probably secure the exclusive things from studios like Mistwalker.
7962000	7965000	You know, some of those other developers we talked about when we first talked about the Apple arcade.
7965000	7968000	I'm sorry, it was the actual Apple games, Apple arcade.
7969000	7977000	Anyhow, let's see. So yeah, apparently this company is, or Apple's also going to be moving into television and films.
7977000	7981000	We also knew that in the news partnerships. We know that already from the recent iOS update.
7981000	7992000	But yeah, this investment is going to be apparently part of that one billion total that Apple's investing in the whole package, including film and TV and all that.
7992000	7999000	Apparently most of more than the hundred games that are planned for the service have budgets in the millions of dollars.
7999000	8006000	That's a lot of money considering it's mobile stuff. But again, Mistwalker, you know, you got some big makers in there.
8006000	8011000	I'd be, I don't know. I would just have to wait and see what they have.
8011000	8016000	Because I don't think that a lot of stuff is not very memorable.
8016000	8023000	I know that they had, wasn't there a game that was from that game company or something that was supposed to be on their platforms or something like that at one time?
8023000	8028000	And I don't even remember that game coming out or it being a thing.
8028000	8036000	I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that they're pushing that just in that marketplace is just going to get drowned out by everything else.
8036000	8042000	Unless it's like a Pokemon Go or like a big AR game or something like that.
8042000	8047000	Or even mobile games. I don't play a lot of mobile games, so I don't really know what the marketplace even looks like.
8047000	8050000	Well, you say that, but Pokemon Go is open on your phone right now.
8050000	8056000	It's only open so that I can auto-catch everything. I'm not actually playing it. The game's playing itself.
8056000	8058000	You're playing it. You're playing it.
8058000	8060000	It's playing itself.
8060000	8063000	Okay. But my point...
8063000	8069000	And the only reason I have to keep this open is because the app is dumb and it will shut itself off if you turn the screen off.
8069000	8078000	My point is, though, is that I think for the games to really be successful on the mobile format, they have to be designed for a mobile format.
8078000	8083000	That's why Pokemon Go does so well. It was designed completely with the mobile phone concept in mind.
8083000	8090000	But what makes that game interesting is it's a different type of gameplay, because honestly the AR stuff is still a bit new.
8090000	8095000	And so it's different in that sense where that makes it interesting and that's the draw to it.
8095000	8102000	But if it's just, we're going to put a triple-A game on this phone, I don't know.
8102000	8105000	How's it going to control? How's it going to play?
8105000	8109000	They have PUBG and Fortnite stuff on those, but I don't know.
8109000	8111000	In my opinion, it's not fun to play on mobile at all.
8111000	8113000	I don't know.
8113000	8117000	Other people play them on mobile and love them on mobile, so I don't know.
8117000	8120000	Apparently Carson Daly plays PUBG at the Emmys while he's sitting there.
8120000	8122000	Who gives a shit what Carson Daly does anymore?
8122000	8124000	This isn't the 90s anymore. No one gives a fuck.
8124000	8126000	Playing PUBG or whatever.
8126000	8130000	Well, he's on The Voice, which still gets a lot of ratings, believe it or not.
8130000	8135000	But anyway, my point is, a lot of people play that on mobile. I just don't get it.
8135000	8138000	I cannot control a game like that.
8138000	8140000	But maybe I'm just old. I don't know.
8140000	8146000	It's not that you're old, it's just that it's not as good as having physical buttons and actual controls.
8146000	8151000	Yeah, you could do it, but there's no feedback. It's not a good way of doing control.
8151000	8154000	But, if you have a phone, that's kind of all you got.
8154000	8157000	So, I mean, you have to work with what you have.
8157000	8161000	So, that's fine, but I don't prefer games on a phone.
8161000	8166000	I prefer games having some sort of control method that's more traditional, but...
8168000	8171000	I mean, there are other games that get away with it just fine.
8171000	8173000	It's just, I don't know.
8173000	8180000	I just can't see what they're envisioning with this to be so worthwhile that I actually want to pay for this service.
8180000	8184000	It just doesn't seem like it's ever going to get to that level.
8184000	8191000	Well, we have to wait and see when the actual games come out and see how much are they going to charge for it.
8191000	8194000	How many games are we talking? What do these games look like?
8194000	8196000	Are they things I feel the need to play?
8196000	8197000	I mean, it's just still early on.
8197000	8206000	But, I mean, at least it sounds like Apple is really taking the financial risk to really believe in this.
8206000	8207000	So, we'll see what happens.
8207000	8209000	Why can't they do that with a Mac instead?
8209000	8211000	You know, Apple Arcade focused on Mac.
8211000	8213000	Because gaming on Mac is like...
8213000	8215000	Apple Arcade will work on Mac if I recall.
8215000	8217000	Okay, fine. We'll see.
8217000	8221000	But I was going to say, because gaming on Mac is kind of a sore spot right now.
8221000	8226000	Well, and to be fair, Apple Arcade is trying to address that.
8226000	8228000	It is going to be a Mac thing, too.
8228000	8229000	We'll see.
8229000	8230000	Alright.
8231000	8233000	Questbuster in chat says,
8233000	8238000	One thing to also keep in mind, Apple has something like $240 billion in cash on hand to burn if they want to.
8238000	8240000	And that's also very true.
8240000	8242000	Anyhow, let's move on.
8242000	8246000	You have some other updates out of Nintendo, right?
8246000	8256000	Yeah, so there was a report out of Nikkei newspaper talking about some of the future Nintendo Switch hardware and different stuff going on with that system.
8256000	8262000	I know we've kind of talked about rumors that there may be some new Switch consoles coming soon.
8262000	8265000	And I think that's still more along the lines of this as well.
8265000	8274000	So there's a report they said out of the Wall Street Journal that is talking about a smaller, cheaper, more portable Switch model coming this fall.
8274000	8277000	And of course, they confirmed that as well.
8277000	8285000	Nikkei saying that Nintendo is planning on putting out a smaller Switch that is geared towards more portable play.
8286000	8289000	Curious to see how that's going to work.
8289000	8292000	If that just means the screen is going to be smaller.
8292000	8297000	I mean, I don't know how that's going to work with the way the Joy-Cons are set up.
8297000	8298000	But okay.
8298000	8300000	I mean, we'll see what happens.
8300000	8308000	And then also that they are going to be releasing a more powerful Switch model that's going to come out sometime next year.
8308000	8312000	And it's going to be more of a refresh.
8312000	8319000	But they're not sure what exactly the form factor is going to be or how that's going to even work.
8319000	8325000	I mean, it's not unlikely for Nintendo to come out with a refresh to hardware because they do that all the time.
8325000	8327000	But I don't know.
8327000	8329000	It's pretty quick, I think.
8329000	8331000	It's only been out for a few years.
8331000	8335000	And then they also have this other device which I was completely unaware of.
8335000	8340000	Apparently that they were working on since 2014, 2015.
8341000	8349000	That was going to be some sort of sleep tracking device, some wearable that they were working on to monitor your sleep.
8349000	8354000	But it's on indefinite hold since 2016.
8354000	8360000	And now they're saying that they're exiting the health business entirely.
8360000	8362000	So they're not even going to work on it.
8362000	8363000	Which is fine.
8363000	8366000	I sort of feel like they missed the boat on that because so many people do sleep tracking through.
8367000	8371000	And I know they were supposed to be doing something that was not something you actually wore.
8371000	8373000	I don't know how that was supposed to work.
8373000	8375000	I guess if we knew, the device would be out.
8375000	8377000	But I know so many people that use...
8377000	8379000	I know you have a Fitbit. I have Apple Watch.
8379000	8381000	And I don't know if you wear yours when you sleep.
8381000	8382000	I do.
8382000	8387000	But yeah, I wear mine when I sleep and I can actually see, oh, here's how much I spin around at night.
8387000	8389000	Or how my heart rate is.
8389000	8391000	I don't know how accurate some of that is.
8391000	8396000	I think it's pretty decent because I do notice if I let the machine at the gym monitor my heart rate,
8396000	8399000	and then I check out what my watch is doing, it's usually about the same.
8399000	8401000	So I think the watch is measuring.
8401000	8404000	I mean, I don't know Fitbit super well, but I can't imagine it's much different.
8404000	8406000	It's about the same technology-wise.
8406000	8408000	So it's measuring your heart rate and stuff.
8408000	8412000	So it is kind of interesting, especially since I have been trying to get more active lately and been exercising more.
8412000	8416000	It does cause your heart rate to dip more when you sleep at night.
8416000	8418000	Which is supposed to be one of the positive side effects of that.
8418000	8421000	And I can actually see that from the sleep tracking.
8421000	8429000	But anyway, my point is, I think the Apple Watch and the Fitbit and all that other universe kind of beat them to it.
8429000	8435000	I feel like if Nintendo were to come out now and say, we got sleep tracking, it would be like, okay, but I'm already doing that.
8435000	8439000	I mean, now granted, Nintendo was supposed to be something not wearable.
8439000	8440000	But what does that mean?
8440000	8442000	Something you would put next to the mattress or something?
8442000	8445000	I don't know how you would not wear something.
8445000	8448000	It's got to track your breathing and heart rate and stuff.
8448000	8452000	So I don't see how they could do something not wearable.
8452000	8455000	ActDeftInChat says, remember the heart monitor from Nintendo or whatever that was called?
8455000	8457000	The Wii Vitality Sensor.
8457000	8459000	Yep. That was garbage.
8459000	8460000	Well, it never happened.
8460000	8465000	Well, then they also tried the, remember there was the, from Ubisoft.
8465000	8471000	It was the, I want to say they were doing something for Relax, like Wii Relax or something like that.
8471000	8476000	And, but they had some sort of Vitality Sensor thing with Ubisoft as well that they tried.
8476000	8482000	Ubisoft went through a lot of really creative stages where they come up with stuff and then nothing ever come of it.
8482000	8487000	Like for example, they had that relaxation sensor with the breathing exercises.
8487000	8488000	They had laser tag.
8488000	8490000	What the fuck happened to that?
8490000	8491000	Oh yeah.
8491000	8492000	Yeah, exactly.
8492000	8494000	Well, they probably just didn't sell it in the video game aisle.
8494000	8497000	It probably didn't sell very well at all, but yeah, that's the thing.
8497000	8503000	ActDeftInChat suggests the Nintendo Switch sleep tracker was having a screen come on at 1 AM saying, go the fuck to sleep.
8503000	8507000	Maybe if Samuel L. Jackson was doing it, it might be effective.
8507000	8508000	I don't know.
8508000	8509000	Alright.
8509000	8512000	Moving on to more information on the Nintendo Switch.
8512000	8515000	Apparently, the Nintendo Switch may finally be coming out in China.
8515000	8519000	Which, you know, is newsworthy because China is a pretty big market, right?
8519000	8521000	There's a lot of people that live in China.
8521000	8528000	But usually it takes the consoles a little while to come out in China because, you know, China has some strict regulations on, you know, what can be released there.
8528000	8533000	And especially when it comes to, especially if you talk about what's been going on lately with some of the tax rules and things like that.
8533000	8534000	So, it can be tricky.
8534000	8539000	But it should be noted, Microsoft has started selling the Xbox One there within, I think, the past year.
8539000	8541000	And Sony now offers the PlayStation 4.
8541000	8545000	So, Nintendo should be able to offer the Switch soon.
8545000	8553000	Apparently, they are teaming up with Tencent, which has been doing a lot of stuff with gaming in China, to be bringing out the Nintendo Switch there.
8553000	8563000	There has been the game regulators in China have provisionally approved a trial version of New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe.
8563000	8568000	Which, you know, was obviously the Wii U version that came out on Switch about a month ago.
8568000	8570000	Maybe two months ago at this point.
8570000	8571000	So, that's pretty interesting.
8571000	8576000	Nintendo did confirm to Reuters that they have applied for the approval to sell the Nintendo Switch.
8576000	8578000	Of course, it is a long process.
8578000	8580000	So, it will probably take some time.
8580000	8583000	But they are taking those steps to put out the Nintendo Switch in China.
8583000	8587000	So, many more of those consoles perhaps to sell.
8587000	8590000	So, we don't talk about the Chinese market very often.
8590000	8596000	But obviously, with so many people there, you know, even if a console doesn't do so hot here or in Japan.
8596000	8598000	I mean, as the case of the Xbox maybe.
8598000	8601000	Like, the Xbox ain't a factor in Japan at all.
8601000	8604000	But, I don't know what success it's having in China.
8604000	8606000	But, it would be interesting, maybe it's selling more there.
8606000	8610000	If you sell enough there, it can kind of make up for some of the difference, right?
8610000	8611000	Yeah.
8611000	8612000	So, anyhow.
8612000	8613000	Moving on, Loki.
8613000	8617000	We're almost to our call segment, if you want to get on our Discord in the green room.
8617000	8621000	And then mention in Channel Orange's launch radio what it is you'd like to call in about tonight.
8621000	8622000	Alright.
8622000	8634000	So, Ubisoft is going to be donating 500,000 Euro to help rebuild the Notre Dame Cathedral after the fire that happened this week.
8634000	8637000	So, that's pretty awesome that they're doing that.
8637000	8645000	They said, of course, that they stand in solidarity with their fellow Parisians.
8645000	8647000	Or, I guess that's how you say that.
8647000	8653000	And everyone around the world by the devastation the fire caused.
8653000	8656000	And they said it was an integral part of Paris.
8656000	8658000	A city which we are deeply connected.
8658000	8664000	Seeing the monument in peril like this affected us all in light of Monday's events.
8664000	8671000	We'll be denoting the 500,000 Euro to help with the restoration and reconstruction of the cathedral.
8671000	8676000	I was not going to be the one to correct somebody on their pronunciation, but Bobby does confirm it is what I was thinking.
8676000	8677000	Parisians.
8677000	8678000	Parisians.
8678000	8679000	Persians is something very different.
8679000	8680000	No, no.
8680000	8681000	Parisians.
8681000	8682000	Yes, because Paris, obviously.
8682000	8683000	Anyway.
8683000	8684000	Parisians.
8684000	8685000	I thought that's how you...
8685000	8686000	That's alright.
8686000	8689000	Again, I didn't want to correct on pronunciation tonight.
8689000	8691000	There's a word I completely cannot say for some reason, so.
8691000	8696000	But to go along with that, which is kind of nice, is they also have some other stuff.
8696000	8698000	This is where it kind of ties in the gaming a little bit more.
8698000	8710000	Apparently they're offering a free PC copy of Assassin's Creed Unity for a limited time between April 17th and midnight of the 25th.
8710000	8713000	So you have some time to actually do it.
8713000	8720000	So in order to do that, if you haven't already, Ubisoft has a special link that you would follow.
8720000	8729000	So it's register.ubisoft.com slash acu dash notre-dame dash giveaway slash en dash us.
8729000	8730000	That's a big link.
8730000	8731000	So you might just want to Google it.
8731000	8732000	Just Google it.
8732000	8734000	You would sign into your Ubisoft account.
8734000	8740000	If you don't have one already, you would create one and you just add it to the cart and you get it for free.
8740000	8741000	So that's pretty awesome.
8741000	8744000	I did that because I do have a Uplay account for when I play South Park.
8744000	8746000	And also Far Cry.
8747000	8752000	I have not played Assassin's Creed Unity, so it will be interesting to check that out.
8752000	8765000	And then, of course, because of this generosity from Ubisoft, people have taken to Steam to review bomb the Assassin's Creed games.
8765000	8767000	But not in the way you might think.
8767000	8770000	They are putting positive reviews because of that.
8771000	8776000	Basically thanking them for their contribution to the repair of the cathedral.
8776000	8781000	Thanking Ubisoft for giving away Assassin's Creed.
8781000	8786000	And thank you for Uplay and its contributions and all that stuff like that.
8786000	8789000	So is Steam going to be taking down those reviews?
8789000	8793000	Because I know that they try to combat review bombing in the other way.
8793000	8797000	I'd be curious to see how that would probably be not going to do anything.
8797000	8799000	You should write rules or rules, right?
8799000	8802000	Rules or rules, but that's going to be bad press.
8802000	8807000	Well, maybe if the internet would stick to this type of positive review bombs.
8807000	8810000	If you don't like something, just shut up.
8810000	8813000	You can always keep your mouth shut and you can talk about the things you do like.
8813000	8819000	Or if this is allowed, then you know what you need to do the next time you don't like a company.
8819000	8826000	You review bomb their competitors and you give them positive scores because they're not douchebags like this other guy.
8826000	8827000	Sure!
8827000	8829000	Because that apparently is allowed and that'll...
8829000	8833000	Sure, why don't y'all go tweet Nintendo something nice.
8833000	8836000	Thank you for allowing my waifu sex games, Nintendo.
8836000	8838000	You're the best, XO.
8839000	8840000	Reggie forever.
8843000	8844000	Why not?
8844000	8845000	Yeah.
8847000	8851000	They don't allow Balzette, but they'll allow their other waifu sex games.
8851000	8855000	Look, if they are going to positive review bomb things,
8855000	8858000	If it was only that, then that's...
8858000	8865000	So, I'm guessing this is probably a yes, but I'm wondering how many Balzette levels are out there in Smash Brothers.
8866000	8867000	Probably.
8867000	8871000	You're saying a lot of things tonight, I just really wish you wouldn't say.
8871000	8872000	And that's one of them.
8873000	8877000	The other one, Reggie going to Microsoft. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
8877000	8879000	Well, I didn't mean he'd actually work for Microsoft.
8879000	8884000	I mean, he would just go there to kind of like introduce the partnership.
8884000	8885000	Just think it, just think it.
8886000	8893000	I'm going to think it out loud, because how are they going to pick up through the power of podcasting my thoughts if I do not speak them.
8893000	8895000	Oh, because I'm sure they're all listening right now.
8895000	8900000	Alright, well then they'll be excited to hear about this, because I was very excited to hear about this collaboration.
8900000	8907000	That's right, it's a partnership between the Tetris company and Hello Kitty.
8907000	8911000	That's right, so to kind of bring this full circle, because we talked about Tetris at the beginning.
8911000	8915000	There was a tweet from the official Tetris account this week at Tetris underscore official mentioning,
8915000	8923000	You love Tetris, you love Sanrio, now get ready for a brand new online game featuring both on June 3rd.
8923000	8928000	For more information on the Tetris Cross Sanrio partnership, head over to Tetris dot com.
8928000	8931000	And yeah, so that's going to be, I guess, coming out on June 3rd online.
8931000	8934000	So, fun, cute, exciting.
8935000	8940000	It's unfortunate they're going with such a violent route, but crushing Hello Kitty with Tetra-
8940000	8944000	Stop it. You will not be crushing Hello Kitty with anything.
8944000	8951000	It should be noted this is timed for the 35th anniversary of Tetris and the 45th anniversary of Hello Kitty.
8951000	8958000	So, I mean, and it's interesting because this article I'm looking at is suggesting why don't they just put it in Tetris 99 or something.
8958000	8965000	But, you know, Tetris, like I said earlier, Tetris is kind of having a little bit of a renaissance because of things like Tetris 99.
8965000	8969000	And obviously Tetris Effect was a very different way of looking at Tetris.
8969000	8973000	And, you know, Tetris Hello Kitty, well that'll be a thing too.
8973000	8976000	To do a new Tetris Effect level.
8976000	8977000	With Hello Kitty?
8977000	8978000	Yeah.
8978000	8979000	I'd be all about that. Why not?
8979000	8980000	I haven't played that game in a long time.
8980000	8981000	Why not?
8981000	8986000	We're going to go to the listener round table, so if you would like to give us a call, you can join our green room over on Discord.
8986000	8992000	Or, of course, you can also just send us a message in our chat room if you have anything you'd like to ask about or what have you tonight.
8992000	8994000	We can do that as well.
8994000	8998000	So, nobody is wanting to call in yet, but that's alright.
8998000	9003000	Sometimes people are just shy or they might be watching that television show we have to worry about for about five more weeks.
9003000	9005000	And a lot of people say-
9005000	9006000	It's also Easter too.
9006000	9008000	A lot of people say, oh yeah, it is Easter. I guess that's a thing.
9008000	9010000	Doesn't everybody do Easter things in the morning though?
9010000	9012000	Everyone's hungover from 420 yesterday.
9012000	9014000	Oh, let's see. Now that I believe a little more.
9014000	9018000	Anyway, do you have any last minute stories? You had a lot of stuff assembled for tonight's show, didn't you?
9018000	9023000	I guess. I don't know. I was-
9023000	9032000	There was something I saw that Kojima was teasing some stuff about streaming.
9032000	9040000	But I think it was more of just talking on the subject of where he thinks gaming is going to go with the whole stadium stuff.
9041000	9050000	Or stadia. And how that might change gaming with being not really bound by console limitations.
9050000	9057000	I'm still so curious what consoles are going to do to incorporate that sort of technology.
9057000	9059000	Well, what are you talking about?
9059000	9065000	Crackdown 3 has an amazing multiplayer thing where you can destroy the really crappy looking map that they have.
9065000	9071000	Because that was totally worth the power of the Xbox cloud or whatever. Microsoft Azure cloud.
9071000	9075000	It was a disappointment. That's what it was.
9075000	9080000	EA shutting down the last gen servers for Burnout Paradise.
9080000	9084000	Oh yeah, I heard about that too. That seems like a long time running for those servers though.
9084000	9087000	Well, they've got the remaster now, so you can do that.
9087000	9090000	Did you ever get Dangerous Driving? I heard-
9090000	9091000	I didn't.
9091000	9092000	I didn't pick it up yet.
9093000	9100000	I have too many games I'm playing. If I'm going to pick up a game, it's going to be probably Iron Rain, the new Defense Force game.
9100000	9106000	But unfortunately I haven't been able to watch TV because now my wife's gotten into another series.
9106000	9110000	She's now watching Big Love because now we have the HBO app. It's the one about polygamy.
9110000	9112000	Yeah, that show's been off the air for a while.
9112000	9116000	Yeah, forever. But she's now picking it up. She's watching the whole series.
9117000	9125000	So she's doing that. I think at this point I just need to move my PlayStation 4 to my computer monitors because I'm never going to ever get to play anything on it.
9125000	9129000	Bobby Blackwell, by the way, points out 11 years for those Burnout Paradise servers.
9129000	9131000	That's a pretty long time.
9131000	9137000	Especially when you consider it's EA. That's really impressive. Because EA, that's unheard of.
9137000	9144000	So that's pretty good. What else? Which TV show is going to be coming out this year?
9144000	9151000	Is it this year? Well, it seems like a fast turnaround. Last call if anyone wants to call in. Or any questions in our chat.
9153000	9158000	I don't know. I have to see what else I had. I'm not really looking at my showreel stuff here.
9158000	9163000	That's alright. I know I surprised you with that because usually we have somebody waiting.
9163000	9169000	Looking in chat, SJ100Matt says, Loki's wife watches shows on a five-year delay. It happens sometimes.
9169000	9171000	Sometimes I don't discover shows until way later too.
9171000	9176000	Bored. I don't know. I picked up Hulu because she's like, there's nothing to watch on Netflix.
9176000	9180000	I'm like, what are you talking about? There's nothing to watch on Netflix. There's nothing to watch on Netflix.
9180000	9184000	I don't want to watch any of that. Fine. I'll get you Hulu. We'll watch stuff on Hulu.
9184000	9189000	So I've been paying for Netflix and I have CBS All Access, right? Because I have to have Big Brother and Star Trek.
9189000	9193000	And I've got to watch that new Twilight Zone. I really want to see that too. So I have those two.
9193000	9199000	But now, because I have Spotify, and I actually personally, they're not paying me to say this.
9199000	9203000	I really enjoy that platform and it's been great for like music at the gym and things like that too.
9203000	9209000	But now as a Spotify person, you get Hulu. So now I have all three.
9209000	9215000	So yeah, Hulu, we watch mainly just, we were watching South Park. We're watching Family Guy again.
9215000	9219000	Because I miss a lot of, I miss most of South Park because I haven't watched that for seasons.
9219000	9227000	And Family Guy's alright. So we do that. I was trying to get in the Brooklyn 99, but she doesn't want to watch that either.
9227000	9232000	But now with HBO, she remembers, oh yeah, we have HBO because we get it with our cable.
9232000	9237000	And so we've been watching Game of Thrones, which we'll watch that again tonight.
9237000	9248000	But I don't know. It's like, I don't get, I had an opportunity to be able to, when she was tied up with Animal Crossing,
9248000	9252000	to actually get to play console games. And then I just didn't want to at that time.
9252000	9255000	And then now that I do, oh, now she's in a new TV show.
9255000	9257000	Have you thought about getting your wife a booby mouse pad?
9257000	9264000	I don't know if she would want, I don't know what she's got as far as mouse pads and stuff.
9264000	9269000	And she, she uses her laptop, so no real room for a mouse on our couch.
9269000	9270000	Yeah.
9270000	9274000	I've got a mouse pad at home, but I've got one of those gaming ones that's like super long.
9274000	9281000	Because it was mainly just, the thought originally was that everybody's going to be using that desk, not just me.
9281000	9290000	And that, that would save the, because the desk isn't, it's that particle board, but it's got like the fake wood look on the outside.
9290000	9294000	And so I thought, oh, the kids are going to do homework here and they're going to fuck up everything.
9294000	9296000	So this is going to protect the surface of the desk.
9296000	9302000	No, I, no one else uses that desk. I'm the only one that uses it because, you know, even though I built it for my wife,
9302000	9306000	because she wants to do work from home, she's like, ah, yeah, I can.
9307000	9312000	I'm like, Jesus Christ, you know, I built this all for you and now no one wants to use it.
9312000	9317000	So now I use it because I get a triple monitor set up and, um, yeah.
9317000	9321000	All right. Well, that's gonna, that's gonna do it.
9321000	9328000	Uh, wrapping up for the show tonight. Um, I guess, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff going on out there in the world, but I hope you all had a great Easter.
9328000	9333000	Uh, thank you guys so much for tuning into the show tonight. Appreciate it. Um, let's go around.
9333000	9334000	Oh, I did want to mention one more thing.
9334000	9335000	Yeah.
9335000	9341000	I don't know if we talked about it last week, but I was going to say that Konami revealed all the Castlevania games are in the Castlevania.
9341000	9344000	I thought this came up last week, which is why I didn't address it, but I could be wrong.
9344000	9345000	I think they announced some of them.
9345000	9346000	Yeah, all right, go ahead.
9346000	9351000	So Castlevania, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Castlevania the Adventure, which was a Game Boy game.
9351000	9356000	Uh, Castlevania III, Dracula's Curse, Kid Dracula, which I think is the first time coming out over here.
9356000	9364000	Castlevania II, Belmont's Revenge, which is on Game Boy, Super Castlevania IV, and Castlevania Bloodlines, New Generation, Vampire Killer, which is a Mega Drive game.
9364000	9370000	I would be more impressed if they would have like taken that Wii remake they did of Castlevania Adventure and put that out.
9370000	9380000	So I don't know. And I've heard, um, that the, the arcade collection that came out kind of has some problems because like the, um, arcade archive stuff is more well-rounded.
9380000	9387000	It supports things like the Switch being in vertical mode. Nope, Konami arcade thing doesn't. The Konami arcade thing, region, region locks the game.
9388000	9396000	Meaning like if you want to play the Japanese version of Gradius II, which is very different from the American version of Gradius II, you have to buy the Japanese collection.
9396000	9401000	They don't just put both versions. And again, if you get the arcade archives one, it has all that in it.
9401000	9407000	So it sounds like they kind of cut some corners on the collection. So it makes me a little less excited about the Castlevania one.
9407000	9415000	Who would have thought being disappointed by Konami in 2019 again, but here we are.
9415000	9421000	Anyway. All right. So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.
9421000	9426000	Uh, Dark Soccer will be back with us next week in studio. I'm sure she'd say something witty if she were here.
9426000	9433000	Uh, but, uh, we'll, we'll welcome her back to the show next week. So it's just us. So thanks. Thanks for being here tonight, Loki.
9433000	9435000	Uh, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
9435000	9441000	Um, not really. I've been working on, uh, my game.
9441000	9447000	Not much, not much has happened this, this week. I didn't get much done.
9447000	9453000	I was trying to get the camera angle right because the silo game I'm doing, it's, I don't know.
9453000	9459000	It's kind of weird the way I'm doing it because it doesn't really work with the silo game I'm trying to emulate.
9460000	9470000	That was very vague, but it's just, it's hard to figure out how I need to get the camera set up to actually have enough space to do everything and to make it look right.
9470000	9475000	Anyway, I'm sure later on that makes sense, but all right. Fair enough. All right.
9475000	9480000	And then my final thought with apologies to the podcast listeners is going to be a visual for Twitch.
9481000	9488000	Um, it's a, it's a callback to earlier in the show. Oh yes. With the goat safe thing.
9488000	9490000	Yes. Thank you, Logan. We understood. All right.
9490000	9496000	It's for the podcast listeners. All right. That's it everybody. We're off for tonight. Thank you so much.
9496000	9500000	Happy gaming, uh, over the next week. Have fun, stay safe and all that good stuff.
9500000	9506000	Hope you all had a good Easter and we will be back in seven more days to do it all again. Hope to see you then.
9506000	9507000	Good night, everyone.
