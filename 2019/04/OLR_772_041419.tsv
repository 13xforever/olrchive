0	17200	This week, Big Brother is watching you!
17200	20760	Echoes from deep within your Oculus Rift controller as Facebook deploys another shaggy defense
20760	21760	for its actions.
21760	24480	That's just one media titan getting caught on camera again.
24480	27200	Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where
27200	32960	every gamer has a voice.
32960	36720	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
36720	38520	where every gamer has a voice.
38520	44960	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 772 for this April the 14th
44960	47040	of 2019.
47040	52040	My name is Rob Roberts here with all you lovely folks over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network
52040	56600	and on our podcast speed to talk about, you know, video games over the next few hours
56600	60760	with my co-hosts across from me sometimes on cam when she feels like it.
60760	62720	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
62720	63720	Sup.
63720	64720	Hi, how are you?
64720	66720	I have the ache of head.
66720	67720	Oh, I'm sorry.
67720	68720	I meant to put my hat on the screen.
68720	69720	There we go.
69720	70720	Headaches are not good.
70720	71720	There we go.
71720	72720	There's my new hat.
72720	75080	Well, I was hoping you might actually show the, I was hoping you might show the shirt
75080	76240	a little bit too if you're willing.
76240	80520	I, hold on, I'm just reading about Captain Marvel.
80520	83340	Just to tell the story a little bit.
83340	88740	One of our listeners and longtime supporters, Chris, from the Let's Be Legendary podcast,
88740	89740	that's the name, right?
89740	94140	Picked up that shirt for you like 10 years ago and now you're able to put that on again.
94140	95140	You're looking fabulous.
95140	96140	Look at you.
96140	97140	All right.
97140	98140	And I love that you're number zero.
98140	99140	That's fantastic.
99140	100740	So there she is, everybody in the flesh.
100740	101740	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
101740	102740	Yeah, that's me.
102740	103740	All right.
103740	104740	Don't get used to it.
104740	108300	Well, I hope the headache feels better, but joining, that's what drugs are for.
108300	109720	Joining us also in studio.
109720	110900	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
110900	111900	I do feel better.
111900	112900	Thank you for asking.
113460	115460	Did you have a headache too?
115460	117540	No, I was like, but I am the headache.
117540	118700	Oh, you are the headache.
118700	119700	I see.
119700	120700	Um, I got it.
120700	124780	Rob, you actually brought into the studio tonight and we were playing with this like
124780	129300	I have left trash behind minutes before the Bobby Black Wolf show gave us a call there
129300	133340	because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern
133340	137420	at the voice of geeks network, twitch TV slash a VOG network right after the Bobby Black
137420	138780	Wolf show.
138780	142520	And you had brought this in this switch and we were checking that out.
142640	146640	So yes, if there's no strap or anything, you do have to just kind of like hold it up, uh,
146640	147640	and uh, do it this way.
147640	148880	But that's, that's the Nintendo Labo.
148880	149880	Yeah.
149880	155440	A lot of their, um, the toys that they require you to use just the basic headset without,
155440	158600	um, any attachments to it and then a controller.
158600	162640	It's a little awkward because they're like, hold on to the headset and hold onto the controller
162640	163640	at the same time.
163640	168680	It's like, uh, that could have been explained better, but well, I wasn't planning to talk
168680	172240	about this at the top of the show and I know it's kind of dabbing into our gaming weeks
172240	173240	a little bit.
173240	176320	You notice it's, it's not on the little side ticker cause I didn't plan to talk about it,
176320	180620	but since you did bring the Nintendo Labo VR, I'm kind of curious of your impressions
180620	184520	having played with it for as much as you have and putting the whole thing together.
184520	185520	I think it's good.
185520	190040	I'm just surprised how well engineered it is because all the stuff that you put together
190040	192040	is just very solid.
192040	195920	It's just the amount of time that must have taken to actually design all that is just
195920	198800	kind of incredible for a bunch of cardboard for a bunch of cardboard.
198800	199800	Yeah.
199800	200880	It's just, it's really well put together.
200880	204460	I think the thing that's most impressive is that bird attachment.
204460	205460	The bird is pretty cool.
205460	206460	Yeah.
206460	207460	And I don't know, can we show it on Twitch?
207460	209920	And I apologize to folks that are listening to us on the podcast feed, but maybe somebody
209920	212640	will clip this on Twitch for you or something.
212640	215840	Um, because the, the clip stuff on Twitch is, is totally free.
215840	216840	Oh, you took the beak out.
216840	217840	I'll put the beak back.
217840	218840	Okay.
218840	222620	So put the beak back in because, so there's this bird attachment and when you actually
222620	229480	put in the switch controller into the bird controller thing, which you push down to flap
229480	230480	the wings and all this.
230480	232640	It's like a little bird thing.
232640	233640	So there you go.
233640	234640	Okay.
234640	235640	So he's put it back together for us.
235640	239320	So, um, I will read some comments in chat real quick because of course, while we tape
239320	241200	live, we'd love to read comments in our chat room.
241200	242320	There you go.
242320	243320	And so I love that.
243320	248860	So the little, we are, I keep saying we mode, the switch thing becomes like the beak.
248860	251940	And so right now it looks like it's attacking you the way you're flapping the wings.
251940	253000	It's next to you.
253000	254160	But that's, that's what it is.
254160	255240	It's that's smart.
255240	258080	That's a very Nintendo kind of thing to do, isn't it?
258080	259080	Yeah.
259080	260080	Yeah.
260680	261680	Wait, we can't hear you.
261680	262680	You got to remember.
262680	263680	Sorry.
263680	264680	I know you're trying to hold.
264680	265680	Sorry.
265680	266680	Then they have the camera.
266680	267680	And then what's kind of cool is they have it actually click like for the lens.
267680	274280	So you can actually, and then it's got, um, it's got the actual camera, the IR stuff facing
274280	275280	outwards.
275280	279080	So Pokemon snap VR confirmed, uh, no, well not right now.
279080	280520	So in this, they have two modes.
280520	284780	So they have one that you can actually take pictures of fish and then when you take pictures
284780	289880	of this thing that I think is supposed to be a cat, but it's this weird alien cat thing.
289880	295340	And then, um, you can take pictures of Mr. Smoosh and unfortunately it fell apart, but
295340	300000	I have a, uh, there's this, it's supposed to be a snorkel.
300000	305200	So it's a snorkel and what's kind of cool is because the infrared camera's facing out
305200	310680	when you wear it, the fish that's closest to you gets this weird human face.
310680	317320	Not, not like we're not talking about like, you know, um, Seaman human face, but it has
317360	322120	like these weird bug eyes and then anything that you do with your head, the fish mimics.
322120	323440	And so you could take pictures of that.
323440	325760	Oh, it's like those emojis on Apple.
325760	329360	It's weird, but yeah, it's, it's, it's silly.
329360	330360	So whatever.
330360	331360	Okay.
331360	333040	So that's, it's just a very Nintendo thing to do.
333040	337160	So tell us about some of the, okay, so you've obviously shown off some of the cardboard
337160	338400	stuff here in studio.
338400	341880	Um, what about like some of the games that are in it and all these like mini, there's
341880	343400	a lot of games in there.
343400	348960	So they have games for each of the like main games for each of the things that you build.
348960	354400	So like the camera, there's, you know, the, um, you know, take pictures of fish.
354400	358520	There's taking pictures of that weird cat thing, but then there's like these little
358520	361720	mini games that they have in this VR, like toy boxing.
361720	366040	So they have like cannon firing stuff.
366040	371360	There's um, like all sorts of weird little things you can like move around and do little
371360	372420	simple things.
372420	374460	They have, I haven't even delved into it.
374460	375940	There's some, they're actually non VR too.
375940	379140	They have like mixed up stuff like pinball and like weird things.
379140	383540	Um, there's like for each of the toys, there's like a bunch of mini games and then there's
383540	385780	a bunch of main games for it as well.
385780	389420	And then there's videos they have in there so you can watch like 3d videos.
389420	392180	Some are really weird, very Japanese.
392180	397540	Um, there's the whole creation stuff.
397540	401100	There's um, there's a lot, there's a lot.
401100	404540	And they even have like, I didn't even delve into it too much by looked at it.
404540	407980	There's like, build your own FPS, build your own adventure thing.
407980	409140	And like, I'm like, what is this?
409140	410740	I saw that in the previews.
410740	412260	There's a ton of stuff in there.
412260	417160	Um, now dark Sakura, you, I know you don't usually do the VR thing because you know,
417160	418520	you get headaches and motion sickness.
418520	422900	You've talked about before, even when playing first person shooters, but you, the curiosity
422900	424740	took over, you had to peak.
424740	427060	So what did you think for the two minutes you did it?
427060	433500	I watched birds swing around on poles and like, like when those little, hold on, like
433500	434500	that.
434500	435500	Yeah.
435500	439540	And then, um, yeah, like cause everyone who's not watching will really see that I did twisty
439540	440540	fingers.
440540	445220	Um, I w I wanted to knock the blocks over that were forming the menu cause I couldn't
445220	448420	get shit to happen, but I was just hitting the wrong button.
448420	449560	No way to be fair.
449560	454700	We rushed through this to try to, and I was feeling really sick even after the first 30
454700	455700	seconds.
455700	456700	Yeah.
456740	461620	And then my eyes like will un-focus on things and then they won't refocus and then it's
461620	463140	instant vertigo.
463140	466620	But I did notice when you sat down, you still said something about, I want to see the breath
466620	467620	of the wild.
467620	468620	Yeah.
468620	471020	I'd still want to like, just look around and breath of the wild, like tourist mode.
471020	474240	I feel like that's what most people are going to do because the breath of the wild thing
474240	475240	isn't in it yet.
475240	476240	Right?
476240	477380	No, that doesn't come out until next week.
477380	478380	Two weeks.
478380	479380	Right.
479380	480380	So, uh, and I also don't have breath of the wild.
480380	483980	So, you know, you can use my coffee demo for VR.
483980	484980	You got it.
484980	485980	Yeah.
486180	490420	But I imagine most people, like I cannot imagine sitting there trying to actually play breath
490420	491420	of the wild.
491420	493980	I mean, I know you could plug in the joy cons.
493980	497900	Thank you for chat for, you're going to have to, cause there's no way you can hold everything.
497900	502340	I was like, you would, I would be able to even use the, um, the pro controller.
502340	504660	I don't even get sick, emotion sick really.
504660	509860	I mean, well, I don't, I don't like to do VR for more than like 30 minutes.
509860	512720	I just don't like, I have to take a break every now and then, but I think that's kind
512720	513720	of normal.
513720	515660	I think they encourage you to take breaks from for three days.
516300	518700	They say it a lot, even when you're building everything, they're all, why don't you take
518700	519700	a break?
519700	520700	Take a break.
520700	521700	You've been doing this for too long.
521700	522700	Stop.
522700	523700	You earned it.
523700	526700	But anyway, uh, I can only see myself doing the, uh, breath of the wild stuff in short
526700	527700	bursts.
527700	530340	Like, like I would go into a temple and be like, Ooh, pretty look around or climb to
530340	531340	the top of a mountain.
531340	536380	Ooh, that's pretty done, you know, but I guess, you know, if it was a relatively easy thing
536380	539800	for Nintendo to implement, which it must've been, uh, then, you know, cool.
539800	540820	It's like added value.
540820	545500	I love when Nintendo puts like new value in like really old titles.
545500	547940	And they've been pretty good about doing this a lot.
547940	548940	Yeah.
548940	554540	So, uh, apparently HBO go crashed from all the people watching that other thing that's
554540	555540	going on tonight.
555540	556540	Uh huh.
556540	558860	So there's already bets as to who dies first.
558860	559860	All right.
559860	561280	Well, let's not, let's not talk about that.
561280	566380	Let's focus on video games, uh, and comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
566380	570080	uh, double O Waldorf, who I'm gonna refer to here.
570080	571080	What game are we talking about?
571080	574420	The Nintendo Labo, uh, VR experience.
574420	579380	And then breath of the wild, uh, being plugged in there, but I do want to start today's show
579380	580380	kind of like segue.
580380	584820	So we talked about like Nintendo adding these value experiences to really, you know, older
584820	585820	titles.
585820	588440	I want to start with what I had planned to do for the kickoff topic tonight and talk
588440	594940	a little bit about maybe not so great free, not free things in games.
594940	600060	Uh, and this is a trend I think we're seeing, um, it's not unique to this game, but we're
600060	602620	seeing it more often, and this is definitely a big title.
602820	605220	Uh, so Resident Evil 2 got a remake recently.
605220	607380	I know dark soccer, you're a big fan, right?
607380	609800	So I'd be very curious what you think about this.
609800	615740	So apparently, uh, what you can do, uh, is if you want, you can just pay $4.99 and you
615740	621660	can buy in the shop, an in game rewards unlock add on, and this would allow you to unlock
621660	626780	the two extra playable modes, costumes, bonus weapon and art.
626780	627780	And it should be noted.
627780	630540	All of these things are what you would unlock.
630540	631540	Yeah.
631540	632540	We have them anyway.
633460	634460	Right.
634460	635460	You guys did the same way.
635460	639500	So this is the whole pay $5 to get it now type of thing is you get it anyway.
639500	640500	Yeah.
640500	645020	But, but if you're impatient and we should point out, it isn't, this is not a trend in
645020	646020	the industry.
646020	652580	You know, it's just, this is, it was either mafia two or the Godfather, I think it was
652580	653580	the Godfather.
653580	660860	I was Godfather on the Godfather because on Xbox 360 you had, um, the cheats that were
660860	668180	in the game where paid DLC versus the PlayStation two and Xbox versions of that game.
668180	672740	The cheats were button presses that you would do like a combination of button presses, unlock
672740	679280	different cheats, but they've decided EA, of course, I know shocking, um, decided that
679280	682260	they would sell that to you because they like all of the money.
682260	685060	So that's why this is the way it is.
685060	686980	And that's why our industry is the way it is.
686980	690540	Well now the 360, you know, that was several years ago at this point.
690540	695680	So apparently this trend, I mean, my people must be buying them or we wouldn't continue
695680	696680	to do this.
696680	697680	Right.
697680	698680	All right.
698680	701540	They dangle it in front of you because what's the worst that's going to happen.
701540	702740	It doesn't get purchased.
702740	704100	I mean, who cares?
704100	708340	It's just, it's a key and I'm sure it's very minimal because yeah, because I bet Sony and
708340	710340	Microsoft, I mean, I don't know this to be true.
710340	715500	Maybe you know, but I bet Sony and Microsoft don't exactly charge these guys money to have
715500	717100	these things on the store.
717100	722060	I mean, maybe if steam charged people a little more money, which I guess they do charge like
722060	723060	a hundred bucks.
723060	724060	What to get listed on the store.
724060	725060	We have all this recoupable.
725060	726060	Yeah.
726060	727060	That's right.
727060	728060	It's recoupable and all that.
728060	729060	But, um, yeah.
729060	731660	So, I mean, I guess there's really no harm in putting it out there cause some people
731660	733540	are going to buy it if nothing else.
733540	738780	And it's, it's just this whole mobile marketplace type thing, you know, even I was watching
738780	744900	psych impressions of the, uh, elder scrolls blades that just recently came out and how
744900	746020	grindy that is.
746020	747540	Like you earn chests in the game.
747540	750100	It's like, Oh, but you're going to wait five minutes to open that chest.
750100	751360	I did see a story today.
751360	754860	We cut it from the show, uh, roll tonight because I don't think any of us have played
754860	756260	the elder scrolls blades yet.
756260	757260	I don't know.
757260	758260	Dark soccer.
758260	759260	Did you check it out?
759260	760260	I know you play a lot of cell phone music and she's saying no.
760260	765260	So, um, but, uh, I heard that like as of like today or yesterday, Bethesda's actually responded.
765260	770460	They are going to be adjusting some of that balance, adjusting, not removing, adjusting.
770460	775340	You know, a lot of angry people on the internet have made them kind of reevaluate that stuff.
775340	779780	And probably a lot of those one star reviews in the store and they have kept many meaning
779780	780780	to check it out.
780780	781780	I wanted to check it out.
781780	782780	They have adjusted some things.
782780	785720	Like there are certain chests, I think that took like five hours to open and they dropped
785720	788620	it down to like one hour instead or something like that.
788620	790120	But I don't know.
790120	791580	It's just not my thing.
791580	792580	It's a mobile game.
792580	797540	I know that they want to say, well, it's a true elder elder scrolls experience, but no,
797540	798540	it's not.
798540	799540	It's a mobile game.
799540	801660	It's a mobile game experience.
801660	805260	Do we think now I'm curious and I want to ask our chat room this as well over at twitch
805260	806720	TV slash vog network.
806720	810300	I want to look at the other side because I think a lot of us gamers, especially those
810300	815860	that have been around for a very long time, uh, remember the days of up, up, down, down,
815860	816860	left, right, left, right.
816860	821300	BA start was the only, you know, coach you needed right to unlock the extra help or whatever.
821300	826280	Um, I'm curious if anybody would be willing to say they see a positive in this.
826280	828640	Like maybe there's a reason you would want to do this.
828640	834040	I mean, my, I don't really like it, so I'm really having to kind of try to put my feet
834040	836960	or my, you know, put the other shoes on my feet to kind of think this way.
836960	840600	But I'm thinking like maybe like a positive could be, you know, we have had a lot of talk
840600	843720	about how difficult some games can be.
843720	846780	And maybe if some people are willing to pay to make that easier, although like as the
846780	850240	words will leave you in my mouth, I kind of go, God, that just seems shitty though.
850240	854720	Like, no, I don't think, no, I don't think we should have to pay for that.
854720	855720	But okay.
855800	860600	Like maybe I'm not phrasing it the right way, but my point is that like, how, how many people
860600	865320	can beat Contra, even people that, that claim to be hardcore.
865320	866320	Yes.
866320	868840	I know, you know, you and your husband, Jamie, but you guys are anomalies.
868840	873400	You know that, but how many people can beat Contra without that code?
873400	874400	Right.
874400	877600	So y'all need a little bit of skill adjustment once in a while.
877600	881600	All of you do except, except that the crazy people like dark Sakura and her husband.
882000	886720	But that was the half the fun, like with games, like I would love have, I loved owning the
886720	891200	game genie because I'd rent stuff and I'd play it and if it's too hard, I just go find
891200	892600	the codes for it.
892600	896200	Of course, back then you didn't have like the internet to find codes.
896200	901680	You had to rely on either gaming magazines or you had to buy a code book that had games
901680	902680	in it.
902680	907160	And then hopefully the one that you're trying to play has, you know, codes for it.
907520	912120	But that was, that was where the fun was because 30 lives wasn't even enough sometimes with
912120	913120	Contra.
913120	915320	Yeah, that's, that's the truth.
915320	918880	So, and it's funny because later in the show we're going to be taking a look at like old
918880	922720	Nintendo games that get boosted, uh, in the Nintendo switch online library.
922720	925520	And sometimes even that isn't enough to get certain things.
925520	926520	Yeah.
926520	930580	So some games still remain very, very hard, but again, Oh, you know what?
930580	931740	Great example.
931740	937820	Here's Nintendo boosting something for free while these other companies are charging five
937820	938820	bucks for it.
938820	941700	But it's not just, you know, and I know I pick you on Resident Evil here, but of course
941700	943300	we know EA does this as well.
943300	946780	Uh, heck our show, our roots are in music gaming, right?
946780	951720	I'm positive that when I went on PlayStation four, there was a DJ max technica thing that
951720	956340	you could download that would unlock everything that you would get just from playing enough
956340	957340	of this.
957340	959820	You know how like every time you play like three or four songs, you get a little thing
959820	961420	and sometimes you get extra songs.
961420	965940	And I'm not talking DLC, I'm talking like some of the extra like remixes and some of
965940	970620	the original tracks that show up in the game, they sell a key to unlock all that stuff out
970620	971620	the gate as well.
971620	973700	Cause it does take a long time to unlock.
973700	978080	And I get that if you have, you know, less time to play that stuff and you want to play
978080	981180	certain things, maybe that's an option for you.
981180	985340	But at the same time, when you do stuff like that, it kind of ruins the point of the game.
985340	987060	Cause the whole point is that you're unlocking everything.
987060	989100	And once you've unlocked everything, then then what?
989100	994380	I mean, I guess it was music and we can play songs and get better at them, but you know,
994380	997700	what's the point if we're like unlock, I don't, I don't know.
997700	1001840	I think if you're going to put that option in there, that it should be something that
1001840	1007880	is free later on down the road or something, but they can make a buck and people aren't
1007880	1009100	going to complain about it.
1009100	1011380	Although apparently people write articles about it.
1011380	1015980	So somebody not like it, but at the same time, it's been like this for years now and it's
1015980	1018780	more of like, Oh, there's another company doing that.
1018780	1023060	So we're going to buy their game because so if you don't like, am I going to protest
1023060	1024060	everybody?
1024060	1025420	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
1025420	1027540	Um, the end of the end of the day, right?
1027540	1028540	Bottom line.
1028540	1029540	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
1029540	1030540	Most important thing.
1030540	1033220	Well, I mean, you can't say that about everything because there are some games now and they've
1033220	1036340	gotten smart about it is like, they'll patch that shit in later.
1036340	1040180	So like for example, call of duty, modern warfare remastered, you know, call of duty.
1040180	1046400	Modern warfare is probably one of the best FPS games, you know, ever made.
1046400	1048420	Then they decided, Hey, you know what?
1048460	1052260	We're just going to go ahead and fucking put some loot boxes in there now, even though
1052260	1054540	you purchased the game and they weren't in there originally.
1054540	1057500	And if you're totally taking a lot of shit, totally getting that to that, but we're going
1057500	1059340	to throw it in there now.
1059340	1060340	You know what though?
1060340	1061760	I can resell you that DLC.
1061760	1066320	I liked what you kind of like referenced there where you said something about like you could
1066320	1069300	come back a year later and then it could be free.
1069300	1074980	Like that would be a great way for developers to kind of get people to revisit maybe an
1074980	1081180	old title is that after a year, why not just put out that sort of DLC for free?
1081180	1085740	And the value is that more people revisit the game, more people play the game, talk
1085740	1086740	about the games.
1086740	1091360	And then you can sell your resident evil, whatever remaster or you put the game on sale
1091360	1095180	and now maybe you sell a few more copies because people know they can just unlock everything
1095180	1096180	out the gate or whatever.
1096180	1097260	Maybe we're stopping them before.
1097260	1104620	I think that's a, that's a very Nintendo ish idea to, to do is just like make that code
1104620	1110540	or whatever free a year, maybe if even that long, six months after the game is out, maybe
1110540	1113620	I guess if they feel the need to charge for it out the gate, then whatever.
1113620	1116620	I still don't think all they'll do is they'll bundle it together with the game.
1116620	1119940	They'll reduce the price down to the original cost of the game, be like, look at the deal
1119940	1120940	you're getting.
1120940	1125700	And I'm sorry, I can't, I can't give, I can't give this industry the benefit of the social
1125700	1127500	media sees straight.
1127500	1131600	Where do people find out about most of those sales, social media, who sees through that
1131600	1134260	shit right off the bat, social media, you know what I mean?
1134260	1139300	So I feel like, like, I realize a lot of game company, executive boardroom type discussions
1139300	1143620	don't think gamers are that smart, but like, I kind of think we are.
1143620	1147260	And like, you know, your sale is not going to gain a lot of traction if, if it's very
1147260	1149140	clear, it's a stupid sale.
1149140	1150140	Yeah.
1150140	1152300	So that's where my head's at on that anyway.
1152300	1157140	Uh, let's see, going to our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, pod culture says
1157140	1162940	Forza horizon has a key to unlock a map, to find all the barn find cars.
1162940	1166180	Uh, and Bobby adds to that and that last damn bonus board.
1166180	1167180	Yeah.
1167180	1169260	And that's like stuff, you know, and I always thought that was really silly too, because
1169260	1175020	I was like, you have an internet and the internet, all the location, I mean, I understand it's
1175020	1179340	awfully convenient to just unlock it in the game and then use the magic GPS to take you
1179340	1180340	there.
1180340	1181340	I get it.
1181340	1184680	But like, it's not like you can't, can't download a high resolution map and just see everything
1184680	1185940	right there.
1185940	1190340	Like it's just, it's kind of blows my mind that they actually make money off that, but
1190340	1191340	I get it.
1191340	1194380	People want to collect stuff and those types of collectible games, I guess.
1194380	1195660	Um, let's see.
1195660	1199900	And Bobby says, it's hard to figure out which bonus boards you don't have when there's 200
1199900	1200900	though.
1200900	1203540	But once the point out, I've never paid for the treasure map, but I see.
1203540	1207660	So it's kind of like you're sitting there at one 99 out of 200, you have no idea where
1207660	1209300	that last board is.
1209300	1213140	Maybe looking at a map on the internet isn't going to help because you're going to see
1213140	1214140	all 200.
1214140	1215140	You're not going to remember which one 99 yard.
1215340	1217300	I remember that they did something similar to that.
1217300	1223740	I think it was in crackdown one where they, they, uh, for people that were down to like
1223740	1228380	the very last few things it was, they actually had it where the, there was a detector that
1228380	1233260	kind of let you know where some of the last few orbs to collect were because I know when
1233260	1236380	it got down, it's like, Oh great, I have two left.
1236380	1237380	Where the hell are they?
1237380	1239620	I've been all over this map like crazy.
1239620	1243220	So it like actually makes them louder so you can hear them and stuff because yeah, it was
1243220	1244220	a pain in the ass.
1244300	1249460	In crackdown one, I never did get all of them because I couldn't find the last, like however
1249460	1252500	many I had left, probably less than five.
1252500	1258020	And I was like all over that map, uh, at depth points out the dragon ball fighter Z also
1258020	1259020	does it.
1259020	1261660	And you can buy a key to unlock some of the characters that you unlock will play in the
1261660	1262660	game.
1262660	1267220	But I could see a little bit too, because like if you're saying, um, not really into
1267220	1271100	just going through the story mode and progressing through that, normally maybe you're into the
1271100	1274900	fighting game scene or something and you want to play those characters that you want to
1274900	1279900	main as, then maybe unlocking them now would be beneficial to you.
1279900	1283540	I don't know, but see, you know, back then what we used to do is just download a save
1283540	1287420	off the internet and then put it in there and all this stuff is unlocked or there would
1287420	1292060	be a code you'd put in a menu and unlock all the characters or a game genie code that would
1292060	1293060	unlock all the characters.
1293060	1295080	I mean, there's lots of ways around everything.
1295080	1300300	We need, where, where did the game G Gottlieb, is that who made the game genie?
1300300	1304020	We need them to come back and make a game genie for the PlayStation four and the Xbox
1304020	1305020	one.
1305020	1306020	That's what we need.
1306020	1307020	What do you mean you can't?
1307020	1308020	You can't do that anymore.
1308020	1309020	Hacks.
1309020	1310020	Hack the planet.
1310020	1311020	I can't.
1311020	1312020	I can't put the CD in the cartridge.
1312020	1313020	It doesn't work.
1313020	1315780	You're not trying hard enough.
1315780	1317060	Can't push the digital games.
1317060	1319740	You can put Linux on it, Loki.
1319740	1320740	There's gotta be a way.
1320740	1322060	Just get the game genie.
1322060	1323060	Oh, Galoob.
1323060	1324060	Sorry.
1324060	1325060	It was very simple.
1325060	1326060	Thank you.
1326060	1327060	It was Galoob.
1327060	1328060	Are they even around still?
1328060	1329060	Gottlieb makes pinball games, I think.
1329060	1330060	They did.
1330820	1331820	They made the game genie.
1331820	1332820	What's that?
1332820	1333820	Is that like tilting the table?
1333820	1336140	It's like going into the menu and changing the rule set.
1336140	1337660	Or sawing the legs down.
1337660	1340660	And then putting a big blocker right behind the flippers.
1340660	1341660	Or turning the tilt off.
1341660	1348500	Or what we used to do is strip, or put a rubber band in between the, was it the channels going
1348500	1349500	down towards the bottom?
1349500	1351860	Just put rubber bands on the side so it only can go down the center.
1351860	1353500	Oh, permanent like ball save?
1353500	1354500	Yeah.
1354500	1355500	Oh yeah.
1355500	1356500	We did it with Attack on Mars.
1356500	1357500	That was fun.
1357500	1358500	Okay.
1358500	1359500	Made the game much easier.
1359940	1362380	A lot easier than it would have been otherwise.
1362380	1363380	I like that.
1363380	1364380	Alright.
1364380	1368300	Let's get into some other topics that we have here at Orange Laundry tonight.
1368300	1371820	One way we always like to start the show is by talking about our gaming weeks and the
1371820	1373940	types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1373940	1376180	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1376180	1377180	Eh.
1377180	1378580	That fun, huh?
1378580	1379580	I really didn't do much.
1379580	1386500	I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing on my phone and trying to farm an ingress
1386500	1387500	at work.
1387500	1393700	You know, just little bits and pieces, it's just, I've had migraines all week from some
1393700	1395660	problems I'm having in my neck.
1395660	1399940	And so it's been really hard for me to just sit and look at a screen for any significant
1399940	1401940	amount of time outside of doing my job.
1401940	1404420	But you're building up hype for Animal Crossing on Switch, right?
1404420	1406860	I really want it.
1406860	1407860	I know.
1407860	1409300	And then Dan will never see the Switch again.
1409300	1411820	He'll have to buy a second one.
1411820	1412820	Right.
1412820	1413820	Alright.
1413820	1414820	Well, if that's all you got for now.
1414820	1415820	Oh, and pinball.
1415820	1416820	I mean, there is pinball.
1417220	1418220	Okay.
1418220	1419220	So there is still that.
1419220	1420500	So you're still you're still gaming something.
1420500	1422780	It's just not maybe video games right now.
1422780	1423780	Yeah.
1423780	1424780	What?
1424780	1425780	You guys just got a new pinball table, right?
1425780	1426780	No.
1426780	1427780	Well, we had Ghostbusters for a while.
1427780	1428780	That was our last new one.
1428780	1429780	I thought there was something.
1429780	1430780	We sold Demolition Man.
1430780	1431780	Okay.
1431780	1432780	So we're selling Monopoly.
1432780	1433780	Right.
1433780	1434780	And you're selling.
1434780	1436740	I may be selling World Cup to Melomelody.
1436740	1437740	Right.
1437740	1438740	Okay.
1438740	1440260	I thought there was something coming in to replace one of those.
1440260	1442260	Black Knight, Sword of Rage.
1442260	1443260	Okay.
1443260	1444260	Maybe.
1444260	1446260	Because now Dan's like, I'm like, shut up.
1446700	1447700	We're getting it.
1448700	1449700	You tell him.
1449700	1451020	And Steve Ritchie did all the voices in it again.
1451020	1453260	He was also the designer of the table, of course.
1453260	1454540	He did all the voices again.
1454540	1461380	And I think that all the guitar in it was written by someone from Anthrax.
1461380	1462380	Why not?
1462380	1463380	It was pretty good stuff.
1463380	1464380	Nice.
1464380	1465380	All right.
1465380	1466380	Loki, how about you?
1466380	1467380	How was your gaming week?
1467380	1468380	I played.
1468380	1470860	Well, I built a lot of Labo VR stuff.
1470860	1474540	So I got that on Friday and I've been building it pretty much ever since.
1474540	1478700	I have still two more toy cons to build.
1478700	1483620	I've got the elephant and the wind flapper.
1483620	1484620	I don't know what they call it.
1484620	1486380	It's a pedal thing with the...
1486380	1491020	It's the one that they have the Toad picture that they posted on the Nintendo Twitter account.
1491020	1496100	Everyone's like, why are you stepping on Toad's penis over and over?
1496100	1497100	I get it.
1497100	1500700	He's supposed to be doing sis, but it looked like you're just stomping on his penis.
1500700	1502700	I'm not going to paint Toad on mine.
1502700	1505960	So we're not going to have that problem.
1505960	1506960	So I played lots of that.
1506960	1511380	I actually did finish the Toy-Con Blaster earlier today and actually played some of
1511380	1512380	that.
1512380	1513380	And that's actually really cool.
1513380	1516380	It's kind of like an on-rails shooting gallery type thing.
1516380	1520740	And so it's hard to see from there, but you actually pull it back and it clicks and then
1520740	1525620	you push a button and it's almost like firing a rubber band gun or something like that.
1525620	1531780	But it's really cool and it's a lot easier to hold than holding the headset by itself.
1531780	1538200	So I did that and then I've been playing Borderlands Remastered a bit.
1538200	1543860	I had the hardest time getting it to run and it still crashes every now and then.
1543860	1548980	It's just some general protection fault thing.
1548980	1552340	It could be because I'm modding my saves.
1552340	1556980	I don't think so, but it might be that.
1556980	1558500	It shouldn't cause the game to crash.
1558500	1562180	I've never had that problem before, but you know, I have to cheat.
1562180	1563180	It's Borderlands.
1563180	1566580	I've already played through the whole game once, so I don't care anymore.
1566580	1568500	Not even once, several times.
1568500	1571140	But it's just fun to mess around with that stuff.
1571140	1575980	But I'm like level 15 now and yeah.
1575980	1579100	So it's been okay.
1579100	1581100	And then what else?
1581100	1582100	Pokemon Go, I guess.
1582100	1588320	A little bit of that and a little bit of working on my game.
1588320	1589320	And that's it.
1589320	1590320	Okay.
1590320	1592200	My Gaming Week may surprise you.
1592200	1594720	I am still playing Borderlands Remastered.
1594720	1598200	I'm not having these problems you're having, but I'm also not fucking with my game.
1598200	1602640	But it was doing it before I fucked with my game, so I think it's actually the game.
1602640	1607440	No, I've been playing it just the way it comes on the computer.
1607440	1608440	And I've been playing it.
1608440	1612640	I mean, I don't play the 4K, I play 2K, but it runs really well in the 2K mode.
1612640	1615640	And I talked a little bit about this last week, I don't want to repeat too much, but
1615640	1616960	I've still been playing.
1616960	1620360	I think that's noteworthy because you guys know how often video games hold my attention
1620360	1622280	for more than a week as new things come out.
1622280	1625720	I'm up to level 17 now, which for me is pretty good.
1625720	1628600	I guess that doesn't sound that high.
1628600	1632240	I heard you beat the game around level 35, right?
1632240	1633240	I don't remember.
1633240	1634240	I don't know.
1634240	1637600	So I don't know how many levels you go through in the game, but I'm at level 17.
1637600	1638880	I feel like I've done a lot.
1638880	1642920	I've only beaten the second boss so far.
1642920	1648160	Is that when you go into the hideout and you're like in a big circular room and there's this
1648160	1652080	big guy, scary, because I think I just did that part.
1652080	1653480	Maybe I only did nine toes.
1653480	1656840	I thought I fought the second guy, but maybe not yet.
1656840	1657840	Okay.
1657840	1661600	So I did this whole area, I think the last thing I remember doing, it was either that
1661600	1666320	or it was the one where you have all these shock crystals and you blow up the shock crystals
1666320	1668680	and pick up the little fragments they leave behind.
1668680	1670340	And then he makes a shot.
1670340	1672820	Maybe I only got this quest because I'm the soldier, I don't know.
1672820	1676300	But he makes a thing that you put on your turret and now it does shock bullets from
1676300	1677300	the turret.
1677300	1678580	So that's like the last thing I did.
1678580	1679580	Oh, that's yeah.
1679580	1681180	That's another side quest, I think.
1681180	1682660	But here's, here's the thing that's made.
1682660	1683660	Okay.
1683660	1687500	So like with Borderlands, I felt like the game was like kind of hard because you have
1687500	1689300	limited ammo, right?
1689300	1691360	Even though it kind of like seems to drop from everything.
1691360	1692920	And I think that's kind of the trick.
1692920	1696920	Like even though I kind of get annoyed at how everything responds, I think there's a
1696920	1700700	method to the madness because I think like if you're running low on ammo and for whatever
1700700	1704220	reason you can't afford it, although I noticed it's really cheap.
1704220	1707900	So I think that's by design is that they make the ammo really cheap so that you can't easily
1707900	1708900	run out.
1708900	1712580	But like also even though some of the monsters level up, not all of them do.
1712580	1716900	Like I noticed right outside that Firestone town, those little, um, Scott, what are they
1716900	1717900	called?
1717900	1721420	The skags, skogs, skags, skags, those things that hang out, they never go up beyond level
1721420	1722420	two.
1722420	1724860	So if you just kill those things, which is really easy, you can melee kill them when
1724860	1728900	they're level two and you're like level five, um, you they'll drop ammo too.
1728900	1730480	So you can kind of farm it that way.
1730480	1734360	So there is a way to do it where you're not really running out of things, but it will
1734360	1736140	take a little selling guns.
1736140	1737140	You do that.
1737140	1738140	You can do that too.
1738140	1741640	But where I'm really feeling progression now, and I know this is funny to some of you because
1741640	1744040	this game is how old is like 10 years old at this point.
1744040	1746480	And I'm like just discovering it for the first time where some of you have been playing it
1746480	1749960	for forever, but maybe you can appreciate that now I'm discovering it.
1749960	1753320	Um, I just got in this last little thing that I did.
1753320	1760000	Um, I got, somebody dropped a purple shield and it's like, it was like twice the shielding
1760040	1761040	of the one I had.
1761040	1763600	It went up from like 160 to like 300.
1763600	1764600	Okay.
1764600	1769640	And it has very fast health regeneration and I was like, yes, this is exactly what I needed
1769640	1773720	because I kept dying because there's like no, are you using the shift keys as well?
1773720	1777920	Because they have shift keys that they post online and you can read, you can redeem them
1777920	1782440	on your, um, like the shift key to run it.
1782440	1783720	You're talking like a DLC thing.
1783720	1784720	Yeah.
1784720	1785720	They're shift keys.
1785720	1790800	So you can register on the borderland site under your VIP thing or whatever, and then
1790800	1795600	you can unlock, uh, there's a chest in Firestone you can unlock and you get loot from there.
1795600	1796920	It's like rare loot.
1796920	1797920	Oh, it's free.
1797920	1800320	Oh, that's how you open that.
1800320	1801320	Yeah.
1801320	1802320	So you have to get shift keys.
1802320	1803320	So you go online, just search.
1803320	1805240	And I mean, I don't think they expire really.
1805240	1808400	And you just, you can put as many of them in as you want and they unlocks five each
1808400	1809400	time.
1809400	1810400	Passcodes and ingress for gear.
1810400	1811400	Yeah, sort of.
1811400	1812400	Yeah.
1812400	1813400	Okay.
1813400	1814400	Wow.
1814400	1815400	Interesting.
1816080	1818000	But if it's something, does it generate stuff at my level?
1818000	1820400	Cause maybe I want to hang on to those till I'm like,
1820400	1821400	um, yes.
1821400	1825280	Oh, so maybe there's, you don't want to just burn them all at level one.
1825280	1826280	That might not be a good idea.
1826280	1827280	Yeah.
1827280	1829280	He probably wants one gain a few levels.
1829280	1830280	Use another gain.
1830280	1831280	Okay.
1831280	1832280	Okay.
1832280	1833280	That's probably what I'll do that.
1833280	1834280	Like I got a shield out of that one time.
1834280	1835280	Yeah.
1835280	1838160	But now that I have that purple shield, I feel like, okay, I can actually go in there
1838160	1839160	and take them.
1839160	1842320	Cause like I'm supposed to, I think the soldiers, the tanky guy, right.
1842320	1845160	Or is it the, maybe there's another guy that's like really big and bulky.
1845920	1846920	It's probably him.
1846920	1847920	Yeah.
1847920	1848920	Soldiers never laid the tank guy.
1848920	1849920	Okay.
1849920	1850920	I don't know.
1850920	1851920	He has the tour.
1851920	1852920	I, the turret thing sounded, I was like, Oh, uh, that's like mass effect with the drone.
1852920	1853920	I'll like that guy.
1853920	1857360	And I do because I remember the first time I played border lands years ago, I played
1857360	1860200	the girl who's like the siren.
1860200	1866160	And although that was a cool ability, like knowing my sense of what I need in first person
1866160	1871700	shooters and how I do better in those games, I went with the turret building guy because
1871700	1873040	I'm like, Ooh, I like turrets.
1873040	1874880	I like, that's like the type of character I like to play.
1875600	1877600	That's why I like Symmetra and Overwatch.
1877600	1882720	And I always play as the hunter mortar guy is that now he, he probably uses snipers,
1882720	1883720	huh?
1883720	1888000	He's sniper rifles in, uh, revolvers and pistols are his specialties.
1888000	1889000	Those are the ones that he loves.
1889000	1890000	Look faster.
1890000	1891000	Okay.
1891000	1892920	Everybody can use everything, but it's, yeah.
1892920	1897560	Because I've been, I was using the sniper rifle a lot to like, like what I will do is
1897560	1901720	like, I'll use this when I'm a distance away, I'll use the sniper rifle to attack them.
1901720	1904260	And then that kind of like agros them, then they come at me.
1904260	1908300	And then I was using a pistol cause I had a really good pistol, but I noticed, I looked,
1908300	1911320	I looked at the skill trees and I was like, Oh, here's a shotgun ability.
1911320	1913020	So let me set out for a shotgun.
1913020	1917940	So now I use the, I was using the sniper rifle to pull them in and then I'd shotgun them
1917940	1918940	down.
1918940	1919940	Right.
1919940	1920940	Good strategy.
1920940	1921940	Right.
1921940	1923700	But, uh, I just recently replaced the sniper rifle with a rocket launcher.
1923700	1925460	That's a much better way to get people's attention.
1925460	1926460	Yes.
1926460	1931020	Well, Doug, and you have to be subtle with one and absolute opposite of subtle with the
1931020	1932020	other.
1932020	1933340	I'm not a subtle person.
1933340	1938300	So yeah, it's, it's, it's so weird to me that I'm talking about like Borderlands strategy.
1938300	1943420	I never thought I would like get into this game, but Mass Effect, I didn't enjoy the
1943420	1944420	first time.
1944420	1945420	Right.
1945420	1946660	But now I'm kind of like into Borderlands.
1946660	1948860	Some of the humor is a little bit toilet, but whatever.
1948860	1949860	It's it's fine.
1949860	1951620	And I, I, I let it go.
1951620	1952620	I'm just, whatever.
1952620	1956660	It's there is something really fucking satisfying about like when you get the car that you could
1956660	1960060	just run over enemies and their blood splatters everywhere and H I definition.
1960060	1962780	I'm like, that is really satisfying.
1962780	1965860	So yeah, I, I'm liking Borderlands y'all.
1965860	1969220	Now there's a reason to have this poster back here besides the fact that one of our listeners
1969220	1970220	got it for us.
1970220	1972060	And I also, look, look, he always liked Borderlands.
1972060	1974820	I also play a zero all the time when I play in Borderlands two.
1974820	1975820	Yeah.
1975820	1981100	So I, I'm going to try to really finish this one and then try to play two and maybe make
1981100	1982580	my way to Borderlands three.
1982580	1983580	I don't know.
1983580	1984580	Anyway.
1984580	1987900	I'm looking at some comments in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG network.
1987900	1992500	Bobby Blackwell points out, I also picked the soldier because of the turret, the necromancer
1992500	1994380	in Borderlands two also had a turret.
1994380	1995380	I think.
1995380	1996380	Yes.
1996380	1999640	I would imagine that's having a little helper is kind of a standard class design thing I
1999640	2002180	think is usually one of the arch types if you will.
2002180	2006780	Um, other games I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy 14, I'm back, I'm back on that
2006780	2007780	bullshit.
2007780	2012020	Uh, I leveled my, so my astrologian has always kind of been my main and I've, that's been
2012020	2013540	70 the max level.
2013540	2019420	My white mage hit 70 in this past week and my scholar is now level 66.
2019420	2024780	So by the end of next week, I should have every healer in Final Fantasy 14 at maximum
2024780	2025780	level.
2025780	2026780	Why?
2026780	2027780	I don't know.
2027780	2028780	It's fun.
2028780	2029780	It's a thing.
2029780	2030780	It's a thing.
2030780	2031780	It's a thing.
2031780	2032780	I'm working.
2032780	2033780	It's just a thing.
2033780	2034780	It's a thing.
2034780	2035780	Um, so there's that.
2035780	2036780	And then of course, Pokemon go like you guys, community day was yesterday.
2036780	2041460	Um, so we went down to Capitol park, our usual stomping grounds for that.
2041460	2042460	And what was it?
2042460	2043460	It was bacon.
2043460	2047600	And it was bag on, but I said, I didn't get a single shiny.
2047600	2048600	You didn't?
2048760	2053360	Well, I'll trade you one later than maybe I forgot that it was at that time.
2053360	2054600	I thought it was earlier in the day.
2054600	2055920	Oh, you know what they've been doing?
2055920	2058960	It's kind of, well, it seems permanent, but they could change it whenever, but it seems
2058960	2063040	like they figured out a way to roll it out in every time zone.
2063040	2066380	And that probably has been helping with the server issues immensely too, but it's every
2066380	2068240	time zone from three to 6 PM.
2068240	2073920	And I like the later hours for now, but like, it's not like it'll work for maybe one more
2073920	2074920	month.
2074920	2078480	But when we get into June and July three to 6 PM is like the hottest point of the day.
2078480	2079360	No, thank you.
2079360	2080760	It's going to be like 115 out.
2080760	2084920	So I'll be playing at the Galleria again, because I'll play at an indoor mall and I'm
2084920	2087840	not playing out at the park in that kind of heat.
2087840	2091320	So I'm hoping they go back to the earlier hours, but yeah, for now the three to six
2091320	2096780	has been kind of interesting, but I caught a seven shiny bake-ons, which is pretty good
2096780	2099640	because the first hour and a half I only had one.
2099640	2103280	And then I just got like three more and then that was when Alan and I were like, okay,
2103280	2104280	we're good.
2104280	2107080	Cause he, he also got like way more in the second half than the first half.
2107080	2109360	And we, so we each had our three and we're like, okay, we're done.
2109360	2111840	And so I switched to my Bluetooth, my gotcha.
2111840	2115240	And I was catching that way and I caught like three more shinies from the gotcha.
2115240	2117120	So there you go.
2117120	2120460	That was a pretty good, except none of them were very good appraisals.
2120460	2121600	That's the only kind of bummer.
2121600	2127400	So and then one of my friends who plays like super casually and doesn't really care about
2127400	2129940	shinies, but he does want to fill his pokey decks.
2129940	2133600	He needed a far-fetched cause he, he guess he wasn't playing when that event happened
2133600	2134600	or whatever.
2134600	2135600	He's never hatched one.
2135600	2137440	So I got a far-fetched and he gave me a shiny Q bone for it.
2137440	2139160	I'm like, are you sure you want to give up a shiny?
2139160	2140160	He's like, I don't care.
2140160	2141960	I don't care about shiny thing, but I want that far-fetched.
2141960	2146000	I was like, okay, so I got another shiny that I needed.
2146000	2147000	So I got the Q bone.
2147000	2152480	So, uh, which is also good because that was the ingress event shiny and that's the enlightened
2152480	2153840	one was the Q bone.
2153840	2156520	So I finally got one of those.
2156520	2161320	I do, even though I'm not a resistance person, uh, the pony does that are the blue ones.
2161320	2162320	Those are really good.
2162320	2164600	Like I have, they're, they just look fucking cool.
2164600	2165720	Like I have to have those.
2165720	2167720	So, but I don't have one of those yet.
2167720	2168720	So, uh, anyway.
2168720	2169720	Oh, you don't?
2169720	2170960	I think I have one.
2170960	2171960	The blue pony tusks?
2171960	2172960	I don't have one of those either.
2172960	2174960	Cause I got one of those first.
2174960	2175960	Oh, hang on to those.
2175960	2179280	Cause yeah, unless you, when you get two, I'll trade you shiny.
2179280	2181920	So I've got, I have like multiple shiny swab blues.
2181920	2184840	I know that's one that like hasn't had a community day.
2184840	2187360	I've just hatched a bunch and some turn out shiny.
2187360	2188960	I wish I could part with my togepi.
2188960	2190160	I have two shiny togepis.
2190160	2192840	Well, one of them's a shiny toga kiss.
2192840	2195720	What's the, no, what's the last, there's a third one.
2195720	2196720	Really?
2196720	2199280	Gen four toga kiss, I think is the last one or something like that.
2199280	2205040	So that's the, uh, my, my only one of those is a shiny because since it was a hatch, it
2205040	2207480	was also a wonder or highest level appraisal.
2207480	2209240	So it made sense to do that one.
2209240	2210240	So yeah.
2210240	2211240	Um, yeah.
2211240	2212240	Anyway, Pokemon, Pokemon.
2212240	2216640	Oh, maybe, maybe I transferred it to, uh, I transferred the Pokemon.
2216640	2217640	Let's go.
2217640	2219960	You, you put a shiny and let's go.
2219960	2220960	Yeah.
2220960	2222760	Cause I don't give a crap about this stuff.
2223680	2225160	Save me all the shinies ever.
2225160	2226160	All right.
2226160	2227160	Yeah.
2227160	2228160	It wasn't.
2228160	2229160	You need to get yourself a Bluetooth catcher.
2229160	2231000	That's, that's been great for shinies.
2231000	2234320	Just you have to just remember to kind of sit there and clean up your Pokemon all the
2234320	2235320	time.
2235320	2237680	And it's, it's only really works when walking.
2237680	2239700	They really nerfed it when driving.
2239700	2243600	But since I've been trying to walk more and do the fitness thing more, um, I've been using
2243600	2248160	like I'll go walk the giant park, not far, not, not the park that's close to the house,
2248160	2249160	but the giant park.
2249160	2250240	It's a little further from the house.
2250240	2252220	I've been walking that pretty regularly.
2252680	2256060	And like, I'll use my Bluetooth to catch, I'll play ingress and I'm walking and it's
2256060	2257060	exercise.
2257060	2259060	Postmates is expensive.
2259060	2260060	Yes.
2260060	2261060	Yes it is.
2261060	2262660	For pita kitchen anyway.
2262660	2263660	All right.
2263660	2264660	Anyway.
2264660	2265940	Uh, that's it for my gaming week.
2265940	2268840	So I guess, uh, we can get into some housekeeping real quick.
2268840	2271580	You can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.
2271580	2274880	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange Laundrio.
2274880	2279400	And of course, if you aren't already following us on Twitch at VOG network, VOG network,
2279400	2281380	I would really hope that you fix that.
2281380	2285020	Thank you to everybody who helps us out on Twitch through all your hosts, your bitty
2285020	2286740	donations are appreciated as well.
2286740	2291380	The bits, uh, and, uh, the, the, um, subscriptions are really, really amazing.
2291380	2294220	You guys have really shown up and we're so happy.
2294220	2298260	Uh, you guys have been supporting us on Twitch for the past few months, ever since we switched
2298260	2301460	to Twitch in December.
2301460	2304300	And there's been a lot of exciting news on the Twitch front lately, right?
2304300	2308660	Uh, we got some new emotes, so I know Bobby Black Wolf has this little, a Wolf emote and
2308660	2310780	we're going to have one that represents a well are pretty soon.
2310780	2312020	We've been talking about it behind the scenes.
2312020	2315580	I think we know what we're going to go with, but we'll have an OLR emote very soon.
2315580	2317060	Uh, that's going to be a thing.
2317060	2322300	And then I'm hearing something about, uh, um, at the Twitch con Europe, I think happened
2322300	2323300	this weekend, right?
2323300	2324300	Yeah.
2324300	2325300	I saw the thing.
2325300	2326300	They were talking about like highlight reels.
2326300	2330940	Like, like something about the volume of your chat and the clips that are made will make
2330940	2334340	this highlight reel at the end of your, so I'm really curious to see what the highlight
2334340	2339180	reels end up being for the show because it sounds, it sounds very play of the game and
2339180	2344180	Overwatch, like it kind of uses an algorithm to figure out like what the highlight is.
2344180	2345180	Those always work well.
2345180	2346180	Yeah.
2346180	2347660	I'm, I'm really curious to see how those turn out.
2347660	2348660	And there's other stuff too.
2348660	2349660	We'll talk about.
2349660	2350660	It's going to be, it's a little later.
2350660	2355060	It's going to be like him, me talking all of a sudden, it's so much fun.
2355060	2358180	God damn it.
2358180	2359180	Fuck you algorithm.
2359180	2361940	Oh, now I really want that to happen.
2361940	2364220	All right, let's get into some gaming news for now.
2364220	2365540	Uh, start us off, Logie.
2365540	2366540	All right.
2366540	2370740	Apparently, uh, Bungee has been blocking people from using a weapon that they accidentally
2370740	2372620	sold to them in destiny.
2372620	2377620	Um, so that seems to have, there was a, some exclusive stuff that they had in PlayStation
2377620	2378620	four.
2378620	2384780	There's this weapon that was, uh, the exotic trace rifle wave splitter, and apparently
2384780	2391980	this traveling alien salesman would sell you and, uh, somehow that, uh, wave splitter was
2391980	2397180	made available, uh, to players on Xbox and PC.
2397180	2401020	And of course, you know, they, they're aware of the issue and they're working on a fix
2401020	2405860	in the meantime though, if you've, um, acquired that weapon, you're not gonna be able to use
2405860	2406860	it.
2406860	2411100	So even if you paid for it, sorry, that's money not well spent and they're not going
2411100	2412280	to refund them.
2412280	2414660	I think that that's maybe what they're working on doing.
2414660	2417780	They haven't said that they're going to do that yet, but most likely that's going to
2417780	2421060	have to be the outcome unless it's going to become a non-exclusive weapon.
2421060	2422860	Um, so I don't know.
2422860	2425980	Here's my, my honest to God reaction to this story that I'm hearing.
2425980	2427940	Like I realized it was a mistake and so forth.
2427940	2430860	First off, we know these exclusive sorts of things are really silly.
2430860	2432620	Like I understand why it happens in the industry.
2432620	2433620	I get it.
2433620	2438420	You know, people like Sony offer money, they offer, and Microsoft does it too.
2438420	2441420	Nintendo kind of doesn't need to, well, no, I take that back.
2441420	2444540	Nintendo does it too with things like star link, the Ubisoft thing, right?
2444540	2445540	That practically became a Starbucks game.
2445580	2446580	So Nintendo does this too.
2446580	2447700	Speaking of which, they have that on sale.
2447700	2448700	Yeah, I heard.
2448700	2449700	It was down to like 30 bucks.
2449700	2450700	Bargain basement prices.
2450700	2451700	Yeah.
2451700	2452700	But I might need to pick that up.
2452700	2453700	But anyway.
2453700	2454700	The Switch version too.
2454700	2455700	I don't want to digress.
2455700	2456700	I don't want to digress.
2456700	2457700	All right, sorry.
2457700	2458700	So Sony, um, you know, spends this money on Destiny.
2458700	2460660	I'm, I'm only picking on them because we're talking about destiny, but my point is every
2460660	2461660	company does this.
2461660	2462660	Okay.
2462660	2463660	So this isn't like a Sony problem.
2463660	2464660	This is an industry problem.
2464660	2469340	So, um, they pay money to get these exclusives, either they're paying money or they're offering
2469340	2474300	advertising, booth space, trade type of MDF is what they call it.
2474300	2475300	Oh, fancy.
2476060	2477060	What's MDF stand for?
2477060	2480700	It's, uh, I think it's marketing development funds or something like that.
2480700	2481700	I don't know.
2481700	2482700	Less fancy.
2482700	2483700	That's all right.
2483700	2486300	MDF is that's the, that's the ad dollars.
2486300	2488140	It's basically it's ad dollars.
2488140	2494300	So what it is is they, they say, I'm going to give you $100,000 MDF, you know, and so
2494300	2499180	what the company has to do is they have to show them how they're spending that on marketing.
2499180	2503680	So they submit, okay, here's our print ad run that we're going to do, or here's our
2503680	2507160	TV advertisement, you know, and the, all the money behind it.
2507160	2508160	All right.
2508160	2511600	Thank you for the peak behind the curtain, but it's kinda, it's with all respect, it's
2511600	2512600	not surprising.
2512600	2513920	That's kind of what I figured was going on.
2513920	2514920	Right.
2514920	2517000	So they're paying the money for the exclusives, whether we'd like it or not, even though we
2517000	2519640	think it's like, it's just kind of like ridiculous or whatever.
2519640	2524760	Like why, you know, why can't Microsoft and PC, when it comes to destiny, just have the
2524760	2525760	same things.
2525760	2527240	It's really, really ridiculous.
2527240	2529120	I get it when it's IP things.
2529120	2530120	Okay.
2530560	2537120	I get why Nintendo or excuse me, Sony and Microsoft can't have Star Fox in their version
2537120	2538120	of Starlink.
2538120	2542400	I get it when it comes to IP, but that's why I thought one of the coolest things ever was
2542400	2545720	back in the day, Soul Calibur 2, right?
2545720	2553160	And how like Nintendo got Link, Sony got Hahachi, Microsoft got Spawn, right?
2553160	2556240	So that was kind of a weird one, but it, you know, it was still, they got something special
2556240	2557240	too.
2557240	2558240	And that was kind of neat.
2558240	2559240	Right?
2559360	2564720	I'm like, I don't know, master chief, there's not really any really space shooting years
2564720	2565720	ago.
2565720	2566720	It doesn't matter.
2566720	2568840	So they put master chief in a million games.
2568840	2569840	It's fine.
2569840	2570840	Spawn's cool.
2570840	2575880	So anyway, um, but it is really like, okay, the thing and the kind of the point I'm trying
2575880	2579680	to get to with this is that, okay, so it was a mistake that they opened it up and sold
2579680	2584400	these weapons, but these are not like, it's not like these are Sony branded weapons, right?
2584400	2586560	These aren't like God of war guns, right?
2586560	2591640	They're not like, um, horizon, zero dawn bullets or things like that.
2591640	2592640	Right.
2592640	2595400	These are just guns that are marked for PlayStation exclusives.
2595400	2596400	Right.
2596400	2597400	Yeah.
2597400	2599880	So here's my thing is that like, Hey, this is a silly thing to have exclusive.
2599880	2604240	They should just open it up already, but be fine.
2604240	2606160	The economy is what it is.
2606160	2607160	Capitalism is what it is.
2607160	2609920	Deals and wheels and all that are what they are.
2609920	2615520	But if they opened it up and they accidentally sold these things, I'm sorry, but you done
2615520	2616520	fucked up.
2616520	2617520	You let people keep them.
2617520	2618520	Okay.
2618520	2619520	And that's so that's your fault.
2619520	2624880	And honestly, in this society we live in, Loki, it, this is going to be a lawsuit in
2624880	2625880	six months.
2625880	2626880	No, it's lawsuit in six months.
2626880	2630120	Funny that you mentioned six months, though, because this is what's going to, this is the
2630120	2631120	fix.
2631120	2632120	Okay.
2632120	2636740	So this is the fix six days because see, while it's an exclusive weapon, like most things
2636740	2642300	that are exclusive on multi-platform, um, games, it's a timed exclusive weapons.
2642300	2646440	So what's going to happen is you will have it in your inventory if you purchase it, but
2646440	2650800	you can't use it until September of this year.
2650800	2653300	So what dot, dot, dot.
2653300	2654840	So it's a timed exclusive.
2654840	2657160	So you know, you fucked up.
2657160	2658240	Just deal with it.
2658240	2659720	Like you, you fucked up.
2659720	2660720	Open it up.
2660720	2665480	Just lucky fucking people that got that when they could like, just deal with it.
2665480	2669120	Like I just, I feel like this just ends in lawsuit.
2669120	2674600	Well, by the time the lawsuit happens, it'll be out in the general public and it won't
2674600	2676520	fucking matter because you'll be able to use it again.
2676520	2683680	So what happens if I like, if I go to, um, target and I buy, um, peppermint Hershey's
2683680	2687520	kisses or something, even though it's not Christmas, does target come to my house and
2687520	2689400	repossess those kisses?
2689400	2692680	And then they're like, we're sorry, you don't get your money back, but come December, you
2692680	2694440	can come back and get these and we'll give them to you.
2694440	2695920	Like that's not how it fucking works though.
2695920	2699000	They hold it in your general inventory, so it's in your cabinet, but you can't touch
2699000	2700000	it.
2700000	2703280	They padlock your cabinet until September.
2703280	2705960	That's not, that's not how this works.
2705960	2708480	That's not how any of this works.
2708480	2709640	I'm telling you a lawsuit.
2709640	2714840	That's just, thank God that this isn't fallout 76 and that gun has weight to it and stuck
2714840	2721040	in your inventory for six months until you can, you know, actually use it and weighing
2721040	2722040	it down.
2722040	2726240	Guys, you don't enter chat at a Twitch TV slash vlog network says the problem is not
2726240	2727240	the marketing.
2727240	2729720	It was probably blocked because gamers are screaming.
2729720	2730720	Opie.
2730720	2731960	It happens too much with games.
2731960	2732960	That's the real problem.
2732960	2736240	I don't know if that's what happened, but that's what I suspect I kind of get.
2736240	2740240	I get your reference, but I think in this particular example, they are selling that
2740240	2745320	gun on Sony's micro marketplace and Sony players aren't screaming, Opie, are they on?
2745320	2746320	Maybe they are.
2746320	2747320	Okay.
2747320	2749240	But regardless, it's functioning on one platform.
2749240	2754080	This is just about, Oh, well due to our agreement with Sony, even though we're the ones that
2754080	2760800	fucked up and somehow open that sale on other marketplaces on PC and Xbox live and all this,
2760800	2764040	you were still going to lock it away from you because we have to honor our deal with
2764040	2768760	Sony and it's like, you just need to admit you fucked up and there should be some type
2768760	2772800	of clause in your contract with Sony where it's like, you know, we made a boo boo, but
2772800	2776320	in good faith we pulled it from the store as soon as we realized there was an issue
2776320	2779080	and it's still going to be exclusive until such a such day.
2779080	2780880	Like they're not going to do that.
2780880	2784120	God, what's going to happen is everyone's going to forget about it next week and then
2784120	2788200	it'll just come available to, no, we'll talk about, I want to, I want a reminder.
2788200	2792040	That's not going to happen at the top of every L R justice for death.
2792040	2797160	Just forget all that happened because there's so much news that it's just going to be forgotten
2797160	2801520	and the next thing someone will be mad at, I can't even think about like what few weeks
2801520	2802520	ago we were mad at.
2802520	2807240	Do I need to put, is everyone still mad at Metro Exodus is on, um, the, was the Epic
2807240	2813160	story and people still remember that or cause they're mad about borderlands three now or
2813160	2815420	whatever next Epic exclusive they get.
2815420	2818160	Do we need a little like, you know, you know how at the beginning of every year, you know,
2818160	2820840	every show here on Twitch, we have our little parody intro.
2820840	2825960	Maybe we need another slide that says, Hey, hashtag remember things were mad at things
2825960	2826960	were mad.
2826960	2827960	Yeah.
2827960	2828960	The list of things to remember.
2828960	2829960	We're mad at.
2829960	2831280	Do we need like a Wiki page?
2831280	2833640	I bet RTC would be willing to make a Wiki page.
2833640	2834640	I just fall.
2834640	2838760	I just fall and told him, I'm like, unlike the, uh, was it like the wall of fame that
2838760	2841960	like certain other podcasts have that they write their listener names on their world,
2841960	2842960	right?
2842960	2843960	All the things that were mad at.
2843960	2847680	So the wall of shame, the list of grievances, lists of grievances.
2847720	2850320	The orange lounge list of grievances.
2850320	2853640	We can move this poster and put like a big whiteboard here and have the orange lounge
2853640	2854640	radio list of grievances.
2854640	2855640	Do you want to do that?
2855640	2860800	Cause we'll make a list of grievances of how expensive this crap is coming soon.
2860800	2861800	Coming soon.
2861800	2863280	The orange launch radio list of grievances.
2863280	2864280	Awesome.
2864280	2867520	No, it's needed.
2867520	2868520	It's needed.
2868520	2869520	I don't even play.
2869520	2872440	I don't even play destiny and I'm mad.
2872440	2873800	All right.
2874800	2878840	$13 for cheese and bacon and egg burrito.
2878840	2879840	Delivery's expensive.
2879840	2880840	Yo.
2880840	2881840	All right.
2881840	2882840	I'm hungry.
2882840	2883840	All right.
2883840	2884840	Yeah.
2884840	2885840	You're hungry.
2885840	2886840	Uh, it has just 200.
2886840	2887840	Matt says the airing of the grievances.
2887840	2888840	Yes.
2888840	2889840	Bobby Black Wolf says an on notice board.
2889840	2890840	No, we would not want to copy anybody else.
2890840	2892000	This is a list of grievances.
2892000	2901920	TM Pat pending, O L R uh, it's the orange lounge log.
2901920	2902920	Yes.
2903040	2904040	The orange log.
2904040	2905040	The O L log.
2905040	2906040	The O L log.
2906040	2907040	What rolls downstairs.
2907040	2908040	Hops over repairs.
2908040	2909040	Your neighbors dog.
2909040	2912240	That's great for a snack and bits on your back.
2912240	2914160	It's O L R log.
2914160	2916200	What's great to complain and scream at the rain.
2916200	2918200	It's O L R's log.
2918200	2920200	All right.
2920200	2923440	Anyway, I'm never doing that again.
2923440	2925040	Let's move on with more stories.
2925040	2927600	Do we gotta, cause I don't know.
2927600	2928880	I'm stuck on that log thing.
2928880	2930360	No, I know you don't have to.
2930360	2933680	I can do the next story cause the next one's supposed to be mine anyway, but it'll be fast.
2933680	2937440	It's about an apex legends update, which I know you guys don't play or do you surprise
2937440	2938440	me?
2938440	2939440	You guys play apex legends?
2939440	2940440	Nope.
2940440	2941440	All right.
2941440	2942440	I played it a couple of times.
2942440	2943440	It's cool.
2943440	2945040	I feel like it's one of those things like border lands that I won't really grow to appreciate
2945040	2948560	it for 10 more years, but the times I've tried it, it's interesting.
2948560	2953000	But um, you all should know if you, if you don't already know this, don't fuck up in
2953000	2954000	apex legends.
2954000	2955560	Meaning like, I mean, you can be bad.
2955560	2957080	Well, if you're bad, people might yell at you.
2957080	2958680	It's going to ban you if you're bad.
2958680	2959680	But you know what?
2959680	2960680	Here's the trick.
2960680	2965680	If you're afraid of other people in apex legends, which I completely understand, turn off your
2965680	2968040	audio incoming and outgoing.
2968040	2970780	They can scream into the abyss and you'll never hear it.
2970780	2975320	And you can still be an effective team member because apex legends has a really great pinging
2975320	2976320	system.
2976320	2978160	They have a great, like, you know, here found a weapon.
2978160	2979160	You can ping things.
2979160	2980640	I'm sure people go ping, ping, ping, ping.
2980640	2983000	Well, they've got to have a ping flood stop.
2983000	2984000	I don't know.
2984000	2989200	But anyway, my point is you can just turn the audio off and then no buddy can ever scream
2989200	2990200	at you.
2990200	2991200	But anyway, uh, but don't cheat.
2991200	2992200	That's the one thing you can't do.
2992200	2996280	And honestly, if you're cheating in these types of games that are meant to be multiplayer
2996280	3002600	online, I mean, if you cheat in your own game, you know, if you hack your, uh, borderlands
3002600	3006880	one file, as long as you're not playing online with other people, especially going into randos.
3006880	3008320	It's co-op, who cares?
3008320	3010880	Or if you're okay, but if you're going in with people that know what they're getting
3010880	3011880	into, that's one thing.
3011880	3014940	But if you go into rando matches and do that shit, that's what's fucked up, right?
3014940	3015940	You don't-
3015940	3017800	Besides, I would share my modded weapons anyways.
3017800	3021660	You don't inflict that on other people that don't want their games to be messed up.
3021660	3026160	So anyway, there's this whole thing going on, of course, the internet forums, the reddits,
3026160	3027160	all that places.
3027160	3030640	Uh, PC players are finding out that if they've cheated, they're getting banned.
3030640	3034180	And the usual types of ban evasions aren't working.
3034180	3036840	Like they're trying to change their IP addresses.
3036840	3037840	Nope.
3037840	3038840	Use a secondary account.
3038840	3039840	Nope.
3039840	3045940	It does appear that Apex Legends is actually using some type of hardware ID ban.
3045940	3050780	So they know your computer specs, and so that is, I don't know if it's like a Mac address
3050780	3054140	reading or what they're doing, but they're doing a hardware ID ban.
3054140	3055500	They drink and they know things.
3055500	3058020	So there's a whole Reddit thread that goes on.
3058020	3059020	Nothing's perfect.
3059020	3060020	They'll find a way to edit.
3060020	3061900	Well, we'll see.
3061900	3066020	But it's really funny to read, there's this Reddit thread going on, there's like 19 edits
3066020	3069980	on the thread with this guy on Twitch who's screaming.
3069980	3073540	And he's like, he got banned for the second time in 10 minutes.
3073540	3075660	And then he says, I didn't use my personal info anywhere.
3075660	3076660	That's the frustrating part.
3076660	3079100	I'm going to run every single fucking cleaner I have.
3079100	3080400	And then he rebooted the PC.
3080400	3083900	And then he says, all right, I guess I have to find a new game to cheat on until I get
3083900	3085380	a working spoofer again.
3085380	3086380	That's edit five.
3086380	3087380	And then it keeps going.
3087380	3088380	I'll be back tomorrow.
3088380	3089380	You better fucking believe it.
3089380	3090380	It's just a soft bet.
3090380	3091380	Da da da.
3091380	3092380	And they edit seven.
3092380	3093380	Apex can suck my dick.
3093380	3094380	They can't keep me out.
3094380	3099540	What people don't understand is that they're so fucking big they can't control everywhere.
3099540	3103260	Seeing this guy get owned makes me so happy.
3103260	3108360	Like you're not wanted in this game by.
3108360	3112820	Don't let the door hit you.
3112820	3115620	Makes me happy.
3115620	3117100	I mean, what is very satisfying?
3117100	3121120	I just want to go in the comments and just fuss at them or laugh.
3121120	3125820	Just nothing but like as many characters as it would let me is ha.
3125820	3129540	God, some of these edits are crazy.
3129540	3132900	Dishonesty isn't toxic, but OK, I'm not toxic.
3132900	3135620	All I do is kill people.
3135620	3137140	Wow.
3137140	3138460	Anyway.
3138460	3139720	Ah.
3139720	3144680	So anyway, I'm I'm I'm really glad to hear that they've found a way to like make at least
3144680	3148660	ban them harder than they have been doing historically.
3148660	3154100	Well, yeah, because, you know, again, it's one thing to cheat in a single player game.
3154100	3155340	It's it's one thing to cheat co-op.
3155340	3157820	If everybody knows that they're signing up for it, then whatever.
3157820	3158820	Right.
3158820	3162420	But it's another thing to go into these one versus 100 type of games is what apex is and
3162420	3164900	flex your opinion, which is fake.
3164900	3165980	It's Viagra.
3165980	3166980	It's fake.
3166980	3169380	It's a fake pain because you're cheating to do it.
3169380	3170500	And you know, for what?
3170500	3175860	To just, you know, yeah, I won, except I can't win without cheating because I have no skills.
3175860	3176860	Yeah.
3176860	3177860	Look at how awesome I am.
3177860	3179940	I don't understand what L.O.
3179940	3183260	How does that make you feel good that you beat people, but you suck?
3183260	3186480	I don't understand how that works or it's L.O.L.
3186480	3188340	I ruined all these people's day.
3188340	3190700	They're probably sitting there crying.
3190700	3193460	Who's crying now?
3193460	3194460	Who's crying now?
3194460	3196580	I need some tea to sip right now.
3196580	3197580	You are.
3197580	3198580	Oh.
3198580	3199580	Yep.
3199580	3200580	Fuck cheaters.
3200580	3201580	All right.
3201580	3205540	Anyhow, let's move on.
3205540	3206540	Dark Sakura.
3206540	3211540	Well, finally, finally, finally, finally, you can change your PSN ID.
3211540	3220020	It actually is live now for North America, Europe and Australia for anyone on the PS4.
3220020	3225620	Some games may have issues after you change your ID, but you need to make sure that some
3225620	3229800	of the games, you know, if they're big games that you have a worry about, you need to make
3229800	3232260	sure that they're going to be fine with the name change.
3232260	3238660	A lot of the big ones like Fortnite, Destiny 2, those are fine.
3238660	3242460	So basically it, you know, a lot of people have asked for it.
3242460	3249140	People will put like, like, I'm trying to think of like a really crappy username, like
3249340	3250340	Rob Roberts.
3250340	3251340	No.
3252340	3258340	Oh, you mean like a shitty toilet person type of name like, like, um, like lead hacks or
3258340	3259340	101.
3259340	3260340	Okay.
3260340	3266780	And then decide, oh no, I actually want to be like, like just cool guy number two.
3266780	3268780	Reformed troll 101.
3268780	3269780	Oh yeah.
3269780	3274980	Like, or, you know, have someone's ex go in and change your name to angry crusty bridge
3274980	3275980	troll.
3275980	3277180	You know, something like that.
3277220	3278980	I'm sure someone actually is that.
3278980	3279980	Oh, perfect.
3279980	3281980	X, X Sephiroth 420 X, X.
3281980	3282980	Perfect.
3282980	3283980	Perfect example.
3284980	3290980	Anyway, um, the first time that you change it, it is free, but it will cost you afterwards.
3290980	3294980	Um, $10, um, or eight pounds.
3294980	3300980	Uh, if, if you just have a regular account, if you're plus, then it's five or four pounds,
3300980	3302980	$5 or four pounds.
3302980	3306940	So you can change it as much as you want.
3306940	3311540	You can always revert back to any previous version of your ID for free.
3311540	3318100	If you contact PlayStation support, no one can take your old IDs so you can choose to
3318100	3321340	display your old ID next to your new one for up to 30 days so that your friends will know
3321340	3323660	it was you doesn't do good.
3323660	3330340	If you were trying to hide who you were, child accounts cannot change their ID.
3330740	3337740	So, you know, if you have, you know, mommy's a little gamer girl, 23 cause it's her 23rd,
3337740	3342540	you know, gamer girl child, she can't go, God damn, this name sucks, mom.
3342540	3346340	I want it to be blood rage woman, you know, or something like that.
3346340	3347340	She can't do it.
3347340	3349740	So I would have blood rage woman though.
3349740	3351740	Just saying, of course you would.
3351740	3355740	I would just have, here's, here's the thing though on PlayStation.
3355940	3360740	Like, I don't, I don't like the gamer tags or the usernames, whatever they call them.
3360740	3363740	I don't like, because I can never remember who's who.
3363740	3365140	Some of them are obvious.
3365140	3368540	Like when I see Bobby Black Wolf, like I know who that fucking is.
3368540	3369040	Right.
3369040	3374540	And usually like if your name kind of matches misty, OLR, I know who that is because that's
3374540	3378840	her name every single place, which bless you for having OLR in your name in the first place.
3378840	3383240	But, um, you know, there's some people where it's like their one name here, their one name
3383240	3386240	on PlayStation, their one name in Twitch chat, their one name over here, which, you know,
3386240	3386840	it's your life.
3386840	3390840	You are welcomed as many identities as you want, but I can't keep them all together.
3390840	3395840	So I love Facebook's name implementation where you can trade.
3395840	3396440	I don't.
3396440	3400840	And so that way, oh, because you don't, because you don't use a fake name on Facebook like
3400840	3401840	I do.
3401840	3402840	So I don't care who knows.
3402840	3403840	Well, no, no, no.
3403840	3411140	I, I have, I don't really want to say this live, but I know plenty of people who Facebook's
3411140	3414940	name policy is highly detrimental to their safety.
3414940	3416740	Oh, we've talked about this on the show before.
3416740	3417740	Sure.
3417740	3418740	Especially, especially in the trans community.
3418740	3423440	That's why I don't like to have a single name like that.
3423440	3426540	I would rather people, people be able to have a handle.
3426540	3427540	Well, okay.
3427540	3431700	But to be fair, like, here's the thing I w when it comes to like your Facebook name,
3431700	3435740	you and the friend have to agree to show each other the name.
3435740	3437940	So like randos don't see it.
3437940	3442740	So like I, I, and usually I'm the one to do it cause I'm using a fake name on Facebook
3442740	3443740	anyway.
3443740	3445240	Um, I will go reach out.
3445240	3446240	I'm like, who is this?
3446240	3449440	And I'll just go do a close friend request and see if they accept it.
3449440	3450440	And most of the times they do.
3450440	3452940	And then I'm like, oh, it's this person.
3452940	3456540	And then you see their Facebook, uh, picture and I'm like, okay, it's that person.
3456540	3464740	Now I know who it is because I had no clue who X, X, X, Sephiroth 42069, uh, weed.king.com,
3464740	3467740	X, X, X is like, I had no idea who that was.
3467740	3469740	And now that guy sounds so awesome though.
3469740	3471940	Well, the problem was he probably picked that name when he was 13.
3471940	3473840	He couldn't change it till yesterday.
3473840	3479940	So it's like, you know, perhaps the two triple X is, it's a bit much.
3479940	3487040	I sure really only done one triple X, but if you triple, triple X, then does that mean
3487040	3489140	like extra fun times?
3489140	3490140	Yes.
3490140	3494140	It doesn't sound fun to me.
3494140	3495140	Interesting.
3495140	3497040	I'm, I'm getting some comments in chat.
3497040	3499140	I'm reading like Bobby's, um, story.
3499140	3504740	Cause you know, he has, I think on, on, uh, uh, one of the services, he has a name that
3504740	3508500	a lot of people really want cause the very like common more thing.
3508500	3512740	And like he's been offered money to get off that name so that other people could use that,
3512740	3516840	you know, on Twitter when my, cause I, you know, y'all know I changed my Twitter account
3516840	3517840	like six months ago.
3517840	3522300	So I'm now Mr. Rob Roberts on Twitter because I just don't use the online name sky as much
3522300	3526100	anymore, which I realize is in the intro to our show, but at some point we'll get our
3526100	3527100	intro updated.
3527100	3531580	But, um, when I had, because I've had my Twitter account for 12 years and I know that cause
3531580	3533200	I got one of the memory things the other day.
3533200	3536700	So when I first went on Twitter, I got on Twitter really early and my username was at
3536700	3541160	S K I E at a four letter name, pretty hard to get right.
3541160	3544700	And I would have people tweet me like, can I have your name?
3544700	3550040	Um, no, this is apparently like, especially in some other cultures overseas, that's like
3550040	3554160	people's like legit first name is S K I E and stuff, but it's like, no, I picked it
3554160	3555160	first.
3555160	3556160	Sorry.
3556160	3557380	You know, this is my identity online.
3557380	3558720	You know, this is my name too.
3558720	3560400	And in a sense I can't.
3560400	3566760	So what I did when I went onto Mr. Rob Roberts, I tried to grab sky back as fast as I could
3566760	3571920	because my plan was I would let that name go when I could get at Rob Roberts, which
3571920	3573560	is spammers sitting on right now.
3573560	3577840	I couldn't get it back because Twitter won't let you get an account name under five or
3577840	3579280	six letters anymore.
3579280	3581360	So nobody can have that name anyway.
3581360	3585560	So anyway, you were the last, I was the, I was the first and the last.
3585560	3589840	I get people asking me for dark Sakura and I'm like, fuck, you know, no, it's my name.
3589840	3591660	We have OLR.
3591660	3592660	We do.
3592660	3593660	We do have OLR on Twitter.
3593660	3594660	And that's a three.
3594660	3595660	And why would I let that go?
3595660	3596660	Yeah.
3596660	3601040	So even, even if the show were to end someday, it would still be an archive of all the episodes
3601040	3603240	of this show that ever had existed.
3603240	3610560	It's going to be, no, it's going to be inherited by like Julian and all the cool kids.
3610560	3615520	Honestly that's where this is headed is that there'll probably be a gen two of OLR at some
3615520	3616520	point.
3616520	3617880	So, and I'm okay with that.
3617880	3618880	Yeah.
3618880	3619880	Why not?
3619880	3620880	I'm going to be doing this when I'm 90.
3620880	3626960	I'm going to be like, just like Iris Apfel with my big huge ass glasses and just be like,
3626960	3627960	fuck you.
3627960	3628960	Games suck.
3628960	3631600	Well, it's like, it's like we've got this record now.
3631600	3638480	Like we've been doing this video game podcast fee thing longer than anybody else can consistently
3638480	3642760	like weekly, you know, some people are really close and I'm sure would love to see us hang
3642760	3646680	up, hang up our hats, but it's like, it's one of those things where, you know, in a
3646680	3650180	friendly competitive way, nobody's really like cutthroat.
3650180	3653960	But I, I it's, it's one of those things where it's like, it's so such a habit.
3653960	3655880	How can we ever stop?
3655880	3659080	What would I do on my Sunday nights?
3659080	3660080	Watch Game of Thrones.
3661080	3662080	Not for much longer.
3662080	3665080	I can't even do that much longer.
3665080	3668920	You have to watch the Game of Thrones prequel that they'll do.
3668920	3672520	I know, you know, now the thing I see like all now is like the memes, it's all the Game
3672520	3673720	of Thrones fans.
3673720	3675320	There's tons of memes on here already.
3675320	3679840	Well, no, but they put these memes out there that say, nobody cares that you don't watch
3679840	3683160	Game of Thrones, asshole, let us have our moment.
3683160	3685020	And I'm like, okay, wait a minute though.
3685020	3688400	Like I don't watch Game of Thrones, but I don't like, I'm not shitting on people who
3688400	3689400	do.
3689720	3695960	I feel a meme from a friend of mine or a friend of ours, I guess I should say, but everyone
3695960	3697280	who's going out going, well, I don't watch it.
3697280	3698280	I don't watch it.
3698280	3699280	I don't like good for you.
3699280	3704720	Literally no one cares, but I, it's, it's a Cersei quote, every breath you draw in my
3704720	3710500	presence annoys me, but, but why can't I say I don't watch it?
3710500	3713260	Like it's not like, it's one thing to say, I don't watch it.
3713260	3716780	It's another thing you like you'd be, Oh, I don't watch it, you know, but other people
3716780	3720860	who make a big fucking deal and it's not watching it, it's, it's, here's the thing.
3720860	3726060	It's when it implied I don't watch it and people who do are stupid.
3726060	3727140	That's then I get that.
3727140	3730520	Be mad at that because let people enjoy things.
3730520	3731520	Just let people enjoy things.
3731520	3732520	And I'm all about that.
3732520	3737220	But like when people like expect me to know Game of Thrones, it's so noisy when people
3737220	3742480	like things, when people expect me to know Game of Thrones or I'm not a real nerd, I'm
3742480	3745540	like, okay, real nerd.
3745540	3748980	You want to talk about why I haven't been watching Game of Thrones?
3748980	3753780	Cause I do this other thing online, Sunday nights with literally half of my fucking life.
3753780	3757660	So you want to talk, you want to talk about nerd?
3757660	3758660	We'll talk about nerd.
3758660	3759660	I'll do this.
3759660	3761660	Have you read the books?
3761660	3762660	There's that too.
3762660	3763660	Have you read the books?
3763660	3767980	Did you see the four hour version of Dune?
3767980	3769260	But what was your first movie?
3769260	3772220	Mine was fucking Star Wars and I was nine months fucking old.
3772220	3777020	For the record, if you're watching the Game of Thrones and you're having a good time,
3777020	3778020	the hats off.
3778020	3779020	Enjoy it.
3779020	3780020	Live it up.
3780020	3781100	Embrace your nerd passion.
3781100	3782100	Love it.
3782100	3785220	Um, and I hope, I hope everybody dies because that's what seems to happen every week on
3785220	3786780	that show and people lose their shit.
3786780	3787780	So they like it.
3787780	3788780	Right?
3788780	3790780	I only literally care about one character that I don't want to die.
3790780	3796420	Anyway, actually three, three characters, uh, Akuma JP in chat says Game of Thrones,
3796420	3798140	too much sex for me.
3798140	3799140	There is.
3799140	3800140	I think that's what I think.
3800620	3801620	I know.
3801620	3804180	I know you're from another part of the world, but I'm going to let you in on a little secret
3804180	3805820	about like America.
3805820	3810220	I think that's why nerds like it.
3810220	3811220	Just just an inquiry.
3811220	3815660	I honestly, I just wait and fast forward pass all the shit I don't want to see because I'm
3815660	3816660	not into it.
3816660	3817660	I'm, I'm ace.
3817660	3818660	I don't like the gory stuff.
3818660	3821500	It doesn't add to anything watching this like, okay, good.
3821500	3822500	They fucked.
3822500	3823500	Whatever.
3823500	3824500	Yeah.
3824500	3826040	You, you would just rather see the black screen that says, and then they fuck.
3826040	3829300	But both sex, both sex.
3829740	3830740	That's the thing in Game of Thrones.
3830740	3831740	You watch this.
3831740	3832740	Don't you?
3832740	3833740	I watch Game of Thrones.
3833740	3834740	Of course.
3834740	3835740	Of course.
3835740	3836740	I could know.
3836740	3837740	Of course.
3837740	3838740	That's, I called it on demand, dude.
3838740	3839740	I mean, geez.
3839740	3840740	Like watch it later.
3840740	3841740	Okay.
3841740	3842740	But I shipped it on the ship.
3842740	3843740	Aha.
3843740	3844740	Okay.
3844740	3845740	Here's the thing.
3845740	3846740	Yes.
3846740	3847740	That's the number one thing I get told by all the Game of Thrones fans.
3847740	3848740	Oh, you did something.
3848740	3849740	So now watch it on demand.
3849740	3852140	I got two reasons for you.
3852140	3855540	Number one, have you seen my on demand cue lately?
3855540	3859300	Did you, did you miss the memo that like fucking everything went to on demand sometime
3859300	3860300	ago?
3860300	3861300	Like respectfully.
3861300	3862300	There's just a ton of shit to watch.
3862300	3864060	This is why I'd watch jack shit.
3864060	3866460	So that when something really awesome is out, I can watch it.
3866460	3870440	Number two, because there's so many of you that enjoy it and that's cool too.
3870440	3872900	You all have spoiled it by the next day.
3872900	3876300	Like I literally saw a tweet earlier that said, if you don't want Game of Thrones spoiled
3876300	3879660	for you, then stay off Twitter at night.
3879660	3880660	That's what I'm doing.
3880660	3884380	This is the exact same person who said, I'm looking for spoilers right now.
3884380	3885380	Don't don't.
3885380	3886380	Obviously we all know not to say them on air.
3886380	3887380	If you want to seek them out.
3887380	3888380	That's one thing.
3888380	3889380	I'm doing it.
3889380	3890380	I'm looking for them.
3890380	3891380	Go for it.
3891380	3895820	But, um, I was gonna say, um, uh, this is the exact same person who then says, if you
3895820	3898740	brag about how you don't watch Game of Thrones, you're an asshole.
3898740	3903200	And I'm kind of like, you can't have it both ways, sis.
3903200	3906660	How are the rest of us supposed to watch Game of Thrones when you're sitting here going,
3906660	3912980	but I'm going to spoil it as soon as it airs and it's your, you can't have it both ways.
3913580	3914580	Anyway.
3914580	3915580	Sorry.
3915580	3916580	It is a video game show.
3916580	3917580	I don't know why.
3917580	3919340	Well, I also didn't really care for chair of swords because I tried reading the first
3919340	3920340	book in the first book.
3920340	3922260	Actually, I literally hated everybody.
3922260	3924860	I hated everybody for like the first three seasons.
3924860	3929420	Ooh, you're edgy because you don't like Game of Thrones.
3929420	3936500	But then I discovered characters I liked and then saw the ones I hated die or about to
3936500	3937500	die.
3937500	3938500	So it's like Mass Effect kind of.
3938500	3939500	Yeah, it is kind of like that.
3939500	3940500	All right.
3940500	3941500	Moving on.
3941500	3942500	Let's get back to games.
3943020	3944020	I'm happy.
3944020	3947580	I don't know how we went from PS4 name changes to Game of Thrones podcast waiting for my
3947580	3950260	fucking $20 burrito.
3950260	3951700	Let's move on.
3951700	3956060	Let's talk about a world where the Vita is still getting games.
3956060	3957060	Wow.
3957060	3958060	Physical games.
3958060	3960620	So, uh, was it Nasalis?
3960620	3962620	I think that's how you pronounce it.
3962620	3968380	They're publishing a couple of physical copies or physical versions of a thousand one spikes
3968380	3969700	and VVVVVV.
3969700	3971820	I love this box art for VVVV.
3971820	3975720	I wish I'd had the forethought to make a video thing I could put on Twitch.
3975720	3981260	I love the VVVVV cover because that looks like an old Commodore 64 cartridge.
3981260	3982260	Yeah.
3982260	3985140	It looks like if you guys have seen like old Commodore 64 cartridges with like it's like
3985140	3987580	the same font and design and everything.
3987580	3988580	It's gorgeous.
3988580	3989580	Yes.
3989580	3991580	So, I mean, I it's awesome.
3991580	3993780	I don't have a Vita anymore, so.
3993780	3995740	But yeah, I love the box art.
3995740	3997540	I know that came out for other systems.
3997540	3999580	I'm surprised they're not publishing on other systems, too.
3999580	4003580	Thousand one spikes, to be clear, though, is actually a PlayStation 4 version.
4003580	4005780	So Vita is getting VVVV.
4005780	4010860	But yeah, it's pretty awesome to see those physical versions.
4010860	4014220	And this, I don't think I don't believe this is actually by Limited Run either.
4014220	4017100	So this is actually being published by Nasalis.
4017100	4022380	So coming soon, apparently they did leak out early to the promo, promo copies that they
4022380	4026900	had been floating to like Sony employees had somehow made it to eBay.
4026900	4029220	It's still a collectible of sorts, really, at this point.
4029220	4030960	So that's pretty cool.
4030960	4033660	Over in chat, Renji221 asked, what's a Vita?
4033660	4039140	Well, put up a chair, Sony, and let me tell you a story.
4039140	4042980	One day, Sony thought they'd compete with Nintendo in a handheld space.
4042980	4045740	So that's almost worth being $20 or $13.
4045740	4047740	Don't interrupt grandpa's story with your burrito.
4047740	4048740	You know what?
4048740	4049740	It's a burrito and it's delicious.
4049740	4050740	No one cares because they're not eating it.
4050740	4051740	Discrito, burrito.
4051740	4056140	Yeah, you need to be a little more discrito with that burrito.
4056660	4057660	All right.
4057660	4059660	Other comments in chat.
4059660	4061660	Let's see.
4061660	4067100	Oh, Akuma JP in chat says, I'm playing Stardew for the first time on iOS.
4067100	4068460	So bye bye free time.
4068460	4069460	Yeah, that happens.
4069460	4072220	It's interesting how we discover big games after the fact.
4072220	4076260	And sometimes it's because it's on a platform, you know, the right platform that we want
4076260	4077260	to play it on.
4077260	4080180	Who knows what big games I have in my Steam library that I've never played.
4080180	4081980	I know there's hundreds of them.
4081980	4089140	So I thought there was something you could use to like, look at the, like, it's coming.
4089140	4091160	Look at your library and see what you haven't played.
4091160	4092160	It's coming soon.
4092160	4093620	That's an update to the Steam store.
4093620	4094620	Oh boy.
4094620	4095620	Library.
4095620	4096620	I can't wait to see that.
4096620	4097860	We talked about that a couple of weeks ago.
4097860	4098860	Okay.
4098860	4099860	Yeah.
4099860	4100860	I thought that was the thing that come up recently.
4100860	4101860	All right.
4101860	4102860	Anyway.
4102860	4103860	All right.
4103860	4104860	Uh, moving on.
4104860	4111220	Let's, uh, talk about our next story, which has to do with a, uh, leaked little, uh, information,
4111220	4118300	little sheet of information about the disc free Xbox one, uh, a site called win future
4118300	4123320	got images that show off the, and take it with a grain of salt because people are weird
4123320	4125260	and do photo shops and all that stuff.
4125260	4130980	But I mean, we have heard so much buzz around the, this, like nothing is shocking with this.
4130980	4133560	I wouldn't be talking about it if it wasn't one of those.
4133560	4138420	This is, we know that Microsoft has been headed this way where there's smoke, there's fire.
4138420	4142780	But anyway, but some of the specifics, somebody could be fucking with us, but they're probably
4142780	4143940	not to be fair.
4143940	4149140	So anyway, uh, the design is what looks like an Xbox one S, but there's just no drive on
4149140	4150140	it.
4150140	4151140	How about that?
4151140	4153900	Uh, it made it much smaller though without the drive in there.
4153900	4156820	Cause you would think that the drive takes up quite a bit of space.
4156820	4157820	Yeah.
4157820	4159620	You'd think, I don't know why they decided to still keep it the same.
4159620	4163540	Assuming that that's legit because that totally looks like someone just photoshopped out the,
4163540	4166020	uh, you know, actual drive image.
4166020	4168380	So maybe that's you that maybe it isn't legit.
4168380	4171140	Whatever dude, like really like a month away from it apparently being released.
4171140	4175260	Well, it's supposed to have a one terabyte hard drive and the Europe version, cause I
4175260	4179580	think that's the version that actually leaked out the Europe version we'll have for Forza
4179580	4181300	horizon three.
4181300	4183140	It should be noted that four is the current one.
4183140	4188020	So it's an older one, but Forza horizon three Minecraft and sea of thieves will already
4188020	4189020	be installed.
4189020	4192380	So you have something like old three though.
4192380	4197420	It's still a good game if you're new to the universe because they want you to play and
4197420	4202260	enjoy three and then, Oh, click this button to purchase for now or buy X-Box game pass
4202260	4206420	for only XYZ a month and or that should just be ABC a year.
4206420	4212220	Just with withhold the games, like withhold actually purchasing, you know, or including
4212220	4213220	like additional games.
4213220	4214220	You're like cut that game out.
4214220	4215220	Like how much is that game worth?
4215220	4221100	I mean like 20 bucks maybe well 30 but I think these, I don't think they're, I, I feel like
4221100	4226260	the price they're charging for it, which by the way is, is speculated to be 230 euros
4226260	4229100	or $260 is what that translates to.
4229100	4232540	So like just cut the cost out of there and just like throw a few months in is that I
4232540	4233900	think these are kind of freebies.
4233900	4237660	I think Microsoft, I don't think Microsoft isn't is inflating the price.
4237660	4241860	I think they're throwing in these freebies to make that price a little more like lucrative.
4241860	4247020	Oh, I'm saying is they should do game pass instead of at one of the games.
4247020	4251300	You know what I would do, I would support that because you know, Minecraft is one of
4251300	4254760	the games that's supposed to be in there as well, you know, eventually.
4254760	4259560	So why not just do game pass so you get the fours of game and the other one and see if
4259560	4262080	these, I think all those game pass games actually.
4262080	4265720	So just game pass, no game, I don't know.
4265720	4266720	All right.
4266720	4269640	Well, anyhow, that is apparently what's going to happen.
4269640	4274320	They're saying April 16th is the unveiling, which would be like Tuesday.
4274320	4278960	Is there a, is there a, is there like an inside Xbox plan pretty soon?
4278960	4279960	I don't know.
4279960	4283440	I don't remember either, but April 16th about is supposed to be the day that this shows
4283440	4285960	up and they're saying May 7th will be the release.
4285960	4289960	So this is all supposed to be kind of wrapped up by E3.
4289960	4294240	So this isn't something they're planning to unveil at E3, I guess.
4294240	4295240	So yeah, we'll have to see.
4295240	4296240	Interesting.
4296240	4297240	Yeah, we will.
4297240	4300800	Yeah, actually they do have, it says an all new episode of inside Xbox on Tuesday, April
4300800	4305540	16th at 2 PM or 5, 2 PM Pacific, 5 PM Eastern time.
4305540	4306540	There you go.
4306540	4308480	That date matches up with what we're hearing here.
4308480	4311880	Latest news on E3, including Xbox Fan Fest and more.
4311880	4315680	So there you go, possibly then.
4315680	4318080	That will probably be the day we get the specifics, if anything.
4318080	4320800	So tune in if that's your thing, I guess.
4320800	4321800	Yeah.
4321800	4322800	Yeah.
4322800	4323800	Cool.
4323800	4326120	Um, I also want to point out in our chat, our Renji221 in chat says, honestly, I think
4326120	4330620	Horizon 3 is better than 4, but that's just me.
4330620	4334480	That's an interesting kind of perspective is that maybe 3 is the better, 3 did have
4334480	4335480	the Hot Wheels thing.
4335480	4337200	Does this have all the expansions?
4337200	4340080	Cause maybe that, is it 4 is Horizon 3 with the expansions?
4340280	4344800	Cause that would be pretty rad because that Hot Wheels was pretty cool and maybe, maybe
4344800	4349520	they, maybe some folks think 3 is the better representative.
4349520	4350520	Who knows?
4350520	4351520	Who knows?
4351520	4352520	All right.
4352520	4355040	Anyhow, uh, let's move on with Dark Sakura.
4355040	4361160	Well, for fans of, uh, the Star Wars prequel, some looks like something kind of good is
4361160	4367360	coming out of it because the rest of it was kind of shit, but the pod race was cool.
4367360	4372280	Well, there is a game coming out called Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.
4372280	4377320	That's a third person action adventure game coming up by Respawn will be on X-Box 4, X-Box
4377320	4379600	1 and PC on Origin.
4379600	4386880	Um, because EA is publishing it, um, it's going to be $59.99 standard $69.99 deluxe,
4386880	4390400	but it also has like a director's cut that shows like behind the scenes stuff and content
4390400	4393520	and you know, some cosmetic stuff.
4393520	4399440	But I just like the, um, the, uh, story like that's actually what has me interested is
4399440	4405000	that you play someone who escaped the, uh, order 66 to kill all the Jedi.
4405000	4409000	It's like, it's, what's funny is about like all these games that are based in the prequel
4409000	4412960	era or like literally everything that's come out of Star Wars that's in the prequel era
4412960	4414720	is better than the actual prequels.
4414720	4415720	Exactly.
4415720	4416720	But I don't know.
4416720	4421760	I always thought I, I, I used to be in a tabletop game where we played, you know, remnants of
4421760	4423800	the Jedi order and it was, it was a fun thing.
4423800	4428640	So just to see like my old tabletop game kind of coming to life just was really, really
4428640	4429640	kind of cool.
4429640	4434880	So, um, it's a shame you can't like actually customize your character, you know, do whatever,
4434880	4435880	but whatever.
4435880	4443280	Um, it has, I'm going to mispronounce this name, Cameron Monahan from Gotham Monahan,
4443280	4444960	I think, but close, get close.
4444960	4445960	But anyway.
4445960	4446960	Cool.
4446960	4447960	Anyway, I thought I'd make a mention.
4447960	4448960	It has droids.
4448960	4449960	It has lightsabers.
4449960	4450960	Yeah.
4451160	4453760	So you know what has me more excited, honestly, than anything else about this, the fact that
4453760	4459100	Respawn's making it and Respawn is like a studio to watch right now because Titanfall,
4459100	4463120	you know, was pretty, especially Titanfall, it's Titanfall 2, a lot of people slept on.
4463120	4466980	And of course, Apex Legends is like the hot shit in gaming right now.
4466980	4470560	So the fact that they're the folks that are making the Star Wars game, which many people
4470560	4473640	have also been going, what the fuck is EA doing with the Star Wars?
4473640	4476200	Titanfall 2 had a pretty great single player campaign.
4476200	4479640	So I hear, haven't played it yet, own it, but still haven't played it yet.
4479640	4482880	Talk that up to your inventory, but that would be your origin backlog as well as your
4482880	4483880	Steam backlog.
4483880	4485360	That's my PlayStation backlog, actually.
4485360	4488440	And on top of this, the trailer looks really freaking good.
4488440	4491120	I mean, it's pretty beautiful.
4491120	4494120	So we'll see what happens.
4494120	4497900	Here's our chance to talk about, I know it's a gaming podcast, but why not?
4497900	4499300	We already had one tangent tonight.
4499300	4504960	I'm sure a lot of nerds watching the Star Wars celebration have some thoughts and feelings.
4504960	4508320	Like I have to admit, I haven't, okay, I've been a really bad Star Wars fan.
4508320	4509680	I still haven't seen episode eight.
4509680	4511160	I like, that's like on my to-do list.
4511160	4512440	I need to see it.
4512440	4518120	But I did watch the episode nine trailer and I got verklempt when I saw Carrie Fisher.
4518120	4519520	That was the number one thing I noticed.
4519520	4520520	Yeah.
4520520	4521520	I mean, yeah.
4521520	4522520	Ray jumping over the pod thing.
4522520	4523920	That was badass too.
4523920	4524920	But like...
4524920	4525920	TIE fighter.
4525920	4526920	It's called the TIE fighter.
4526920	4527920	Yeah, whatever.
4527920	4529800	The thingy, the space space plane.
4529800	4531060	TIE fighter.
4531060	4532060	It's like...
4532060	4536520	When she jumped over the space plane, I was like, and it looked like I saw a great side
4536520	4538240	by side comparison on Twitter.
4538240	4541600	That Hitchcock movie North by Northwest when the plane comes in.
4541600	4542600	There's a great side by side.
4542600	4543600	Like that scene looks like that.
4543600	4546680	Yes, I loved when he did a back flip with his lightsaber over the...
4546680	4547680	Shut the fuck up.
4547680	4548680	No, no, no, no.
4548680	4554720	But, but the thing is that the movies actually do take from like some of the cinematic greats.
4554720	4559760	Like the whole Rashomon storytelling when it came to Luke's flashbacks.
4559760	4561360	Oh, wait.
4561360	4562360	Okay.
4562360	4565160	You need to see that one because it has the Rashomon style flashbacks.
4565160	4566160	Okay.
4566200	4569440	And basically you see the same scene from different perspectives.
4569440	4572640	Oh, um, God, who does that a lot in their movies?
4572640	4576200	God, that's like a Tarantino thing actually, Pulp Fiction was kind of that.
4576200	4582320	No, but this is like exactly the same moment from different perspectives.
4582320	4587720	So you have, you'll have to see it, but basically the entirety, I believe it was Rashomon that
4587720	4588720	was told that way.
4588720	4589720	It's Kurosawa.
4589720	4590720	I mean...
4590720	4591720	Who's that famous director?
4591720	4594480	I think, um, um, his first movie was Phantom of the Paradise.
4594480	4595960	That's how all the cult movie people know him.
4595960	4597600	De Palma does that.
4597600	4599360	Like he does the split screen thing.
4599360	4600360	Like, okay.
4600360	4601360	Oh, not the same.
4601360	4602360	Okay.
4602360	4604000	It's basically it, it is interjected at different points.
4604000	4608320	Now I think all of Rashomon was told this way where you have everybody at the same event
4608320	4612920	that different their own perspective on it, but this comes in at key points in the movie
4612920	4617260	as it pushes the narrative, as you get more story and perspective on it, but it's still
4617260	4619440	exactly the same scene.
4619440	4625880	So, but yeah, there's lots of wonderful, wonderful, um, just different.
4625880	4630680	And cinematic quotes, I like to call them, you know, in art, when you see someone refer
4630680	4634600	to the same art style as someone else or something from another painting, it's called a quote.
4634600	4639040	These are definitely quotes back to, you know, other theatrical grades.
4639040	4640440	Can I do a really random thing?
4640440	4641440	Cause you talked about art.
4641440	4642560	Can I do a really random thing?
4642560	4646320	Cause this is something like I should have done like six months ago on Twitch.
4646320	4647320	This is going to be a Twitch thing.
4647320	4648320	Okay.
4648320	4650400	And I apologize to the podcast listeners for this, but this is very important.
4650400	4653120	Can you help me fill time here while I go grab something?
4653120	4654120	Um, sure.
4654160	4658600	I'm just making sure that it is the story that I'm thinking of, that it is Rashomon.
4658600	4662640	Um, that's the short story I'm looking for the movie.
4662640	4668960	Um, but yeah, the, uh, the movie Rashomon, yeah, that's the one I think is the, uh, the
4668960	4673840	one where they tell it a different, yeah, different, uh, levels of the story.
4673840	4676240	And it's another one with Mihone in it, so.
4676240	4680880	So since you brought up art, I've never been able to show this and I'm so happy I can now.
4680880	4683960	This is an example, this is one of my mom's paintings.
4684000	4687160	And so we have a whole collection of paintings.
4687160	4688160	No, this is a good, this is fine.
4688160	4689160	This is fine.
4689160	4694360	Uh, there's a whole collection of paintings that she made, um, before she passed, you
4694360	4696240	know, cause she was a painter like her whole life.
4696240	4700600	So I've never been able to show these on the show before and I just thought I would now
4700600	4701960	that we're on Twitch.
4701960	4702960	So what's that?
4702960	4703960	Nothing.
4703960	4704960	Oh yeah.
4704960	4707760	So anyway, I just thought I would, uh, show that.
4707760	4709720	And I love this painting too cause it's cats.
4709720	4711920	And so she made this with me and mine just so we're clear.
4711920	4713320	I like the penguin one.
4713680	4716280	Yes, there's a pink one that's hung up in the hall though, so I can't exactly take that
4716280	4717360	one down.
4717360	4720960	And for those who don't know, by the way, what Russian one is, there is what the poster
4720960	4721960	looks like.
4721960	4729280	So anyway, but yeah, I, that's been the big kind of nerdy thing for me enjoying the, um,
4729280	4735760	the movies though, is that there really are some wonderful callbacks to just really beautiful
4735760	4737840	movies and just the storytelling.
4737840	4741800	I'm super happy with it, but just like, you know, you were mentioning the one throwback
4741800	4748000	for North by Northwest, which I do believe that the titles for North by Northwest were
4748000	4749680	done by Saul Bass.
4749680	4752440	Let me double check, which is everyone know he's one of my heroes.
4756320	4758680	Yeah, I think it was Saul Bass.
4758680	4759680	Yup.
4759680	4764400	It was Saul Bass who also did the man with golden arm and a man with the silver arm,
4764400	4766680	sorry, and, uh, Vertigo.
4766680	4770720	And he directed the shower scene in Psycho and actually when it came out that he did
4770760	4773440	Hitchcock said he would never talk to him again.
4773440	4774440	Anyway.
4774440	4777520	Uh, anyways, yeah, we, we, uh, before we move on to the next gaming story, anything Star
4777520	4782320	Wars related that anyone wants to get out about everything around this celebration.
4782320	4783320	I'm looking for it in the movie.
4783320	4788040	Yeah, the movie very much because the last two movies are kind of, but the new movie
4788040	4789040	looks awesome.
4789040	4790040	The movies were great.
4790040	4793640	Wait, when we say the last two movies, do we mean spinoffs or do we mean seven and eight,
4793640	4794640	seven, eight?
4794640	4795640	Okay.
4795640	4796640	Cause there were no prequels.
4796640	4799680	So basically remakes of the first two original.
4799680	4800680	No.
4800680	4803880	Well, I, people, people have their different opinions, so we'll see.
4803880	4805800	I still haven't seen eight, but I liked seven.
4805800	4810960	I did definitely see the parallels to the original in seven, but I still really liked
4810960	4813040	seven for what it was, for what it's worth.
4813040	4817140	Um, I will say the thing that definitely has my attention, that's kind of tangential to
4817140	4821720	Star Wars, this whole Disney plus and their competitor to Netflix.
4821720	4826600	Like it seems like Disney is like ready to come out the gate with this Disney plus thing
4826600	4828120	it's pretty loaded with stuff.
4828120	4833000	I got to say, I'm not looking forward to having yet another subscription, but I have a weird
4833000	4836960	feeling that the marketplace is going to force some of these things to consolidate before
4836960	4838080	too long.
4838080	4841240	Just like Spotify and Hulu have kind of joined forces here.
4841240	4843680	I think you're going to start to see more of that stuff show up.
4843680	4845280	I'm looking forward to Hawkeye series.
4845280	4846280	Oh yeah.
4846280	4847680	Cause that's a Disney thing, huh?
4847680	4848680	Yeah.
4848680	4853120	Well it's Marvel, but, um, but it's going to be taking, um, it said that like one of
4853120	4856640	my favorite comic characters who was like the girl who took over as Hawkeye while he
4856640	4860040	was dead in the comics, Kate Bishop, she's supposed to be in it too.
4860040	4861040	So that'd be really awesome.
4861040	4862040	All right.
4862040	4865160	Well meanwhile, we'll also look forward to whatever Lucasville's games is working on
4865160	4867920	because that was a story a couple of weeks ago that Lucasville's games apparently making
4867920	4868920	the comeback.
4868920	4869920	All right.
4869920	4870920	Well, anyhow, let's move on.
4870920	4874040	We have a couple more stories before we get to our classic segment of the week or is it
4874040	4875400	month this week?
4875400	4876400	Uh, Loki.
4876400	4877400	Yeah.
4877400	4882600	So there's a rumor that the next, uh, Assassin's Creed game has been teased in the division
4882600	4883780	two.
4883780	4889940	Apparently there's a poster that can be found inside the Potomac events center.
4889940	4896480	And one of those shows the title Valhalla, which of course, uh, features kind of a Viking
4896480	4898520	character in there.
4898520	4902660	They are saying that the Viking appears to be grasping the apple of Eden, which they
4902660	4911620	says the main plot device, and that, uh, apparently the following, um, or following Assassin's
4911620	4914300	Creed Odyssey, the next game is going to be set in the Viking age.
4914300	4918700	I think it's just kind of a guess, but maybe, I mean, it seems plausible since they were
4918700	4923500	kind of using my word since, since, since, you know, they kind of threw in, I think some
4923500	4925860	like Greek mythology stuff with the last one.
4925860	4926860	So why not?
4926860	4932300	It fits the Assassin's Creed kind of M O and Vikings is not something they've explored
4932300	4933300	yet.
4933300	4934300	Right.
4934300	4935300	We haven't had a game in that.
4935300	4938860	So it fits the, the, the mold, let's say, and would, I think it's something people would
4938860	4939860	be interested in.
4939860	4943700	I know that even though I'm not super into the Assassin's Creed games, I know that what
4943700	4947260	I want to happen, if this is the direction for Assassin's Creed, is that if my character
4947260	4951140	gets defeated in Assassin's Creed, I want to have a Viking funeral.
4951140	4952860	I think that would be fantastic.
4952860	4957060	So I hope that plea, as long as a Viking funeral, which, you know, of course is when they put
4957060	4959740	you on a boat, say you have to see, and then light the boat on fire where they're shooting
4959740	4960980	all the arrows at it.
4960980	4963740	That is what I hope to see reflected in this game.
4963740	4964740	Okay.
4964740	4966220	Well, you don't want to see a Viking funeral?
4966220	4967220	No.
4967220	4970900	I know someone who did that for their cat.
4970900	4972580	That's kind of, I don't know.
4972580	4973580	I don't know.
4973580	4974580	It's weird.
4974580	4976820	It's a little, I guess if that's what helped them through it, that was also a Norwegian
4976820	4977820	forest cat.
4977820	4978820	Oh, okay.
4978820	4980260	So there's a reason for it.
4980260	4981260	Yeah.
4981260	4982260	Interesting.
4982260	4983260	Okay.
4983260	4984260	All right.
4984260	4985260	Uh, all right.
4985260	4986260	I just like sitting cats on fire.
4986260	4987260	So I know their cat was dead.
4987260	4988260	That was already deceased.
4988460	4991140	Didn't say the cat wasn't alive.
4991140	4993420	Right.
4993420	4995700	One more completely different topic here.
4995700	4999740	Before we get to the classic game segment, actually, um, I think it would be appropriate
4999740	5001200	to talk about this service.
5001200	5003740	This was something that was brought to my attention completely on our discord.
5003740	5008640	I had no idea that this was a thing that was going on, but then dark Tetsuya I think, or,
5008640	5012540	you know, the topic came up in our discord server, which if you're not on our discord
5012540	5014500	survey, you should think about joining it.
5014500	5019180	Gog network.com slash discord is the only URL you need to get an invite right on into
5019180	5020180	the server.
5020180	5022900	And I would certainly encourage you to join that cause that's how you can call into the
5022900	5024220	show later as well.
5024220	5028820	But um, anyway, the story was posting the orange launch radio channel is that we, and
5028820	5032680	we've been talking about this just as recently as like last week, like whatever happened
5032680	5038140	to services like game tap and the classic games and why, why isn't somebody taking the
5038140	5040980	advantage to do a streaming service for classic games?
5040980	5042780	Well, how about this?
5042780	5046700	It's apparently one has been being developed for a little while and they just went on a
5046700	5048260	Kickstarter this week.
5048260	5054220	So, but in usually I wouldn't talk about Kickstarter things, but in kind of reading the website
5054220	5059740	in reading their pitch on Kickstarter, I kind of got the impression of we're doing this,
5059740	5062580	whether this Kickstarter succeeds or not.
5062580	5066180	This Kickstarter just seems to be a way to offer these kinds of earlier perks and maybe
5066180	5069620	get the word out, which I guess, you know, successful cause here we are talking about
5069620	5073820	on our show when I guess this has been a thing that's been in development for a while
5073820	5075640	and I had like no idea.
5075640	5077660	So the service is called ant stream.
5077660	5080980	I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but I think the logo is really cute cause
5080980	5082580	it looks like a little ant or whatever.
5082580	5087260	They are saying that ant stream will have a beta launch on mobile devices.
5087260	5091260	So iOS and Android, PC and Xbox one.
5091260	5095200	And the early backers are set to get in in early may, which I guess is probably when
5095200	5096580	this Kickstarter is about to finish up.
5096580	5101340	Cause I think the Kickstarter has got about 25 days left on it.
5101340	5106020	And so when it goes into beta, you are going to be able to play curated titles from the
5106020	5107980	seventies, eighties and nineties.
5107980	5114900	They are mentioning titles like Akari Warriors, Joe and Mac, California Games, Zool and Double
5114900	5116260	Dragon.
5116260	5120740	It was pointed out that a couple of weeks ago, one of the parody intros we had here
5120740	5126860	at OLR, we had the epics game store, the EPYX game store, because it was a play on
5126860	5133500	me always talking about EPIC apostrophe S when really the story is called the epic game
5133500	5134500	store.
5134500	5137580	And so you're not supposed to call it epics game store cause it sounds like the old company
5137580	5144980	from the eighties, but ironically that epics, the EPYX looks to be a company that is partnered
5144980	5148340	on this service because you go look at the games list, which they're showing off what
5148340	5150900	400 games, right?
5150900	5154620	And epics games are all over this list and it's very similar to the type of stuff you'd
5154620	5158380	see like on the mini Commodore 64 and some of these other places right now, but it's
5158380	5159380	not just limited to that.
5159380	5160380	Right.
5160380	5163820	It looks like they've got, you know, like Akari Warriors would be like Data East appears
5163820	5164820	to be on this.
5164820	5169280	A lot of these SNK, Codemasters, a lot of these retro friendly companies you've seen
5169280	5173100	in other places too, but with their really old stuff.
5173100	5177460	So I mean, certainly there's that question that's going to be asked, well, why not just,
5177460	5179180	why not just use emulators?
5179180	5180180	Right?
5180180	5186100	Well, and I, I even called this out as one reason I liked to play on GameTap was they
5186100	5190460	had the additional features like the replays, like the high scores so I could compete with
5190460	5191760	my friends.
5191760	5197640	And so that's why like this caught my eye and Stream will be having unique multiplayer
5197640	5198640	challenges.
5198640	5205740	So it will put twists on some of the games like score attacks, speed runs and boss rushes.
5205740	5210260	So there's a whole spiel you can check out over on their Kickstarter, which if you just
5210260	5215060	start for Antstream or go to antstream.com, I really want to invite them on the show.
5215060	5218580	I'll probably do that in the coming weeks here since they got a Kickstarter going on
5218580	5219580	anyway.
5219580	5224300	Cause I just like, it's funny because I feel like I S I said this out loud, like one or
5224300	5229100	two weeks ago, not obviously I didn't invent this has been in works for years, but I think
5229100	5232420	it's just funny that like, this is relevant.
5232420	5234720	Like I was asking for something like this and here it is.
5234720	5236400	And I got to say, it looks pretty, pretty cool.
5236400	5242560	I mean, there, I think like the early fee, like if you get in early, you can like have
5242560	5247280	your rate frozen at like six, I think $60 a year was like a rate you can get frozen
5247280	5248280	out.
5248280	5250680	I think they said they were going to ask for $10 a month for it.
5250680	5255480	I'm worried that might be a little high for some people for retro games, but I mean, if
5255480	5260880	they're talking like a library of 4,000 games that were, it, it might be kind of worth it,
5260880	5263800	especially if these multiplayer challenges are really good.
5263800	5266040	Like I really want to see the implementation of this.
5266040	5271920	Unfortunately, that's the one thing that Kickstarter's not really showing is, but I, you know, and
5271920	5274680	they're about two thirds of the way to their goal already with, yeah, they're probably
5274680	5276640	going to make their goal, honestly.
5276640	5281200	So I'm curious, I got to say, you know, I'm a sucker for retro games.
5281200	5285760	I love that, like as a retro game enthusiast and somebody who would like stream them a
5285760	5290860	lot, like, because I like to stream games like this would open up a whole new, like
5290860	5292560	zillions of games to stream.
5292560	5294840	So I do want to see something like this succeed.
5294840	5299520	I hope, I hope it is really going to be worth that price that I'm going to be really surprised
5299520	5302440	there, but I'll probably sign onto the Kickstarter.
5302440	5303440	We'll see.
5303440	5304440	So it looks pretty neat.
5304440	5311480	So it says they're fixed price for Antstream is that's if you pledge 55 Euro is $70 a year
5311480	5312480	for it.
5312480	5315240	Yeah, there's, there's weird because they're based in the UK.
5315240	5317760	So you have to, there's some money conversion things going on.
5317760	5323120	It's something like if you put down like $120, you get two years because that's actually
5323120	5324760	the two years and $60.
5324760	5327580	And then you get $60 frozen beyond that, I think.
5327580	5329760	So it's kind of interesting.
5329760	5332160	So I'm, I'm curious, was there early backers already gone?
5332160	5334920	Cause I was looking at doing that and I got lazy and didn't do it.
5334920	5336380	And of course it's already gone.
5336380	5338480	So I mean, that's, that's good for them though.
5338480	5339480	So we'll see.
5339480	5343400	Like I said, I really want to try and invite them on the show to later date because I hope
5343400	5346400	maybe they'll go so far as to be like a virtual museum.
5346400	5351200	Wouldn't it be really cool if like, not only do they have the games, but maybe they have
5351200	5354520	interviews with some of these game makers talking about the games.
5354520	5357960	Like think about like commentary tracks or something, because let's be real, the people
5357960	5361300	who made these games in the eighties and nineties, they're getting older.
5361300	5363140	Some of them are no longer with us.
5363140	5365800	And you know, as people get older, that's going to continue to be the case.
5365800	5369520	They can't have an interface where I can put arcade cabinets and arrange them in certain
5369520	5370520	ways.
5370520	5373640	And, Oh, you take your tongue in cheek reference to game room.
5373640	5374640	Yeah.
5374640	5375640	I'd love that.
5375880	5376880	I'll take what I can get.
5376880	5378320	I kind of think that's all secondary.
5378320	5380040	So yeah.
5380040	5384880	Some folks in chat, S.H.O. 100 Matt saying, like what game room could have been.
5384880	5385880	Yeah.
5385880	5386880	Let's see.
5386880	5389760	Dartitsuya says, yeah, I'm definitely getting a game tap vibe from the service.
5389760	5392200	I'm very interested to see how they do.
5392200	5394280	That's what I thought of when I saw some of those games on the list.
5394280	5399000	I think that was a reference to when we had the Epic store, tongue in cheek joke, who
5399000	5403440	knew that that may actually become a reality of sorts after this.
5403440	5409160	So Metal Mayhem says, yeah, I missed out on the game tap era, but I know you were there
5409160	5413080	for Microsoft's game room era because Kaijuto is asking, what's game room?
5413080	5416800	It was a Microsoft thing that they kind of tried to do with the classic gaming.
5416800	5420400	But I feel like they let it, they pulled the plug on it before it had time to really grow.
5420400	5421400	Yeah.
5421400	5422400	That's unfortunate.
5422400	5423400	So anyway.
5423400	5424400	All right.
5424400	5425400	Let's move on.
5425400	5427880	Speaking of classic stuff every week here on the show, we like to step into the gaming
5427880	5432920	vault and find a classic game that, Hey, you guys should be checking this game out and
5432920	5434720	show it a little bit of love this week.
5434720	5438940	But in the 2019 twist, we like to do things a little differently.
5438940	5443720	So once a month, Dark Sakura picks out a classic soundtrack.
5443720	5448400	So the classic soundtrack of the month is what we're going to be discussing this week.
5448400	5452520	And you said the theme for 2019 is going to be all NES or 8-bit games, right?
5452520	5453520	All right.
5453520	5455320	So what 8-bit game did you pick this week?
5455320	5460560	I picked Jackal, which I've covered before for classic game, but my focus is of course
5460560	5466300	the soundtrack, this music.
5466300	5470760	And I should point out that the video is not synced with the audio we did replace so that
5470760	5471920	I took, I stripped the game noise.
5471920	5473360	Although it was actually pretty close.
5473360	5475840	Yeah, it is pretty close.
5475840	5479640	But this is like some of my favorite 8-bit gaming music ever.
5479640	5484880	It was just that era of delicious Konami music, you know, but this was even better than some
5484880	5487480	of the other stuff that was out at the time.
5487480	5490760	Didn't we ever get a remix of this and like Beat Mania or anything?
5490760	5492400	It's really like a missed opportunity.
5492400	5493400	Bummer.
5493400	5500720	But anyway, it was, the sound designer for this was Atsushi Fujio.
5500720	5504880	He worked on many Konami titles in the late 80s.
5504880	5510280	He's actually, I think still doing music to this day.
5510280	5516240	But as far as other games that he worked on, I'm trying to pick like, well, I brought this
5516240	5520620	came up before YY World for Super Famicom.
5520620	5529620	He did Jyris for the Famicom Disk System, Blades of Steel, Jyris for NES itself, Twin
5529620	5531520	Bee 3, Poco Poco Daimaou.
5531520	5535640	I love the Jyris soundtrack, even though it really just is like classic songs.
5535640	5544320	You May Penguin, Monogatari, Konami Hyper Soccer, I'm trying to think of things, Bucky O'Hare,
5544320	5548080	Hunter 3, The Alien Wars, he was a sound programmer.
5548080	5550240	He did sound programming for Axlay.
5550240	5555320	He did the same for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtle Tournament Fighters.
5555320	5558920	Sorry, words are weird today.
5558920	5561740	He also did the music for Double Dribble.
5561740	5565480	And he was a consultant on Snatcher, Rob.
5565480	5566480	Nice.
5566480	5570940	But at any rate, this is just a good soundtrack.
5570940	5575860	I played a fuck ton of this game when I was a kid, every time I was in Dothan, and I always
5575860	5579300	wanted my own copy, and I didn't get it until I was an adult.
5579300	5584220	But just the music was just, I thought, really solid.
5584220	5589620	It actually was, some people would say it was kind of generic for like the whole army,
5589620	5595140	war, you know, military game, but I really did think that it was actually a very fitting
5595140	5600620	soundtrack and it wasn't just, I think, more of the same how a lot of the other games of
5600620	5601620	its type were.
5601620	5604420	And on top of that, Jackal is just a really unique and good game.
5604420	5606700	So there you go.
5606700	5611020	Yeah, I remember playing this game on Commodore 64.
5611020	5613180	I don't think, was the soundtrack the same?
5613180	5614180	I don't think it was.
5614180	5615180	I don't think so.
5615180	5619700	But I remember, like at the time, this whole like driving a jeep around like a much larger
5619700	5623380	map that kind of scrolled in different ways than what we were used to, like that was a
5623380	5625740	very kind of like novel thing.
5625740	5631780	Well, this game was also originally designed to use rotary joysticks, like in the SNK games,
5631780	5638220	like Ikari Warriors, but they ended up doing this one out for a joystick, I think because
5638220	5644380	of like cost, but it also, you know, it changed the way that the tactics were going to work
5644380	5645380	on this game.
5645380	5646380	It is a very solid game.
5646380	5649860	And of course, the music is just not even annoying at all.
5649860	5650940	It's just really good.
5650940	5652340	So there you go.
5652340	5653340	All right.
5653340	5655860	I would love for this in the chat room as well.
5655860	5659940	Some folks saying, let's see, Metal Mayhem says Jackal was one of those Konami NES games
5659940	5660940	I saw advertised.
5660940	5662140	I won it on the NES.
5662140	5665660	The only time I ever got to play it was on Game Room, the arcade version, I think was
5665660	5666660	there.
5666660	5669460	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, my brother and I played the hell out of this, so much better
5669460	5670460	with two players.
5670460	5672100	I played this with my papa.
5672100	5673420	Oh, love that.
5673420	5675860	Dr. Seuss says, I do have the cart of this.
5675860	5677340	Still haven't beaten it, though.
5677340	5681100	And Quest Buster says the music- You haven't beaten it?
5681100	5682660	No day like today.
5682660	5686060	Quest Buster says the music in Jackal was one of the reasons I kept coming back to the
5686060	5687060	game.
5687060	5688060	Yeah.
5688060	5694340	And it's all just that intro music where it has the build up and then, you know, it goes
5694340	5695340	right into it.
5695340	5696340	Let me play it.
5696340	5697340	Wait, if I restart the thingy, hold on.
5697340	5701340	If I go back to us in the studio and then I go and I hit the button to start the video
5701340	5702340	again.
5702340	5703340	Yeah.
5703340	5707060	You can hear this opening music again.
5707060	5710180	Yeah.
5710180	5712540	But the little bit of a key change between the two.
5712540	5713540	Yeah.
5713540	5717580	Just really with the pause and then a key change, I was like, that's really, I mean,
5717580	5720700	coming from a musical point of view, I know it's a fucking video game, but it is really
5720700	5721700	dynamic.
5721700	5726580	But back in the day, in the 80s with games like this, you know, when sometimes you play
5726580	5731820	the game just to hear the songs because there wasn't the YouTube, MP3s, OC Remix wasn't
5731820	5732820	made yet.
5732820	5737820	You know, you had to go to the game, you had to put the game in and listen to the music.
5737820	5742700	And sometimes that's how you rediscovered a game that you may not have really played
5742700	5743700	the first time.
5743700	5746300	I was telling Dan last night, just, you know, when I was thinking, what should I do?
5746300	5747300	What should I do?
5747300	5748420	And then I picked the music.
5748420	5752660	I was like, man, I feel fucking heroic.
5752660	5753660	As you should.
5753660	5754660	Yeah.
5754660	5755660	As you should.
5755660	5756660	All right.
5756660	5757660	There it is.
5757660	5758660	Your classic soundtrack of the month.
5758660	5760420	Jackal on the NES specifically.
5760420	5762040	And just a point of order.
5762040	5764540	We may see something on a different system next month.
5764540	5765540	Ooh.
5765540	5766540	Okay.
5766540	5767540	It's gotta be an 8-bit.
5768260	5769260	Well, gee, I wonder what it could be.
5769260	5770260	We'll see, though.
5770260	5771260	We'll see.
5771260	5772260	All right.
5772260	5775900	What could it, could it be when you put two 8-bits together to make a faux 16-bit?
5775900	5777500	Because there was one console that did do that.
5777500	5779420	I'm not going to talk about the PC Engine.
5779420	5780420	All right.
5780420	5781420	Fine.
5781420	5784500	But, but, um, I'll just put it this way.
5784500	5786900	Um, there may be some Sega love coming next.
5786900	5787900	All right.
5787900	5789740	Gee, I would never have guessed.
5789740	5791980	Or it could also be Atari.
5791980	5792980	Okay.
5792980	5793980	Oh, true.
5793980	5794980	True.
5794980	5795980	It could.
5795980	5796980	The 7200.
5797420	5798420	Old school stuff.
5798420	5801220	You know that arcade collection is coming out very soon.
5801220	5802780	So I'll be very curious.
5802780	5806660	Even though, um, you know, some of the games, like Haunted Castle was kind of like the arcade
5806660	5812220	version of Castlevania, but the, the gag is it's not that good unless they put, they may
5812220	5813380	have put cheats in it.
5813380	5817700	I bet they did, uh, on the Switch version so that you can just keep plunking in quarters.
5817700	5820060	You know, probably get further in the game than you ever did before.
5820060	5821420	Um, but it'd be interesting.
5821420	5822820	I don't know if Jackal was into it though.
5822820	5826620	I don't think Jackal's in it, but, um, I didn't remember seeing, I don't think Jackal was
5826620	5829100	on the list, but, uh, yeah, I know that's coming out very soon.
5829100	5831820	So some folks will be, uh, taking a look at that pretty soon.
5831820	5832820	All right.
5832820	5837420	Anyhow, uh, we're going to do a little prerecorded segment that I did earlier today about another
5837420	5838420	just recorded.
5838420	5839420	A what?
5839420	5840980	So it's just recorded.
5840980	5841980	Yes.
5841980	5846300	A recorded segment from earlier today, uh, on another news item this week.
5846300	5847300	So let's go to that.
5847300	5848300	All right.
5848300	5850780	Hello everybody from the office studio.
5850780	5854460	And I thought for a little middle of the show break this week, we could take a look again
5854460	5857340	at the switch online, uh, and the classic NES library.
5857340	5860820	But this time, you know, I know that last week we looked a lot at the comparisons between
5860820	5863900	the American and the Japanese versions of the service, but this week I want to take
5863900	5866280	a look at some of the new offerings in the service.
5866280	5870080	So, uh, as you guys know, there was some new stuff that was added, including a special
5870080	5876740	version of kid Icarus, as well as punch out star soldier and super Mario, the loss levels,
5876740	5879920	which of course is super Mario brothers two in Japan.
5879920	5883500	So what I want to kind of focus on during the break, uh, this week is I want to take
5883540	5887420	a look at these special versions that have been added to the service.
5887420	5891580	You know, it's kind of interesting as this trend that Nintendo has been doing with the
5891580	5895740	classic library is that it seems like every time they release new games, they've been
5895740	5900300	doing like a throwback to one of the harder games from the previous month, allowing you
5900300	5906060	to take it on in a whole new way, perhaps, um, actually, uh, starting with full life
5906060	5910640	or full coins or, uh, starting on the very last level of the game, which is the case
5910640	5912520	with the kid Icarus release this week.
5912520	5916480	But if you actually look at, you know, the details, they try to give it like this fancy
5916480	5920480	little name, like, Ooh, you're playing the three sacred treasures level and you know,
5920480	5921560	you're not really finished.
5921560	5925840	And it's basically a fancy way of saying we're starting you at the end of the game with all
5925840	5928060	the items and full life and everything.
5928060	5929060	So let's actually take a look.
5929060	5930060	I'm going to load it up.
5930060	5934380	And the interesting thing about kid Icarus specifically was that the very last stage
5934380	5939980	of the game, stage four, one was very different from any other level in the game.
5939980	5942480	There was really no other level like it.
5942480	5948420	Not so ever, um, it plays more like a shooter game, whereas of course the first few stages
5948420	5954980	of the game is a platformer and, uh, uh, dungeon stages are also there and yeah, it's just
5954980	5957440	a very different type of game.
5957440	5961940	So obviously we're flying through and you notice pit looks very different now because
5961940	5965240	the story with the game has him collecting the treasures in the various dungeons.
5965240	5969420	So he has the wings, he has the special arrow, he has the shield, so that's why he looks
5969420	5970640	a lot different.
5970640	5975700	So we're obviously flying through here to make our way to Medusa who, spoiler alert,
5975700	5979840	is the final boss of the game, but I'm sure you all already knew that.
5979840	5985300	It's interesting too because I haven't played this in a long time, the American release,
5985300	5986560	but I've played the Japanese.
5986560	5989000	It's funny cause I have to throw back a little bit to last week.
5989000	5994000	I did play the Japanese release of this earlier and believe it or not, it's different.
5994000	5999580	Like you actually use one of the buttons to fly and I seem to remember you walk on this
5999580	6004460	part, you can't fly underneath this brick like you can in this version.
6004460	6009760	So the American version apparently lets you fly through walls and that's something new
6009760	6013100	and you just use the control pad to move wherever you want.
6013100	6016380	That's a very interesting, a little difference I'm noticing right off the bat besides just
6016380	6019380	all those sound differences we were noting last week.
6019380	6021580	Well, this stage isn't very long.
6021580	6023940	Once you get to the green brick, guess what?
6023940	6025460	You are about to the Medusa fight.
6025460	6030940	I think we just have to get through a few more mobs.
6030940	6032380	Shoot my way through.
6032380	6036460	Yeah, it's like a shooter, but it's not like, you know, for as hard as this game is, it's
6036460	6038940	not exactly like cuphead level shooting.
6038940	6042920	I mean, sure, I've lost a little bit of health and been hit a few times so far, but it's
6042920	6047540	not like, you know, I'm not like super dying or anything.
6047540	6048980	All right.
6048980	6050780	This level is longer than I remember.
6050780	6054380	Maybe the American version is longer too, I don't remember.
6054380	6058980	I played the Japanese one earlier this week when it was first released.
6058980	6062040	Just because I wanted to hear the little subtle differences in the music that we talked about
6062040	6063040	last week.
6063040	6068140	But obviously, Kid Icarus is not the only game that's had an SP release.
6068140	6071980	I know like Legend of Zelda, I did a stream on my personal channel once when that came
6071980	6072980	out.
6072980	6077340	They had a version that started you with all the rupees and heart containers and everything
6077340	6078420	else that you can get.
6078420	6080580	I swear this thing just looped me through the level twice.
6080580	6082100	Isn't that what it looks like?
6082100	6083500	I just looped through the level twice.
6083620	6085620	I think I did.
6085620	6089140	Maybe that's how they made it more difficult.
6089140	6090140	You thought this was easy?
6090140	6091140	Well, ah!
6091140	6092140	Do it again.
6092140	6093140	All right.
6093140	6098060	Well, maybe this time when we get to the green brick, we'll be able to fight Medusa.
6098060	6100140	You know, the other interesting thing, though, even though it looks like I'm really close
6100140	6103900	to dying, well, not only do I start with full hearts, so picking up the additional hearts
6103900	6107080	really isn't doing me any good, but if you look at the special items, you'll notice I
6107080	6109980	have like eight life restoration items.
6109980	6115140	So even if I were to lose all my health, which unfortunately seems very likely at this point,
6115140	6118360	it's okay because my health is going to refill automatically.
6118360	6120460	So it makes it very hard to die.
6120460	6126320	So even if like you sucked at Kid Icarus as a kid, now's your chance to be a winner, which
6126320	6130420	hopefully I will get the chance here shortly without this middle point segment going on
6130420	6132660	for 20 minutes.
6132660	6139020	Pretty sure maybe there's something special I have to do to trigger the Medusa phase.
6139060	6140860	I don't remember.
6140860	6141860	I don't think so.
6141860	6142860	I've got full hearts.
6142860	6145020	What else could I possibly need?
6145020	6147820	All right.
6147820	6154020	Oh, my God, are we living through it again?
6154020	6156140	We might be if that green brick goes away.
6156140	6158660	Oh, no, it just looks.
6158660	6160660	There we go.
6160660	6161660	There we go.
6161660	6162660	Okay.
6162660	6163660	Now, yeah, suspenseful music change.
6163660	6164660	Here we go.
6164660	6166120	All right.
6166120	6172440	So obviously I want to dodge that dragon, which I'm getting hit with a bunch.
6172440	6176340	You can deflect those little beams that are coming with the mirror.
6176340	6179480	So as long as but you'll notice the shield goes down for a minute when you shoot the
6179480	6181480	arrows.
6181480	6187740	I'm having a really hard time facing forward.
6187740	6192240	This is probably part of my issue of using the control pro controller.
6196840	6201280	So I'm just going through those extra health like it's nobody's business.
6201280	6205920	Hopefully I'll be able to kill Medusa.
6205920	6213920	Oh, my gosh, I think that's one of the downfalls of using the pro controller is that, oh, look
6213920	6214920	at that.
6214920	6215920	I found that sweet spot.
6215920	6217920	There it is.
6217920	6218920	That's right.
6218920	6221120	I remember that being a thing now is that there's like a sweet spot.
6221120	6222280	There you go.
6222280	6225320	And there's Palutena.
6225320	6226320	I think.
6226320	6229120	So that's supposed to be coming out of the eye.
6229120	6230120	We did it.
6230120	6232120	We beat it.
6232120	6233120	Yay.
6233120	6234120	Hooray.
6234120	6235120	There it is.
6235120	6236120	The ending screen.
6236120	6239400	And I didn't have any help whatsoever.
6239400	6240400	And he transforms.
6240400	6243720	Again, interesting because this is very different from the Japanese version now that that's
6243720	6244720	recent in my head.
6244720	6246680	Oh, no, they didn't hug in the Japanese.
6246680	6248480	Oh, that was a little kiss.
6248480	6251520	All this blue scenery and everything.
6251520	6253800	This is not in the Japanese version.
6253800	6255680	It's just a black screen, but it has more writing.
6255680	6258160	And then it says Fiin at the bottom.
6258160	6262040	And I imagine this is the translation of the writing, which is Medusa was destroyed in
6262040	6263480	the light of peace.
6263480	6264480	Return to Angel.
6264480	6265480	I didn't read fast enough.
6265480	6267080	I need to be a speed reader, clearly.
6267080	6271280	And we get the staff role, which again, not present in the Japanese version.
6271280	6274480	So I guess this did end up being a comparison video of sorts as well.
6274480	6278120	But it makes it a lot easier to see things later in the game.
6278120	6280640	Thanks to these special SP versions.
6280640	6284120	So I'm curious, are you guys checking out these SP versions?
6284120	6285800	Those of you that have Nintendo online?
6285800	6289280	Like are you using this to see parts of the game that you couldn't get to as a kid?
6289280	6292020	Now, I did beat Kid Icarus as a kid.
6292020	6297000	I may have had some help from maps in Nintendo Power or whatever magazines are out at the
6297000	6300160	time that helped me get through like the third dungeon and all that stuff.
6300160	6301560	But I did beat it.
6301560	6306020	But things like, I don't know, like Ghosts and Goblins and some of these other games,
6306020	6309740	like I would never see these end segments of the game if it weren't for the SP versions.
6309740	6314500	So I'm curious if you guys are checking them out or if, you know, you're like, eh, I don't
6314500	6316140	want to see it on easy mode.
6316140	6317140	No.
6317140	6319260	Anyway, that's my question to you guys.
6319260	6320500	And I think that's it for now.
6320500	6327380	So we'll end on that lovely note where the hero, the hero is you and copyright 1986 Nintendo.
6327380	6328380	That's it.
6328380	6329600	We're going to go back to the studio.
6329600	6330820	See ya.
6330820	6338660	Thank you, me, for that lovely segment on the SP version of Kid Icarus, which was released
6338660	6343900	into the Nintendo online library on Switch in this past week.
6343900	6347300	Have you guys or you guys don't really do a lot of the Switch Nintendo library?
6347300	6348500	I don't play that often.
6348500	6349780	Yeah, it's not really.
6349780	6350780	Yeah.
6350780	6352780	I kind of check out the SP stuff once in a while.
6352780	6355980	Well, especially kind of like I was saying there, the ghosts and goblins, but like things
6355980	6358640	like I just I never was going to see otherwise.
6358640	6360880	The Kid Icarus thing, again, humble brag.
6360880	6366300	I saw that already when I was a kid, but also, I mean, all humble bragging aside, and I forgot
6366300	6368320	to talk about it in the video.
6368320	6370640	There was also pass codes we would always use, right?
6370640	6375320	Like I was it like Icarus fights, Medusa, terror, danger, horror, exclamation point.
6375320	6376320	Yeah.
6376320	6378900	So there were little codes you could use that would also get you a little further along
6378900	6380720	in the game to see that level.
6380720	6382720	But now who needs codes anymore?
6382720	6383720	You have SP versions.
6383720	6386360	We could sell you those codes for cheap.
6386360	6390560	Well, at least Nintendo is not selling those as well, unless you consider the price of
6390560	6392240	the online subscription, what you're paying.
6392240	6397880	But I think I let that one slide, considering that's not the only value in their online
6397880	6398880	subscription.
6398880	6404660	So anyway, let's travel around and check out some rapid fire news, some other quick things
6404660	6405660	going on in the industry.
6405660	6407280	You also have a podcast of the week.
6407280	6408280	Oh, yeah, let's do that.
6408280	6410280	Let's do it by all means, please.
6410280	6411920	You have a podcast to plug.
6411920	6412920	Absolutely.
6412920	6419760	And then comes courtesy of my friend Grim, who is the one of the creative talents behind
6419760	6421720	Voodoo Walrus.
6421720	6423320	And check out check it out.
6423320	6427360	It's a really funny, cool adventure comic.
6427360	6430900	But the podcast is called This Week We're Talking About.
6430900	6433920	And there are up to 10 episodes from what I can tell so far.
6433920	6436080	The last one was on April 4th.
6436080	6438560	And they basically just pick a topic and talk about it.
6438560	6442820	You know, it's like, oh, but but not.
6442820	6450820	Not with Katya or Trixie, but like this last episode is a kiss retrospective, 1971 through
6450820	6451820	1974.
6451820	6456420	And because Kiss is going to be retiring because it's about time, I'm sure Gene Simmons's tongue
6456420	6460220	has had so much Botox that it can't move out anymore.
6460220	6463260	But yeah, check him out.
6463260	6465540	Actually the favorite title of all.
6465540	6468580	Actually, there's two titles I super like.
6468580	6470380	One of them is episode eight.
6470380	6475500	We've come to teach you the boundless joys of a life without pants.
6475500	6477980	And oh, it actually is creep night and grim on that one.
6477980	6482700	So and then carbon units are not true life forms.
6482700	6485660	And it's actually about Star Trek the motion picture.
6485660	6488640	So go check them out.
6488640	6489700	There's only 10 episodes.
6489700	6490700	You can catch up easy.
6490700	6491700	All right.
6491700	6492700	Thank you for that lovely plug.
6492700	6498380	I had to also plug the shows at vognetwork.com because we have many shows that are part of
6498380	6499380	the network.
6499380	6500860	All of them broadcast live on Twitch.
6500860	6506900	A few of them do not, including anime jam session, which is hosted here on Tuesday nights.
6506900	6509020	But I will plug, I'm going to plug my own show.
6509020	6514540	I'm going to plug shaking and crying now, which I do with the lovely Aria snark.
6514540	6520220	Speaking of Game of Thrones, Aria snark is a cosplayer, but she goes by Victoria in the
6520220	6521860	real world.
6521860	6526700	And this week we talked about, well, Victoria did the show high.
6526700	6528620	So we talked about marijuana.
6528860	6531220	And we talked about 420 a little bit.
6531220	6532320	And you know, cause that's coming up.
6532320	6535100	So we had a very frank conversation on that.
6535100	6536260	So it was a interesting episode.
6536260	6538700	Also the first full day of Passover.
6538700	6541660	And guess what weed is kosher.
6541660	6542660	Good to know.
6542660	6543660	Good to know.
6543660	6544660	So you can check that out.
6544660	6545660	Shaking and crying.com.
6545660	6549540	But that's just going to take you to a little subsection at vognetwork.com.
6549540	6552920	Now we can get into some rapid fire news, Loki.
6552920	6559480	So if you're a fan of old edutainment, and this was probably a little, this was probably
6559480	6563560	a little after when I was actually playing a lot of those games, but you're probably
6563560	6570920	familiar with humongous or humongous entertainment and humongous entertainment did such wonderful
6570920	6576840	series as pajama Sam, Freddy fish, spy Fox, putt putt, et cetera.
6576840	6581440	Well they have a bundle now on humble bundle and you can get a shit ton of games for very
6581440	6582560	little money.
6582560	6586080	So for a dollar, you get, uh, quite a few.
6586080	6593040	So big fingers, first grade kindergarten, fatty bears, birthday, surprise, buzzy, the
6593040	6599960	airport, the farm, the jungle, putt, putt, and pops, uh, balloon, Orama doc on a stick
6599960	6602080	and activity pack.
6602080	6604280	What was that birthday surprise?
6604280	6607360	That was fatty bears or fatty bears.
6607360	6608360	Your dinner.
6609160	6614600	That sounds like my trip to Chicago last year.
6614600	6615600	Let's see where else.
6615600	6618540	Uh, and then of course spy Fox and cheese chase.
6618540	6621020	So all that for $1, not bad.
6621020	6627200	And then of course, um, if you pay the average price, which now is $11 and 16 cents, but
6627200	6630000	of course that changes as people are purchasing the bundle.
6630000	6633480	It's spy Fox to, uh, putt putt travels through time.
6633640	6639760	Freddy fish to pajamas, Sam for pajamas, Sam, lost and found, uh, lots of games basically.
6639760	6644360	Um, and then of course, $14 or more, um, you get even more games.
6644360	6650000	So pajamas, Sam, three Freddy fish, five, four spy Fox, three puppet joins the circus.
6650000	6652640	There's just a ton of goddamn games in there.
6652640	6658800	So if you really need to fill your steam library full of humongous games, then go check that
6658800	6663600	out on humble bundle.com because it's, there's a lot.
6663600	6672840	And then, um, there was this lawsuit against, um, take two, um, regarding red dead redemption
6672840	6678380	two, because in the game, of course, there's the Pinkertons, which were kind of this rival
6678380	6679640	to your gang.
6679640	6681960	And apparently the Pinkertons are actually real.
6681960	6686320	Um, there is this, uh, Pinkerton consulting and investigation.
6686840	6692420	Uh, they wanted royalties for every time the word Pinkerton was used in the game, but now
6692420	6698400	they have dropped their lawsuit against take two over their depiction of the Pinkertons.
6698400	6704840	Also there was the Pinkerton investigation agency in Hong Kong, just saying, so that's
6704840	6705840	been dropped.
6705840	6712880	Unfortunately, um, that lawsuit being gone does not make red dead online any better.
6712880	6713880	Fair enough.
6713940	6717580	Uh, maybe there'll be online in this game, although this is, um, you know, this is one
6717580	6721560	of those take it with a grain of salt cause it's not confirmed, but usually the ratings
6721560	6725280	boards, when we get leaks from the rating boards, we know there's something coming.
6725280	6728360	Like those don't tend to be things that lie to us.
6728360	6733920	So the Australian ratings board just approved something from way forward games, the developers
6733920	6736720	behind Shantae, um, and that Shantae you stay.
6736720	6740760	I always like, I can't say that game without saying that, uh, way forward did other stuff
6740760	6741760	too.
6741760	6742760	That was really cool.
6742760	6743760	Did they do blaster master zero?
6743760	6747040	No, but didn't they do, was it the DuckTales or masters?
6747040	6748040	Yes.
6748040	6749040	Yes.
6749040	6750040	So they've done some really cool classic remasters.
6750040	6755200	Well, apparently the game that was rated was called river city girls.
6755200	6761040	So some people are wondering, is this Kunio kun, which is the river city ransom, right?
6761040	6767320	Those games is that here now that franchise is by arc system works, but they have licensed
6767320	6772320	that out for other releases like river city ransom underground, which was by a Canadian
6772320	6773320	studio.
6773880	6778600	Did they maybe make like, did way forward maybe make a new river city ransom as game,
6778600	6783920	but now it's, you know, the twist is it's going to be girl fighters maybe, uh, who knows,
6783920	6784920	but I'm into it.
6784920	6786560	I'm into like river city ransom coming back.
6786560	6791080	I think that's a fun twist, uh, on the, the franchise, um, beginnings.
6791080	6792080	So that'd be cool.
6792080	6793080	Uh, dark soccer.
6793080	6795880	I know you love the Kunio kun type games.
6795880	6796880	Would you play river city girls?
6796880	6797880	I probably would.
6797880	6798880	Yeah.
6798880	6802040	And you know, especially if like the boys are the ones that are working at the cafe
6802040	6805440	and have to have to smile for free.
6805440	6806440	Yeah.
6806440	6809320	They're like, like they'd be prettier if they smiled more.
6809320	6810320	Fair enough.
6810320	6813000	Why not give everybody a turn?
6813000	6814800	Uh, and then that's, that's all I have.
6814800	6817400	So dark soccer, what do you have for us rapid fighters?
6817400	6824240	Well for fans of octopath traveler who don't necessarily have a system to play it on, um,
6824240	6825320	it's going to be on steam.
6825320	6826320	Of course.
6826320	6830120	Phoenix is going to put it on steam on June 7th.
6830120	6834640	So keep your eyes open if you sincerely want to play it.
6834640	6840040	Um, which honestly it's not a bad idea, but I hope that it will, there will be a Mac version
6840040	6841040	as well.
6841040	6847600	Um, and then, um, this one I thought was funny for all of you oculus sisters, there's creepy
6847600	6851840	messages on your controller, at least a few thousand of them.
6852360	6858160	Um, so there were, um, you know, different versions that went out for testing, um, different,
6858160	6864840	uh, but about tens of thousands of oculus touch controllers have creepy privacy related
6864840	6868960	Easter egg messages written on the internal hardware.
6868960	6874500	Like one of them says, the masons were here inscribed on a cable, others are big brother
6874500	6875500	is watching.
6875500	6881760	Um, you know, and other develop, developers will put jokes in their kits too, but here's
6881760	6882760	a few others.
6882760	6886440	One of them says, uh, this space for rent, the masons were here.
6886440	6887600	Big brother is watching.
6887600	6889280	Hi, I fix it.
6889280	6892160	We see you.
6892160	6896420	So that they will throw back to pin bot.
6896420	6900080	Now I see you.
6900080	6906960	I can see from bride of him, but, but yeah, but, um, they basically were part of the prototypes
6906960	6911720	and they went into production, but, um, they're trying to keep them from happening again.
6911720	6918160	Um, but yeah, the affected touch controllers are shipping with the rift S and oculus quest
6918160	6919160	headsets.
6919160	6924760	Um, and they're not going to recall them because I mean, why the fuck it might be really funny.
6924760	6929000	It's not like we don't have hidden messages and a lot of things that we use in our everyday
6929000	6930000	lives.
6930000	6932720	For example, um, currency, right?
6932720	6935560	Like coins, they have little, you know, things on them.
6935560	6940120	Um, also like, hello, don't y'all know, like, like everybody loves in and out when they
6940120	6941120	come to California.
6941520	6945400	You ever looked at one of the bottom of the cups at in and out Bible verses, Bible verses
6945400	6946400	on them.
6946400	6954840	So no, not on my cup, but thankfully they don't, you know, contribute money to, well,
6954840	6960800	do they not to anti LGBT, but you know, it's just, you know, you gotta do your research.
6960800	6966340	But I also, I have a controversial opinion on all that anyway, but I, you know, I still
6966340	6970000	eat it because, um, they treat their workers very well from what I understand.
6970000	6971360	And kids really want to work there.
6971360	6974840	So I think that's also very, I like that everyone who starts off there, even if they're, you
6974840	6981480	know, fresh incoming CEO or whatever, or executive have to take, um, have to spend a day on the
6981480	6982480	floor.
6982480	6983480	Oh, okay.
6983480	6984480	That's, that's interesting.
6984480	6985480	They're absolutely required to.
6985480	6986480	Oh, that's cool.
6986480	6987480	Yeah.
6987480	6988480	You know what's interesting?
6988480	6990180	The orientation I do in my work is the same required.
6990180	6991920	Why wouldn't you want to do that for a day?
6991920	6992920	That'd be fun.
6992920	6993920	Yeah.
6993920	6994920	Just for a day.
6994920	6995920	I think for a week.
6995920	6997700	Oh, well, you know, why not?
6997700	6999840	It's the best way to learn about what's going on, right?
6999840	7002940	So anyway, but my point is there's hidden messages in a lot of things.
7002940	7006200	It sounds like, sounds like this was one that wasn't meant to get out in mass.
7006200	7011560	In fact, Bobby, who we all know loves his VR in chat says, I fix it does tear down YouTube
7011560	7012600	videos.
7012600	7013800	That's what the message was for.
7013800	7015160	So of course that makes sense.
7015160	7016160	Yeah.
7016160	7019560	So, you know, they tried to hide a cute message for those folks and now it's turns out a lot
7019560	7021080	of folks see it.
7021080	7022080	I'll be honest.
7022080	7026160	I have used, I fix it before and for lack of having a manual with me when trying to
7026160	7029180	change on a hard drive and it wasn't like on a PC.
7029180	7032140	It was on, it was a, my old Toshiba.
7032140	7033140	Right.
7033140	7034140	So, all right.
7034140	7035580	Anyway, hidden messages.
7035580	7036580	They're everywhere.
7036580	7037580	All right.
7037580	7038580	Moving on.
7038580	7041420	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates that are coming up.
7041420	7050540	Well, we've got Anno 1800 coming out on PC, Final Fantasy 10 and 10 2 HD remaster on the
7050540	7053740	Nintendo switch and Xbox one.
7053740	7062460	We have my time at Portia on switch PlayStation four and Xbox one world war Z on PC, PlayStation
7062460	7070420	four and Xbox one, um, trooper Brooke on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox
7070420	7074280	one cup head on Nintendo switch.
7074280	7078240	And finally Katana zero on PC and the Nintendo switch.
7078240	7079240	That's it.
7079240	7081220	Are you going to pick up cup head on switch?
7081220	7083640	I've heard a lot of people talking about it on PC and I don't play it.
7083640	7087800	So why would I pick it up another platform not to play on PC and it makes me cry to continue
7087800	7088800	to not play it.
7088800	7089800	Oh, why is it?
7089800	7090800	Just cause it's fucking hard.
7090800	7092480	I do want to pick up birth defense force.
7092480	7095820	I did hold off on picking that up this week because I knew I wouldn't get to play it this
7095820	7096820	week.
7096820	7101320	So it's, which is why, and also it's kind of expensive, but I, I do need to get it.
7101320	7102320	All right.
7102320	7106120	Let's talk about some titles coming out in Japan on the PlayStation four this week.
7106120	7111020	It looks like the biggest title they have there is Langrisser one and two on the PlayStation
7111020	7112020	four.
7112020	7118220	This is a remake of these RPGs that were out on the mega drive in 1991 and 1994.
7118220	7122260	So now it's like a one, two combo remastered for the PlayStation four.
7122260	7124580	So there's a regular and a limited edition of that.
7124580	7126580	And that's on the PlayStation four this week.
7126580	7133580	The other release in Japan this week, override mech city brawl is also out this week in Japan.
7133580	7137380	And that is also on the PlayStation four looking quickly at the Nintendo switch that Langrisser
7137380	7139960	one and two is also out on the switch.
7139960	7145640	As well as a game called Tai Shu cross Alex, excuse me, Alice all in one.
7145640	7147820	That is the other release in Japan this week.
7147820	7152900	Otherwise it's a relatively slow week in Japan, but I know we're heading into a big holiday
7152900	7155780	thing coming up here pretty soon, I think at the end of the month.
7155780	7158220	So it's probably going to be slow for a little bit.
7158220	7159420	How about Europe?
7159420	7160420	It's a little bit slow.
7160420	7163300	I mean, there's some stuff to look forward to.
7163340	7169020	So there is my time at Porsche on April 15th.
7169020	7175220	Also out on the 15th is world war Z and then final fantasy 10, 10 to HD remaster.
7175220	7181940	On the 16th, we have snooker 2019 which is a pool game.
7181940	7188520	On the 17th, we have trooper Brook constructor plus, and our world is ended.
7188520	7194280	And then on the 18th ghost giant deluxe edition.
7194280	7195280	That's it.
7195280	7196280	That's it.
7196280	7201760	And then my birthday, which is a game in and of itself because trying to just live is fun.
7201760	7202760	That's right.
7202760	7204960	Happy early birthday because we do another show.
7204960	7205960	It will have passed.
7205960	7206960	Right.
7206960	7207960	Thank you.
7207960	7208960	I'm old.
7208960	7209960	So no, you're not.
7209960	7210960	You're doing a 24 hour stream for your birthday.
7210960	7211960	Right.
7211960	7212960	I'm just kidding.
7212960	7213960	No, I'm going to be in San Francisco.
7213960	7214960	Oh, that'd be.
7214960	7215960	Oh yes.
7215960	7216960	Oh, cause you're, you're not here on the next episode, right?
7216960	7217960	No, I am not.
7218400	7222040	I'm going to be going to the, uh, conclave for the 40th anniversary of the sisters of
7222040	7224840	perpetual indulgence because I know you're very heavily involved with that.
7224840	7226280	I would love to go.
7226280	7228920	I have a very busy next weekend is very busy myself though.
7228920	7232940	I'm hosting an event Friday here in SAC, a burlesque show in old town and then a rocky
7232940	7234280	horror is on four 20.
7234280	7237880	The very important thing though about the theme burlesque show or is it just a regular
7237880	7238880	burlesque?
7238880	7242720	It is a themed burlesque show because it is also a, it is that cannabis weekend.
7242720	7245040	So it's a cannabis burlesque show.
7245040	7246920	That's interesting.
7246920	7247920	Come see what it is.
7248880	7254360	The other thing though about this particular one is that, um, the, the, the Easter in the
7254360	7258000	park had been done traditionally at Dolores park and had to move to golden gate park when
7258000	7260840	they changed the gathering rules for Dolores park.
7260840	7265360	They got a special, uh, dispensation for the 40th anniversary to have it at Dolores park
7265360	7266360	again.
7266360	7271120	So if anyone, any of our listeners is in San Francisco, come find me.
7271120	7276880	Um, I will be, uh, in my sister persona, I'll be wearing a little blue and white Lolita
7276880	7282840	dress with a floofy hat and I'm sure there'll be pictures on social media, but my face will
7282840	7283840	be hidden.
7283840	7284840	Can you find me?
7284840	7286320	It's where's Jamie?
7286320	7290020	Uh, and I'm okay going off topic a little bit because this is the part of the show where
7290020	7294240	we would be answering your emails, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send
7294240	7297840	us emails and every week, dark soccer dives in the mailbag and finds what she wants to
7297840	7298840	read about tonight.
7298840	7300800	But this week, someone washed the floor.
7300800	7302040	It's not sticky anymore.
7302040	7303040	It's clean.
7303040	7304760	So there's nothing in the mailbag once again.
7304760	7305760	Yeah.
7305840	7308280	And because of that, I'm going to play animal crossing.
7308280	7309280	No, no.
7309280	7310560	We're going to talk about RuPaul's drag race.
7310560	7311560	Oh, that's right.
7311560	7314840	So, so girl, I didn't watch this a week's episode.
7314840	7315840	Why?
7315840	7318440	I just haven't gotten around to it yet, but it was so satisfying.
7318440	7319440	I know.
7319440	7322000	I've heard what happens cause you know, things get ruined on social media.
7322000	7323840	If you, I was ready for that bitch to go.
7323840	7325920	Now I got one more bitch to go.
7325920	7327280	You know which bitch I want to go.
7327280	7329160	Uh, probably Dr Ganesh.
7329160	7330160	Dr Ganesh.
7330160	7331160	Yeah.
7331160	7332160	I'm thinking.
7332160	7335600	Dr Ganesh is proof that you can be well educated and still be a fucking moron.
7335600	7336840	Let's keep it positive.
7336840	7337840	Who are you rooting for?
7337840	7338840	Positively stupid.
7338840	7341040	Who are you rooting for at this point in the competition?
7341040	7342040	Evie.
7342040	7343040	Evie?
7343040	7344040	I really like Evie.
7344040	7345040	I like Evie too.
7345040	7349440	But I super love Miss Vangie and I want her to, I think Vangie is going to get, um, Miss
7349440	7351120	Vangie is going to get a spinoff series.
7351120	7356360	Miss Vangie just, Miss Vangie is going to be like the Alyssa Edwards of this generation
7356360	7357360	of drag race.
7357360	7358360	You know what I mean?
7358560	7366600	Miss Vangie though, I think is going to be, um, what, what fan favorite called, um, uh,
7366600	7370200	crap that De La got and oh, Miss Congeniality.
7370200	7371200	Yes.
7371200	7372200	Thank you.
7372200	7373200	Cause I was like, I couldn't make the word come out of my mouth.
7373200	7377400	Oh, by the way, in chat right now, Frodo's swaggin says reload the mailbag cause I sent
7377400	7378400	something 10 minutes ago.
7378400	7379400	Too bad.
7379400	7382120	It's already closed and you made me lose a fish.
7382120	7383120	Damn it.
7383120	7384120	All right.
7384120	7385120	Let me look at this freaking mailbag.
7385120	7386120	We can roll it to next week.
7386120	7387120	Well, you won't be here next week.
7387120	7388120	Then you can read it.
7388120	7389120	Rob.
7389120	7390120	It's up to you.
7390120	7391120	No, you go ahead.
7391120	7392120	Let's do it.
7392120	7393120	Let's do it.
7393120	7394120	Loki.
7394120	7395120	Loki is literally typing in chat.
7395120	7396120	Save me.
7396120	7397120	It's just called OLR.
7397120	7398120	Okay.
7398120	7399120	All right.
7399120	7400120	Hey, OLR.
7400120	7401120	Frodo's swaggin's here.
7401120	7403760	I wanted to take a second to talk about Roblox.
7403760	7406960	I've always, it's coming up later in the show, but okay.
7406960	7407960	It's fine.
7407960	7408960	We'll talk about it now.
7408960	7409960	I've always seen it on X-Box and PC.
7409960	7410960	I've also seen it.
7410960	7411960	It's on X-Box?
7411960	7413960	I didn't know there was an X-Box.
7413960	7414960	That's cool.
7414960	7417080	Cause it's windows shit.
7417080	7418080	Makes sense.
7418080	7419080	Yeah.
7419080	7420440	I've also seen people try to do add-ons for it.
7420440	7422720	They get their computers hyper infected.
7422720	7424080	Watch what your kids download.
7424080	7425600	Is that the technical term for it?
7425600	7426600	It's windows shit.
7426600	7427600	Shit.
7427600	7428600	Yeah, exactly.
7428600	7429600	Is that the technical term?
7429600	7430600	Yeah.
7430600	7431600	Is that what we call the windows store now?
7431600	7432600	I did this number.
7432600	7433600	Sorry.
7433600	7434600	Sorry, Loki.
7434600	7435600	I didn't mean to.
7435600	7436600	It's very popular.
7436600	7437600	I know it's popular.
7437600	7438600	My son plays it every day.
7438600	7439600	Watch.
7439600	7440600	What do you download?
7440600	7441600	Come to find.
7441600	7442600	Oh, I don't want to download whatever.
7442600	7443600	What's it going to do?
7443600	7444600	Hyper infect this computer that has nothing on it?
7444600	7445680	Can I read an email, please?
7445680	7448240	Come to find out it's on all platforms, actually.
7448240	7452800	I also just assumed it was going to be for younger age group just by looking at the title
7452800	7453800	and screenshots.
7453800	7457400	Anyway, last week I said why not and opened up the game and holy shit, there are thousands
7457400	7459420	of games in there to choose from.
7459420	7463900	Not all games are great, but there are many gems here to have fun with.
7463900	7467720	It's literally all I've been playing lately, especially some of the first person shooters.
7467720	7472120	The graphics obviously aren't anything special, but the gameplay is definitely there.
7472120	7476280	Especially on PC with keyboard and mouse, the shooters feel great.
7476280	7478640	Also been dumping hours into restaurant tycoon.
7478640	7482880	Anyway, I had no idea what the heck Roblox was and I'm glad I opened it up.
7482880	7483880	Lol.
7483880	7487280	Also, I've seen people making their own games and putting it on there.
7487280	7489880	Loki, have you ever thought about making a game for Roblox?
7489880	7491800	No, I mean, sort of.
7491800	7495100	I've looked at it, but I'm not really interested in Roblox at all.
7495100	7496100	My son is.
7496100	7499840	That's actually why he's doing his programming class now, because actually part of the programming
7499840	7505720	class once he gets high enough into it, because they have to learn Scratch, then JavaScript,
7505720	7509320	then they actually do Roblox level making with Lua.
7509320	7512360	I keep forgetting your kid's going to finish a game before you do.
7512360	7513360	He doesn't.
7513360	7514360	He already did a game.
7514360	7518820	He's done several, because they have several projects that they work on.
7518820	7519820	I just don't.
7519820	7520820	The John Cena game.
7520820	7524880	He had that, but he has several that he's done since then, because he's been doing it
7524880	7526680	for like a couple months now.
7526680	7531640	But no, once they actually get out of, he belts up to yellow, they start doing JavaScript
7531640	7532640	and stuff.
7532640	7537480	And then eventually I think it's like they do Lua and Roblox and they start teaching
7537480	7539360	like level design, stuff like that.
7539360	7542960	I've thought about it, but like, I just don't want to.
7542960	7546800	You should say you've made him a game and it's nothing but like Josh's adventures at
7546800	7547880	the broccoli farm.
7547880	7551860	There's so much rampant like IP theft on that.
7551860	7555840	It's just not even like you think you think like YouTube's bad with all like the weird
7555840	7560000	children's programming, but like people like because I think some a lot of kids are making
7560000	7563040	so they don't give a fuck what they rip off.
7563040	7565880	It's just like, oh, hey, I'm playing a Five Nights at Freddy's game.
7565880	7570000	I'm sure you had permission to do that or hey, I'm playing an Avengers game or whatever
7570000	7571000	the fuck I'm playing.
7571000	7574440	The way I heard about Roblox the first time and like I thought it was just like a kid
7574440	7576760	only thing and I never even bothered to look at it.
7576760	7581540	The way I heard about it was that there were you know, I played those fakie fakie survivor
7581540	7583240	and big brother games online.
7583680	7589360	Well, some of those people play survivor Roblox games and so they have all sorts of this is
7589360	7590360	happening by the way.
7590360	7591360	Yeah.
7591360	7592360	Oh yes.
7592360	7593360	Now who's derailing the topic?
7593360	7594360	Yeah.
7594360	7595360	Yeah.
7595360	7598620	They have all sorts of like simulator games that he'll play and stuff and that's fine.
7598620	7599620	It's entertaining for him.
7599620	7600800	It's free.
7600800	7603640	He does want me to buy the premium currency form every once in a while.
7603640	7607320	I'll do that like once or twice a year for him and then that's it.
7607320	7611080	But like they've got like physical toys you can get the unlocked stuff in the games and
7611080	7612080	they have.
7612080	7615800	And you can basically build a game and build your own like premium stuff in there that
7615800	7620040	they purchase with their points and you get money for it is what kind of the incentive.
7620040	7624600	So it's funny our emailer brought up Roblox because I actually have a showreel story on
7624600	7625600	it here later.
7625600	7627600	We just haven't come across it yet.
7627600	7634840	And so I only know of this game what my friends from the other stuff have told me about it.
7634840	7637400	I haven't really bothered to do any research.
7637400	7641720	So sometimes when I want to learn more about a game I'll go look up twitch streams.
7641720	7644040	So you should totally stream yourself playing Roblox.
7644040	7645040	It's free.
7645040	7646040	OK.
7646040	7647040	Maybe I will.
7647040	7648040	Well here's the problem.
7648040	7651820	When I went into those like Roblox streams and like just clicked on some random ones
7651820	7658120	I sampled like for every single one of them was like a 13 year old and I felt fucking
7658120	7664440	creepy because I'm like I'm a 40 year old dude watching these 13 year olds play like
7664440	7665440	where are the adults.
7665440	7670040	You know the average people that play Fortnite though in like Apex Legends stuff is probably
7670040	7671040	the same.
7671040	7672900	So if you're probably you know what.
7672900	7679040	And see when I was 13 back in my day I was calling into BBS's and I bet like a lot of
7679040	7680040	adults are on this.
7680040	7683780	I remember talking to people that were in like their 20s and 30s and I was 13 posting
7683780	7687000	on these like fucking BBS threads and stuff.
7687000	7688000	Sorry I'm sorry.
7688000	7689000	I scared the hell.
7689000	7690000	My mom hated it.
7690000	7691000	Sorry to derail that.
7691000	7692000	Once again.
7692000	7693000	What else.
7693100	7695760	I did want to bring this up and this is to your interest as well.
7695760	7696760	Hold on.
7696760	7697760	Hold on.
7697760	7698760	Is the email done.
7698760	7699760	OK.
7699760	7700760	The email is done so we can we can do a tangent.
7700760	7701760	Sorry.
7701760	7705080	So Humble Bundle as I was talking about before they have another bundle right now that is
7705080	7708160	a classics video games.
7708160	7712320	It's boss fight books and they do kind of post mortems and stuff.
7712320	7717860	It's a nonfiction documentary style books about classic video games and stuff.
7717860	7725260	The reason I mention this is in their one dollar one there is a book on ZZT Oh get out
7725260	7729740	and not only ZZT but Earthbound Mega Man 3 Galaga.
7729740	7732820	And then of course you know if you pay that more than the average which is eight bucks
7732820	7739660	they have like Soft and Cuddly Super Mario Brothers 2 Bible Adventures Metal Gear Solid
7739660	7740660	American one.
7740660	7741660	And these are all e-books.
7741660	7743100	Yeah these are all e-books.
7743100	7747380	But like I saw the ZZT I'm like I may have to pick that up and that's good for another
7747900	7749260	about two and a half days.
7749260	7751300	So I hope I remember after the show to go look that up.
7751300	7753020	I love ZZT.
7753020	7757000	I'm curious though who the authors are because if they're authors that work for a particular
7757000	7760100	large gaming Web site then I'm interested.
7760100	7761820	It's Anna Anthropy.
7761820	7765940	I oh I've I've heard that name before.
7765940	7770020	I believe she was at one of the gamer X events.
7770020	7771020	Yes.
7771020	7778020	She's been right or author of Rise of the Video Game Zenisters.
7778020	7783820	OK yes I know I think I recognize the panels a gamer game creator historian 30 year old
7783820	7784820	teen witch.
7784820	7785820	All right.
7785820	7786820	So OK.
7786820	7787820	I can deal with that.
7787820	7789780	Teen witches are so in right now.
7789780	7790780	Yeah.
7790780	7791780	You know watching Sabrina.
7791780	7792780	All right.
7792780	7793780	OK.
7793780	7794780	Oh.
7794780	7795780	And says.
7795780	7796780	Yeah.
7796780	7797780	Yeah.
7797780	7798780	She says her previous.
7798780	7799780	Yeah.
7799780	7803780	Rise of the Video Game Zenisters and Starwench which she recently made is easy to version
7803780	7804780	of.
7804780	7805780	Oh so.
7805780	7806780	OK.
7806780	7807780	So there's a little credit in there.
7807780	7808780	She makes her own ZZT game.
7808780	7809780	So yeah.
7809780	7810780	All right.
7810780	7811780	I'm into it.
7811780	7812780	Yeah.
7812780	7813780	Definitely.
7813780	7814780	All right.
7814780	7815780	I'll check it out.
7815780	7816780	All right.
7816780	7817780	Anyways that's all I had.
7817780	7818780	No that's fine.
7818780	7819780	Let's move on.
7819780	7820780	Let's get into some more gaming news.
7820780	7821780	You have a few more things that we're going to get to the discord part of the show and
7821780	7822780	as well as any chat room comments.
7822780	7824660	We'll get to that a little later on here in our roundtable.
7824660	7825660	But first Loki.
7825660	7826660	So this is interesting.
7826660	7831660	We have Twitch actually releasing games on their platform.
7831660	7836300	So this is a new free to play karaoke game called Twitch sings and it's a partnership
7836300	7840180	between harmonics and Twitch and it's been in beta for a while.
7840180	7841180	Yes.
7841180	7844380	Because you've probably seen this on Twitch already but only certain people had access
7844380	7846080	to it.
7846080	7847500	So apparently yet.
7847500	7852660	So they have now close to 2000 songs and we'll get new songs over time.
7852660	7856260	And apparently it ties directly with the players Twitch accounts letting them stream
7856260	7862980	games without needing any sort of additional software or whatever.
7862980	7869340	Interesting you also support duets using asynchronous multiplayer where one person records half
7869340	7874420	of it and the other person sings to the upload of that.
7874420	7877500	Interesting I have no interest in doing this whatsoever but it's interesting that it's
7877500	7878500	something that's available.
7878500	7886460	I hope we see more things like this or you know Twitch built games or something.
7886460	7889700	I downloaded it and I'm too afraid to play it on stream.
7889700	7896420	I got to be honest because my one like karaoke infamous thing I did was when we were at that
7896420	7901060	theme park years ago and I went to sound booth and I did Madonna's like a prayer because
7901060	7905260	that was like a big thing you will do like yeah you go record your video or the video
7905260	7909540	no music video is a CD this is before like CD burners were everywhere.
7909540	7912260	So like that was the great America right now is a great America.
7912260	7913260	Yeah we're there.
7913260	7920400	You know I didn't do that Jessica did Lisa Loeb or oh oh no non blondes that was always
7920400	7922040	her like no she did.
7922040	7923040	She did stay.
7923040	7924040	Oh yeah.
7924040	7925040	That was one of her go to.
7925040	7926040	So yeah.
7926040	7927040	Yeah.
7927040	7928040	But anyway.
7928040	7929040	So anyway.
7929040	7931380	Well the problem is that CD ended up in the hands of trying to Travis Donovan.
7931380	7934140	Oh no.
7934140	7937920	So it kind of like makes me nervous to do karaoke again.
7937920	7942780	I've gone out and done karaoke at bars and stuff but I don't know like I'm not a great
7942780	7948180	singer like I'm not William Hung but I'm not like great.
7948180	7950220	I'm going to get off key sometimes.
7950220	7952060	So makes me a little scared to play it on Twitch.
7952060	7955140	I did download the client just to see if I could play it like offline.
7955140	7959940	I think I can but I didn't even want to play it because Alan was home.
7959940	7963500	I didn't even want Alan around I was trying to play it.
7963500	7966860	I should have played it earlier today when he went to the gym but I was working on it.
7966860	7971260	I did that movie you saw during the break instead when he was gone at the gym.
7971260	7972260	So I don't know.
7972260	7973620	Maybe I'll play two things somewhat.
7973620	7976700	Would you be willing to do karaoke on stream or soccer.
7976700	7978620	I would do it once once.
7978620	7979620	OK.
7979620	7980620	All right.
7980620	7984040	I've I've done it and I've been recorded before.
7984040	7986140	Maybe I'll do it for charity.
7986140	7989500	Maybe that's maybe that's will finally get me to do two things if it's for rock band
7989500	7990500	for charity maybe.
7990500	7991500	Yeah.
7991500	7992500	Something like that.
7992500	7994940	By the way why are all the copies of robot money do you like expensive.
7994940	7997260	I have no idea why.
7997260	7999260	I don't know.
7999260	8001100	All right.
8001100	8005540	Moving on to talk about World of Warcraft something a little more old school and getting
8005540	8009620	really old school pretty soon because World of Warcraft classic as you know is on the
8009620	8014140	way out because what's new is not good for some people they want to go play the game
8014140	8018180	the way it used to be back in my day so World of Warcraft classic is on the way and people
8018180	8020740	want to know how's PVP going to work.
8020740	8024940	Like because you know PVP didn't just like end up in the game all at once.
8024940	8029060	How is it going to work in World of Warcraft classic what's going to look like when the
8029060	8030060	game rolls out.
8030060	8033980	And the answer is it's going to be rolled out gradually just like it was when the original
8033980	8035160	game launched.
8035160	8038420	So there will be no kill tracking or reward system at first.
8038420	8041500	If you take down other players just to kill them.
8041500	8043180	That's just good.
8043180	8044180	Good on you.
8044180	8045180	E-peen.
8045180	8046180	E-peen points.
8046180	8047180	That's all you get.
8047820	8051820	Phase two kicks in there will be an honor system and rank rewards.
8051820	8054540	And then the third phase will bring in the battlegrounds.
8054540	8056900	Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch.
8056900	8059260	The fourth phase, Arathi Basin.
8059260	8063860	The fifth phase I don't think I don't think will affect PVP I think they're doing other
8063860	8064860	updates.
8064860	8069040	And the sixth phase is finally the World PVP in the Eastern Playlands and Silithus.
8069040	8071220	But we don't know how long these phases are.
8071220	8072220	We don't know if they're months.
8072220	8075620	We don't know if they're weeks or what that's going to look like.
8075620	8076620	But I don't know.
8076620	8080220	I really think all these people have been demanding the classic WoT and I think they're
8080220	8083100	going to download it, play it, and realize it sucks.
8083100	8086940	Like I just feel like Blizzard's pouring all these resources into something that's not
8086940	8088660	going to last very long.
8088660	8093940	I mean I'm sure there'll be like a little a little audience that sticks with it hardcore.
8093940	8097020	Now if they were doing something a little more frozen in time when Wrath of the Lich
8097020	8101060	King was current content maybe but I even then I still feel like it would be something
8101060	8105260	where it's like oh you download the novelties but you've just gotten too used to the quality
8105260	8108840	of life stuff that's in the MMOs now.
8108840	8115420	Like when people realize that there is no flying mounts that's going to be irritating.
8115420	8119580	When people realize that oh there's weapon skills you have to level up because that's
8119580	8122300	what you used to have to do and wow they're going to be annoyed.
8122300	8126540	Like there's a lot of things where the quality of life you forget like how much these games
8126540	8130340	have progressed because oh everything sucks now I guess.
8130340	8131340	I don't know.
8131340	8134340	Anyway World of Warcraft classic I'll still check it out.
8134340	8140880	Like I mean it's supposed to be free if you're a wow subscriber anyway which I am so I'll
8140880	8146100	check it out anyway but it's just I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.
8146100	8147100	All right.
8147100	8148100	Anyhow let's move on.
8148100	8150020	DarkSakura what do you have for us?
8150020	8155920	Well there is a documentary coming about this comes actually from Destructoid but they are
8155920	8163480	doing a project about Shirley Curry who is the gaming grandma.
8163480	8168380	And so they're going to basically it's going to be actually no it looks like it's already
8168380	8171880	released but it's for her 83rd birthday.
8171880	8176840	Going through Skyrim and YouTube and how all of these people have affected her life and
8176840	8180120	how she keeps doing it and enjoys what she does.
8180120	8186660	So I think that's pretty cool and I'd say if you want to watch it I'll link the page
8186660	8192640	for it in the chat room but it's on Destructoid and I think it would be a worthwhile watch.
8192640	8196740	And this is the same grandma that is like known for Skyrim and we just had a story like
8196740	8200480	two weeks ago about that she's in Elder Scrolls 6 now.
8200480	8201480	Yep.
8201480	8202480	That's pretty cool.
8202480	8203480	Yeah.
8203480	8204920	She seems like a fun lady.
8204920	8208960	So I tried to get my mom into games but she wasn't having it.
8208960	8214320	I can just imagine your mom sit her down with Skyrim you know and what she would say.
8214320	8215320	No.
8215320	8216320	Yeah.
8216320	8217320	She would.
8217320	8218320	Yeah.
8218320	8219320	No.
8219320	8220720	I detect holding a controller like this.
8220720	8221720	She'd be like what do I do.
8221720	8222720	There's too many.
8222720	8223720	But you know you do it.
8223720	8224720	I'll just tell you what to do.
8224720	8225720	No.
8225720	8231400	The only games I could ever get my mom to play would be like Wheel of Fortune Jeopardy
8231400	8233800	Family Feud like the game show games.
8233800	8237760	She would play those but she would still be like you type it in.
8237760	8238760	You do.
8238760	8239760	You run it.
8239760	8240760	I don't want to touch it.
8240760	8241760	Oh my God.
8241760	8244240	Why don't they have game show games like in VR.
8244240	8247980	Like imagine actually being able to spin the wheel in Wheel of Fortune.
8247980	8250220	I'm sure somebody is working on something like that.
8250220	8254740	Just I was going to say just waiting for VR to gain a little more of a foothold.
8254740	8259260	But honestly PlayStation VR is so like out there now I'm now I'm surprised there isn't
8259260	8260620	a Wheel of Fortune VR game.
8260620	8262620	You can even have someone host it or something.
8262620	8263620	I don't know.
8263620	8264620	It'd be funny.
8264620	8265620	It's like a wish.
8265620	8266620	Yeah.
8266620	8267620	Yeah.
8267620	8268620	Yeah.
8268620	8271140	These I smell money games live game show apps are all the rage.
8271140	8276060	Now did you know that even dating apps have like game show things in them.
8276060	8277060	What Yeah.
8277060	8280100	There's like there's a there's what are you saying there's like a tinder game show now
8280100	8284060	sort of like I wouldn't expect you to know about this because it's a gay dating app.
8284060	8288760	There's a gay one called Scruff that like you know gay dudes used to find each other.
8288760	8293400	And this thing has a game show built into it that they do.
8293400	8299180	That's just it's the exact same thing as HQ it's the exact same thing as that.
8299180	8302820	But it's in this and they'll they'll do a thing where they're all like if you've been
8302820	8306220	eliminated from the game you can swipe to the side and see other players that have been
8306220	8309900	eliminated and you can tap on their profile to save them for later or whatever.
8309900	8315140	I don't I don't know all the ins and outs of it but yeah they do like a game show and
8315140	8320540	I know it's funny but like it's all the rage these these game show things okey doke.
8320540	8322780	And I don't think it's just dating apps that are doing them too.
8322780	8329400	So I'm surprised that we don't have like an HQ type of thing on PlayStation yet or Microsoft.
8329400	8330400	Maybe it's a matter of time.
8330400	8331460	I don't know.
8331460	8338680	So let's see Kai's you know says I was watching a trivia show in Altspace VR SSU 100 Matt
8338680	8343280	says got to have a VR match game with a digital Charles Nelson Riley.
8343280	8344280	Hell yes.
8344280	8348560	Well ABC has been reviving all those old game shows like match game is back on ABC and they're
8348560	8350400	they're doing a press your luck.
8350400	8354120	And I think it was the other one concentration maybe that they're doing to I know there's
8354120	8355120	they're adapting.
8355120	8356120	Yeah.
8356120	8359240	ABC is having a lot of those game shows are probably more successful in American Idol
8359240	8362800	reboots doing so you know that's on air.
8362800	8366640	It's like literally on right now like on the word like there's an American Idol thing on
8366640	8367640	now.
8367640	8368640	Like against Game of Thrones.
8368640	8369640	Yeah.
8369640	8370640	Right.
8370640	8371640	Yeah.
8371640	8372880	I guess it's something to realize that was on.
8372880	8373880	Yeah.
8373880	8374880	No it's back.
8374880	8379980	Well like it's not even Simon Cowling there anymore it's Katy Perry some country guy Luke
8379980	8382880	something and Lionel Richie.
8382880	8387640	Yeah I watched that like part maybe part of it last season.
8387640	8388640	I don't really remember.
8388640	8395140	I don't watch the show but I see the emotional porn clips on Facebook of like this really
8395140	8398320	sweet audition that just knocks it apart.
8398320	8402140	You won't believe what happens at the 75 second mark like those types of things.
8402140	8405380	I just know I'm not doing this.
8405380	8406380	I tried to.
8406380	8409220	We tried watching I think we just got bored of it really fast.
8409220	8413180	All right let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we get to discord if we
8413180	8417460	have anybody tonight unfortunately because of those things our live viewership is a little
8417460	8419500	lower than this week.
8419500	8420500	How long is the season again.
8420500	8421900	There's only like six or seven weeks right.
8421900	8422900	It's a short season.
8422900	8424180	It's like eight episodes.
8424220	8426500	No offense but good.
8426500	8427500	It's gotten into our numbers.
8427500	8428500	All right.
8428500	8430380	A few more stories for you guys first though Loki.
8430380	8434700	So in case you're not aware there is this Twitter account called Can you pet the dog
8434700	8440460	which basically answers or ask that question among lots of things including games.
8440460	8443820	I'm assuming just games.
8443820	8449820	But apparently one of them it actually looked at into the gungeon and it said no.
8449820	8457220	And so into the gungeon of course the devs behind that once people I guess saw that they
8457220	8461640	prompted them to like hey you know why can't we pet the dog in the game.
8461640	8466980	So with the latest update they have now added the ability to pet the dog into the game in
8466980	8471820	which the of course tweet was deleted from the Twitter account.
8471820	8478740	Can you pet the dog with now it being updated to say yes yes now you can pet the dog.
8479740	8485700	All those updates just to get on the Web site that yes you can now pet the dog.
8485700	8486700	Yes.
8486700	8487700	What happens when you pet the dog.
8487700	8488700	Just go Arf.
8488700	8492500	I don't like in some games when you go up and talk to the dog the dog just goes wolf
8492500	8495220	estimation boy and that's like you petting the dog.
8495220	8499460	I don't know but you can I guess I'll have to download and see I don't know.
8499460	8500460	All right.
8500460	8501460	Anyhow.
8501460	8506980	And lastly tonight my last story that I had earmarked for tonight was about roblox.
8506980	8511100	So I guess we kind of already got into that discussion earlier but the notable landmark
8511100	8516760	for roblox is that they have hit 90 million monthly active users.
8516760	8519220	They announced that news today actually.
8519220	8523780	This gaming company is also going to be expanding into other territories.
8523780	8528740	French and German languages will be added into the game and even more languages from
8528740	8529740	there.
8529740	8535080	So in a statement the president of roblox international which yes is a thing Chris Minzer
8535080	8539740	said roblox is where anyone can unleash their creativity and have fun with their friends
8539740	8541380	no matter where they live.
8541380	8545820	By bringing top games and resources to French and German audiences we're uniting the next
8545820	8550840	generation through a truly global platform for play.
8550840	8553160	Everyone playing it is 13 I'm telling you.
8553160	8555300	Or younger.
8555300	8556300	Or even younger.
8556300	8560440	No I should I there was one or two people in chat that were like I'm 30 and I play it
8560440	8563600	so I'm just saying I just knows wow.
8563600	8564600	I feel old.
8564600	8569040	I don't usually get that feeling a lot but yeah and dark soccer if you're in your feelings
8569040	8573480	right now with your birthday being this week I implore you do not watch roblox streams
8573480	8579000	because you'll just be more in your feelings because that's where I was today.
8579000	8580900	I have no feelings.
8580900	8583920	My heart shriveled up.
8583920	8584920	All right.
8584920	8589800	So congratulations though to roblox no you know what I will say this.
8589800	8597740	I will say that it's really cool that roblox is getting kids interested in programming
8597740	8599960	and stuff like the way you describe it.
8599960	8600960	That is pretty rad.
8600960	8606000	So as much as I like poke fun at this game tongue in cheek I think that is really cool.
8606000	8609480	Wow breaking news I had no idea this was the case.
8609480	8614320	Bobby Blackwell is telling me buzzer the network on Twitch that has all the classic game shows
8614320	8616800	is no longer airing.
8616800	8618160	That's tragic.
8618160	8621040	Is the over the air buzzer still there.
8621040	8622040	I'm sad.
8622040	8623040	What happened.
8623040	8627520	They put a goodbye message or anything.
8627520	8628520	God damn it.
8628520	8630260	This is why we can't have nice things.
8630260	8634720	I love my classic game shows but I guess that's actually I feel like it probably went off
8634720	8635720	the air a while ago.
8635720	8639000	I haven't seen it in a long time actually.
8639000	8642520	So they probably pulled themselves a long time ago.
8642520	8645780	No I don't see anything.
8645780	8647480	It just said we'll be back soon.
8647800	8648800	All right then.
8648800	8650200	Yeah as soon as any time.
8650200	8651880	Yeah that could be anything.
8651880	8656600	All right well anyhow hopefully you'll be with us very soon.
8656600	8660120	We're going to take some calls now via discord.
8660120	8666800	So if you want to be on the show you can join the green room over on the vog network discord
8666800	8672880	which again is accessible over at vog network dot com slash discord.
8672880	8676000	Although of course nobody's there right now I have a feeling it's going to be a very slow
8676000	8680280	week just because our live listenership is a little bit lower than usual and I imagine
8680280	8683520	all the TV going on and other things share of sorts.
8683520	8687480	Well not just that but if I'm not mistaken if Easter is next weekend then I mean spring
8687480	8689760	break started this week for a lot of people.
8689760	8690760	Right.
8690760	8691760	Yeah.
8691760	8692760	So that's probably cutting into it too.
8692760	8697200	So I don't think it's just the HBO shows fault and that sort of thing.
8697200	8701880	So we'll take questions in our chat and comments as well over a vog.
8701880	8706720	Well I mean vog network dot com will get you there but over twitch TV slash vog network.
8706720	8711960	So as you know says I just saw buzzer a day or two ago it's a sister network on one of
8711960	8713040	my local channels.
8713040	8719100	Yeah they they are you know when TV switched from analog to digital right.
8719100	8723240	So like TVs don't have the dials anymore or if you had a TV that had the dials you had
8723240	8726960	to get an adapter to get digital signals that changed like God that was probably like eight
8726960	8729800	years ago at this point it's been a while.
8729800	8734600	When the expansion to digital happened there's more room there's more bandwidth.
8734600	8738160	So it's off the air because I'm like it seems to be pulling up on their Web site.
8738160	8741120	I don't know if maybe they're streaming through a different platform or something interesting
8741120	8744880	I don't know if they have it or that could actually that could be the buzzer.
8744880	8748000	That could be the buzzer network that's over the air.
8748000	8754240	Maybe it's just on their their but but I can't pull that up on my Xbox one.
8754240	8757780	That's what I like to do with the twitch app is I would just pull up buzzer and watch old
8757780	8758840	game shows.
8758840	8765860	So anyway but yeah no but the digital expansion happens so that's why you have like all these
8765860	8771780	like little networks that you're like you know like your CBS station like here we have
8771780	8774080	what CBS is 13 right.
8774080	8780180	So I think 13 too is like the CBS all news network all day and it is news all 24 7 and
8780180	8783260	I think there's another one that's just weather 24 7.
8783260	8787100	And so that's where buzzer goes on some of these areas is that they just go on one of
8787100	8788680	the digital channels.
8788680	8791840	Some will do like Christian programming all day long depending on what part of the country
8791840	8796380	you live in or other types of religious programming or possibly Spanish language programming is
8796380	8798800	another one.
8798800	8800620	There's another one that's on to movies.
8800620	8803060	There's some that just show classic movies all day long.
8803060	8804700	So it just depends.
8804700	8811820	Let's see Frodo Swaggins is asking in our chat room is did Facebook streaming ever go
8811820	8812820	anywhere.
8812820	8814140	Oh it's it's still a thing.
8814140	8816420	I see it's so easy from your mobile phone.
8816420	8818780	I mean like the real life streaming.
8818780	8819900	I see that all the time.
8819900	8825380	I was watching because I was a youtuber that I watch only 43 who does a lot of Grand Theft
8825380	8827420	Auto stuff and all sorts of other games.
8827420	8833060	But he for a while tried doing live streaming from Facebook for the Facebook gaming stuff
8833060	8834060	specifically gaming.
8834060	8835060	OK.
8835060	8836060	Yeah.
8836060	8839840	So Facebook gaming stuff and his thing take away from it was when he did like his first
8839840	8841220	few streams.
8841220	8847280	He got quite a few views on there but then it really dropped immensely afterwards like
8847280	8851860	he was getting just no traction whatsoever and he thought it was probably their algorithm
8851860	8853360	that's fucking with it.
8853360	8857860	And so he's basically given up on it and going back to Twitch and YouTube instead.
8857860	8863020	So it sounds like it's still out there but however they have their algorithms it's not
8863020	8864020	working out.
8864020	8866700	They might have had that curiosity factor at first too.
8866700	8870340	But then like now people aren't talking about oh Facebook's getting into gaming streaming
8870460	8871460	so people aren't looking at it.
8871460	8872460	Yeah.
8872460	8873460	I think that's a huge part.
8873460	8880180	So it's there but I don't know how long until I think that the problem where I think a lot
8880180	8884140	of the competitors to Twitch and so forth have a real problem getting their foot in
8884140	8886620	the door is because Twitch has an app.
8886620	8888740	Twitch isn't just a Web site.
8888740	8890060	Twitch is a phone app.
8890060	8891980	Twitch is an app on PlayStation 4.
8891980	8893460	It's an app on Xbox One.
8893460	8896980	And I would bet those that are watching the show right now some are probably on their
8896980	8897980	PCs.
8897980	8901180	Most are on their PCs or Macs whatever you know desktop computers right now watching
8901180	8902180	the show.
8902180	8906660	And I would say quite a few are on their mobile phones watching probably so they can watch
8906660	8909300	in their bedroom or while they multitask or something.
8909300	8912180	Maybe some might just have their headphones in because you can just listen to audio only
8912180	8913180	on Twitch.
8913180	8915340	So some people might be doing it that way.
8915340	8920100	And then some folks might be on their PlayStation or their Xbox One streaming through it right
8920100	8921100	now.
8921100	8922900	That's what's so I think great about Twitch.
8922900	8929420	When Facebook gaming came out the only way to watch it was on PC or Mac or whatever.
8929420	8931580	Could you even do it on the mobile app.
8931580	8933420	Maybe you probably could do it on the mobile app.
8933420	8934420	That's it.
8934420	8936860	It wasn't really baked into consoles or anything else.
8936860	8941380	At least Mixer you know which is probably Twitch's biggest well Mixer and YouTube I
8941380	8943460	guess which are probably the biggest competitors.
8943460	8945560	YouTube is also available everywhere right.
8945560	8947580	We know that YouTube is everywhere.
8947580	8949180	Mixer is on most of those places.
8949180	8953460	It's just not on the PlayStation or the Nintendo Switch.
8953460	8959800	But if these rumors and things about Nintendo and Microsoft being in bed together continue
8959800	8964460	I would bet we're going to get a Mixer app on Nintendo Switch before we get a Twitch
8964460	8966900	app on Nintendo Switch.
8966900	8968480	Not saying you're gonna be able to stream your games.
8968480	8972460	I don't know if the Switch has the power for that but you might be able to watch at least.
8972460	8974180	I mean YouTube is on there now.
8974180	8975220	Am I correct.
8975220	8976220	So yeah.
8976220	8977220	Yeah.
8977260	8983060	Look in our chat lights up there and Bobby says the Amazon Fire TV stick finally got
8983060	8984060	a Twitch update.
8984060	8986620	Act Deaf is using his PlayStation 4.
8986620	8988860	Spyro 557 Jonathan's on his phone.
8988860	8990980	Frodo Swaggins is on his phone at work.
8990980	8993660	So people that's the great thing about Twitch in my opinion.
8993660	8999280	And one reason why I was really sold on the move over from how we were doing this before
8999280	9000280	on Shoutcast.
9000280	9001280	Yeah.
9001280	9004600	Because you couldn't really do Shoutcast I mean you could do Shoutcast on mobile but
9004600	9008880	it was like you had to know that you really download an app called TuneIn and that will
9008880	9011800	get you into it and like all this stuff like it just wasn't the same.
9011800	9015720	Like Twitch is very very easy and that's kind of what I like about it to be honest.
9015720	9019240	Anyway I do see we have a call waiting in the green room so I want to go ahead and take
9019240	9020240	a call here.
9020240	9025560	I just closed my control panel however so there we go I think I can do my drag and drop
9025560	9026560	now.
9026560	9027560	Yes there we go.
9027560	9028560	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9028560	9029560	Who's this?
9029560	9030560	Hey this is Act Deaf.
9030560	9031840	Hey it's good to hear from you Act Deaf.
9031840	9032840	What's up buddy?
9033080	9043000	Well I want to talk about KmonGo and pretty much all the events we've had for the last
9043000	9046460	like two months maybe.
9046460	9050640	There's been a lot right because we don't just have the community days but we've been
9050640	9055600	having these research days right so it's it's been a lot.
9055600	9060500	Yeah it's been a lot we've had the at least in the last month.
9060500	9071740	We've had the Econox event, we've had also the Lotad and Castform event, then we also
9071740	9083540	had Trico last month, we had just the Bagon community day also and we had this past week
9083540	9088140	what what what other event we had oh the debug got a bug out event.
9088140	9096540	So yeah there have been like really really tons of events but by my question here for
9096540	9104380	for you and anyone on the studio playing Pokemon Go have you liked the events at all?
9104380	9107620	Have you literally been like excited to play an event?
9107620	9109620	When I can go to them.
9109620	9115220	Yeah I'm kind of with you Jamie I like the concept of the events I think they're doing
9115220	9118880	too many of these limited time events.
9118880	9123940	I think these like week long things like the bug festival or the raid bosses are changing
9123940	9128620	that's fine but like there's too many things that are limited time and then you have that
9128620	9132820	whole FOMO if you fear missing out and you feel like well the object of the game is to
9132820	9136060	collect them all and they can't do every event then I've flopped and I might as well quit
9136060	9142100	playing and like these things like the lunchtime raids like in theory that's a good idea but
9142100	9147980	that they should be doing it like more often than what they're doing or the you know the
9147980	9154660	community day and stuff that's fine and good but like I can't like put aside this specific
9154660	9161860	three hour window to go do these things every time you know at the whim of Niantic and whatever
9161860	9165540	window they choose that's why I think the low tat event and the castle one thing ended
9165540	9170540	up being a little better because that had the nine hour window on it right yeah yeah
9170780	9174460	and that was a little better so you didn't feel the need to grind the entire nine hours
9174460	9177780	you just did it enough to get like your one or two but then I guess the shiny drop rate
9177780	9181740	was so low on some some people did grind for hours and hours and still didn't get what
9181740	9185100	they were looking for so I think Niantic in some ways has to find the balance there but
9185100	9191500	I think as far as like the burnout of Pokemon go with all these events and the limited event
9191500	9197580	fatigue I think it's very real like I have a friend who is a big presence in Pokemon
9197620	9202980	go like co like he doesn't lead the raid group but he's kind of like the vice lead of a big
9202980	9208340	raid group here locally and he kind of said like yeah I'm just getting really kind of like Pokemon
9208340	9212660	go is kind of starting to drag a little bit like it's just not as exciting as used to be so he
9212660	9219180	picked up ingress and like he's gone like off the deep end and ingress I mean that a good way like
9219180	9223380	he's already up to like level he's gonna be level 9 pretty soon which you know takes a little while
9223780	9228100	I know it doesn't sound like a long way but it's a pretty long way in ingress and it like he's just
9228100	9233500	enjoying that right now so it's and I'm sure when the Harry Potter game comes out of all things it's
9233500	9238180	gonna make this worse because so many people are gonna want to jump ship to Harry Potter now is that
9238180	9243740	really a loss for Niantic I guess not if they're just it's kind of like it's kind of like when
9243740	9250420	people leave World of Warcraft to go play overwatch is that really a loss for blizzard not really
9250420	9255380	because you're still kind of keeping them in the system keeping it in the fam so to speak so yeah
9255380	9260060	I don't know but um how are you feeling about it all act after what's that what's the impression
9260060	9267460	from you as well as like your community well mostly my community has been someone liking it
9267460	9276220	but but I understand also the frustration coming from the loss of people and friends that are
9276220	9284900	playing right now because like for example the past bug out of band that lasted a week do you
9284900	9292900	get any like shiny from from it from which event I didn't get any from the last one yeah from the
9292900	9298780	bug bug out of and from oh the bug event no I didn't get any I I'm sorry when he was saying
9298780	9304700	that real fat I was like is that a bag on I got no no the bug event I ain't gaining I had well I
9304700	9310900	already had a shiny Caterpie I had that from before I got it in a research task but I know
9310900	9314980	like Scyther was the new one no I did I saw Scyther's everywhere but I didn't get a shiny
9314980	9320220	yeah and many people were frustrated because of that because oh there they all wanted us
9320220	9329180	a shiny Scyther I managed to get one and I was like really really lucky but so many people even
9329340	9336580	in my my personal raid group like we're really really frustrated they were like oh I'm tired
9336580	9345980	of this I don't want to do this every every single week like per se because if if you're not gonna
9345980	9353300	get like new content we're not gonna get like that really really big chance of getting a shiny
9353380	9359900	and I understand that a shiny it's like a really really lucky occurrence it shouldn't be like oh
9359900	9367700	they they just dust them around especially with this kind of events but still it's like there's
9367700	9377460	no not gonna say pressure but there's no there's no really really great reward yeah or doing those
9377460	9383780	events so yeah you just play normally I think Pokemon go could really benefit from like a
9383780	9389020	crafting system sort of thing like a way and you know not maybe like literally the way you might
9389020	9394100	interpret what I'm when I say that but like you know a way to sort of guarantee that you can get
9394100	9400980	a shiny Scyther if you do like a lot of work like you might still have a chance at it through RNG
9400980	9406300	but like you guarantee yourself one if you're willing to do a lure item for a shiny yeah well
9406580	9410580	because they don't want to give out well I've heard that that might be something because somebody did
9410580	9415980	data mining I've heard there is like a shiny it's either a is it a lure or an incense these an
9415980	9419980	incense thing that they're looking at doing like that would attract more shinies but I also
9419980	9426660	realized Niantic doesn't want to necessarily give away shinies like candy because there's only so
9426660	9431580	many and then like if somebody fills out a pokey Texas shinies then what you know like what's what's
9431580	9435980	left to do in the game for some people so they want to keep people coming back so but I you know
9436180	9443900	I think of things like the Meltan quest I took a long time to do or the what was the one the
9443900	9449900	Halloween by the way I know it's hard it's hard to find the Aerodactyl huh spirit orb I think I've
9449900	9455380	had a bunch of Aerodactyls had a spear I just keep forgetting the transfer stuff to my let's go game
9455380	9459660	but um you know they had a question I think I think maybe if there was like some type of
9459660	9463300	questing or some other way you could like guarantee you to get a shiny if you do a lot
9463300	9469260	of work if you spin a stop every day if you're checking like I I think it would help I think
9469260	9473780	with some of that so that at least you can still get the reward and not feel like you're just at
9473780	9479820	the mercy of the random number generator yeah and I've seen concepts of that like the shiny
9479820	9489260	incense and also like in the main games that you can have a shiny charm so you could possibly get
9489340	9496900	they could reward it if if they they're planning on expanding levels like instead of 40 being the
9496900	9505500	limit like 45 or 50 being the level limit they can probably reward the a shiny charm for yeah
9505500	9510740	those getting levels or you know maybe maybe you'll hate me for putting this idea out in the
9510740	9515700	universe but one big thing they started doing in ingress when they released ingress prime is that
9515700	9521420	now you can do something called recursion so if you were a max level agent in ingress level 16
9521420	9525980	you could basically go back to the beginning you wouldn't lose your badge you wouldn't lose your
9525980	9530100	perks that come with the leveling you wouldn't lose like your badges or anything you wouldn't
9530100	9535020	lose your lifetime AP is still track but basically you go back to level one and level again I
9535020	9540260	actually did it and I'm only on level 10 in the recursion process now so soft six levels to go
9540260	9544980	which can take me a very long time but my point is we're still waiting to see what the perk is
9544980	9551300	for recursing in the first place besides a shiny badge but what if they brought in a similar type
9551300	9556340	of system in Pokemon go where okay you've hit the max level you've gone as far as you can go in
9556340	9564980	Pokemon go you can reset back to level one but you get a big reward like a shiny charm maybe would be
9564980	9570100	like your your reward for resetting back to level one I bet you there's people that would do it for
9570100	9579460	a shiny charm Shane or maybe like a permanent incubator and a second permanent incubator for
9579460	9583980	recursing going back to the beginning there might be some people that would be really intrigued by
9583980	9590020	that idea so I don't know this is something that I could I think when we talk about extra levels in
9590020	9595260	Pokemon go I have a feeling they might do something like the recursion from ingress instead or
9595420	9601820	prestige ing is how they call this in other games too and yeah that that would be actually awesome I
9601820	9609580	would be down for that actually because even right now and as sj100 madison and shad you get to level
9609580	9617020	40 and lucky x are like yeah I I don't need them I I have no use for them I have like almost like
9617820	9622540	more than 40 lucky x that I don't I don't use because I don't have the need for them
9622540	9629740	so yeah having like recursive or or prestige whatever they want to call it yeah it would be
9629740	9637660	great because they I would be like more incentivized to play more because I would
9637660	9644460	like to to get those rewards again at level 20 level 30 or even getting again to level 40
9645020	9652300	that that would be like really awesome that the game is fine right now it's it isn't
9652300	9657740	and like bobby buckwolf says also a dead game it isn't at all well he always says that just yeah
9658460	9665020	yeah he's that's the recurring joke there but but still that there's many people that think that
9665660	9673660	and it it isn't but it's starting to feel like is it is going to be a dead game it won't it's
9673740	9679980	starting to feel like a job and games shouldn't feel like a job yes and I see people that treat
9679980	9686060	pokemon go and ingress as their job you know and it's like you just kind of like okay you don't
9686060	9691500	want to let a game dictate that much you know what I mean it's it's really it's really kind
9691500	9696220	of hard to watch that but um maybe niantic is listening and maybe would adapt some of these
9696220	9700300	ideas I think that would be very exciting but I will say this you know despite this conversation
9700300	9703580	about some of the troubles of pokemon go I don't know about your neck of the woods but like
9703580	9709020	community day yesterday down at capital park where I usually go it was it was hopping like it was
9709020	9712620	more crowded yesterday and I've seen it in quite a while so I don't know if that's just because the
9712620	9719340	weather was really good too or what but it was it was hopping yesterday oh yeah I've seen that
9719900	9726380	effect on my neck on the woods were there server problems there's um not in the states yeah there
9726380	9732140	were server problems in japan yeah yeah they they always happen in japan it's like they give
9732140	9737260	they end up extending it and in japan what happens is because now they do it time zone by time zone
9737260	9742300	who has the first time zones on the planet that region like australia asia they get the first
9742300	9748140	ones and so all the problems show up then yeah in japan it's always a given that it's going to fail
9748140	9753980	that these at the first hour so yeah they always extend it they always do something like that
9753980	9759020	because it always fails because there's way too many people playing in japan yeah and not
9759020	9764700	mentioning spoopers but yeah i was gonna say i didn't notice anything going on so no it was
9764700	9769900	fine here but but california if you think about it we're one of the last areas to do community
9769900	9775660	day because the only place on earth that has time zones later than us is like hawaii alaska
9775660	9781100	the hawaii and alaska would be the latter or earlier than us would be the no they're they
9781260	9785580	because they have to wait till it's three o'clock in their region so oh i see and they're behind so
9785580	9793100	hawaii is like the last on the planet to do the community day basically yeah so yeah but but yeah
9793100	9800140	going back to the community day thing it was pretty great the past two community days have been
9800140	9807020	really packed their way there have been way more people than in previous community days and that
9807020	9813500	has been awesome but something that is going to suck but really really suck is coming into the
9813500	9821900	summer having the three to six time in a 110 degree weather i don't know if you caught me
9821900	9826620	i complained about this exact thing earlier i said they're gonna need to re-evaluate those times when
9826620	9830700	summer gets here because five o'clock is the hottest point of the day so either it needs to
9830700	9836460	go back what do it in the morning or yeah they need to go back to the 11 am time frame or i'm
9836460	9841020	just gonna go play indoors like we have a mall here that has 10 pokestops it's enough
9842380	9847820	yeah that's what we're planning to on on on possibly torture community day
9847820	9855820	we're going to the mall it has four five pokestops too and two gyms so we're gonna be fine
9855820	9863180	there there's tons of pokies uh pokemon spawning there so so yeah because in the summer at least
9863180	9870700	we would have endured the first hour and a half um being outside at the middle of the day but
9870700	9878220	still it would have been uh like okay we can we can endure it but three to six is gonna be like
9878780	9883740	hell literally hell because it's gonna be way too hot you know what i'm thinking i'm like while
9883740	9889100	it's on my mind i'm like next time i go to galleria i need to submit more ingress portals
9889100	9893020	there so that way by the time summer rolls around maybe there'll be some more pokestops
9894220	9899900	like kind of help myself in advance that's what i'm thinking too that's what i'm thinking with
9899900	9907100	my brother since his level 10 ah we can make more portals there yeah go get him to submit some
9907100	9911180	portals at the mall get ready for that because those take a few months to go through so get
9911180	9915580	working on that yeah all right all right my friend i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show
9915580	9919100	but thank you for calling in i appreciate that and uh it's always good to talk to you and have

9931100	9934540	on that note that's probably the i didn't see anybody else in the green room waiting so i think
9934540	9939980	we'll probably wrap up on that note but thanks of course to everybody who's uh listening live

9986380	9990700	and of course we're buying me a pizza no buying jamie a pizza will do nothing that's just something
9990700	9997260	she wants but making me happy makes me uh have more incentive to do things anyway although
9997260	10001340	staying in bed also works all right well uh we're gonna go around and give everybody's final
10001340	10004860	thought because we're about to wrap up for the week here uh dark soccer will not be joining us
10004860	10009420	next week as she has her easter commitments in the golden gate park in san francisco and i'm
10009420	10017660	gonna be old oh too old and happy early birthday and none of that none of that on your birthday
10018700	10025580	i'm gonna be doing none of anything all right but happy birthday thank you remember when we were
10025580	10030780	kids and we first met no i'm too old to remember it was the olr my god i was how old was i when
10030780	10036620	our last started like 24 it's crazy i was still older just not not by much so i think i was still
10036620	10041820	in my yeah i was in my 20s all right um let's go around to everybody's final thought dark soccer
10041820	10046300	will start with you have a good week off next week we'll miss you but our what our aim will continue
10046300	10053420	to improve uh cadbury creme eggs speaking of eggs and this is my final thought deer animal crossing
10054060	10060700	put more of these fucking eggs where i can find them i need 150 more so i can get the stupid bunny
10060700	10066620	and get more fucking leaves leaf tickets or points or whatever shit they're called
10066620	10072220	frodo swagans wants to know what day is your birthday the 19th 19th i will it will officially
10072220	10078140	be at whatever 2 a.m is central time all right fair enough i was born into central time
10078940	10083260	uh loki so that would actually be midnight here the day before if you think about it i
10083260	10088140	think that 4 a.m um central so it'd be 2 a.m here okay it's 4 a.m yeah 2 a.m here
10088940	10095580	i was also born early in the morning i was a 5 a.m baby i woke up my mama labor because i'm a brat
10096380	10101660	all right um listen i'll do my final thought my final thought tonight is um i'm gonna try to get
10101660	10106540	to at least level 20 in borderlands and keep my going my way through the story and probably hit
10106540	10110780	level 70 on all the healers and palm asi 14 as well that'll probably be my week and then i have
10110780	10114380	to think about what i want to play after that because i'm not sure yet uh loki your final
10114380	10121500	thought i'll probably finish the other two toy con things that i have still for labo vr and i'll try
10121500	10131660	to roll back my uh insane borderland save hacking to it it's a damn game because it crashes whenever
10131660	10138940	i go to the actual uh perk screen and that's what causes the crash every time for no reason and so
10139660	10144460	and it's apparently this bug is not necessarily just from what i've been doing it's related to
10144460	10150540	the phys x and it's also from the original game like the original release and so it's a bug that
10150540	10156220	they've had in there they patched out and then remastered the bug um so yeah that's what we'll
10156220	10162540	be doing this week mr smoosh sounds like he's in heat uh he does that all the time he's just
10162540	10166060	screaming in the other room would you know something like that used to happen for becky
10166060	10171260	because i would hack her mass effect save file so like she could use like one of the hairstyles
10171260	10176060	that's programmed into the game but it wasn't available mr smoosh screaming still is like what
10176060	10182540	what you hacked the cat no and had the cat i like mr smoosh me too i just wish he'd scream
10182780	10186780	weird funny smooshy face alan keeps saying the only way to shut him up is to get another cat
10187740	10191420	and you have two cats yelling i know that's exactly my response then we'll have two cats
10191420	10195740	yelling and knocking everything over when they play me today because i took her outside on her
10195740	10201180	leash and she was mad all right uh that's it we're out of here for the week we'll see you
10201180	10204860	in seven days looking i'll be back here in seven days dark soccer will still be playing animal
10204860	10211740	crossing i'm sure uh let's go oh sorry i can't i can't i'm my old eyes can't see across the room
10212300	10215420	all right that's it we'll see you next time thanks everybody and happy gaming
