00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200
This week, Big Brother is watching you!

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,760
Echoes from deep within your Oculus Rift controller as Facebook deploys another shaggy defense

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
for its actions.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
That's just one media titan getting caught on camera again.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,200
Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,960
every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,720
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,520
where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 772 for this April the 14th

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,040
of 2019.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,040
My name is Rob Roberts here with all you lovely folks over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,600
and on our podcast speed to talk about, you know, video games over the next few hours

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,760
with my co-hosts across from me sometimes on cam when she feels like it.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,720
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Sup.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Hi, how are you?

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
I have the ache of head.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
I meant to put my hat on the screen.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
There we go.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Headaches are not good.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
There we go.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
There's my new hat.

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,080
Well, I was hoping you might actually show the, I was hoping you might show the shirt

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,240
a little bit too if you're willing.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,520
I, hold on, I'm just reading about Captain Marvel.

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,340
Just to tell the story a little bit.

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,740
One of our listeners and longtime supporters, Chris, from the Let's Be Legendary podcast,

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
that's the name, right?

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,140
Picked up that shirt for you like 10 years ago and now you're able to put that on again.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,140
You're looking fabulous.

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,140
Look at you.

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,140
All right.

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,140
And I love that you're number zero.

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,140
That's fantastic.

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,740
So there she is, everybody in the flesh.

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

38
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
Yeah, that's me.

39
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,740
All right.

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
Don't get used to it.

41
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,300
Well, I hope the headache feels better, but joining, that's what drugs are for.

42
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,720
Joining us also in studio.

43
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,900
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

44
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
I do feel better.

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Thank you for asking.

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,460
Did you have a headache too?

47
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,540
No, I was like, but I am the headache.

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,700
Oh, you are the headache.

49
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,700
I see.

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Um, I got it.

51
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,780
Rob, you actually brought into the studio tonight and we were playing with this like

52
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,300
I have left trash behind minutes before the Bobby Black Wolf show gave us a call there

53
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,340
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

54
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,420
at the voice of geeks network, twitch TV slash a VOG network right after the Bobby Black

55
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,780
Wolf show.

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,520
And you had brought this in this switch and we were checking that out.

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,640
So yes, if there's no strap or anything, you do have to just kind of like hold it up, uh,

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
and uh, do it this way.

59
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,880
But that's, that's the Nintendo Labo.

60
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Yeah.

61
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,440
A lot of their, um, the toys that they require you to use just the basic headset without,

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,600
um, any attachments to it and then a controller.

63
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,640
It's a little awkward because they're like, hold on to the headset and hold onto the controller

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
at the same time.

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,680
It's like, uh, that could have been explained better, but well, I wasn't planning to talk

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,240
about this at the top of the show and I know it's kind of dabbing into our gaming weeks

67
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
a little bit.

68
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,320
You notice it's, it's not on the little side ticker cause I didn't plan to talk about it,

69
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,620
but since you did bring the Nintendo Labo VR, I'm kind of curious of your impressions

70
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,520
having played with it for as much as you have and putting the whole thing together.

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
I think it's good.

72
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm just surprised how well engineered it is because all the stuff that you put together

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
is just very solid.

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,920
It's just the amount of time that must have taken to actually design all that is just

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,800
kind of incredible for a bunch of cardboard for a bunch of cardboard.

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Yeah.

77
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,880
It's just, it's really well put together.

78
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,460
I think the thing that's most impressive is that bird attachment.

79
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,460
The bird is pretty cool.

80
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,460
Yeah.

81
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
And I don't know, can we show it on Twitch?

82
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,920
And I apologize to folks that are listening to us on the podcast feed, but maybe somebody

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,640
will clip this on Twitch for you or something.

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
Um, because the, the clip stuff on Twitch is, is totally free.

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Oh, you took the beak out.

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll put the beak back.

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Okay.

88
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,620
So put the beak back in because, so there's this bird attachment and when you actually

89
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,480
put in the switch controller into the bird controller thing, which you push down to flap

90
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
the wings and all this.

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
It's like a little bird thing.

92
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
So there you go.

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Okay.

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
So he's put it back together for us.

95
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,320
So, um, I will read some comments in chat real quick because of course, while we tape

96
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,200
live, we'd love to read comments in our chat room.

97
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,320
There you go.

98
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
And so I love that.

99
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,860
So the little, we are, I keep saying we mode, the switch thing becomes like the beak.

100
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,940
And so right now it looks like it's attacking you the way you're flapping the wings.

101
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,000
It's next to you.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,160
But that's, that's what it is.

103
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,240
It's that's smart.

104
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,080
That's a very Nintendo kind of thing to do, isn't it?

105
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Yeah.

106
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Yeah.

107
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Wait, we can't hear you.

108
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
You got to remember.

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Sorry.

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
I know you're trying to hold.

111
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Sorry.

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Then they have the camera.

113
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
And then what's kind of cool is they have it actually click like for the lens.

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,280
So you can actually, and then it's got, um, it's got the actual camera, the IR stuff facing

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
outwards.

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,080
So Pokemon snap VR confirmed, uh, no, well not right now.

117
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,520
So in this, they have two modes.

118
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,780
So they have one that you can actually take pictures of fish and then when you take pictures

119
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,880
of this thing that I think is supposed to be a cat, but it's this weird alien cat thing.

120
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,340
And then, um, you can take pictures of Mr. Smoosh and unfortunately it fell apart, but

121
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,000
I have a, uh, there's this, it's supposed to be a snorkel.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,200
So it's a snorkel and what's kind of cool is because the infrared camera's facing out

123
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,680
when you wear it, the fish that's closest to you gets this weird human face.

124
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,320
Not, not like we're not talking about like, you know, um, Seaman human face, but it has

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,120
like these weird bug eyes and then anything that you do with your head, the fish mimics.

126
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,440
And so you could take pictures of that.

127
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Oh, it's like those emojis on Apple.

128
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,360
It's weird, but yeah, it's, it's, it's silly.

129
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
So whatever.

130
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Okay.

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,040
So that's, it's just a very Nintendo thing to do.

132
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,160
So tell us about some of the, okay, so you've obviously shown off some of the cardboard

133
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,400
stuff here in studio.

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,880
Um, what about like some of the games that are in it and all these like mini, there's

135
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,400
a lot of games in there.

136
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,960
So they have games for each of the like main games for each of the things that you build.

137
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,400
So like the camera, there's, you know, the, um, you know, take pictures of fish.

138
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,520
There's taking pictures of that weird cat thing, but then there's like these little

139
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,720
mini games that they have in this VR, like toy boxing.

140
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,040
So they have like cannon firing stuff.

141
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,360
There's um, like all sorts of weird little things you can like move around and do little

142
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,420
simple things.

143
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,460
They have, I haven't even delved into it.

144
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,940
There's some, they're actually non VR too.

145
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,140
They have like mixed up stuff like pinball and like weird things.

146
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,540
Um, there's like for each of the toys, there's like a bunch of mini games and then there's

147
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,780
a bunch of main games for it as well.

148
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,420
And then there's videos they have in there so you can watch like 3d videos.

149
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,180
Some are really weird, very Japanese.

150
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,540
Um, there's the whole creation stuff.

151
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,100
There's um, there's a lot, there's a lot.

152
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,540
And they even have like, I didn't even delve into it too much by looked at it.

153
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,980
There's like, build your own FPS, build your own adventure thing.

154
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,140
And like, I'm like, what is this?

155
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,740
I saw that in the previews.

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,260
There's a ton of stuff in there.

157
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,160
Um, now dark Sakura, you, I know you don't usually do the VR thing because you know,

158
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,520
you get headaches and motion sickness.

159
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,900
You've talked about before, even when playing first person shooters, but you, the curiosity

160
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,740
took over, you had to peak.

161
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,060
So what did you think for the two minutes you did it?

162
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,500
I watched birds swing around on poles and like, like when those little, hold on, like

163
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
that.

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Yeah.

165
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,540
And then, um, yeah, like cause everyone who's not watching will really see that I did twisty

166
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
fingers.

167
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,220
Um, I w I wanted to knock the blocks over that were forming the menu cause I couldn't

168
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,420
get shit to happen, but I was just hitting the wrong button.

169
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,560
No way to be fair.

170
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,700
We rushed through this to try to, and I was feeling really sick even after the first 30

171
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
seconds.

172
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Yeah.

173
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,620
And then my eyes like will un-focus on things and then they won't refocus and then it's

174
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,140
instant vertigo.

175
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,620
But I did notice when you sat down, you still said something about, I want to see the breath

176
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
of the wild.

177
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,620
Yeah.

178
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,020
I'd still want to like, just look around and breath of the wild, like tourist mode.

179
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,240
I feel like that's what most people are going to do because the breath of the wild thing

180
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
isn't in it yet.

181
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Right?

182
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,380
No, that doesn't come out until next week.

183
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
Two weeks.

184
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,380
Right.

185
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
So, uh, and I also don't have breath of the wild.

186
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,980
So, you know, you can use my coffee demo for VR.

187
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
You got it.

188
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Yeah.

189
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,420
But I imagine most people, like I cannot imagine sitting there trying to actually play breath

190
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
of the wild.

191
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,980
I mean, I know you could plug in the joy cons.

192
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,900
Thank you for chat for, you're going to have to, cause there's no way you can hold everything.

193
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,340
I was like, you would, I would be able to even use the, um, the pro controller.

194
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,660
I don't even get sick, emotion sick really.

195
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,860
I mean, well, I don't, I don't like to do VR for more than like 30 minutes.

196
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,720
I just don't like, I have to take a break every now and then, but I think that's kind

197
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
of normal.

198
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,660
I think they encourage you to take breaks from for three days.

199
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,700
They say it a lot, even when you're building everything, they're all, why don't you take

200
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
a break?

201
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Take a break.

202
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
You've been doing this for too long.

203
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Stop.

204
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
You earned it.

205
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,700
But anyway, uh, I can only see myself doing the, uh, breath of the wild stuff in short

206
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
bursts.

207
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,340
Like, like I would go into a temple and be like, Ooh, pretty look around or climb to

208
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
the top of a mountain.

209
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,380
Ooh, that's pretty done, you know, but I guess, you know, if it was a relatively easy thing

210
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,800
for Nintendo to implement, which it must've been, uh, then, you know, cool.

211
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,820
It's like added value.

212
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,500
I love when Nintendo puts like new value in like really old titles.

213
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,940
And they've been pretty good about doing this a lot.

214
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
Yeah.

215
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,540
So, uh, apparently HBO go crashed from all the people watching that other thing that's

216
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
going on tonight.

217
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
Uh huh.

218
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,860
So there's already bets as to who dies first.

219
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
All right.

220
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,280
Well, let's not, let's not talk about that.

221
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,380
Let's focus on video games, uh, and comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

222
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,080
uh, double O Waldorf, who I'm gonna refer to here.

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
What game are we talking about?

224
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,420
The Nintendo Labo, uh, VR experience.

225
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,380
And then breath of the wild, uh, being plugged in there, but I do want to start today's show

226
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,380
kind of like segue.

227
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,820
So we talked about like Nintendo adding these value experiences to really, you know, older

228
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
titles.

229
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,440
I want to start with what I had planned to do for the kickoff topic tonight and talk

230
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,940
a little bit about maybe not so great free, not free things in games.

231
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,060
Uh, and this is a trend I think we're seeing, um, it's not unique to this game, but we're

232
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,620
seeing it more often, and this is definitely a big title.

233
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,220
Uh, so Resident Evil 2 got a remake recently.

234
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,380
I know dark soccer, you're a big fan, right?

235
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,800
So I'd be very curious what you think about this.

236
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,740
So apparently, uh, what you can do, uh, is if you want, you can just pay $4.99 and you

237
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,660
can buy in the shop, an in game rewards unlock add on, and this would allow you to unlock

238
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,780
the two extra playable modes, costumes, bonus weapon and art.

239
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
And it should be noted.

240
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,540
All of these things are what you would unlock.

241
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Yeah.

242
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,540
We have them anyway.

243
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,460
Right.

244
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
You guys did the same way.

245
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,500
So this is the whole pay $5 to get it now type of thing is you get it anyway.

246
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Yeah.

247
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,020
But, but if you're impatient and we should point out, it isn't, this is not a trend in

248
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
the industry.

249
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:52,580
You know, it's just, this is, it was either mafia two or the Godfather, I think it was

250
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
the Godfather.

251
00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:00,860
I was Godfather on the Godfather because on Xbox 360 you had, um, the cheats that were

252
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,180
in the game where paid DLC versus the PlayStation two and Xbox versions of that game.

253
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,740
The cheats were button presses that you would do like a combination of button presses, unlock

254
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,280
different cheats, but they've decided EA, of course, I know shocking, um, decided that

255
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,260
they would sell that to you because they like all of the money.

256
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,060
So that's why this is the way it is.

257
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,980
And that's why our industry is the way it is.

258
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,540
Well now the 360, you know, that was several years ago at this point.

259
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,680
So apparently this trend, I mean, my people must be buying them or we wouldn't continue

260
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
to do this.

261
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Right.

262
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
All right.

263
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,540
They dangle it in front of you because what's the worst that's going to happen.

264
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,740
It doesn't get purchased.

265
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,100
I mean, who cares?

266
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,340
It's just, it's a key and I'm sure it's very minimal because yeah, because I bet Sony and

267
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,340
Microsoft, I mean, I don't know this to be true.

268
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,500
Maybe you know, but I bet Sony and Microsoft don't exactly charge these guys money to have

269
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,100
these things on the store.

270
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,060
I mean, maybe if steam charged people a little more money, which I guess they do charge like

271
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,060
a hundred bucks.

272
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,060
What to get listed on the store.

273
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
We have all this recoupable.

274
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Yeah.

275
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,060
That's right.

276
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,060
It's recoupable and all that.

277
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
But, um, yeah.

278
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,660
So, I mean, I guess there's really no harm in putting it out there cause some people

279
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,540
are going to buy it if nothing else.

280
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,780
And it's, it's just this whole mobile marketplace type thing, you know, even I was watching

281
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:24,900
psych impressions of the, uh, elder scrolls blades that just recently came out and how

282
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,020
grindy that is.

283
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,540
Like you earn chests in the game.

284
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,100
It's like, Oh, but you're going to wait five minutes to open that chest.

285
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,360
I did see a story today.

286
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,860
We cut it from the show, uh, roll tonight because I don't think any of us have played

287
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,260
the elder scrolls blades yet.

288
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
I don't know.

289
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,260
Dark soccer.

290
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Did you check it out?

291
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
I know you play a lot of cell phone music and she's saying no.

292
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,260
So, um, but, uh, I heard that like as of like today or yesterday, Bethesda's actually responded.

293
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,460
They are going to be adjusting some of that balance, adjusting, not removing, adjusting.

294
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,340
You know, a lot of angry people on the internet have made them kind of reevaluate that stuff.

295
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,780
And probably a lot of those one star reviews in the store and they have kept many meaning

296
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
to check it out.

297
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
I wanted to check it out.

298
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
They have adjusted some things.

299
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,720
Like there are certain chests, I think that took like five hours to open and they dropped

300
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,620
it down to like one hour instead or something like that.

301
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,120
But I don't know.

302
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,580
It's just not my thing.

303
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
It's a mobile game.

304
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,540
I know that they want to say, well, it's a true elder elder scrolls experience, but no,

305
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
it's not.

306
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
It's a mobile game.

307
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,660
It's a mobile game experience.

308
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,260
Do we think now I'm curious and I want to ask our chat room this as well over at twitch

309
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,720
TV slash vog network.

310
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,300
I want to look at the other side because I think a lot of us gamers, especially those

311
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,860
that have been around for a very long time, uh, remember the days of up, up, down, down,

312
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
left, right, left, right.

313
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,300
BA start was the only, you know, coach you needed right to unlock the extra help or whatever.

314
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,280
Um, I'm curious if anybody would be willing to say they see a positive in this.

315
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,640
Like maybe there's a reason you would want to do this.

316
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,040
I mean, my, I don't really like it, so I'm really having to kind of try to put my feet

317
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,960
or my, you know, put the other shoes on my feet to kind of think this way.

318
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,600
But I'm thinking like maybe like a positive could be, you know, we have had a lot of talk

319
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,720
about how difficult some games can be.

320
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,780
And maybe if some people are willing to pay to make that easier, although like as the

321
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,240
words will leave you in my mouth, I kind of go, God, that just seems shitty though.

322
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,720
Like, no, I don't think, no, I don't think we should have to pay for that.

323
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
But okay.

324
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,600
Like maybe I'm not phrasing it the right way, but my point is that like, how, how many people

325
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,320
can beat Contra, even people that, that claim to be hardcore.

326
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Yes.

327
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,840
I know, you know, you and your husband, Jamie, but you guys are anomalies.

328
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,400
You know that, but how many people can beat Contra without that code?

329
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Right.

330
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,600
So y'all need a little bit of skill adjustment once in a while.

331
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,600
All of you do except, except that the crazy people like dark Sakura and her husband.

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,720
But that was the half the fun, like with games, like I would love have, I loved owning the

333
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,200
game genie because I'd rent stuff and I'd play it and if it's too hard, I just go find

334
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,600
the codes for it.

335
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,200
Of course, back then you didn't have like the internet to find codes.

336
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,680
You had to rely on either gaming magazines or you had to buy a code book that had games

337
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
in it.

338
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,160
And then hopefully the one that you're trying to play has, you know, codes for it.

339
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,120
But that was, that was where the fun was because 30 lives wasn't even enough sometimes with

340
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Contra.

341
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah, that's, that's the truth.

342
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,880
So, and it's funny because later in the show we're going to be taking a look at like old

343
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,720
Nintendo games that get boosted, uh, in the Nintendo switch online library.

344
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,520
And sometimes even that isn't enough to get certain things.

345
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Yeah.

346
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,580
So some games still remain very, very hard, but again, Oh, you know what?

347
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,740
Great example.

348
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,820
Here's Nintendo boosting something for free while these other companies are charging five

349
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
bucks for it.

350
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,700
But it's not just, you know, and I know I pick you on Resident Evil here, but of course

351
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,300
we know EA does this as well.

352
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,780
Uh, heck our show, our roots are in music gaming, right?

353
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm positive that when I went on PlayStation four, there was a DJ max technica thing that

354
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,340
you could download that would unlock everything that you would get just from playing enough

355
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,340
of this.

356
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,820
You know how like every time you play like three or four songs, you get a little thing

357
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,420
and sometimes you get extra songs.

358
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,940
And I'm not talking DLC, I'm talking like some of the extra like remixes and some of

359
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,620
the original tracks that show up in the game, they sell a key to unlock all that stuff out

360
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
the gate as well.

361
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,700
Cause it does take a long time to unlock.

362
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,080
And I get that if you have, you know, less time to play that stuff and you want to play

363
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,180
certain things, maybe that's an option for you.

364
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,340
But at the same time, when you do stuff like that, it kind of ruins the point of the game.

365
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,060
Cause the whole point is that you're unlocking everything.

366
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,100
And once you've unlocked everything, then then what?

367
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,380
I mean, I guess it was music and we can play songs and get better at them, but you know,

368
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,700
what's the point if we're like unlock, I don't, I don't know.

369
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,840
I think if you're going to put that option in there, that it should be something that

370
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,880
is free later on down the road or something, but they can make a buck and people aren't

371
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,100
going to complain about it.

372
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,380
Although apparently people write articles about it.

373
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,980
So somebody not like it, but at the same time, it's been like this for years now and it's

374
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,780
more of like, Oh, there's another company doing that.

375
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,060
So we're going to buy their game because so if you don't like, am I going to protest

376
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
everybody?

377
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,420
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

378
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,540
Um, the end of the end of the day, right?

379
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,540
Bottom line.

380
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,540
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

381
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Most important thing.

382
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,220
Well, I mean, you can't say that about everything because there are some games now and they've

383
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,340
gotten smart about it is like, they'll patch that shit in later.

384
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,180
So like for example, call of duty, modern warfare remastered, you know, call of duty.

385
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:26,400
Modern warfare is probably one of the best FPS games, you know, ever made.

386
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,420
Then they decided, Hey, you know what?

387
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,260
We're just going to go ahead and fucking put some loot boxes in there now, even though

388
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,540
you purchased the game and they weren't in there originally.

389
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,500
And if you're totally taking a lot of shit, totally getting that to that, but we're going

390
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,340
to throw it in there now.

391
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
You know what though?

392
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,760
I can resell you that DLC.

393
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,320
I liked what you kind of like referenced there where you said something about like you could

394
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,300
come back a year later and then it could be free.

395
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,980
Like that would be a great way for developers to kind of get people to revisit maybe an

396
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:01,180
old title is that after a year, why not just put out that sort of DLC for free?

397
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,740
And the value is that more people revisit the game, more people play the game, talk

398
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
about the games.

399
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,360
And then you can sell your resident evil, whatever remaster or you put the game on sale

400
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,180
and now maybe you sell a few more copies because people know they can just unlock everything

401
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
out the gate or whatever.

402
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,260
Maybe we're stopping them before.

403
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:24,620
I think that's a, that's a very Nintendo ish idea to, to do is just like make that code

404
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,540
or whatever free a year, maybe if even that long, six months after the game is out, maybe

405
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,620
I guess if they feel the need to charge for it out the gate, then whatever.

406
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,620
I still don't think all they'll do is they'll bundle it together with the game.

407
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,940
They'll reduce the price down to the original cost of the game, be like, look at the deal

408
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
you're getting.

409
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,700
And I'm sorry, I can't, I can't give, I can't give this industry the benefit of the social

410
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,500
media sees straight.

411
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,600
Where do people find out about most of those sales, social media, who sees through that

412
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,260
shit right off the bat, social media, you know what I mean?

413
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,300
So I feel like, like, I realize a lot of game company, executive boardroom type discussions

414
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,620
don't think gamers are that smart, but like, I kind of think we are.

415
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,260
And like, you know, your sale is not going to gain a lot of traction if, if it's very

416
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,140
clear, it's a stupid sale.

417
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Yeah.

418
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,300
So that's where my head's at on that anyway.

419
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,140
Uh, let's see, going to our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, pod culture says

420
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,940
Forza horizon has a key to unlock a map, to find all the barn find cars.

421
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,180
Uh, and Bobby adds to that and that last damn bonus board.

422
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Yeah.

423
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,260
And that's like stuff, you know, and I always thought that was really silly too, because

424
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:35,020
I was like, you have an internet and the internet, all the location, I mean, I understand it's

425
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,340
awfully convenient to just unlock it in the game and then use the magic GPS to take you

426
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
there.

427
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
I get it.

428
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,680
But like, it's not like you can't, can't download a high resolution map and just see everything

429
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,940
right there.

430
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,340
Like it's just, it's kind of blows my mind that they actually make money off that, but

431
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
I get it.

432
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,380
People want to collect stuff and those types of collectible games, I guess.

433
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,660
Um, let's see.

434
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,900
And Bobby says, it's hard to figure out which bonus boards you don't have when there's 200

435
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
though.

436
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,540
But once the point out, I've never paid for the treasure map, but I see.

437
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,660
So it's kind of like you're sitting there at one 99 out of 200, you have no idea where

438
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,300
that last board is.

439
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,140
Maybe looking at a map on the internet isn't going to help because you're going to see

440
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
all 200.

441
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,140
You're not going to remember which one 99 yard.

442
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,300
I remember that they did something similar to that.

443
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,740
I think it was in crackdown one where they, they, uh, for people that were down to like

444
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,380
the very last few things it was, they actually had it where the, there was a detector that

445
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,260
kind of let you know where some of the last few orbs to collect were because I know when

446
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,380
it got down, it's like, Oh great, I have two left.

447
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,380
Where the hell are they?

448
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,620
I've been all over this map like crazy.

449
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,220
So it like actually makes them louder so you can hear them and stuff because yeah, it was

450
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
a pain in the ass.

451
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,460
In crackdown one, I never did get all of them because I couldn't find the last, like however

452
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,500
many I had left, probably less than five.

453
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,020
And I was like all over that map, uh, at depth points out the dragon ball fighter Z also

454
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,020
does it.

455
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,660
And you can buy a key to unlock some of the characters that you unlock will play in the

456
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,660
game.

457
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,220
But I could see a little bit too, because like if you're saying, um, not really into

458
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,100
just going through the story mode and progressing through that, normally maybe you're into the

459
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,900
fighting game scene or something and you want to play those characters that you want to

460
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,900
main as, then maybe unlocking them now would be beneficial to you.

461
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,540
I don't know, but see, you know, back then what we used to do is just download a save

462
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,420
off the internet and then put it in there and all this stuff is unlocked or there would

463
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,060
be a code you'd put in a menu and unlock all the characters or a game genie code that would

464
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,060
unlock all the characters.

465
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,080
I mean, there's lots of ways around everything.

466
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,300
We need, where, where did the game G Gottlieb, is that who made the game genie?

467
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,020
We need them to come back and make a game genie for the PlayStation four and the Xbox

468
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,020
one.

469
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
That's what we need.

470
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,020
What do you mean you can't?

471
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
You can't do that anymore.

472
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Hacks.

473
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
Hack the planet.

474
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
I can't.

475
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
I can't put the CD in the cartridge.

476
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,020
It doesn't work.

477
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,780
You're not trying hard enough.

478
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,060
Can't push the digital games.

479
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,740
You can put Linux on it, Loki.

480
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,740
There's gotta be a way.

481
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,060
Just get the game genie.

482
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
Oh, Galoob.

483
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
Sorry.

484
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
It was very simple.

485
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Thank you.

486
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
It was Galoob.

487
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
Are they even around still?

488
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Gottlieb makes pinball games, I think.

489
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
They did.

490
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
They made the game genie.

491
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
What's that?

492
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Is that like tilting the table?

493
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,140
It's like going into the menu and changing the rule set.

494
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,660
Or sawing the legs down.

495
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,660
And then putting a big blocker right behind the flippers.

496
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
Or turning the tilt off.

497
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:28,500
Or what we used to do is strip, or put a rubber band in between the, was it the channels going

498
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
down towards the bottom?

499
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,860
Just put rubber bands on the side so it only can go down the center.

500
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,500
Oh, permanent like ball save?

501
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Yeah.

502
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Oh yeah.

503
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
We did it with Attack on Mars.

504
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
That was fun.

505
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Okay.

506
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Made the game much easier.

507
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,380
A lot easier than it would have been otherwise.

508
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,380
I like that.

509
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,380
Alright.

510
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,300
Let's get into some other topics that we have here at Orange Laundry tonight.

511
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,820
One way we always like to start the show is by talking about our gaming weeks and the

512
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,940
types of video games that we've been playing this week.

513
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,180
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

514
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Eh.

515
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,580
That fun, huh?

516
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
I really didn't do much.

517
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:06,500
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing on my phone and trying to farm an ingress

518
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
at work.

519
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,700
You know, just little bits and pieces, it's just, I've had migraines all week from some

520
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,660
problems I'm having in my neck.

521
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,940
And so it's been really hard for me to just sit and look at a screen for any significant

522
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
amount of time outside of doing my job.

523
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,420
But you're building up hype for Animal Crossing on Switch, right?

524
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,860
I really want it.

525
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
I know.

526
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,300
And then Dan will never see the Switch again.

527
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,820
He'll have to buy a second one.

528
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,820
Right.

529
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,820
Alright.

530
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Well, if that's all you got for now.

531
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Oh, and pinball.

532
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
I mean, there is pinball.

533
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Okay.

534
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
So there is still that.

535
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,500
So you're still you're still gaming something.

536
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,780
It's just not maybe video games right now.

537
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
Yeah.

538
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
What?

539
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,780
You guys just got a new pinball table, right?

540
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,780
No.

541
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,780
Well, we had Ghostbusters for a while.

542
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
That was our last new one.

543
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,780
I thought there was something.

544
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,780
We sold Demolition Man.

545
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Okay.

546
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,780
So we're selling Monopoly.

547
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Right.

548
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,780
And you're selling.

549
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,740
I may be selling World Cup to Melomelody.

550
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,740
Right.

551
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
Okay.

552
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,260
I thought there was something coming in to replace one of those.

553
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Black Knight, Sword of Rage.

554
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Okay.

555
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Maybe.

556
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Because now Dan's like, I'm like, shut up.

557
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
We're getting it.

558
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
You tell him.

559
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,020
And Steve Ritchie did all the voices in it again.

560
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,260
He was also the designer of the table, of course.

561
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,540
He did all the voices again.

562
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:21,380
And I think that all the guitar in it was written by someone from Anthrax.

563
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
Why not?

564
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
It was pretty good stuff.

565
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
Nice.

566
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
All right.

567
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,380
Loki, how about you?

568
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
How was your gaming week?

569
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
I played.

570
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,860
Well, I built a lot of Labo VR stuff.

571
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,540
So I got that on Friday and I've been building it pretty much ever since.

572
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,700
I have still two more toy cons to build.

573
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,620
I've got the elephant and the wind flapper.

574
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
I don't know what they call it.

575
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,380
It's a pedal thing with the...

576
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,020
It's the one that they have the Toad picture that they posted on the Nintendo Twitter account.

577
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:56,100
Everyone's like, why are you stepping on Toad's penis over and over?

578
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
I get it.

579
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,700
He's supposed to be doing sis, but it looked like you're just stomping on his penis.

580
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
I'm not going to paint Toad on mine.

581
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,960
So we're not going to have that problem.

582
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
So I played lots of that.

583
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,380
I actually did finish the Toy-Con Blaster earlier today and actually played some of

584
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
that.

585
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
And that's actually really cool.

586
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,380
It's kind of like an on-rails shooting gallery type thing.

587
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,740
And so it's hard to see from there, but you actually pull it back and it clicks and then

588
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,620
you push a button and it's almost like firing a rubber band gun or something like that.

589
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:31,780
But it's really cool and it's a lot easier to hold than holding the headset by itself.

590
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:38,200
So I did that and then I've been playing Borderlands Remastered a bit.

591
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,860
I had the hardest time getting it to run and it still crashes every now and then.

592
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,980
It's just some general protection fault thing.

593
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,340
It could be because I'm modding my saves.

594
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,980
I don't think so, but it might be that.

595
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,500
It shouldn't cause the game to crash.

596
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,180
I've never had that problem before, but you know, I have to cheat.

597
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
It's Borderlands.

598
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,580
I've already played through the whole game once, so I don't care anymore.

599
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,500
Not even once, several times.

600
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,140
But it's just fun to mess around with that stuff.

601
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,980
But I'm like level 15 now and yeah.

602
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,100
So it's been okay.

603
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
And then what else?

604
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Pokemon Go, I guess.

605
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,320
A little bit of that and a little bit of working on my game.

606
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
And that's it.

607
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Okay.

608
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,200
My Gaming Week may surprise you.

609
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,720
I am still playing Borderlands Remastered.

610
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm not having these problems you're having, but I'm also not fucking with my game.

611
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,640
But it was doing it before I fucked with my game, so I think it's actually the game.

612
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,440
No, I've been playing it just the way it comes on the computer.

613
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
And I've been playing it.

614
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,640
I mean, I don't play the 4K, I play 2K, but it runs really well in the 2K mode.

615
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,640
And I talked a little bit about this last week, I don't want to repeat too much, but

616
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,960
I've still been playing.

617
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
I think that's noteworthy because you guys know how often video games hold my attention

618
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,280
for more than a week as new things come out.

619
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,720
I'm up to level 17 now, which for me is pretty good.

620
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,600
I guess that doesn't sound that high.

621
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,240
I heard you beat the game around level 35, right?

622
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
I don't remember.

623
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
I don't know.

624
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,600
So I don't know how many levels you go through in the game, but I'm at level 17.

625
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
I feel like I've done a lot.

626
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,920
I've only beaten the second boss so far.

627
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,160
Is that when you go into the hideout and you're like in a big circular room and there's this

628
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,080
big guy, scary, because I think I just did that part.

629
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,480
Maybe I only did nine toes.

630
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,840
I thought I fought the second guy, but maybe not yet.

631
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Okay.

632
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,600
So I did this whole area, I think the last thing I remember doing, it was either that

633
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,320
or it was the one where you have all these shock crystals and you blow up the shock crystals

634
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,680
and pick up the little fragments they leave behind.

635
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,340
And then he makes a shot.

636
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,820
Maybe I only got this quest because I'm the soldier, I don't know.

637
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,300
But he makes a thing that you put on your turret and now it does shock bullets from

638
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,300
the turret.

639
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,580
So that's like the last thing I did.

640
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,580
Oh, that's yeah.

641
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,180
That's another side quest, I think.

642
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,660
But here's, here's the thing that's made.

643
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
Okay.

644
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,500
So like with Borderlands, I felt like the game was like kind of hard because you have

645
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,300
limited ammo, right?

646
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,360
Even though it kind of like seems to drop from everything.

647
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,920
And I think that's kind of the trick.

648
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Like even though I kind of get annoyed at how everything responds, I think there's a

649
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,700
method to the madness because I think like if you're running low on ammo and for whatever

650
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,220
reason you can't afford it, although I noticed it's really cheap.

651
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,900
So I think that's by design is that they make the ammo really cheap so that you can't easily

652
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,900
run out.

653
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,580
But like also even though some of the monsters level up, not all of them do.

654
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,900
Like I noticed right outside that Firestone town, those little, um, Scott, what are they

655
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
called?

656
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,420
The skags, skogs, skags, skags, those things that hang out, they never go up beyond level

657
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
two.

658
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,860
So if you just kill those things, which is really easy, you can melee kill them when

659
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,900
they're level two and you're like level five, um, you they'll drop ammo too.

660
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,480
So you can kind of farm it that way.

661
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,360
So there is a way to do it where you're not really running out of things, but it will

662
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,140
take a little selling guns.

663
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
You do that.

664
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
You can do that too.

665
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,640
But where I'm really feeling progression now, and I know this is funny to some of you because

666
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,040
this game is how old is like 10 years old at this point.

667
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,480
And I'm like just discovering it for the first time where some of you have been playing it

668
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,960
for forever, but maybe you can appreciate that now I'm discovering it.

669
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,320
Um, I just got in this last little thing that I did.

670
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:20,000
Um, I got, somebody dropped a purple shield and it's like, it was like twice the shielding

671
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
of the one I had.

672
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,600
It went up from like 160 to like 300.

673
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Okay.

674
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,640
And it has very fast health regeneration and I was like, yes, this is exactly what I needed

675
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,720
because I kept dying because there's like no, are you using the shift keys as well?

676
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,920
Because they have shift keys that they post online and you can read, you can redeem them

677
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,440
on your, um, like the shift key to run it.

678
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,720
You're talking like a DLC thing.

679
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Yeah.

680
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
They're shift keys.

681
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,800
So you can register on the borderland site under your VIP thing or whatever, and then

682
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,600
you can unlock, uh, there's a chest in Firestone you can unlock and you get loot from there.

683
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,920
It's like rare loot.

684
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Oh, it's free.

685
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,320
Oh, that's how you open that.

686
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
Yeah.

687
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
So you have to get shift keys.

688
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
So you go online, just search.

689
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,240
And I mean, I don't think they expire really.

690
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,400
And you just, you can put as many of them in as you want and they unlocks five each

691
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
time.

692
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Passcodes and ingress for gear.

693
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Yeah, sort of.

694
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Yeah.

695
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Okay.

696
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Wow.

697
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Interesting.

698
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,000
But if it's something, does it generate stuff at my level?

699
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,400
Cause maybe I want to hang on to those till I'm like,

700
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
um, yes.

701
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Oh, so maybe there's, you don't want to just burn them all at level one.

702
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
That might not be a good idea.

703
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Yeah.

704
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
He probably wants one gain a few levels.

705
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Use another gain.

706
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Okay.

707
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Okay.

708
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
That's probably what I'll do that.

709
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Like I got a shield out of that one time.

710
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Yeah.

711
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,160
But now that I have that purple shield, I feel like, okay, I can actually go in there

712
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
and take them.

713
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,320
Cause like I'm supposed to, I think the soldiers, the tanky guy, right.

714
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,160
Or is it the, maybe there's another guy that's like really big and bulky.

715
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
It's probably him.

716
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Yeah.

717
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Soldiers never laid the tank guy.

718
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Okay.

719
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
I don't know.

720
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
He has the tour.

721
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
I, the turret thing sounded, I was like, Oh, uh, that's like mass effect with the drone.

722
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
I'll like that guy.

723
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,360
And I do because I remember the first time I played border lands years ago, I played

724
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,200
the girl who's like the siren.

725
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,160
And although that was a cool ability, like knowing my sense of what I need in first person

726
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,700
shooters and how I do better in those games, I went with the turret building guy because

727
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,040
I'm like, Ooh, I like turrets.

728
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,880
I like, that's like the type of character I like to play.

729
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
That's why I like Symmetra and Overwatch.

730
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,720
And I always play as the hunter mortar guy is that now he, he probably uses snipers,

731
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
huh?

732
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,000
He's sniper rifles in, uh, revolvers and pistols are his specialties.

733
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Those are the ones that he loves.

734
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Look faster.

735
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay.

736
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,920
Everybody can use everything, but it's, yeah.

737
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,560
Because I've been, I was using the sniper rifle a lot to like, like what I will do is

738
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,720
like, I'll use this when I'm a distance away, I'll use the sniper rifle to attack them.

739
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,260
And then that kind of like agros them, then they come at me.

740
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,300
And then I was using a pistol cause I had a really good pistol, but I noticed, I looked,

741
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,320
I looked at the skill trees and I was like, Oh, here's a shotgun ability.

742
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,020
So let me set out for a shotgun.

743
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,940
So now I use the, I was using the sniper rifle to pull them in and then I'd shotgun them

744
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
down.

745
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
Right.

746
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Good strategy.

747
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
Right.

748
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,700
But, uh, I just recently replaced the sniper rifle with a rocket launcher.

749
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,460
That's a much better way to get people's attention.

750
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,460
Yes.

751
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,020
Well, Doug, and you have to be subtle with one and absolute opposite of subtle with the

752
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
other.

753
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,340
I'm not a subtle person.

754
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,300
So yeah, it's, it's, it's so weird to me that I'm talking about like Borderlands strategy.

755
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,420
I never thought I would like get into this game, but Mass Effect, I didn't enjoy the

756
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
first time.

757
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Right.

758
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,660
But now I'm kind of like into Borderlands.

759
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,860
Some of the humor is a little bit toilet, but whatever.

760
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
It's it's fine.

761
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,620
And I, I, I let it go.

762
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
I'm just, whatever.

763
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,660
It's there is something really fucking satisfying about like when you get the car that you could

764
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,060
just run over enemies and their blood splatters everywhere and H I definition.

765
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,780
I'm like, that is really satisfying.

766
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,860
So yeah, I, I'm liking Borderlands y'all.

767
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,220
Now there's a reason to have this poster back here besides the fact that one of our listeners

768
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,220
got it for us.

769
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,060
And I also, look, look, he always liked Borderlands.

770
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,820
I also play a zero all the time when I play in Borderlands two.

771
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
Yeah.

772
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:01,100
So I, I'm going to try to really finish this one and then try to play two and maybe make

773
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,580
my way to Borderlands three.

774
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
I don't know.

775
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Anyway.

776
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,900
I'm looking at some comments in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG network.

777
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,500
Bobby Blackwell points out, I also picked the soldier because of the turret, the necromancer

778
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,380
in Borderlands two also had a turret.

779
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
I think.

780
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,380
Yes.

781
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,640
I would imagine that's having a little helper is kind of a standard class design thing I

782
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,180
think is usually one of the arch types if you will.

783
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,780
Um, other games I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy 14, I'm back, I'm back on that

784
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
bullshit.

785
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,020
Uh, I leveled my, so my astrologian has always kind of been my main and I've, that's been

786
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,540
70 the max level.

787
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:39,420
My white mage hit 70 in this past week and my scholar is now level 66.

788
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,780
So by the end of next week, I should have every healer in Final Fantasy 14 at maximum

789
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
level.

790
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
Why?

791
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
I don't know.

792
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
It's fun.

793
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
It's a thing.

794
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
It's a thing.

795
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
It's a thing.

796
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
I'm working.

797
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
It's just a thing.

798
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
It's a thing.

799
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Um, so there's that.

800
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,780
And then of course, Pokemon go like you guys, community day was yesterday.

801
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,460
Um, so we went down to Capitol park, our usual stomping grounds for that.

802
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,460
And what was it?

803
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
It was bacon.

804
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,600
And it was bag on, but I said, I didn't get a single shiny.

805
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
You didn't?

806
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,360
Well, I'll trade you one later than maybe I forgot that it was at that time.

807
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,600
I thought it was earlier in the day.

808
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,920
Oh, you know what they've been doing?

809
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,960
It's kind of, well, it seems permanent, but they could change it whenever, but it seems

810
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,040
like they figured out a way to roll it out in every time zone.

811
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,380
And that probably has been helping with the server issues immensely too, but it's every

812
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,240
time zone from three to 6 PM.

813
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,920
And I like the later hours for now, but like, it's not like it'll work for maybe one more

814
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
month.

815
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,480
But when we get into June and July three to 6 PM is like the hottest point of the day.

816
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,360
No, thank you.

817
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
It's going to be like 115 out.

818
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,920
So I'll be playing at the Galleria again, because I'll play at an indoor mall and I'm

819
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,840
not playing out at the park in that kind of heat.

820
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,320
So I'm hoping they go back to the earlier hours, but yeah, for now the three to six

821
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,780
has been kind of interesting, but I caught a seven shiny bake-ons, which is pretty good

822
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,640
because the first hour and a half I only had one.

823
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,280
And then I just got like three more and then that was when Alan and I were like, okay,

824
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
we're good.

825
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,080
Cause he, he also got like way more in the second half than the first half.

826
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,360
And we, so we each had our three and we're like, okay, we're done.

827
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,840
And so I switched to my Bluetooth, my gotcha.

828
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,240
And I was catching that way and I caught like three more shinies from the gotcha.

829
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,120
So there you go.

830
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,460
That was a pretty good, except none of them were very good appraisals.

831
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,600
That's the only kind of bummer.

832
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,400
So and then one of my friends who plays like super casually and doesn't really care about

833
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,940
shinies, but he does want to fill his pokey decks.

834
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,600
He needed a far-fetched cause he, he guess he wasn't playing when that event happened

835
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
or whatever.

836
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
He's never hatched one.

837
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,440
So I got a far-fetched and he gave me a shiny Q bone for it.

838
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,160
I'm like, are you sure you want to give up a shiny?

839
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
He's like, I don't care.

840
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,960
I don't care about shiny thing, but I want that far-fetched.

841
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,000
I was like, okay, so I got another shiny that I needed.

842
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So I got the Q bone.

843
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,480
So, uh, which is also good because that was the ingress event shiny and that's the enlightened

844
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,840
one was the Q bone.

845
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,520
So I finally got one of those.

846
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,320
I do, even though I'm not a resistance person, uh, the pony does that are the blue ones.

847
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Those are really good.

848
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,600
Like I have, they're, they just look fucking cool.

849
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,720
Like I have to have those.

850
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
So, but I don't have one of those yet.

851
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
So, uh, anyway.

852
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Oh, you don't?

853
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,960
I think I have one.

854
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
The blue pony tusks?

855
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
I don't have one of those either.

856
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Cause I got one of those first.

857
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Oh, hang on to those.

858
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,280
Cause yeah, unless you, when you get two, I'll trade you shiny.

859
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,920
So I've got, I have like multiple shiny swab blues.

860
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,840
I know that's one that like hasn't had a community day.

861
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,360
I've just hatched a bunch and some turn out shiny.

862
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,960
I wish I could part with my togepi.

863
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
I have two shiny togepis.

864
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,840
Well, one of them's a shiny toga kiss.

865
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,720
What's the, no, what's the last, there's a third one.

866
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Really?

867
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,280
Gen four toga kiss, I think is the last one or something like that.

868
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,040
So that's the, uh, my, my only one of those is a shiny because since it was a hatch, it

869
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,480
was also a wonder or highest level appraisal.

870
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,240
So it made sense to do that one.

871
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
So yeah.

872
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Um, yeah.

873
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Anyway, Pokemon, Pokemon.

874
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,640
Oh, maybe, maybe I transferred it to, uh, I transferred the Pokemon.

875
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Let's go.

876
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,960
You, you put a shiny and let's go.

877
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Yeah.

878
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,760
Cause I don't give a crap about this stuff.

879
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,160
Save me all the shinies ever.

880
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
All right.

881
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Yeah.

882
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
It wasn't.

883
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
You need to get yourself a Bluetooth catcher.

884
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,000
That's, that's been great for shinies.

885
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,320
Just you have to just remember to kind of sit there and clean up your Pokemon all the

886
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
time.

887
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,680
And it's, it's only really works when walking.

888
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,700
They really nerfed it when driving.

889
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,600
But since I've been trying to walk more and do the fitness thing more, um, I've been using

890
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,160
like I'll go walk the giant park, not far, not, not the park that's close to the house,

891
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
but the giant park.

892
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,240
It's a little further from the house.

893
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,220
I've been walking that pretty regularly.

894
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,060
And like, I'll use my Bluetooth to catch, I'll play ingress and I'm walking and it's

895
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
exercise.

896
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Postmates is expensive.

897
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
Yes.

898
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
Yes it is.

899
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,660
For pita kitchen anyway.

900
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
All right.

901
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Anyway.

902
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,940
Uh, that's it for my gaming week.

903
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,840
So I guess, uh, we can get into some housekeeping real quick.

910
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,380
The bits, uh, and, uh, the, the, um, subscriptions are really, really amazing.

911
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,220
You guys have really shown up and we're so happy.

912
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,260
Uh, you guys have been supporting us on Twitch for the past few months, ever since we switched

913
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,460
to Twitch in December.

914
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,300
And there's been a lot of exciting news on the Twitch front lately, right?

915
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,660
Uh, we got some new emotes, so I know Bobby Black Wolf has this little, a Wolf emote and

916
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,780
we're going to have one that represents a well are pretty soon.

917
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,020
We've been talking about it behind the scenes.

918
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,580
I think we know what we're going to go with, but we'll have an OLR emote very soon.

919
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,060
Uh, that's going to be a thing.

920
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,300
And then I'm hearing something about, uh, um, at the Twitch con Europe, I think happened

921
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
this weekend, right?

922
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Yeah.

923
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
I saw the thing.

924
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,300
They were talking about like highlight reels.

925
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,940
Like, like something about the volume of your chat and the clips that are made will make

926
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,340
this highlight reel at the end of your, so I'm really curious to see what the highlight

927
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,180
reels end up being for the show because it sounds, it sounds very play of the game and

928
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,180
Overwatch, like it kind of uses an algorithm to figure out like what the highlight is.

929
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,180
Those always work well.

930
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,180
Yeah.

931
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,660
I'm, I'm really curious to see how those turn out.

932
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
And there's other stuff too.

933
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
We'll talk about.

934
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,660
It's going to be, it's a little later.

935
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,060
It's going to be like him, me talking all of a sudden, it's so much fun.

936
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,180
God damn it.

937
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,180
Fuck you algorithm.

938
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,940
Oh, now I really want that to happen.

939
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,220
All right, let's get into some gaming news for now.

940
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,540
Uh, start us off, Logie.

941
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
All right.

942
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,740
Apparently, uh, Bungee has been blocking people from using a weapon that they accidentally

943
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,620
sold to them in destiny.

944
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Um, so that seems to have, there was a, some exclusive stuff that they had in PlayStation

945
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,620
four.

946
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:44,780
There's this weapon that was, uh, the exotic trace rifle wave splitter, and apparently

947
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:51,980
this traveling alien salesman would sell you and, uh, somehow that, uh, wave splitter was

948
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:57,180
made available, uh, to players on Xbox and PC.

949
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,020
And of course, you know, they, they're aware of the issue and they're working on a fix

950
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,860
in the meantime though, if you've, um, acquired that weapon, you're not gonna be able to use

951
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
it.

952
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,100
So even if you paid for it, sorry, that's money not well spent and they're not going

953
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,280
to refund them.

954
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,660
I think that that's maybe what they're working on doing.

955
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,780
They haven't said that they're going to do that yet, but most likely that's going to

956
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,060
have to be the outcome unless it's going to become a non-exclusive weapon.

957
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,860
Um, so I don't know.

958
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,980
Here's my, my honest to God reaction to this story that I'm hearing.

959
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,940
Like I realized it was a mistake and so forth.

960
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,860
First off, we know these exclusive sorts of things are really silly.

961
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,620
Like I understand why it happens in the industry.

962
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,620
I get it.

963
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,420
You know, people like Sony offer money, they offer, and Microsoft does it too.

964
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,420
Nintendo kind of doesn't need to, well, no, I take that back.

965
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,540
Nintendo does it too with things like star link, the Ubisoft thing, right?

966
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
That practically became a Starbucks game.

967
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
So Nintendo does this too.

968
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,700
Speaking of which, they have that on sale.

969
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Yeah, I heard.

970
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
It was down to like 30 bucks.

971
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Bargain basement prices.

972
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Yeah.

973
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,700
But I might need to pick that up.

974
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
But anyway.

975
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
The Switch version too.

976
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
I don't want to digress.

977
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
I don't want to digress.

978
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
All right, sorry.

979
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,700
So Sony, um, you know, spends this money on Destiny.

980
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,660
I'm, I'm only picking on them because we're talking about destiny, but my point is every

981
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
company does this.

982
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Okay.

983
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
So this isn't like a Sony problem.

984
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
This is an industry problem.

985
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,340
So, um, they pay money to get these exclusives, either they're paying money or they're offering

986
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,300
advertising, booth space, trade type of MDF is what they call it.

987
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
Oh, fancy.

988
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,060
What's MDF stand for?

989
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,700
It's, uh, I think it's marketing development funds or something like that.

990
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
I don't know.

991
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Less fancy.

992
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
That's all right.

993
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,300
MDF is that's the, that's the ad dollars.

994
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,140
It's basically it's ad dollars.

995
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:34,300
So what it is is they, they say, I'm going to give you $100,000 MDF, you know, and so

996
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,180
what the company has to do is they have to show them how they're spending that on marketing.

997
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,680
So they submit, okay, here's our print ad run that we're going to do, or here's our

998
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,160
TV advertisement, you know, and the, all the money behind it.

999
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
All right.

1000
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,600
Thank you for the peak behind the curtain, but it's kinda, it's with all respect, it's

1001
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
not surprising.

1002
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,920
That's kind of what I figured was going on.

1003
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Right.

1004
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,000
So they're paying the money for the exclusives, whether we'd like it or not, even though we

1005
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,640
think it's like, it's just kind of like ridiculous or whatever.

1006
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,760
Like why, you know, why can't Microsoft and PC, when it comes to destiny, just have the

1007
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
same things.

1008
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,240
It's really, really ridiculous.

1009
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,120
I get it when it's IP things.

1010
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Okay.

1011
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,120
I get why Nintendo or excuse me, Sony and Microsoft can't have Star Fox in their version

1012
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
of Starlink.

1013
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,400
I get it when it comes to IP, but that's why I thought one of the coolest things ever was

1014
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,720
back in the day, Soul Calibur 2, right?

1015
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:33,160
And how like Nintendo got Link, Sony got Hahachi, Microsoft got Spawn, right?

1016
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,240
So that was kind of a weird one, but it, you know, it was still, they got something special

1017
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
too.

1018
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
And that was kind of neat.

1019
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Right?

1020
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,720
I'm like, I don't know, master chief, there's not really any really space shooting years

1021
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
ago.

1022
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,720
It doesn't matter.

1023
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,840
So they put master chief in a million games.

1024
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
It's fine.

1025
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Spawn's cool.

1026
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,880
So anyway, um, but it is really like, okay, the thing and the kind of the point I'm trying

1027
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,680
to get to with this is that, okay, so it was a mistake that they opened it up and sold

1028
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,400
these weapons, but these are not like, it's not like these are Sony branded weapons, right?

1029
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,560
These aren't like God of war guns, right?

1030
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,640
They're not like, um, horizon, zero dawn bullets or things like that.

1031
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
Right.

1032
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,400
These are just guns that are marked for PlayStation exclusives.

1033
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Right.

1034
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Yeah.

1035
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,880
So here's my thing is that like, Hey, this is a silly thing to have exclusive.

1036
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,240
They should just open it up already, but be fine.

1037
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,160
The economy is what it is.

1038
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Capitalism is what it is.

1039
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,920
Deals and wheels and all that are what they are.

1040
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,520
But if they opened it up and they accidentally sold these things, I'm sorry, but you done

1041
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
fucked up.

1042
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
You let people keep them.

1043
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
Okay.

1044
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
And that's so that's your fault.

1045
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,880
And honestly, in this society we live in, Loki, it, this is going to be a lawsuit in

1046
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
six months.

1047
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
No, it's lawsuit in six months.

1048
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,120
Funny that you mentioned six months, though, because this is what's going to, this is the

1049
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
fix.

1050
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Okay.

1051
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,740
So this is the fix six days because see, while it's an exclusive weapon, like most things

1052
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:02,300
that are exclusive on multi-platform, um, games, it's a timed exclusive weapons.

1053
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,440
So what's going to happen is you will have it in your inventory if you purchase it, but

1054
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,800
you can't use it until September of this year.

1055
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,300
So what dot, dot, dot.

1056
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,840
So it's a timed exclusive.

1057
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,160
So you know, you fucked up.

1058
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,240
Just deal with it.

1059
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,720
Like you, you fucked up.

1060
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
Open it up.

1061
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,480
Just lucky fucking people that got that when they could like, just deal with it.

1062
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,120
Like I just, I feel like this just ends in lawsuit.

1063
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,600
Well, by the time the lawsuit happens, it'll be out in the general public and it won't

1064
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,520
fucking matter because you'll be able to use it again.

1065
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:43,680
So what happens if I like, if I go to, um, target and I buy, um, peppermint Hershey's

1066
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,520
kisses or something, even though it's not Christmas, does target come to my house and

1067
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,400
repossess those kisses?

1068
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,680
And then they're like, we're sorry, you don't get your money back, but come December, you

1069
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,440
can come back and get these and we'll give them to you.

1070
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,920
Like that's not how it fucking works though.

1071
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,000
They hold it in your general inventory, so it's in your cabinet, but you can't touch

1072
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
it.

1073
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,280
They padlock your cabinet until September.

1074
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,960
That's not, that's not how this works.

1075
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,480
That's not how any of this works.

1076
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,640
I'm telling you a lawsuit.

1077
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,840
That's just, thank God that this isn't fallout 76 and that gun has weight to it and stuck

1078
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:21,040
in your inventory for six months until you can, you know, actually use it and weighing

1079
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,040
it down.

1080
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,240
Guys, you don't enter chat at a Twitch TV slash vlog network says the problem is not

1081
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,240
the marketing.

1082
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,720
It was probably blocked because gamers are screaming.

1083
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
Opie.

1084
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,960
It happens too much with games.

1085
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,960
That's the real problem.

1086
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,240
I don't know if that's what happened, but that's what I suspect I kind of get.

1087
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,240
I get your reference, but I think in this particular example, they are selling that

1088
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,320
gun on Sony's micro marketplace and Sony players aren't screaming, Opie, are they on?

1089
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320
Maybe they are.

1090
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Okay.

1091
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,240
But regardless, it's functioning on one platform.

1092
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,080
This is just about, Oh, well due to our agreement with Sony, even though we're the ones that

1093
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:00,800
fucked up and somehow open that sale on other marketplaces on PC and Xbox live and all this,

1094
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,040
you were still going to lock it away from you because we have to honor our deal with

1095
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,760
Sony and it's like, you just need to admit you fucked up and there should be some type

1096
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,800
of clause in your contract with Sony where it's like, you know, we made a boo boo, but

1097
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,320
in good faith we pulled it from the store as soon as we realized there was an issue

1098
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,080
and it's still going to be exclusive until such a such day.

1099
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,880
Like they're not going to do that.

1100
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,120
God, what's going to happen is everyone's going to forget about it next week and then

1101
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,200
it'll just come available to, no, we'll talk about, I want to, I want a reminder.

1102
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,040
That's not going to happen at the top of every L R justice for death.

1103
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,160
Just forget all that happened because there's so much news that it's just going to be forgotten

1104
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,520
and the next thing someone will be mad at, I can't even think about like what few weeks

1105
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
ago we were mad at.

1106
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,240
Do I need to put, is everyone still mad at Metro Exodus is on, um, the, was the Epic

1107
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:53,160
story and people still remember that or cause they're mad about borderlands three now or

1108
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,420
whatever next Epic exclusive they get.

1109
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,160
Do we need a little like, you know, you know how at the beginning of every year, you know,

1110
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,840
every show here on Twitch, we have our little parody intro.

1111
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:05,960
Maybe we need another slide that says, Hey, hashtag remember things were mad at things

1112
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
were mad.

1113
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
Yeah.

1114
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
The list of things to remember.

1115
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
We're mad at.

1116
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,280
Do we need like a Wiki page?

1117
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,640
I bet RTC would be willing to make a Wiki page.

1118
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,640
I just fall.

1119
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,760
I just fall and told him, I'm like, unlike the, uh, was it like the wall of fame that

1120
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,960
like certain other podcasts have that they write their listener names on their world,

1121
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,960
right?

1122
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,960
All the things that were mad at.

1123
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,680
So the wall of shame, the list of grievances, lists of grievances.

1124
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,320
The orange lounge list of grievances.

1125
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,640
We can move this poster and put like a big whiteboard here and have the orange lounge

1126
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,640
radio list of grievances.

1127
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,640
Do you want to do that?

1128
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,800
Cause we'll make a list of grievances of how expensive this crap is coming soon.

1129
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Coming soon.

1130
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,280
The orange launch radio list of grievances.

1131
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,280
Awesome.

1132
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,520
No, it's needed.

1133
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
It's needed.

1134
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,520
I don't even play.

1135
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,440
I don't even play destiny and I'm mad.

1136
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,800
All right.

1137
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,840
$13 for cheese and bacon and egg burrito.

1138
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
Delivery's expensive.

1139
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,840
Yo.

1140
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
All right.

1141
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
I'm hungry.

1142
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
All right.

1143
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Yeah.

1144
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
You're hungry.

1145
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Uh, it has just 200.

1146
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Matt says the airing of the grievances.

1147
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Yes.

1148
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
Bobby Black Wolf says an on notice board.

1149
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
No, we would not want to copy anybody else.

1150
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,000
This is a list of grievances.

1151
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:21,920
TM Pat pending, O L R uh, it's the orange lounge log.

1152
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,920
Yes.

1153
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
The orange log.

1154
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,040
The O L log.

1155
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,040
The O L log.

1156
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,040
What rolls downstairs.

1157
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
Hops over repairs.

1158
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
Your neighbors dog.

1159
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,240
That's great for a snack and bits on your back.

1160
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,160
It's O L R log.

1161
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,200
What's great to complain and scream at the rain.

1162
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,200
It's O L R's log.

1163
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,200
All right.

1164
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,440
Anyway, I'm never doing that again.

1165
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,040
Let's move on with more stories.

1166
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,600
Do we gotta, cause I don't know.

1167
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,880
I'm stuck on that log thing.

1168
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,360
No, I know you don't have to.

1169
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,680
I can do the next story cause the next one's supposed to be mine anyway, but it'll be fast.

1170
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,440
It's about an apex legends update, which I know you guys don't play or do you surprise

1171
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
me?

1172
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
You guys play apex legends?

1173
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Nope.

1174
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,440
All right.

1175
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
I played it a couple of times.

1176
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
It's cool.

1177
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,040
I feel like it's one of those things like border lands that I won't really grow to appreciate

1178
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,560
it for 10 more years, but the times I've tried it, it's interesting.

1179
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,000
But um, you all should know if you, if you don't already know this, don't fuck up in

1180
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
apex legends.

1181
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,560
Meaning like, I mean, you can be bad.

1182
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,080
Well, if you're bad, people might yell at you.

1183
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,680
It's going to ban you if you're bad.

1184
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,680
But you know what?

1185
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
Here's the trick.

1186
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,680
If you're afraid of other people in apex legends, which I completely understand, turn off your

1187
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,040
audio incoming and outgoing.

1188
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,780
They can scream into the abyss and you'll never hear it.

1189
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,320
And you can still be an effective team member because apex legends has a really great pinging

1190
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,320
system.

1191
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,160
They have a great, like, you know, here found a weapon.

1192
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
You can ping things.

1193
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,640
I'm sure people go ping, ping, ping, ping.

1194
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,000
Well, they've got to have a ping flood stop.

1195
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't know.

1196
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,200
But anyway, my point is you can just turn the audio off and then no buddy can ever scream

1197
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,200
at you.

1198
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,200
But anyway, uh, but don't cheat.

1199
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,200
That's the one thing you can't do.

1200
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,280
And honestly, if you're cheating in these types of games that are meant to be multiplayer

1201
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:02,600
online, I mean, if you cheat in your own game, you know, if you hack your, uh, borderlands

1202
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,880
one file, as long as you're not playing online with other people, especially going into randos.

1203
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,320
It's co-op, who cares?

1204
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,880
Or if you're okay, but if you're going in with people that know what they're getting

1205
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,880
into, that's one thing.

1206
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,940
But if you go into rando matches and do that shit, that's what's fucked up, right?

1207
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,940
You don't-

1208
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,800
Besides, I would share my modded weapons anyways.

1209
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,660
You don't inflict that on other people that don't want their games to be messed up.

1210
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,160
So anyway, there's this whole thing going on, of course, the internet forums, the reddits,

1211
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
all that places.

1212
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,640
Uh, PC players are finding out that if they've cheated, they're getting banned.

1213
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,180
And the usual types of ban evasions aren't working.

1214
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,840
Like they're trying to change their IP addresses.

1215
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,840
Nope.

1216
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
Use a secondary account.

1217
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Nope.

1218
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,940
It does appear that Apex Legends is actually using some type of hardware ID ban.

1219
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,780
So they know your computer specs, and so that is, I don't know if it's like a Mac address

1220
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,140
reading or what they're doing, but they're doing a hardware ID ban.

1221
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,500
They drink and they know things.

1222
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,020
So there's a whole Reddit thread that goes on.

1223
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,020
Nothing's perfect.

1224
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,020
They'll find a way to edit.

1225
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,900
Well, we'll see.

1226
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,020
But it's really funny to read, there's this Reddit thread going on, there's like 19 edits

1227
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,980
on the thread with this guy on Twitch who's screaming.

1228
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,540
And he's like, he got banned for the second time in 10 minutes.

1229
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,660
And then he says, I didn't use my personal info anywhere.

1230
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,660
That's the frustrating part.

1231
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,100
I'm going to run every single fucking cleaner I have.

1232
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,400
And then he rebooted the PC.

1233
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,900
And then he says, all right, I guess I have to find a new game to cheat on until I get

1234
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,380
a working spoofer again.

1235
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,380
That's edit five.

1236
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,380
And then it keeps going.

1237
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,380
I'll be back tomorrow.

1238
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,380
You better fucking believe it.

1239
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,380
It's just a soft bet.

1240
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,380
Da da da.

1241
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,380
And they edit seven.

1242
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,380
Apex can suck my dick.

1243
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,380
They can't keep me out.

1244
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,540
What people don't understand is that they're so fucking big they can't control everywhere.

1245
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,260
Seeing this guy get owned makes me so happy.

1246
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,360
Like you're not wanted in this game by.

1247
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,820
Don't let the door hit you.

1248
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,620
Makes me happy.

1249
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,100
I mean, what is very satisfying?

1250
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,120
I just want to go in the comments and just fuss at them or laugh.

1251
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,820
Just nothing but like as many characters as it would let me is ha.

1252
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,540
God, some of these edits are crazy.

1253
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,900
Dishonesty isn't toxic, but OK, I'm not toxic.

1254
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,620
All I do is kill people.

1255
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,140
Wow.

1256
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,460
Anyway.

1257
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,720
Ah.

1258
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,680
So anyway, I'm I'm I'm really glad to hear that they've found a way to like make at least

1259
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,660
ban them harder than they have been doing historically.

1260
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,100
Well, yeah, because, you know, again, it's one thing to cheat in a single player game.

1261
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,340
It's it's one thing to cheat co-op.

1262
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,820
If everybody knows that they're signing up for it, then whatever.

1263
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,820
Right.

1264
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,420
But it's another thing to go into these one versus 100 type of games is what apex is and

1265
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,900
flex your opinion, which is fake.

1266
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,980
It's Viagra.

1267
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,980
It's fake.

1268
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,380
It's a fake pain because you're cheating to do it.

1269
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,500
And you know, for what?

1270
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,860
To just, you know, yeah, I won, except I can't win without cheating because I have no skills.

1271
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,860
Yeah.

1272
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,860
Look at how awesome I am.

1273
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,940
I don't understand what L.O.

1274
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,260
How does that make you feel good that you beat people, but you suck?

1275
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,480
I don't understand how that works or it's L.O.L.

1276
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,340
I ruined all these people's day.

1277
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,700
They're probably sitting there crying.

1278
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,460
Who's crying now?

1279
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,460
Who's crying now?

1280
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,580
I need some tea to sip right now.

1281
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,580
You are.

1282
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,580
Oh.

1283
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,580
Yep.

1284
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
Fuck cheaters.

1285
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,580
All right.

1286
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,540
Anyhow, let's move on.

1287
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,540
Dark Sakura.

1288
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:31,540
Well, finally, finally, finally, finally, you can change your PSN ID.

1289
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:40,020
It actually is live now for North America, Europe and Australia for anyone on the PS4.

1290
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,620
Some games may have issues after you change your ID, but you need to make sure that some

1291
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,800
of the games, you know, if they're big games that you have a worry about, you need to make

1292
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,260
sure that they're going to be fine with the name change.

1293
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:58,660
A lot of the big ones like Fortnite, Destiny 2, those are fine.

1294
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,460
So basically it, you know, a lot of people have asked for it.

1295
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:09,140
People will put like, like, I'm trying to think of like a really crappy username, like

1296
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,340
Rob Roberts.

1297
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,340
No.

1298
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:18,340
Oh, you mean like a shitty toilet person type of name like, like, um, like lead hacks or

1299
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,340
101.

1300
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,340
Okay.

1301
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:26,780
And then decide, oh no, I actually want to be like, like just cool guy number two.

1302
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,780
Reformed troll 101.

1303
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,780
Oh yeah.

1304
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,980
Like, or, you know, have someone's ex go in and change your name to angry crusty bridge

1305
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,980
troll.

1306
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,180
You know, something like that.

1307
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,980
I'm sure someone actually is that.

1308
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Oh, perfect.

1309
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,980
X, X Sephiroth 420 X, X.

1310
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,980
Perfect.

1311
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,980
Perfect example.

1312
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:50,980
Anyway, um, the first time that you change it, it is free, but it will cost you afterwards.

1313
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,980
Um, $10, um, or eight pounds.

1314
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:00,980
Uh, if, if you just have a regular account, if you're plus, then it's five or four pounds,

1315
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,980
$5 or four pounds.

1316
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,940
So you can change it as much as you want.

1317
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:11,540
You can always revert back to any previous version of your ID for free.

1318
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:18,100
If you contact PlayStation support, no one can take your old IDs so you can choose to

1319
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,340
display your old ID next to your new one for up to 30 days so that your friends will know

1320
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,660
it was you doesn't do good.

1321
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:30,340
If you were trying to hide who you were, child accounts cannot change their ID.

1322
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:37,740
So, you know, if you have, you know, mommy's a little gamer girl, 23 cause it's her 23rd,

1323
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,540
you know, gamer girl child, she can't go, God damn, this name sucks, mom.

1324
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,340
I want it to be blood rage woman, you know, or something like that.

1325
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,340
She can't do it.

1326
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,740
So I would have blood rage woman though.

1327
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,740
Just saying, of course you would.

1328
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,740
I would just have, here's, here's the thing though on PlayStation.

1329
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,740
Like, I don't, I don't like the gamer tags or the usernames, whatever they call them.

1330
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,740
I don't like, because I can never remember who's who.

1331
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,140
Some of them are obvious.

1332
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,540
Like when I see Bobby Black Wolf, like I know who that fucking is.

1333
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,040
Right.

1334
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,540
And usually like if your name kind of matches misty, OLR, I know who that is because that's

1335
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,840
her name every single place, which bless you for having OLR in your name in the first place.

1336
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,240
But, um, you know, there's some people where it's like their one name here, their one name

1337
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,240
on PlayStation, their one name in Twitch chat, their one name over here, which, you know,

1338
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,840
it's your life.

1339
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,840
You are welcomed as many identities as you want, but I can't keep them all together.

1340
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,840
So I love Facebook's name implementation where you can trade.

1341
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,440
I don't.

1342
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,840
And so that way, oh, because you don't, because you don't use a fake name on Facebook like

1343
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,840
I do.

1344
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,840
So I don't care who knows.

1345
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,840
Well, no, no, no.

1346
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:51,140
I, I have, I don't really want to say this live, but I know plenty of people who Facebook's

1347
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,940
name policy is highly detrimental to their safety.

1348
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,740
Oh, we've talked about this on the show before.

1349
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,740
Sure.

1350
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,740
Especially, especially in the trans community.

1351
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,440
That's why I don't like to have a single name like that.

1352
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,540
I would rather people, people be able to have a handle.

1353
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,540
Well, okay.

1354
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,700
But to be fair, like, here's the thing I w when it comes to like your Facebook name,

1355
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,740
you and the friend have to agree to show each other the name.

1356
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,940
So like randos don't see it.

1357
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:22,740
So like I, I, and usually I'm the one to do it cause I'm using a fake name on Facebook

1358
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,740
anyway.

1359
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,240
Um, I will go reach out.

1360
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,240
I'm like, who is this?

1361
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,440
And I'll just go do a close friend request and see if they accept it.

1362
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,440
And most of the times they do.

1363
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,940
And then I'm like, oh, it's this person.

1364
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,540
And then you see their Facebook, uh, picture and I'm like, okay, it's that person.

1365
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:44,740
Now I know who it is because I had no clue who X, X, X, Sephiroth 42069, uh, weed.king.com,

1366
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,740
X, X, X is like, I had no idea who that was.

1367
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,740
And now that guy sounds so awesome though.

1368
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,940
Well, the problem was he probably picked that name when he was 13.

1369
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,840
He couldn't change it till yesterday.

1370
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:59,940
So it's like, you know, perhaps the two triple X is, it's a bit much.

1371
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:07,040
I sure really only done one triple X, but if you triple, triple X, then does that mean

1372
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,140
like extra fun times?

1373
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,140
Yes.

1374
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,140
It doesn't sound fun to me.

1375
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,140
Interesting.

1376
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,040
I'm, I'm getting some comments in chat.

1377
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,140
I'm reading like Bobby's, um, story.

1378
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:24,740
Cause you know, he has, I think on, on, uh, uh, one of the services, he has a name that

1379
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,500
a lot of people really want cause the very like common more thing.

1380
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,740
And like he's been offered money to get off that name so that other people could use that,

1381
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,840
you know, on Twitter when my, cause I, you know, y'all know I changed my Twitter account

1382
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,840
like six months ago.

1383
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:42,300
So I'm now Mr. Rob Roberts on Twitter because I just don't use the online name sky as much

1384
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,100
anymore, which I realize is in the intro to our show, but at some point we'll get our

1385
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,100
intro updated.

1386
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,580
But, um, when I had, because I've had my Twitter account for 12 years and I know that cause

1387
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,200
I got one of the memory things the other day.

1388
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,700
So when I first went on Twitter, I got on Twitter really early and my username was at

1389
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,160
S K I E at a four letter name, pretty hard to get right.

1390
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,700
And I would have people tweet me like, can I have your name?

1391
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:10,040
Um, no, this is apparently like, especially in some other cultures overseas, that's like

1392
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,160
people's like legit first name is S K I E and stuff, but it's like, no, I picked it

1393
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,160
first.

1394
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,160
Sorry.

1395
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,380
You know, this is my identity online.

1396
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,720
You know, this is my name too.

1397
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,400
And in a sense I can't.

1398
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,760
So what I did when I went onto Mr. Rob Roberts, I tried to grab sky back as fast as I could

1399
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,920
because my plan was I would let that name go when I could get at Rob Roberts, which

1400
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,560
is spammers sitting on right now.

1401
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,840
I couldn't get it back because Twitter won't let you get an account name under five or

1402
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,280
six letters anymore.

1403
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,360
So nobody can have that name anyway.

1404
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,560
So anyway, you were the last, I was the, I was the first and the last.

1405
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,840
I get people asking me for dark Sakura and I'm like, fuck, you know, no, it's my name.

1406
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,660
We have OLR.

1407
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,660
We do.

1408
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,660
We do have OLR on Twitter.

1409
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,660
And that's a three.

1410
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,660
And why would I let that go?

1411
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,660
Yeah.

1412
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:01,040
So even, even if the show were to end someday, it would still be an archive of all the episodes

1413
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,240
of this show that ever had existed.

1414
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:10,560
It's going to be, no, it's going to be inherited by like Julian and all the cool kids.

1415
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,520
Honestly that's where this is headed is that there'll probably be a gen two of OLR at some

1416
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,520
point.

1417
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,880
So, and I'm okay with that.

1418
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,880
Yeah.

1419
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Why not?

1420
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,880
I'm going to be doing this when I'm 90.

1421
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,960
I'm going to be like, just like Iris Apfel with my big huge ass glasses and just be like,

1422
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
fuck you.

1423
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Games suck.

1424
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,600
Well, it's like, it's like we've got this record now.

1425
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:38,480
Like we've been doing this video game podcast fee thing longer than anybody else can consistently

1426
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,760
like weekly, you know, some people are really close and I'm sure would love to see us hang

1427
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,680
up, hang up our hats, but it's like, it's one of those things where, you know, in a

1428
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,180
friendly competitive way, nobody's really like cutthroat.

1429
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,960
But I, I it's, it's one of those things where it's like, it's so such a habit.

1430
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,880
How can we ever stop?

1431
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,080
What would I do on my Sunday nights?

1432
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,080
Watch Game of Thrones.

1433
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,080
Not for much longer.

1434
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,080
I can't even do that much longer.

1435
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,920
You have to watch the Game of Thrones prequel that they'll do.

1436
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,520
I know, you know, now the thing I see like all now is like the memes, it's all the Game

1437
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,720
of Thrones fans.

1438
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,320
There's tons of memes on here already.

1439
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,840
Well, no, but they put these memes out there that say, nobody cares that you don't watch

1440
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,160
Game of Thrones, asshole, let us have our moment.

1441
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,020
And I'm like, okay, wait a minute though.

1442
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,400
Like I don't watch Game of Thrones, but I don't like, I'm not shitting on people who

1443
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,400
do.

1444
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:35,960
I feel a meme from a friend of mine or a friend of ours, I guess I should say, but everyone

1445
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,280
who's going out going, well, I don't watch it.

1446
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,280
I don't watch it.

1447
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,280
I don't like good for you.

1448
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,720
Literally no one cares, but I, it's, it's a Cersei quote, every breath you draw in my

1449
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,500
presence annoys me, but, but why can't I say I don't watch it?

1450
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,260
Like it's not like, it's one thing to say, I don't watch it.

1451
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,780
It's another thing you like you'd be, Oh, I don't watch it, you know, but other people

1452
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,860
who make a big fucking deal and it's not watching it, it's, it's, here's the thing.

1453
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:06,060
It's when it implied I don't watch it and people who do are stupid.

1454
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,140
That's then I get that.

1455
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,520
Be mad at that because let people enjoy things.

1456
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,520
Just let people enjoy things.

1457
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,520
And I'm all about that.

1458
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,220
But like when people like expect me to know Game of Thrones, it's so noisy when people

1459
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:22,480
like things, when people expect me to know Game of Thrones or I'm not a real nerd, I'm

1460
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,540
like, okay, real nerd.

1461
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,980
You want to talk about why I haven't been watching Game of Thrones?

1462
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,780
Cause I do this other thing online, Sunday nights with literally half of my fucking life.

1463
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,660
So you want to talk, you want to talk about nerd?

1464
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,660
We'll talk about nerd.

1465
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,660
I'll do this.

1466
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,660
Have you read the books?

1467
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,660
There's that too.

1468
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,660
Have you read the books?

1469
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:47,980
Did you see the four hour version of Dune?

1470
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,260
But what was your first movie?

1471
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,220
Mine was fucking Star Wars and I was nine months fucking old.

1472
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:57,020
For the record, if you're watching the Game of Thrones and you're having a good time,

1473
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,020
the hats off.

1474
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,020
Enjoy it.

1475
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,020
Live it up.

1476
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,100
Embrace your nerd passion.

1477
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,100
Love it.

1478
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,220
Um, and I hope, I hope everybody dies because that's what seems to happen every week on

1479
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,780
that show and people lose their shit.

1480
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,780
So they like it.

1481
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,780
Right?

1482
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,780
I only literally care about one character that I don't want to die.

1483
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:16,420
Anyway, actually three, three characters, uh, Akuma JP in chat says Game of Thrones,

1484
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,140
too much sex for me.

1485
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,140
There is.

1486
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,140
I think that's what I think.

1487
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,620
I know.

1488
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,180
I know you're from another part of the world, but I'm going to let you in on a little secret

1489
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,820
about like America.

1490
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:30,220
I think that's why nerds like it.

1491
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,220
Just just an inquiry.

1492
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:35,660
I honestly, I just wait and fast forward pass all the shit I don't want to see because I'm

1493
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,660
not into it.

1494
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,660
I'm, I'm ace.

1495
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,660
I don't like the gory stuff.

1496
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,500
It doesn't add to anything watching this like, okay, good.

1497
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,500
They fucked.

1498
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
Whatever.

1499
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,500
Yeah.

1500
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,040
You, you would just rather see the black screen that says, and then they fuck.

1501
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,300
But both sex, both sex.

1502
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,740
That's the thing in Game of Thrones.

1503
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,740
You watch this.

1504
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,740
Don't you?

1505
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,740
I watch Game of Thrones.

1506
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,740
Of course.

1507
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,740
Of course.

1508
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,740
I could know.

1509
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,740
Of course.

1510
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,740
That's, I called it on demand, dude.

1511
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,740
I mean, geez.

1512
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,740
Like watch it later.

1513
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:01,740
Okay.

1514
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,740
But I shipped it on the ship.

1515
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,740
Aha.

1516
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,740
Okay.

1517
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,740
Here's the thing.

1518
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,740
Yes.

1519
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,740
That's the number one thing I get told by all the Game of Thrones fans.

1520
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:08,740
Oh, you did something.

1521
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:09,740
So now watch it on demand.

1522
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,140
I got two reasons for you.

1523
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,540
Number one, have you seen my on demand cue lately?

1524
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:19,300
Did you, did you miss the memo that like fucking everything went to on demand sometime

1525
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,300
ago?

1526
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,300
Like respectfully.

1527
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,300
There's just a ton of shit to watch.

1528
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,060
This is why I'd watch jack shit.

1529
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,460
So that when something really awesome is out, I can watch it.

1530
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:30,440
Number two, because there's so many of you that enjoy it and that's cool too.

1531
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,900
You all have spoiled it by the next day.

1532
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,300
Like I literally saw a tweet earlier that said, if you don't want Game of Thrones spoiled

1533
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,660
for you, then stay off Twitter at night.

1534
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,660
That's what I'm doing.

1535
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:44,380
This is the exact same person who said, I'm looking for spoilers right now.

1536
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,380
Don't don't.

1537
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,380
Obviously we all know not to say them on air.

1538
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,380
If you want to seek them out.

1539
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,380
That's one thing.

1540
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,380
I'm doing it.

1541
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,380
I'm looking for them.

1542
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:51,380
Go for it.

1543
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:55,820
But, um, I was gonna say, um, uh, this is the exact same person who then says, if you

1544
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,740
brag about how you don't watch Game of Thrones, you're an asshole.

1545
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:03,200
And I'm kind of like, you can't have it both ways, sis.

1546
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,660
How are the rest of us supposed to watch Game of Thrones when you're sitting here going,

1547
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:12,980
but I'm going to spoil it as soon as it airs and it's your, you can't have it both ways.

1548
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,580
Anyway.

1549
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,580
Sorry.

1550
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,580
It is a video game show.

1551
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,580
I don't know why.

1552
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,340
Well, I also didn't really care for chair of swords because I tried reading the first

1553
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,340
book in the first book.

1554
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,260
Actually, I literally hated everybody.

1555
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,860
I hated everybody for like the first three seasons.

1556
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:29,420
Ooh, you're edgy because you don't like Game of Thrones.

1557
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:36,500
But then I discovered characters I liked and then saw the ones I hated die or about to

1558
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,500
die.

1559
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,500
So it's like Mass Effect kind of.

1560
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,500
Yeah, it is kind of like that.

1561
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,500
All right.

1562
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Moving on.

1563
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,500
Let's get back to games.

1564
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,020
I'm happy.

1565
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,580
I don't know how we went from PS4 name changes to Game of Thrones podcast waiting for my

1566
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,260
fucking $20 burrito.

1567
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,700
Let's move on.

1568
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:56,060
Let's talk about a world where the Vita is still getting games.

1569
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,060
Wow.

1570
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,060
Physical games.

1571
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,620
So, uh, was it Nasalis?

1572
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,620
I think that's how you pronounce it.

1573
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:08,380
They're publishing a couple of physical copies or physical versions of a thousand one spikes

1574
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,700
and VVVVVV.

1575
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,820
I love this box art for VVVV.

1576
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,720
I wish I'd had the forethought to make a video thing I could put on Twitch.

1577
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:21,260
I love the VVVVV cover because that looks like an old Commodore 64 cartridge.

1578
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,260
Yeah.

1579
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,140
It looks like if you guys have seen like old Commodore 64 cartridges with like it's like

1580
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,580
the same font and design and everything.

1581
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,580
It's gorgeous.

1582
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,580
Yes.

1583
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,580
So, I mean, I it's awesome.

1584
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,780
I don't have a Vita anymore, so.

1585
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,740
But yeah, I love the box art.

1586
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,540
I know that came out for other systems.

1587
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,580
I'm surprised they're not publishing on other systems, too.

1588
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,580
Thousand one spikes, to be clear, though, is actually a PlayStation 4 version.

1589
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,780
So Vita is getting VVVV.

1590
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:50,860
But yeah, it's pretty awesome to see those physical versions.

1591
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:54,220
And this, I don't think I don't believe this is actually by Limited Run either.

1592
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,100
So this is actually being published by Nasalis.

1593
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:02,380
So coming soon, apparently they did leak out early to the promo, promo copies that they

1594
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,900
had been floating to like Sony employees had somehow made it to eBay.

1595
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,220
It's still a collectible of sorts, really, at this point.

1596
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,960
So that's pretty cool.

1597
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,660
Over in chat, Renji221 asked, what's a Vita?

1598
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:19,140
Well, put up a chair, Sony, and let me tell you a story.

1599
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,980
One day, Sony thought they'd compete with Nintendo in a handheld space.

1600
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,740
So that's almost worth being $20 or $13.

1601
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,740
Don't interrupt grandpa's story with your burrito.

1602
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,740
You know what?

1603
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,740
It's a burrito and it's delicious.

1604
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,740
No one cares because they're not eating it.

1605
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,740
Discrito, burrito.

1606
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,140
Yeah, you need to be a little more discrito with that burrito.

1607
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,660
All right.

1608
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,660
Other comments in chat.

1609
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,660
Let's see.

1610
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:47,100
Oh, Akuma JP in chat says, I'm playing Stardew for the first time on iOS.

1611
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,460
So bye bye free time.

1612
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,460
Yeah, that happens.

1613
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:52,220
It's interesting how we discover big games after the fact.

1614
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:56,260
And sometimes it's because it's on a platform, you know, the right platform that we want

1615
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,260
to play it on.

1616
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,180
Who knows what big games I have in my Steam library that I've never played.

1617
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,980
I know there's hundreds of them.

1618
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:09,140
So I thought there was something you could use to like, look at the, like, it's coming.

1619
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,160
Look at your library and see what you haven't played.

1620
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,160
It's coming soon.

1621
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,620
That's an update to the Steam store.

1622
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,620
Oh boy.

1623
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,620
Library.

1624
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,620
I can't wait to see that.

1625
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,860
We talked about that a couple of weeks ago.

1626
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:18,860
Okay.

1627
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:19,860
Yeah.

1628
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:20,860
I thought that was the thing that come up recently.

1629
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:21,860
All right.

1630
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:22,860
Anyway.

1631
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,860
All right.

1632
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,860
Uh, moving on.

1633
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:31,220
Let's, uh, talk about our next story, which has to do with a, uh, leaked little, uh, information,

1634
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:38,300
little sheet of information about the disc free Xbox one, uh, a site called win future

1635
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:43,320
got images that show off the, and take it with a grain of salt because people are weird

1636
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,260
and do photo shops and all that stuff.

1637
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:50,980
But I mean, we have heard so much buzz around the, this, like nothing is shocking with this.

1638
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,560
I wouldn't be talking about it if it wasn't one of those.

1639
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,420
This is, we know that Microsoft has been headed this way where there's smoke, there's fire.

1640
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:02,780
But anyway, but some of the specifics, somebody could be fucking with us, but they're probably

1641
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,940
not to be fair.

1642
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:09,140
So anyway, uh, the design is what looks like an Xbox one S, but there's just no drive on

1643
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,140
it.

1644
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,140
How about that?

1645
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,900
Uh, it made it much smaller though without the drive in there.

1646
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,820
Cause you would think that the drive takes up quite a bit of space.

1647
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,820
Yeah.

1648
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,620
You'd think, I don't know why they decided to still keep it the same.

1649
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,540
Assuming that that's legit because that totally looks like someone just photoshopped out the,

1650
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,020
uh, you know, actual drive image.

1651
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,380
So maybe that's you that maybe it isn't legit.

1652
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,140
Whatever dude, like really like a month away from it apparently being released.

1653
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:35,260
Well, it's supposed to have a one terabyte hard drive and the Europe version, cause I

1654
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:39,580
think that's the version that actually leaked out the Europe version we'll have for Forza

1655
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,300
horizon three.

1656
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,140
It should be noted that four is the current one.

1657
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,020
So it's an older one, but Forza horizon three Minecraft and sea of thieves will already

1658
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,020
be installed.

1659
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,380
So you have something like old three though.

1660
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,420
It's still a good game if you're new to the universe because they want you to play and

1661
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:02,260
enjoy three and then, Oh, click this button to purchase for now or buy X-Box game pass

1662
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:06,420
for only XYZ a month and or that should just be ABC a year.

1663
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:12,220
Just with withhold the games, like withhold actually purchasing, you know, or including

1664
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,220
like additional games.

1665
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,220
You're like cut that game out.

1666
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,220
Like how much is that game worth?

1667
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:21,100
I mean like 20 bucks maybe well 30 but I think these, I don't think they're, I, I feel like

1668
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:26,260
the price they're charging for it, which by the way is, is speculated to be 230 euros

1669
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,100
or $260 is what that translates to.

1670
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,540
So like just cut the cost out of there and just like throw a few months in is that I

1671
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,900
think these are kind of freebies.

1672
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,660
I think Microsoft, I don't think Microsoft isn't is inflating the price.

1673
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:41,860
I think they're throwing in these freebies to make that price a little more like lucrative.

1674
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:47,020
Oh, I'm saying is they should do game pass instead of at one of the games.

1675
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:51,300
You know what I would do, I would support that because you know, Minecraft is one of

1676
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,760
the games that's supposed to be in there as well, you know, eventually.

1677
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:59,560
So why not just do game pass so you get the fours of game and the other one and see if

1678
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,080
these, I think all those game pass games actually.

1679
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,720
So just game pass, no game, I don't know.

1680
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,720
All right.

1681
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,640
Well, anyhow, that is apparently what's going to happen.

1682
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:14,320
They're saying April 16th is the unveiling, which would be like Tuesday.

1683
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,960
Is there a, is there a, is there like an inside Xbox plan pretty soon?

1684
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,960
I don't know.

1685
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,440
I don't remember either, but April 16th about is supposed to be the day that this shows

1686
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,960
up and they're saying May 7th will be the release.

1687
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,960
So this is all supposed to be kind of wrapped up by E3.

1688
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,240
So this isn't something they're planning to unveil at E3, I guess.

1689
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,240
So yeah, we'll have to see.

1690
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,240
Interesting.

1691
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,240
Yeah, we will.

1692
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,800
Yeah, actually they do have, it says an all new episode of inside Xbox on Tuesday, April

1693
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,540
16th at 2 PM or 5, 2 PM Pacific, 5 PM Eastern time.

1694
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:46,540
There you go.

1695
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,480
That date matches up with what we're hearing here.

1696
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,880
Latest news on E3, including Xbox Fan Fest and more.

1697
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,680
So there you go, possibly then.

1698
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,080
That will probably be the day we get the specifics, if anything.

1699
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,800
So tune in if that's your thing, I guess.

1700
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
Yeah.

1701
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
Yeah.

1702
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,800
Cool.

1703
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,120
Um, I also want to point out in our chat, our Renji221 in chat says, honestly, I think

1704
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:10,620
Horizon 3 is better than 4, but that's just me.

1705
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,480
That's an interesting kind of perspective is that maybe 3 is the better, 3 did have

1706
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,480
the Hot Wheels thing.

1707
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,200
Does this have all the expansions?

1708
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,080
Cause maybe that, is it 4 is Horizon 3 with the expansions?

1709
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:24,800
Cause that would be pretty rad because that Hot Wheels was pretty cool and maybe, maybe

1710
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,520
they, maybe some folks think 3 is the better representative.

1711
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,520
Who knows?

1712
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,520
Who knows?

1713
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,520
All right.

1714
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,040
Anyhow, uh, let's move on with Dark Sakura.

1715
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:41,160
Well, for fans of, uh, the Star Wars prequel, some looks like something kind of good is

1716
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:47,360
coming out of it because the rest of it was kind of shit, but the pod race was cool.

1717
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,280
Well, there is a game coming out called Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.

1718
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:57,320
That's a third person action adventure game coming up by Respawn will be on X-Box 4, X-Box

1719
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,600
1 and PC on Origin.

1720
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:06,880
Um, because EA is publishing it, um, it's going to be $59.99 standard $69.99 deluxe,

1721
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,400
but it also has like a director's cut that shows like behind the scenes stuff and content

1722
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,520
and you know, some cosmetic stuff.

1723
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:19,440
But I just like the, um, the, uh, story like that's actually what has me interested is

1724
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:25,000
that you play someone who escaped the, uh, order 66 to kill all the Jedi.

1725
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It's like, it's, what's funny is about like all these games that are based in the prequel

1726
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,960
era or like literally everything that's come out of Star Wars that's in the prequel era

1727
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,720
is better than the actual prequels.

1728
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,720
Exactly.

1729
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,720
But I don't know.

1730
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,760
I always thought I, I, I used to be in a tabletop game where we played, you know, remnants of

1731
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,800
the Jedi order and it was, it was a fun thing.

1732
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,640
So just to see like my old tabletop game kind of coming to life just was really, really

1733
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,640
kind of cool.

1734
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:54,880
So, um, it's a shame you can't like actually customize your character, you know, do whatever,

1735
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,880
but whatever.

1736
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:03,280
Um, it has, I'm going to mispronounce this name, Cameron Monahan from Gotham Monahan,

1737
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,960
I think, but close, get close.

1738
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,960
But anyway.

1739
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,960
Cool.

1740
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
Anyway, I thought I'd make a mention.

1741
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,960
It has droids.

1742
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,960
It has lightsabers.

1743
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,960
Yeah.

1744
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,760
So you know what has me more excited, honestly, than anything else about this, the fact that

1745
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:19,100
Respawn's making it and Respawn is like a studio to watch right now because Titanfall,

1746
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,120
you know, was pretty, especially Titanfall, it's Titanfall 2, a lot of people slept on.

1747
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,980
And of course, Apex Legends is like the hot shit in gaming right now.

1748
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:30,560
So the fact that they're the folks that are making the Star Wars game, which many people

1749
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,640
have also been going, what the fuck is EA doing with the Star Wars?

1750
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,200
Titanfall 2 had a pretty great single player campaign.

1751
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,640
So I hear, haven't played it yet, own it, but still haven't played it yet.

1752
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,880
Talk that up to your inventory, but that would be your origin backlog as well as your

1753
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,880
Steam backlog.

1754
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,360
That's my PlayStation backlog, actually.

1755
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,440
And on top of this, the trailer looks really freaking good.

1756
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,120
I mean, it's pretty beautiful.

1757
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,120
So we'll see what happens.

1758
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,900
Here's our chance to talk about, I know it's a gaming podcast, but why not?

1759
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,300
We already had one tangent tonight.

1760
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:04,960
I'm sure a lot of nerds watching the Star Wars celebration have some thoughts and feelings.

1761
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,320
Like I have to admit, I haven't, okay, I've been a really bad Star Wars fan.

1762
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,680
I still haven't seen episode eight.

1763
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,160
I like, that's like on my to-do list.

1764
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,440
I need to see it.

1765
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:18,120
But I did watch the episode nine trailer and I got verklempt when I saw Carrie Fisher.

1766
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,520
That was the number one thing I noticed.

1767
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,520
Yeah.

1768
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,520
I mean, yeah.

1769
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,520
Ray jumping over the pod thing.

1770
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,920
That was badass too.

1771
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,920
But like...

1772
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,920
TIE fighter.

1773
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
It's called the TIE fighter.

1774
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,920
Yeah, whatever.

1775
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,800
The thingy, the space space plane.

1776
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,060
TIE fighter.

1777
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,060
It's like...

1778
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:36,520
When she jumped over the space plane, I was like, and it looked like I saw a great side

1779
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,240
by side comparison on Twitter.

1780
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,600
That Hitchcock movie North by Northwest when the plane comes in.

1781
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,600
There's a great side by side.

1782
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,600
Like that scene looks like that.

1783
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,680
Yes, I loved when he did a back flip with his lightsaber over the...

1784
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,680
Shut the fuck up.

1785
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,680
No, no, no, no.

1786
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:54,720
But, but the thing is that the movies actually do take from like some of the cinematic greats.

1787
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,760
Like the whole Rashomon storytelling when it came to Luke's flashbacks.

1788
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,360
Oh, wait.

1789
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,360
Okay.

1790
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,160
You need to see that one because it has the Rashomon style flashbacks.

1791
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,160
Okay.

1792
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,440
And basically you see the same scene from different perspectives.

1793
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,640
Oh, um, God, who does that a lot in their movies?

1794
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,200
God, that's like a Tarantino thing actually, Pulp Fiction was kind of that.

1795
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:22,320
No, but this is like exactly the same moment from different perspectives.

1796
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,720
So you have, you'll have to see it, but basically the entirety, I believe it was Rashomon that

1797
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,720
was told that way.

1798
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
It's Kurosawa.

1799
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,720
I mean...

1800
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,720
Who's that famous director?

1801
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,480
I think, um, um, his first movie was Phantom of the Paradise.

1802
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,960
That's how all the cult movie people know him.

1803
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,600
De Palma does that.

1804
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,360
Like he does the split screen thing.

1805
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,360
Like, okay.

1806
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,360
Oh, not the same.

1807
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
Okay.

1808
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,000
It's basically it, it is interjected at different points.

1809
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,320
Now I think all of Rashomon was told this way where you have everybody at the same event

1810
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,920
that different their own perspective on it, but this comes in at key points in the movie

1811
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,260
as it pushes the narrative, as you get more story and perspective on it, but it's still

1812
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,440
exactly the same scene.

1813
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:05,880
So, but yeah, there's lots of wonderful, wonderful, um, just different.

1814
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,680
And cinematic quotes, I like to call them, you know, in art, when you see someone refer

1815
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:14,600
to the same art style as someone else or something from another painting, it's called a quote.

1816
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,040
These are definitely quotes back to, you know, other theatrical grades.

1817
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,440
Can I do a really random thing?

1818
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,440
Cause you talked about art.

1819
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,560
Can I do a really random thing?

1820
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,320
Cause this is something like I should have done like six months ago on Twitch.

1821
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,320
This is going to be a Twitch thing.

1822
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,320
Okay.

1823
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,400
And I apologize to the podcast listeners for this, but this is very important.

1824
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,120
Can you help me fill time here while I go grab something?

1825
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,120
Um, sure.

1826
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:38,600
I'm just making sure that it is the story that I'm thinking of, that it is Rashomon.

1827
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,640
Um, that's the short story I'm looking for the movie.

1828
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,960
Um, but yeah, the, uh, the movie Rashomon, yeah, that's the one I think is the, uh, the

1829
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,840
one where they tell it a different, yeah, different, uh, levels of the story.

1830
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,240
And it's another one with Mihone in it, so.

1831
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:00,880
So since you brought up art, I've never been able to show this and I'm so happy I can now.

1832
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,960
This is an example, this is one of my mom's paintings.

1833
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,160
And so we have a whole collection of paintings.

1834
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,160
No, this is a good, this is fine.

1835
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,160
This is fine.

1836
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:14,360
Uh, there's a whole collection of paintings that she made, um, before she passed, you

1837
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,240
know, cause she was a painter like her whole life.

1838
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:20,600
So I've never been able to show these on the show before and I just thought I would now

1839
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,960
that we're on Twitch.

1840
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,960
So what's that?

1841
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,960
Nothing.

1842
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,960
Oh yeah.

1843
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,760
So anyway, I just thought I would, uh, show that.

1844
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,720
And I love this painting too cause it's cats.

1845
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,920
And so she made this with me and mine just so we're clear.

1846
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,320
I like the penguin one.

1847
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,280
Yes, there's a pink one that's hung up in the hall though, so I can't exactly take that

1848
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,360
one down.

1849
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,960
And for those who don't know, by the way, what Russian one is, there is what the poster

1850
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:41,960
looks like.

1851
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:49,280
So anyway, but yeah, I, that's been the big kind of nerdy thing for me enjoying the, um,

1852
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:55,760
the movies though, is that there really are some wonderful callbacks to just really beautiful

1853
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,840
movies and just the storytelling.

1854
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,800
I'm super happy with it, but just like, you know, you were mentioning the one throwback

1855
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:08,000
for North by Northwest, which I do believe that the titles for North by Northwest were

1856
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,680
done by Saul Bass.

1857
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,440
Let me double check, which is everyone know he's one of my heroes.

1858
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,680
Yeah, I think it was Saul Bass.

1859
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,680
Yup.

1860
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:24,400
It was Saul Bass who also did the man with golden arm and a man with the silver arm,

1861
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,680
sorry, and, uh, Vertigo.

1862
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,720
And he directed the shower scene in Psycho and actually when it came out that he did

1863
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,440
Hitchcock said he would never talk to him again.

1864
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Anyway.

1865
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,520
Uh, anyways, yeah, we, we, uh, before we move on to the next gaming story, anything Star

1866
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,320
Wars related that anyone wants to get out about everything around this celebration.

1867
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,320
I'm looking for it in the movie.

1868
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,040
Yeah, the movie very much because the last two movies are kind of, but the new movie

1869
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,040
looks awesome.

1870
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,040
The movies were great.

1871
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,640
Wait, when we say the last two movies, do we mean spinoffs or do we mean seven and eight,

1872
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,640
seven, eight?

1873
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,640
Okay.

1874
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,640
Cause there were no prequels.

1875
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,680
So basically remakes of the first two original.

1876
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,680
No.

1877
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,880
Well, I, people, people have their different opinions, so we'll see.

1878
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,800
I still haven't seen eight, but I liked seven.

1879
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,960
I did definitely see the parallels to the original in seven, but I still really liked

1880
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,040
seven for what it was, for what it's worth.

1881
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,140
Um, I will say the thing that definitely has my attention, that's kind of tangential to

1882
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:21,720
Star Wars, this whole Disney plus and their competitor to Netflix.

1883
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:26,600
Like it seems like Disney is like ready to come out the gate with this Disney plus thing

1884
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,120
it's pretty loaded with stuff.

1885
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:33,000
I got to say, I'm not looking forward to having yet another subscription, but I have a weird

1886
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,960
feeling that the marketplace is going to force some of these things to consolidate before

1887
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,080
too long.

1888
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,240
Just like Spotify and Hulu have kind of joined forces here.

1889
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,680
I think you're going to start to see more of that stuff show up.

1890
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,280
I'm looking forward to Hawkeye series.

1891
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,280
Oh yeah.

1892
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,680
Cause that's a Disney thing, huh?

1893
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
Yeah.

1894
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:53,120
Well it's Marvel, but, um, but it's going to be taking, um, it said that like one of

1895
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,640
my favorite comic characters who was like the girl who took over as Hawkeye while he

1896
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:00,040
was dead in the comics, Kate Bishop, she's supposed to be in it too.

1897
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,040
So that'd be really awesome.

1898
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,040
All right.

1899
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,160
Well meanwhile, we'll also look forward to whatever Lucasville's games is working on

1900
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,920
because that was a story a couple of weeks ago that Lucasville's games apparently making

1901
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,920
the comeback.

1902
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:09,920
All right.

1903
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,920
Well, anyhow, let's move on.

1904
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,040
We have a couple more stories before we get to our classic segment of the week or is it

1905
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,400
month this week?

1906
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,400
Uh, Loki.

1907
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,400
Yeah.

1908
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,600
So there's a rumor that the next, uh, Assassin's Creed game has been teased in the division

1909
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,780
two.

1910
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:29,940
Apparently there's a poster that can be found inside the Potomac events center.

1911
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:36,480
And one of those shows the title Valhalla, which of course, uh, features kind of a Viking

1912
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,520
character in there.

1913
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,660
They are saying that the Viking appears to be grasping the apple of Eden, which they

1914
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:51,620
says the main plot device, and that, uh, apparently the following, um, or following Assassin's

1915
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,300
Creed Odyssey, the next game is going to be set in the Viking age.

1916
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,700
I think it's just kind of a guess, but maybe, I mean, it seems plausible since they were

1917
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:03,500
kind of using my word since, since, since, you know, they kind of threw in, I think some

1918
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,860
like Greek mythology stuff with the last one.

1919
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,860
So why not?

1920
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:12,300
It fits the Assassin's Creed kind of M O and Vikings is not something they've explored

1921
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,300
yet.

1922
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,300
Right.

1923
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,300
We haven't had a game in that.

1924
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,860
So it fits the, the, the mold, let's say, and would, I think it's something people would

1925
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:19,860
be interested in.

1926
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:23,700
I know that even though I'm not super into the Assassin's Creed games, I know that what

1927
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,260
I want to happen, if this is the direction for Assassin's Creed, is that if my character

1928
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:31,140
gets defeated in Assassin's Creed, I want to have a Viking funeral.

1929
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,860
I think that would be fantastic.

1930
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:37,060
So I hope that plea, as long as a Viking funeral, which, you know, of course is when they put

1931
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,740
you on a boat, say you have to see, and then light the boat on fire where they're shooting

1932
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:40,980
all the arrows at it.

1933
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,740
That is what I hope to see reflected in this game.

1934
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:44,740
Okay.

1935
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,220
Well, you don't want to see a Viking funeral?

1936
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,220
No.

1937
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:50,900
I know someone who did that for their cat.

1938
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,580
That's kind of, I don't know.

1939
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,580
I don't know.

1940
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,580
It's weird.

1941
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:56,820
It's a little, I guess if that's what helped them through it, that was also a Norwegian

1942
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,820
forest cat.

1943
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:58,820
Oh, okay.

1944
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,260
So there's a reason for it.

1945
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,260
Yeah.

1946
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,260
Interesting.

1947
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,260
Okay.

1948
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,260
All right.

1949
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:05,260
Uh, all right.

1950
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,260
I just like sitting cats on fire.

1951
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,260
So I know their cat was dead.

1952
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,260
That was already deceased.

1953
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,140
Didn't say the cat wasn't alive.

1954
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,420
Right.

1955
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,700
One more completely different topic here.

1956
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:19,740
Before we get to the classic game segment, actually, um, I think it would be appropriate

1957
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,200
to talk about this service.

1958
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,740
This was something that was brought to my attention completely on our discord.

1959
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:28,640
I had no idea that this was a thing that was going on, but then dark Tetsuya I think, or,

1960
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:32,540
you know, the topic came up in our discord server, which if you're not on our discord

1961
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,500
survey, you should think about joining it.

1962
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:39,180
Gog network.com slash discord is the only URL you need to get an invite right on into

1963
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,180
the server.

1964
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,900
And I would certainly encourage you to join that cause that's how you can call into the

1965
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,220
show later as well.

1966
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:48,820
But um, anyway, the story was posting the orange launch radio channel is that we, and

1967
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:52,680
we've been talking about this just as recently as like last week, like whatever happened

1968
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:58,140
to services like game tap and the classic games and why, why isn't somebody taking the

1969
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:00,980
advantage to do a streaming service for classic games?

1970
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,780
Well, how about this?

1971
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:06,700
It's apparently one has been being developed for a little while and they just went on a

1972
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,260
Kickstarter this week.

1973
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:14,220
So, but in usually I wouldn't talk about Kickstarter things, but in kind of reading the website

1974
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:19,740
in reading their pitch on Kickstarter, I kind of got the impression of we're doing this,

1975
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:22,580
whether this Kickstarter succeeds or not.

1976
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,180
This Kickstarter just seems to be a way to offer these kinds of earlier perks and maybe

1977
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:29,620
get the word out, which I guess, you know, successful cause here we are talking about

1978
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:33,820
on our show when I guess this has been a thing that's been in development for a while

1979
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,640
and I had like no idea.

1980
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,660
So the service is called ant stream.

1981
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,980
I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but I think the logo is really cute cause

1982
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,580
it looks like a little ant or whatever.

1983
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:47,260
They are saying that ant stream will have a beta launch on mobile devices.

1984
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:51,260
So iOS and Android, PC and Xbox one.

1985
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:55,200
And the early backers are set to get in in early may, which I guess is probably when

1986
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,580
this Kickstarter is about to finish up.

1987
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:01,340
Cause I think the Kickstarter has got about 25 days left on it.

1988
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:06,020
And so when it goes into beta, you are going to be able to play curated titles from the

1989
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,980
seventies, eighties and nineties.

1990
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:14,900
They are mentioning titles like Akari Warriors, Joe and Mac, California Games, Zool and Double

1991
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,260
Dragon.

1992
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,740
It was pointed out that a couple of weeks ago, one of the parody intros we had here

1993
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:26,860
at OLR, we had the epics game store, the EPYX game store, because it was a play on

1994
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:33,500
me always talking about EPIC apostrophe S when really the story is called the epic game

1995
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,500
store.

1996
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,580
And so you're not supposed to call it epics game store cause it sounds like the old company

1997
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:44,980
from the eighties, but ironically that epics, the EPYX looks to be a company that is partnered

1998
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:48,340
on this service because you go look at the games list, which they're showing off what

1999
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,900
400 games, right?

2000
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:54,620
And epics games are all over this list and it's very similar to the type of stuff you'd

2001
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,380
see like on the mini Commodore 64 and some of these other places right now, but it's

2002
01:25:58,380 --> 01:25:59,380
not just limited to that.

2003
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,380
Right.

2004
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:03,820
It looks like they've got, you know, like Akari Warriors would be like Data East appears

2005
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:04,820
to be on this.

2006
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:09,280
A lot of these SNK, Codemasters, a lot of these retro friendly companies you've seen

2007
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,100
in other places too, but with their really old stuff.

2008
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:17,460
So I mean, certainly there's that question that's going to be asked, well, why not just,

2009
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:19,180
why not just use emulators?

2010
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,180
Right?

2011
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:26,100
Well, and I, I even called this out as one reason I liked to play on GameTap was they

2012
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:30,460
had the additional features like the replays, like the high scores so I could compete with

2013
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,760
my friends.

2014
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:37,640
And so that's why like this caught my eye and Stream will be having unique multiplayer

2015
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,640
challenges.

2016
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:45,740
So it will put twists on some of the games like score attacks, speed runs and boss rushes.

2017
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:50,260
So there's a whole spiel you can check out over on their Kickstarter, which if you just

2018
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:55,060
start for Antstream or go to antstream.com, I really want to invite them on the show.

2019
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:58,580
I'll probably do that in the coming weeks here since they got a Kickstarter going on

2020
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,580
anyway.

2021
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:04,300
Cause I just like, it's funny because I feel like I S I said this out loud, like one or

2022
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:09,100
two weeks ago, not obviously I didn't invent this has been in works for years, but I think

2023
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:12,420
it's just funny that like, this is relevant.

2024
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,720
Like I was asking for something like this and here it is.

2025
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,400
And I got to say, it looks pretty, pretty cool.

2026
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:22,560
I mean, there, I think like the early fee, like if you get in early, you can like have

2027
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:27,280
your rate frozen at like six, I think $60 a year was like a rate you can get frozen

2028
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,280
out.

2029
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,680
I think they said they were going to ask for $10 a month for it.

2030
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:35,480
I'm worried that might be a little high for some people for retro games, but I mean, if

2031
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:40,880
they're talking like a library of 4,000 games that were, it, it might be kind of worth it,

2032
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,800
especially if these multiplayer challenges are really good.

2033
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,040
Like I really want to see the implementation of this.

2034
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:51,920
Unfortunately, that's the one thing that Kickstarter's not really showing is, but I, you know, and

2035
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,680
they're about two thirds of the way to their goal already with, yeah, they're probably

2036
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,640
going to make their goal, honestly.

2037
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:01,200
So I'm curious, I got to say, you know, I'm a sucker for retro games.

2038
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,760
I love that, like as a retro game enthusiast and somebody who would like stream them a

2039
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,860
lot, like, because I like to stream games like this would open up a whole new, like

2040
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,560
zillions of games to stream.

2041
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,840
So I do want to see something like this succeed.

2042
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,520
I hope, I hope it is really going to be worth that price that I'm going to be really surprised

2043
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,440
there, but I'll probably sign onto the Kickstarter.

2044
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,440
We'll see.

2045
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,440
So it looks pretty neat.

2046
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:31,480
So it says they're fixed price for Antstream is that's if you pledge 55 Euro is $70 a year

2047
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,480
for it.

2048
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,240
Yeah, there's, there's weird because they're based in the UK.

2049
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,760
So you have to, there's some money conversion things going on.

2050
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,120
It's something like if you put down like $120, you get two years because that's actually

2051
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,760
the two years and $60.

2052
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,580
And then you get $60 frozen beyond that, I think.

2053
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:49,760
So it's kind of interesting.

2054
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,160
So I'm, I'm curious, was there early backers already gone?

2055
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,920
Cause I was looking at doing that and I got lazy and didn't do it.

2056
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,380
And of course it's already gone.

2057
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,480
So I mean, that's, that's good for them though.

2058
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,480
So we'll see.

2059
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,400
Like I said, I really want to try and invite them on the show to later date because I hope

2060
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,400
maybe they'll go so far as to be like a virtual museum.

2061
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:11,200
Wouldn't it be really cool if like, not only do they have the games, but maybe they have

2062
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,520
interviews with some of these game makers talking about the games.

2063
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,960
Like think about like commentary tracks or something, because let's be real, the people

2064
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,300
who made these games in the eighties and nineties, they're getting older.

2065
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:23,140
Some of them are no longer with us.

2066
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,800
And you know, as people get older, that's going to continue to be the case.

2067
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,520
They can't have an interface where I can put arcade cabinets and arrange them in certain

2068
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,520
ways.

2069
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,640
And, Oh, you take your tongue in cheek reference to game room.

2070
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:34,640
Yeah.

2071
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,640
I'd love that.

2072
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,880
I'll take what I can get.

2073
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,320
I kind of think that's all secondary.

2074
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,040
So yeah.

2075
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:44,880
Some folks in chat, S.H.O. 100 Matt saying, like what game room could have been.

2076
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,880
Yeah.

2077
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,880
Let's see.

2078
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,760
Dartitsuya says, yeah, I'm definitely getting a game tap vibe from the service.

2079
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,200
I'm very interested to see how they do.

2080
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,280
That's what I thought of when I saw some of those games on the list.

2081
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:59,000
I think that was a reference to when we had the Epic store, tongue in cheek joke, who

2082
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,440
knew that that may actually become a reality of sorts after this.

2083
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:09,160
So Metal Mayhem says, yeah, I missed out on the game tap era, but I know you were there

2084
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:13,080
for Microsoft's game room era because Kaijuto is asking, what's game room?

2085
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,800
It was a Microsoft thing that they kind of tried to do with the classic gaming.

2086
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,400
But I feel like they let it, they pulled the plug on it before it had time to really grow.

2087
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,400
Yeah.

2088
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,400
That's unfortunate.

2089
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,400
So anyway.

2090
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,400
All right.

2091
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,400
Let's move on.

2092
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,880
Speaking of classic stuff every week here on the show, we like to step into the gaming

2093
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:32,920
vault and find a classic game that, Hey, you guys should be checking this game out and

2094
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,720
show it a little bit of love this week.

2095
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,940
But in the 2019 twist, we like to do things a little differently.

2096
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:43,720
So once a month, Dark Sakura picks out a classic soundtrack.

2097
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:48,400
So the classic soundtrack of the month is what we're going to be discussing this week.

2098
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:52,520
And you said the theme for 2019 is going to be all NES or 8-bit games, right?

2099
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,520
All right.

2100
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,320
So what 8-bit game did you pick this week?

2101
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,560
I picked Jackal, which I've covered before for classic game, but my focus is of course

2102
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:06,300
the soundtrack, this music.

2103
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:10,760
And I should point out that the video is not synced with the audio we did replace so that

2104
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,920
I took, I stripped the game noise.

2105
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,360
Although it was actually pretty close.

2106
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,840
Yeah, it is pretty close.

2107
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,640
But this is like some of my favorite 8-bit gaming music ever.

2108
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:24,880
It was just that era of delicious Konami music, you know, but this was even better than some

2109
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,480
of the other stuff that was out at the time.

2110
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,760
Didn't we ever get a remix of this and like Beat Mania or anything?

2111
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,400
It's really like a missed opportunity.

2112
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,400
Bummer.

2113
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:40,720
But anyway, it was, the sound designer for this was Atsushi Fujio.

2114
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,880
He worked on many Konami titles in the late 80s.

2115
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,280
He's actually, I think still doing music to this day.

2116
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:56,240
But as far as other games that he worked on, I'm trying to pick like, well, I brought this

2117
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:00,620
came up before YY World for Super Famicom.

2118
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:09,620
He did Jyris for the Famicom Disk System, Blades of Steel, Jyris for NES itself, Twin

2119
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,520
Bee 3, Poco Poco Daimaou.

2120
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,640
I love the Jyris soundtrack, even though it really just is like classic songs.

2121
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:24,320
You May Penguin, Monogatari, Konami Hyper Soccer, I'm trying to think of things, Bucky O'Hare,

2122
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,080
Hunter 3, The Alien Wars, he was a sound programmer.

2123
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,240
He did sound programming for Axlay.

2124
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:35,320
He did the same for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtle Tournament Fighters.

2125
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,920
Sorry, words are weird today.

2126
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,740
He also did the music for Double Dribble.

2127
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:45,480
And he was a consultant on Snatcher, Rob.

2128
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,480
Nice.

2129
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,940
But at any rate, this is just a good soundtrack.

2130
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:55,860
I played a fuck ton of this game when I was a kid, every time I was in Dothan, and I always

2131
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:59,300
wanted my own copy, and I didn't get it until I was an adult.

2132
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:04,220
But just the music was just, I thought, really solid.

2133
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:09,620
It actually was, some people would say it was kind of generic for like the whole army,

2134
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:15,140
war, you know, military game, but I really did think that it was actually a very fitting

2135
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:20,620
soundtrack and it wasn't just, I think, more of the same how a lot of the other games of

2136
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,620
its type were.

2137
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:24,420
And on top of that, Jackal is just a really unique and good game.

2138
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,700
So there you go.

2139
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:31,020
Yeah, I remember playing this game on Commodore 64.

2140
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:33,180
I don't think, was the soundtrack the same?

2141
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:34,180
I don't think it was.

2142
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,180
I don't think so.

2143
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:39,700
But I remember, like at the time, this whole like driving a jeep around like a much larger

2144
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:43,380
map that kind of scrolled in different ways than what we were used to, like that was a

2145
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,740
very kind of like novel thing.

2146
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:51,780
Well, this game was also originally designed to use rotary joysticks, like in the SNK games,

2147
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:58,220
like Ikari Warriors, but they ended up doing this one out for a joystick, I think because

2148
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:04,380
of like cost, but it also, you know, it changed the way that the tactics were going to work

2149
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:05,380
on this game.

2150
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:06,380
It is a very solid game.

2151
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:09,860
And of course, the music is just not even annoying at all.

2152
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,940
It's just really good.

2153
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:12,340
So there you go.

2154
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,340
All right.

2155
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:15,860
I would love for this in the chat room as well.

2156
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:19,940
Some folks saying, let's see, Metal Mayhem says Jackal was one of those Konami NES games

2157
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:20,940
I saw advertised.

2158
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,140
I won it on the NES.

2159
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:25,660
The only time I ever got to play it was on Game Room, the arcade version, I think was

2160
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:26,660
there.

2161
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:29,460
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, my brother and I played the hell out of this, so much better

2162
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:30,460
with two players.

2163
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,100
I played this with my papa.

2164
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,420
Oh, love that.

2165
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:35,860
Dr. Seuss says, I do have the cart of this.

2166
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:37,340
Still haven't beaten it, though.

2167
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:41,100
And Quest Buster says the music- You haven't beaten it?

2168
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,660
No day like today.

2169
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:46,060
Quest Buster says the music in Jackal was one of the reasons I kept coming back to the

2170
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:47,060
game.

2171
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,060
Yeah.

2172
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:54,340
And it's all just that intro music where it has the build up and then, you know, it goes

2173
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,340
right into it.

2174
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,340
Let me play it.

2175
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,340
Wait, if I restart the thingy, hold on.

2176
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:01,340
If I go back to us in the studio and then I go and I hit the button to start the video

2177
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,340
again.

2178
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:03,340
Yeah.

2179
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:07,060
You can hear this opening music again.

2180
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:10,180
Yeah.

2181
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,540
But the little bit of a key change between the two.

2182
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,540
Yeah.

2183
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:17,580
Just really with the pause and then a key change, I was like, that's really, I mean,

2184
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:20,700
coming from a musical point of view, I know it's a fucking video game, but it is really

2185
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:21,700
dynamic.

2186
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:26,580
But back in the day, in the 80s with games like this, you know, when sometimes you play

2187
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:31,820
the game just to hear the songs because there wasn't the YouTube, MP3s, OC Remix wasn't

2188
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:32,820
made yet.

2189
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:37,820
You know, you had to go to the game, you had to put the game in and listen to the music.

2190
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:42,700
And sometimes that's how you rediscovered a game that you may not have really played

2191
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:43,700
the first time.

2192
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:46,300
I was telling Dan last night, just, you know, when I was thinking, what should I do?

2193
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:47,300
What should I do?

2194
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,420
And then I picked the music.

2195
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:52,660
I was like, man, I feel fucking heroic.

2196
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:53,660
As you should.

2197
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:54,660
Yeah.

2198
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,660
As you should.

2199
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,660
All right.

2200
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:57,660
There it is.

2201
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:58,660
Your classic soundtrack of the month.

2202
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,420
Jackal on the NES specifically.

2203
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:02,040
And just a point of order.

2204
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,540
We may see something on a different system next month.

2205
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:05,540
Ooh.

2206
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:06,540
Okay.

2207
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:07,540
It's gotta be an 8-bit.

2208
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:09,260
Well, gee, I wonder what it could be.

2209
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,260
We'll see, though.

2210
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:11,260
We'll see.

2211
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:12,260
All right.

2212
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,900
What could it, could it be when you put two 8-bits together to make a faux 16-bit?

2213
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,500
Because there was one console that did do that.

2214
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,420
I'm not going to talk about the PC Engine.

2215
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:20,420
All right.

2216
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,420
Fine.

2217
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:24,500
But, but, um, I'll just put it this way.

2218
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,900
Um, there may be some Sega love coming next.

2219
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:27,900
All right.

2220
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,740
Gee, I would never have guessed.

2221
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,980
Or it could also be Atari.

2222
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:32,980
Okay.

2223
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:33,980
Oh, true.

2224
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:34,980
True.

2225
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:35,980
It could.

2226
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:36,980
The 7200.

2227
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:38,420
Old school stuff.

2228
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:41,220
You know that arcade collection is coming out very soon.

2229
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:42,780
So I'll be very curious.

2230
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:46,660
Even though, um, you know, some of the games, like Haunted Castle was kind of like the arcade

2231
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:52,220
version of Castlevania, but the, the gag is it's not that good unless they put, they may

2232
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,380
have put cheats in it.

2233
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:57,700
I bet they did, uh, on the Switch version so that you can just keep plunking in quarters.

2234
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,060
You know, probably get further in the game than you ever did before.

2235
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,420
Um, but it'd be interesting.

2236
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:02,820
I don't know if Jackal was into it though.

2237
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:06,620
I don't think Jackal's in it, but, um, I didn't remember seeing, I don't think Jackal was

2238
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,100
on the list, but, uh, yeah, I know that's coming out very soon.

2239
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,820
So some folks will be, uh, taking a look at that pretty soon.

2240
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:12,820
All right.

2241
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:17,420
Anyhow, uh, we're going to do a little prerecorded segment that I did earlier today about another

2242
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,420
just recorded.

2243
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:19,420
A what?

2244
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,980
So it's just recorded.

2245
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:21,980
Yes.

2246
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:26,300
A recorded segment from earlier today, uh, on another news item this week.

2247
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,300
So let's go to that.

2248
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,300
All right.

2249
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,780
Hello everybody from the office studio.

2250
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:34,460
And I thought for a little middle of the show break this week, we could take a look again

2251
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,340
at the switch online, uh, and the classic NES library.

2252
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,820
But this time, you know, I know that last week we looked a lot at the comparisons between

2253
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:43,900
the American and the Japanese versions of the service, but this week I want to take

2254
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:46,280
a look at some of the new offerings in the service.

2255
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:50,080
So, uh, as you guys know, there was some new stuff that was added, including a special

2256
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:56,740
version of kid Icarus, as well as punch out star soldier and super Mario, the loss levels,

2257
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:59,920
which of course is super Mario brothers two in Japan.

2258
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,500
So what I want to kind of focus on during the break, uh, this week is I want to take

2259
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:07,420
a look at these special versions that have been added to the service.

2260
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:11,580
You know, it's kind of interesting as this trend that Nintendo has been doing with the

2261
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:15,740
classic library is that it seems like every time they release new games, they've been

2262
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:20,300
doing like a throwback to one of the harder games from the previous month, allowing you

2263
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:26,060
to take it on in a whole new way, perhaps, um, actually, uh, starting with full life

2264
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:30,640
or full coins or, uh, starting on the very last level of the game, which is the case

2265
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,520
with the kid Icarus release this week.

2266
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,480
But if you actually look at, you know, the details, they try to give it like this fancy

2267
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:40,480
little name, like, Ooh, you're playing the three sacred treasures level and you know,

2268
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,560
you're not really finished.

2269
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:45,840
And it's basically a fancy way of saying we're starting you at the end of the game with all

2270
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,060
the items and full life and everything.

2271
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,060
So let's actually take a look.

2272
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:50,060
I'm going to load it up.

2273
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:54,380
And the interesting thing about kid Icarus specifically was that the very last stage

2274
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:59,980
of the game, stage four, one was very different from any other level in the game.

2275
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:02,480
There was really no other level like it.

2276
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:08,420
Not so ever, um, it plays more like a shooter game, whereas of course the first few stages

2277
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:14,980
of the game is a platformer and, uh, uh, dungeon stages are also there and yeah, it's just

2278
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:17,440
a very different type of game.

2279
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:21,940
So obviously we're flying through and you notice pit looks very different now because

2280
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:25,240
the story with the game has him collecting the treasures in the various dungeons.

2281
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:29,420
So he has the wings, he has the special arrow, he has the shield, so that's why he looks

2282
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:30,640
a lot different.

2283
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:35,700
So we're obviously flying through here to make our way to Medusa who, spoiler alert,

2284
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:39,840
is the final boss of the game, but I'm sure you all already knew that.

2285
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:45,300
It's interesting too because I haven't played this in a long time, the American release,

2286
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:46,560
but I've played the Japanese.

2287
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,000
It's funny cause I have to throw back a little bit to last week.

2288
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I did play the Japanese release of this earlier and believe it or not, it's different.

2289
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,580
Like you actually use one of the buttons to fly and I seem to remember you walk on this

2290
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:04,460
part, you can't fly underneath this brick like you can in this version.

2291
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:09,760
So the American version apparently lets you fly through walls and that's something new

2292
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,100
and you just use the control pad to move wherever you want.

2293
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:16,380
That's a very interesting, a little difference I'm noticing right off the bat besides just

2294
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,380
all those sound differences we were noting last week.

2295
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,580
Well, this stage isn't very long.

2296
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,940
Once you get to the green brick, guess what?

2297
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,460
You are about to the Medusa fight.

2298
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:30,940
I think we just have to get through a few more mobs.

2299
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:32,380
Shoot my way through.

2300
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:36,460
Yeah, it's like a shooter, but it's not like, you know, for as hard as this game is, it's

2301
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,940
not exactly like cuphead level shooting.

2302
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:42,920
I mean, sure, I've lost a little bit of health and been hit a few times so far, but it's

2303
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,540
not like, you know, I'm not like super dying or anything.

2304
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:48,980
All right.

2305
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:50,780
This level is longer than I remember.

2306
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:54,380
Maybe the American version is longer too, I don't remember.

2307
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:58,980
I played the Japanese one earlier this week when it was first released.

2308
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:02,040
Just because I wanted to hear the little subtle differences in the music that we talked about

2309
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,040
last week.

2310
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:08,140
But obviously, Kid Icarus is not the only game that's had an SP release.

2311
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:11,980
I know like Legend of Zelda, I did a stream on my personal channel once when that came

2312
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:12,980
out.

2313
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:17,340
They had a version that started you with all the rupees and heart containers and everything

2314
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:18,420
else that you can get.

2315
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:20,580
I swear this thing just looped me through the level twice.

2316
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:22,100
Isn't that what it looks like?

2317
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:23,500
I just looped through the level twice.

2318
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:25,620
I think I did.

2319
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:29,140
Maybe that's how they made it more difficult.

2320
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,140
You thought this was easy?

2321
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:31,140
Well, ah!

2322
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,140
Do it again.

2323
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:33,140
All right.

2324
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:38,060
Well, maybe this time when we get to the green brick, we'll be able to fight Medusa.

2325
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,140
You know, the other interesting thing, though, even though it looks like I'm really close

2326
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:43,900
to dying, well, not only do I start with full hearts, so picking up the additional hearts

2327
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,080
really isn't doing me any good, but if you look at the special items, you'll notice I

2328
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,980
have like eight life restoration items.

2329
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:55,140
So even if I were to lose all my health, which unfortunately seems very likely at this point,

2330
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:58,360
it's okay because my health is going to refill automatically.

2331
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,460
So it makes it very hard to die.

2332
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:06,320
So even if like you sucked at Kid Icarus as a kid, now's your chance to be a winner, which

2333
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:10,420
hopefully I will get the chance here shortly without this middle point segment going on

2334
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,660
for 20 minutes.

2335
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:19,020
Pretty sure maybe there's something special I have to do to trigger the Medusa phase.

2336
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,860
I don't remember.

2337
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:21,860
I don't think so.

2338
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:22,860
I've got full hearts.

2339
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,020
What else could I possibly need?

2340
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:27,820
All right.

2341
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:34,020
Oh, my God, are we living through it again?

2342
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,140
We might be if that green brick goes away.

2343
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,660
Oh, no, it just looks.

2344
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,660
There we go.

2345
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:41,660
There we go.

2346
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:42,660
Okay.

2347
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,660
Now, yeah, suspenseful music change.

2348
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:44,660
Here we go.

2349
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,120
All right.

2350
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:52,440
So obviously I want to dodge that dragon, which I'm getting hit with a bunch.

2351
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:56,340
You can deflect those little beams that are coming with the mirror.

2352
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,480
So as long as but you'll notice the shield goes down for a minute when you shoot the

2353
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:01,480
arrows.

2354
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:07,740
I'm having a really hard time facing forward.

2355
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:12,240
This is probably part of my issue of using the control pro controller.

2356
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:21,280
So I'm just going through those extra health like it's nobody's business.

2357
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:25,920
Hopefully I'll be able to kill Medusa.

2358
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:33,920
Oh, my gosh, I think that's one of the downfalls of using the pro controller is that, oh, look

2359
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,920
at that.

2360
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:35,920
I found that sweet spot.

2361
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,920
There it is.

2362
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:38,920
That's right.

2363
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,120
I remember that being a thing now is that there's like a sweet spot.

2364
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:42,280
There you go.

2365
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:45,320
And there's Palutena.

2366
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:46,320
I think.

2367
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,120
So that's supposed to be coming out of the eye.

2368
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,120
We did it.

2369
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,120
We beat it.

2370
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,120
Yay.

2371
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,120
Hooray.

2372
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,120
There it is.

2373
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,120
The ending screen.

2374
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:59,400
And I didn't have any help whatsoever.

2375
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,400
And he transforms.

2376
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,720
Again, interesting because this is very different from the Japanese version now that that's

2377
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,720
recent in my head.

2378
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,680
Oh, no, they didn't hug in the Japanese.

2379
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,480
Oh, that was a little kiss.

2380
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,520
All this blue scenery and everything.

2381
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,800
This is not in the Japanese version.

2382
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,680
It's just a black screen, but it has more writing.

2383
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,160
And then it says Fiin at the bottom.

2384
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:22,040
And I imagine this is the translation of the writing, which is Medusa was destroyed in

2385
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,480
the light of peace.

2386
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,480
Return to Angel.

2387
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,480
I didn't read fast enough.

2388
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,080
I need to be a speed reader, clearly.

2389
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:31,280
And we get the staff role, which again, not present in the Japanese version.

2390
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,480
So I guess this did end up being a comparison video of sorts as well.

2391
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,120
But it makes it a lot easier to see things later in the game.

2392
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,640
Thanks to these special SP versions.

2393
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,120
So I'm curious, are you guys checking out these SP versions?

2394
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,800
Those of you that have Nintendo online?

2395
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,280
Like are you using this to see parts of the game that you couldn't get to as a kid?

2396
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,020
Now, I did beat Kid Icarus as a kid.

2397
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:57,000
I may have had some help from maps in Nintendo Power or whatever magazines are out at the

2398
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,160
time that helped me get through like the third dungeon and all that stuff.

2399
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,560
But I did beat it.

2400
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,020
But things like, I don't know, like Ghosts and Goblins and some of these other games,

2401
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:09,740
like I would never see these end segments of the game if it weren't for the SP versions.

2402
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:14,500
So I'm curious if you guys are checking them out or if, you know, you're like, eh, I don't

2403
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,140
want to see it on easy mode.

2404
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,140
No.

2405
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:19,260
Anyway, that's my question to you guys.

2406
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:20,500
And I think that's it for now.

2407
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:27,380
So we'll end on that lovely note where the hero, the hero is you and copyright 1986 Nintendo.

2408
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:28,380
That's it.

2409
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,600
We're going to go back to the studio.

2410
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,820
See ya.

2411
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:38,660
Thank you, me, for that lovely segment on the SP version of Kid Icarus, which was released

2412
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:43,900
into the Nintendo online library on Switch in this past week.

2413
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:47,300
Have you guys or you guys don't really do a lot of the Switch Nintendo library?

2414
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,500
I don't play that often.

2415
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:49,780
Yeah, it's not really.

2416
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,780
Yeah.

2417
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:52,780
I kind of check out the SP stuff once in a while.

2418
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:55,980
Well, especially kind of like I was saying there, the ghosts and goblins, but like things

2419
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:58,640
like I just I never was going to see otherwise.

2420
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:00,880
The Kid Icarus thing, again, humble brag.

2421
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,300
I saw that already when I was a kid, but also, I mean, all humble bragging aside, and I forgot

2422
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,320
to talk about it in the video.

2423
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,640
There was also pass codes we would always use, right?

2424
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:15,320
Like I was it like Icarus fights, Medusa, terror, danger, horror, exclamation point.

2425
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,320
Yeah.

2426
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,900
So there were little codes you could use that would also get you a little further along

2427
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,720
in the game to see that level.

2428
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,720
But now who needs codes anymore?

2429
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:23,720
You have SP versions.

2430
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:26,360
We could sell you those codes for cheap.

2431
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:30,560
Well, at least Nintendo is not selling those as well, unless you consider the price of

2432
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,240
the online subscription, what you're paying.

2433
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:37,880
But I think I let that one slide, considering that's not the only value in their online

2434
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:38,880
subscription.

2435
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,660
So anyway, let's travel around and check out some rapid fire news, some other quick things

2436
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,660
going on in the industry.

2437
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,280
You also have a podcast of the week.

2438
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,280
Oh, yeah, let's do that.

2439
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:50,280
Let's do it by all means, please.

2440
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,920
You have a podcast to plug.

2441
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:52,920
Absolutely.

2442
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:59,760
And then comes courtesy of my friend Grim, who is the one of the creative talents behind

2443
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,720
Voodoo Walrus.

2444
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,320
And check out check it out.

2445
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,360
It's a really funny, cool adventure comic.

2446
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,900
But the podcast is called This Week We're Talking About.

2447
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:13,920
And there are up to 10 episodes from what I can tell so far.

2448
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,080
The last one was on April 4th.

2449
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,560
And they basically just pick a topic and talk about it.

2450
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,820
You know, it's like, oh, but but not.

2451
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:30,820
Not with Katya or Trixie, but like this last episode is a kiss retrospective, 1971 through

2452
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:31,820
1974.

2453
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:36,420
And because Kiss is going to be retiring because it's about time, I'm sure Gene Simmons's tongue

2454
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:40,220
has had so much Botox that it can't move out anymore.

2455
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:43,260
But yeah, check him out.

2456
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,540
Actually the favorite title of all.

2457
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:48,580
Actually, there's two titles I super like.

2458
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:50,380
One of them is episode eight.

2459
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:55,500
We've come to teach you the boundless joys of a life without pants.

2460
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,980
And oh, it actually is creep night and grim on that one.

2461
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:02,700
So and then carbon units are not true life forms.

2462
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:05,660
And it's actually about Star Trek the motion picture.

2463
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:08,640
So go check them out.

2464
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,700
There's only 10 episodes.

2465
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:10,700
You can catch up easy.

2466
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:11,700
All right.

2467
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:12,700
Thank you for that lovely plug.

2468
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:18,380
I had to also plug the shows at vognetwork.com because we have many shows that are part of

2469
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,380
the network.

2470
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,860
All of them broadcast live on Twitch.

2471
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:26,900
A few of them do not, including anime jam session, which is hosted here on Tuesday nights.

2472
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,020
But I will plug, I'm going to plug my own show.

2473
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:34,540
I'm going to plug shaking and crying now, which I do with the lovely Aria snark.

2474
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:40,220
Speaking of Game of Thrones, Aria snark is a cosplayer, but she goes by Victoria in the

2475
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:41,860
real world.

2476
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:46,700
And this week we talked about, well, Victoria did the show high.

2477
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:48,620
So we talked about marijuana.

2478
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:51,220
And we talked about 420 a little bit.

2479
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:52,320
And you know, cause that's coming up.

2480
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:55,100
So we had a very frank conversation on that.

2481
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:56,260
So it was a interesting episode.

2482
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:58,700
Also the first full day of Passover.

2483
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,660
And guess what weed is kosher.

2484
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:02,660
Good to know.

2485
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:03,660
Good to know.

2486
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:04,660
So you can check that out.

2487
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:05,660
Shaking and crying.com.

2488
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:09,540
But that's just going to take you to a little subsection at vognetwork.com.

2489
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,920
Now we can get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

2490
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:19,480
So if you're a fan of old edutainment, and this was probably a little, this was probably

2491
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:23,560
a little after when I was actually playing a lot of those games, but you're probably

2492
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:30,920
familiar with humongous or humongous entertainment and humongous entertainment did such wonderful

2493
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:36,840
series as pajama Sam, Freddy fish, spy Fox, putt putt, et cetera.

2494
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:41,440
Well they have a bundle now on humble bundle and you can get a shit ton of games for very

2495
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,560
little money.

2496
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:46,080
So for a dollar, you get, uh, quite a few.

2497
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:53,040
So big fingers, first grade kindergarten, fatty bears, birthday, surprise, buzzy, the

2498
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:59,960
airport, the farm, the jungle, putt, putt, and pops, uh, balloon, Orama doc on a stick

2499
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:02,080
and activity pack.

2500
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,280
What was that birthday surprise?

2501
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:07,360
That was fatty bears or fatty bears.

2502
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,360
Your dinner.

2503
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:14,600
That sounds like my trip to Chicago last year.

2504
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,600
Let's see where else.

2505
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,540
Uh, and then of course spy Fox and cheese chase.

2506
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:21,020
So all that for $1, not bad.

2507
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:27,200
And then of course, um, if you pay the average price, which now is $11 and 16 cents, but

2508
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,000
of course that changes as people are purchasing the bundle.

2509
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,480
It's spy Fox to, uh, putt putt travels through time.

2510
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:39,760
Freddy fish to pajamas, Sam for pajamas, Sam, lost and found, uh, lots of games basically.

2511
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:44,360
Um, and then of course, $14 or more, um, you get even more games.

2512
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:50,000
So pajamas, Sam, three Freddy fish, five, four spy Fox, three puppet joins the circus.

2513
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,640
There's just a ton of goddamn games in there.

2514
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:58,800
So if you really need to fill your steam library full of humongous games, then go check that

2515
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:03,600
out on humble bundle.com because it's, there's a lot.

2516
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:12,840
And then, um, there was this lawsuit against, um, take two, um, regarding red dead redemption

2517
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:18,380
two, because in the game, of course, there's the Pinkertons, which were kind of this rival

2518
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:19,640
to your gang.

2519
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,960
And apparently the Pinkertons are actually real.

2520
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:26,320
Um, there is this, uh, Pinkerton consulting and investigation.

2521
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:32,420
Uh, they wanted royalties for every time the word Pinkerton was used in the game, but now

2522
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:38,400
they have dropped their lawsuit against take two over their depiction of the Pinkertons.

2523
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:44,840
Also there was the Pinkerton investigation agency in Hong Kong, just saying, so that's

2524
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:45,840
been dropped.

2525
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:52,880
Unfortunately, um, that lawsuit being gone does not make red dead online any better.

2526
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:53,880
Fair enough.

2527
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:57,580
Uh, maybe there'll be online in this game, although this is, um, you know, this is one

2528
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:01,560
of those take it with a grain of salt cause it's not confirmed, but usually the ratings

2529
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,280
boards, when we get leaks from the rating boards, we know there's something coming.

2530
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:08,360
Like those don't tend to be things that lie to us.

2531
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:13,920
So the Australian ratings board just approved something from way forward games, the developers

2532
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,720
behind Shantae, um, and that Shantae you stay.

2533
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,760
I always like, I can't say that game without saying that, uh, way forward did other stuff

2534
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:21,760
too.

2535
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,760
That was really cool.

2536
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:23,760
Did they do blaster master zero?

2537
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:27,040
No, but didn't they do, was it the DuckTales or masters?

2538
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:28,040
Yes.

2539
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:29,040
Yes.

2540
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,040
So they've done some really cool classic remasters.

2541
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:35,200
Well, apparently the game that was rated was called river city girls.

2542
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:41,040
So some people are wondering, is this Kunio kun, which is the river city ransom, right?

2543
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:47,320
Those games is that here now that franchise is by arc system works, but they have licensed

2544
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:52,320
that out for other releases like river city ransom underground, which was by a Canadian

2545
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,320
studio.

2546
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:58,600
Did they maybe make like, did way forward maybe make a new river city ransom as game,

2547
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:03,920
but now it's, you know, the twist is it's going to be girl fighters maybe, uh, who knows,

2548
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:04,920
but I'm into it.

2549
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,560
I'm into like river city ransom coming back.

2550
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:11,080
I think that's a fun twist, uh, on the, the franchise, um, beginnings.

2551
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:12,080
So that'd be cool.

2552
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,080
Uh, dark soccer.

2553
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,880
I know you love the Kunio kun type games.

2554
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:16,880
Would you play river city girls?

2555
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,880
I probably would.

2556
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:18,880
Yeah.

2557
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,040
And you know, especially if like the boys are the ones that are working at the cafe

2558
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:25,440
and have to have to smile for free.

2559
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,440
Yeah.

2560
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:29,320
They're like, like they'd be prettier if they smiled more.

2561
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:30,320
Fair enough.

2562
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,000
Why not give everybody a turn?

2563
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,800
Uh, and then that's, that's all I have.

2564
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,400
So dark soccer, what do you have for us rapid fighters?

2565
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:44,240
Well for fans of octopath traveler who don't necessarily have a system to play it on, um,

2566
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:45,320
it's going to be on steam.

2567
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,320
Of course.

2568
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:50,120
Phoenix is going to put it on steam on June 7th.

2569
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:54,640
So keep your eyes open if you sincerely want to play it.

2570
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:00,040
Um, which honestly it's not a bad idea, but I hope that it will, there will be a Mac version

2571
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,040
as well.

2572
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:07,600
Um, and then, um, this one I thought was funny for all of you oculus sisters, there's creepy

2573
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:11,840
messages on your controller, at least a few thousand of them.

2574
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:18,160
Um, so there were, um, you know, different versions that went out for testing, um, different,

2575
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:24,840
uh, but about tens of thousands of oculus touch controllers have creepy privacy related

2576
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:28,960
Easter egg messages written on the internal hardware.

2577
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:34,500
Like one of them says, the masons were here inscribed on a cable, others are big brother

2578
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:35,500
is watching.

2579
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:41,760
Um, you know, and other develop, developers will put jokes in their kits too, but here's

2580
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,760
a few others.

2581
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:46,440
One of them says, uh, this space for rent, the masons were here.

2582
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,600
Big brother is watching.

2583
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,280
Hi, I fix it.

2584
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,160
We see you.

2585
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:56,420
So that they will throw back to pin bot.

2586
01:54:56,420 --> 01:55:00,080
Now I see you.

2587
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:06,960
I can see from bride of him, but, but yeah, but, um, they basically were part of the prototypes

2588
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:11,720
and they went into production, but, um, they're trying to keep them from happening again.

2589
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:18,160
Um, but yeah, the affected touch controllers are shipping with the rift S and oculus quest

2590
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:19,160
headsets.

2591
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:24,760
Um, and they're not going to recall them because I mean, why the fuck it might be really funny.

2592
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:29,000
It's not like we don't have hidden messages and a lot of things that we use in our everyday

2593
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
lives.

2594
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,720
For example, um, currency, right?

2595
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,560
Like coins, they have little, you know, things on them.

2596
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:40,120
Um, also like, hello, don't y'all know, like, like everybody loves in and out when they

2597
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,120
come to California.

2598
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,400
You ever looked at one of the bottom of the cups at in and out Bible verses, Bible verses

2599
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,400
on them.

2600
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:54,840
So no, not on my cup, but thankfully they don't, you know, contribute money to, well,

2601
01:55:54,840 --> 01:56:00,800
do they not to anti LGBT, but you know, it's just, you know, you gotta do your research.

2602
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:06,340
But I also, I have a controversial opinion on all that anyway, but I, you know, I still

2603
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:10,000
eat it because, um, they treat their workers very well from what I understand.

2604
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,360
And kids really want to work there.

2605
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:14,840
So I think that's also very, I like that everyone who starts off there, even if they're, you

2606
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:21,480
know, fresh incoming CEO or whatever, or executive have to take, um, have to spend a day on the

2607
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,480
floor.

2608
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,480
Oh, okay.

2609
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:24,480
That's, that's interesting.

2610
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,480
They're absolutely required to.

2611
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,480
Oh, that's cool.

2612
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:27,480
Yeah.

2613
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:28,480
You know what's interesting?

2614
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,180
The orientation I do in my work is the same required.

2615
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:31,920
Why wouldn't you want to do that for a day?

2616
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:32,920
That'd be fun.

2617
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:33,920
Yeah.

2618
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,920
Just for a day.

2619
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:35,920
I think for a week.

2620
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,700
Oh, well, you know, why not?

2621
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,840
It's the best way to learn about what's going on, right?

2622
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,940
So anyway, but my point is there's hidden messages in a lot of things.

2623
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:46,200
It sounds like, sounds like this was one that wasn't meant to get out in mass.

2624
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:51,560
In fact, Bobby, who we all know loves his VR in chat says, I fix it does tear down YouTube

2625
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,600
videos.

2626
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,800
That's what the message was for.

2627
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,160
So of course that makes sense.

2628
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,160
Yeah.

2629
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:59,560
So, you know, they tried to hide a cute message for those folks and now it's turns out a lot

2630
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:01,080
of folks see it.

2631
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,080
I'll be honest.

2632
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:06,160
I have used, I fix it before and for lack of having a manual with me when trying to

2633
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:09,180
change on a hard drive and it wasn't like on a PC.

2634
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:12,140
It was on, it was a, my old Toshiba.

2635
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:13,140
Right.

2636
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:14,140
So, all right.

2637
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:15,580
Anyway, hidden messages.

2638
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:16,580
They're everywhere.

2639
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:17,580
All right.

2640
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:18,580
Moving on.

2641
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:21,420
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates that are coming up.

2642
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:30,540
Well, we've got Anno 1800 coming out on PC, Final Fantasy 10 and 10 2 HD remaster on the

2643
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:33,740
Nintendo switch and Xbox one.

2644
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:42,460
We have my time at Portia on switch PlayStation four and Xbox one world war Z on PC, PlayStation

2645
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:50,420
four and Xbox one, um, trooper Brooke on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox

2646
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:54,280
one cup head on Nintendo switch.

2647
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:58,240
And finally Katana zero on PC and the Nintendo switch.

2648
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:59,240
That's it.

2649
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,220
Are you going to pick up cup head on switch?

2650
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:03,640
I've heard a lot of people talking about it on PC and I don't play it.

2651
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:07,800
So why would I pick it up another platform not to play on PC and it makes me cry to continue

2652
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,800
to not play it.

2653
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:09,800
Oh, why is it?

2654
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:10,800
Just cause it's fucking hard.

2655
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,480
I do want to pick up birth defense force.

2656
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,820
I did hold off on picking that up this week because I knew I wouldn't get to play it this

2657
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:16,820
week.

2658
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:21,320
So it's, which is why, and also it's kind of expensive, but I, I do need to get it.

2659
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:22,320
All right.

2660
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:26,120
Let's talk about some titles coming out in Japan on the PlayStation four this week.

2661
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:31,020
It looks like the biggest title they have there is Langrisser one and two on the PlayStation

2662
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:32,020
four.

2663
01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:38,220
This is a remake of these RPGs that were out on the mega drive in 1991 and 1994.

2664
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:42,260
So now it's like a one, two combo remastered for the PlayStation four.

2665
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:44,580
So there's a regular and a limited edition of that.

2666
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:46,580
And that's on the PlayStation four this week.

2667
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:53,580
The other release in Japan this week, override mech city brawl is also out this week in Japan.

2668
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:57,380
And that is also on the PlayStation four looking quickly at the Nintendo switch that Langrisser

2669
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,960
one and two is also out on the switch.

2670
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:05,640
As well as a game called Tai Shu cross Alex, excuse me, Alice all in one.

2671
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,820
That is the other release in Japan this week.

2672
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:12,900
Otherwise it's a relatively slow week in Japan, but I know we're heading into a big holiday

2673
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:15,780
thing coming up here pretty soon, I think at the end of the month.

2674
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:18,220
So it's probably going to be slow for a little bit.

2675
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:19,420
How about Europe?

2676
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:20,420
It's a little bit slow.

2677
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:23,300
I mean, there's some stuff to look forward to.

2678
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:29,020
So there is my time at Porsche on April 15th.

2679
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:35,220
Also out on the 15th is world war Z and then final fantasy 10, 10 to HD remaster.

2680
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:41,940
On the 16th, we have snooker 2019 which is a pool game.

2681
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:48,520
On the 17th, we have trooper Brook constructor plus, and our world is ended.

2682
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:54,280
And then on the 18th ghost giant deluxe edition.

2683
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,280
That's it.

2684
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,280
That's it.

2685
01:59:56,280 --> 02:00:01,760
And then my birthday, which is a game in and of itself because trying to just live is fun.

2686
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:02,760
That's right.

2687
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,960
Happy early birthday because we do another show.

2688
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:05,960
It will have passed.

2689
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:06,960
Right.

2690
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:07,960
Thank you.

2691
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:08,960
I'm old.

2692
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,960
So no, you're not.

2693
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:10,960
You're doing a 24 hour stream for your birthday.

2694
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:11,960
Right.

2695
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:12,960
I'm just kidding.

2696
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:13,960
No, I'm going to be in San Francisco.

2697
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:14,960
Oh, that'd be.

2698
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:15,960
Oh yes.

2699
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,960
Oh, cause you're, you're not here on the next episode, right?

2700
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,960
No, I am not.

2701
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:22,040
I'm going to be going to the, uh, conclave for the 40th anniversary of the sisters of

2702
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,840
perpetual indulgence because I know you're very heavily involved with that.

2703
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,280
I would love to go.

2704
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:28,920
I have a very busy next weekend is very busy myself though.

2705
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:32,940
I'm hosting an event Friday here in SAC, a burlesque show in old town and then a rocky

2706
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:34,280
horror is on four 20.

2707
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:37,880
The very important thing though about the theme burlesque show or is it just a regular

2708
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:38,880
burlesque?

2709
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,720
It is a themed burlesque show because it is also a, it is that cannabis weekend.

2710
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,040
So it's a cannabis burlesque show.

2711
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,920
That's interesting.

2712
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,920
Come see what it is.

2713
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:54,360
The other thing though about this particular one is that, um, the, the, the Easter in the

2714
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:58,000
park had been done traditionally at Dolores park and had to move to golden gate park when

2715
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,840
they changed the gathering rules for Dolores park.

2716
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:05,360
They got a special, uh, dispensation for the 40th anniversary to have it at Dolores park

2717
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:06,360
again.

2718
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:11,120
So if anyone, any of our listeners is in San Francisco, come find me.

2719
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:16,880
Um, I will be, uh, in my sister persona, I'll be wearing a little blue and white Lolita

2720
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:22,840
dress with a floofy hat and I'm sure there'll be pictures on social media, but my face will

2721
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:23,840
be hidden.

2722
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:24,840
Can you find me?

2723
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:26,320
It's where's Jamie?

2724
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:30,020
Uh, and I'm okay going off topic a little bit because this is the part of the show where

2725
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:34,240
we would be answering your emails, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send

2726
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:37,840
us emails and every week, dark soccer dives in the mailbag and finds what she wants to

2727
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:38,840
read about tonight.

2728
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,800
But this week, someone washed the floor.

2729
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,040
It's not sticky anymore.

2730
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:43,040
It's clean.

2731
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,760
So there's nothing in the mailbag once again.

2732
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:45,760
Yeah.

2733
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,280
And because of that, I'm going to play animal crossing.

2734
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:49,280
No, no.

2735
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:50,560
We're going to talk about RuPaul's drag race.

2736
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:51,560
Oh, that's right.

2737
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:54,840
So, so girl, I didn't watch this a week's episode.

2738
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,840
Why?

2739
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,440
I just haven't gotten around to it yet, but it was so satisfying.

2740
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,440
I know.

2741
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:02,000
I've heard what happens cause you know, things get ruined on social media.

2742
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,840
If you, I was ready for that bitch to go.

2743
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,920
Now I got one more bitch to go.

2744
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,280
You know which bitch I want to go.

2745
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,160
Uh, probably Dr Ganesh.

2746
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:10,160
Dr Ganesh.

2747
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,160
Yeah.

2748
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:12,160
I'm thinking.

2749
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:15,600
Dr Ganesh is proof that you can be well educated and still be a fucking moron.

2750
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,840
Let's keep it positive.

2751
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:17,840
Who are you rooting for?

2752
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:18,840
Positively stupid.

2753
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:21,040
Who are you rooting for at this point in the competition?

2754
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,040
Evie.

2755
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,040
Evie?

2756
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,040
I really like Evie.

2757
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:25,040
I like Evie too.

2758
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:29,440
But I super love Miss Vangie and I want her to, I think Vangie is going to get, um, Miss

2759
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:31,120
Vangie is going to get a spinoff series.

2760
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:36,360
Miss Vangie just, Miss Vangie is going to be like the Alyssa Edwards of this generation

2761
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:37,360
of drag race.

2762
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:38,360
You know what I mean?

2763
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:46,600
Miss Vangie though, I think is going to be, um, what, what fan favorite called, um, uh,

2764
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:50,200
crap that De La got and oh, Miss Congeniality.

2765
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:51,200
Yes.

2766
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,200
Thank you.

2767
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:53,200
Cause I was like, I couldn't make the word come out of my mouth.

2768
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:57,400
Oh, by the way, in chat right now, Frodo's swaggin says reload the mailbag cause I sent

2769
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:58,400
something 10 minutes ago.

2770
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,400
Too bad.

2771
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:02,120
It's already closed and you made me lose a fish.

2772
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,120
Damn it.

2773
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:04,120
All right.

2774
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:05,120
Let me look at this freaking mailbag.

2775
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:06,120
We can roll it to next week.

2776
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:07,120
Well, you won't be here next week.

2777
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:08,120
Then you can read it.

2778
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:09,120
Rob.

2779
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:10,120
It's up to you.

2780
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:11,120
No, you go ahead.

2781
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:12,120
Let's do it.

2782
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,120
Let's do it.

2783
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:14,120
Loki.

2784
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,120
Loki is literally typing in chat.

2785
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:16,120
Save me.

2786
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:17,120
It's just called OLR.

2787
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,120
Okay.

2788
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,120
All right.

2789
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:20,120
Hey, OLR.

2790
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:21,120
Frodo's swaggin's here.

2791
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:23,760
I wanted to take a second to talk about Roblox.

2792
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,960
I've always, it's coming up later in the show, but okay.

2793
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:27,960
It's fine.

2794
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:28,960
We'll talk about it now.

2795
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:29,960
I've always seen it on X-Box and PC.

2796
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:30,960
I've also seen it.

2797
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:31,960
It's on X-Box?

2798
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:33,960
I didn't know there was an X-Box.

2799
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:34,960
That's cool.

2800
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:37,080
Cause it's windows shit.

2801
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:38,080
Makes sense.

2802
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,080
Yeah.

2803
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:40,440
I've also seen people try to do add-ons for it.

2804
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,720
They get their computers hyper infected.

2805
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,080
Watch what your kids download.

2806
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,600
Is that the technical term for it?

2807
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:46,600
It's windows shit.

2808
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:47,600
Shit.

2809
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:48,600
Yeah, exactly.

2810
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,600
Is that the technical term?

2811
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:50,600
Yeah.

2812
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,600
Is that what we call the windows store now?

2813
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,600
I did this number.

2814
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:53,600
Sorry.

2815
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,600
Sorry, Loki.

2816
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:55,600
I didn't mean to.

2817
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:56,600
It's very popular.

2818
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:57,600
I know it's popular.

2819
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,600
My son plays it every day.

2820
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:59,600
Watch.

2821
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,600
What do you download?

2822
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:01,600
Come to find.

2823
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,600
Oh, I don't want to download whatever.

2824
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:03,600
What's it going to do?

2825
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:04,600
Hyper infect this computer that has nothing on it?

2826
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:05,680
Can I read an email, please?

2827
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:08,240
Come to find out it's on all platforms, actually.

2828
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:12,800
I also just assumed it was going to be for younger age group just by looking at the title

2829
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:13,800
and screenshots.

2830
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:17,400
Anyway, last week I said why not and opened up the game and holy shit, there are thousands

2831
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,420
of games in there to choose from.

2832
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:23,900
Not all games are great, but there are many gems here to have fun with.

2833
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:27,720
It's literally all I've been playing lately, especially some of the first person shooters.

2834
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:32,120
The graphics obviously aren't anything special, but the gameplay is definitely there.

2835
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:36,280
Especially on PC with keyboard and mouse, the shooters feel great.

2836
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:38,640
Also been dumping hours into restaurant tycoon.

2837
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:42,880
Anyway, I had no idea what the heck Roblox was and I'm glad I opened it up.

2838
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,880
Lol.

2839
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,280
Also, I've seen people making their own games and putting it on there.

2840
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,880
Loki, have you ever thought about making a game for Roblox?

2841
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:51,800
No, I mean, sort of.

2842
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:55,100
I've looked at it, but I'm not really interested in Roblox at all.

2843
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,100
My son is.

2844
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:59,840
That's actually why he's doing his programming class now, because actually part of the programming

2845
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:05,720
class once he gets high enough into it, because they have to learn Scratch, then JavaScript,

2846
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:09,320
then they actually do Roblox level making with Lua.

2847
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:12,360
I keep forgetting your kid's going to finish a game before you do.

2848
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,360
He doesn't.

2849
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,360
He already did a game.

2850
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:18,820
He's done several, because they have several projects that they work on.

2851
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:19,820
I just don't.

2852
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:20,820
The John Cena game.

2853
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:24,880
He had that, but he has several that he's done since then, because he's been doing it

2854
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,680
for like a couple months now.

2855
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:31,640
But no, once they actually get out of, he belts up to yellow, they start doing JavaScript

2856
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:32,640
and stuff.

2857
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:37,480
And then eventually I think it's like they do Lua and Roblox and they start teaching

2858
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:39,360
like level design, stuff like that.

2859
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:42,960
I've thought about it, but like, I just don't want to.

2860
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,800
You should say you've made him a game and it's nothing but like Josh's adventures at

2861
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,880
the broccoli farm.

2862
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:51,860
There's so much rampant like IP theft on that.

2863
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:55,840
It's just not even like you think you think like YouTube's bad with all like the weird

2864
02:05:55,840 --> 02:06:00,000
children's programming, but like people like because I think some a lot of kids are making

2865
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,040
so they don't give a fuck what they rip off.

2866
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,880
It's just like, oh, hey, I'm playing a Five Nights at Freddy's game.

2867
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:10,000
I'm sure you had permission to do that or hey, I'm playing an Avengers game or whatever

2868
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
the fuck I'm playing.

2869
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,440
The way I heard about Roblox the first time and like I thought it was just like a kid

2870
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:16,760
only thing and I never even bothered to look at it.

2871
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:21,540
The way I heard about it was that there were you know, I played those fakie fakie survivor

2872
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:23,240
and big brother games online.

2873
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:29,360
Well, some of those people play survivor Roblox games and so they have all sorts of this is

2874
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:30,360
happening by the way.

2875
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:31,360
Yeah.

2876
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:32,360
Oh yes.

2877
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:33,360
Now who's derailing the topic?

2878
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:34,360
Yeah.

2879
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:35,360
Yeah.

2880
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:38,620
They have all sorts of like simulator games that he'll play and stuff and that's fine.

2881
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:39,620
It's entertaining for him.

2882
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:40,800
It's free.

2883
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,640
He does want me to buy the premium currency form every once in a while.

2884
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:47,320
I'll do that like once or twice a year for him and then that's it.

2885
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:51,080
But like they've got like physical toys you can get the unlocked stuff in the games and

2886
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:52,080
they have.

2887
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:55,800
And you can basically build a game and build your own like premium stuff in there that

2888
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:00,040
they purchase with their points and you get money for it is what kind of the incentive.

2889
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:04,600
So it's funny our emailer brought up Roblox because I actually have a showreel story on

2890
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:05,600
it here later.

2891
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:07,600
We just haven't come across it yet.

2892
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:14,840
And so I only know of this game what my friends from the other stuff have told me about it.

2893
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:17,400
I haven't really bothered to do any research.

2894
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:21,720
So sometimes when I want to learn more about a game I'll go look up twitch streams.

2895
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:24,040
So you should totally stream yourself playing Roblox.

2896
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:25,040
It's free.

2897
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,040
OK.

2898
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:27,040
Maybe I will.

2899
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:28,040
Well here's the problem.

2900
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:31,820
When I went into those like Roblox streams and like just clicked on some random ones

2901
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:38,120
I sampled like for every single one of them was like a 13 year old and I felt fucking

2902
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:44,440
creepy because I'm like I'm a 40 year old dude watching these 13 year olds play like

2903
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,440
where are the adults.

2904
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:50,040
You know the average people that play Fortnite though in like Apex Legends stuff is probably

2905
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:51,040
the same.

2906
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,900
So if you're probably you know what.

2907
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:59,040
And see when I was 13 back in my day I was calling into BBS's and I bet like a lot of

2908
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,040
adults are on this.

2909
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:03,780
I remember talking to people that were in like their 20s and 30s and I was 13 posting

2910
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:07,000
on these like fucking BBS threads and stuff.

2911
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Sorry I'm sorry.

2912
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I scared the hell.

2913
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
My mom hated it.

2914
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Sorry to derail that.

2915
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Once again.

2916
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
What else.

2917
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:15,760
I did want to bring this up and this is to your interest as well.

2918
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:16,760
Hold on.

2919
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:17,760
Hold on.

2920
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:18,760
Is the email done.

2921
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:19,760
OK.

2922
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:20,760
The email is done so we can we can do a tangent.

2923
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:21,760
Sorry.

2924
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:25,080
So Humble Bundle as I was talking about before they have another bundle right now that is

2925
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:28,160
a classics video games.

2926
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:32,320
It's boss fight books and they do kind of post mortems and stuff.

2927
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:37,860
It's a nonfiction documentary style books about classic video games and stuff.

2928
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:45,260
The reason I mention this is in their one dollar one there is a book on ZZT Oh get out

2929
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:49,740
and not only ZZT but Earthbound Mega Man 3 Galaga.

2930
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:52,820
And then of course you know if you pay that more than the average which is eight bucks

2931
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:59,660
they have like Soft and Cuddly Super Mario Brothers 2 Bible Adventures Metal Gear Solid

2932
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:00,660
American one.

2933
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:01,660
And these are all e-books.

2934
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:03,100
Yeah these are all e-books.

2935
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:07,380
But like I saw the ZZT I'm like I may have to pick that up and that's good for another

2936
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:09,260
about two and a half days.

2937
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:11,300
So I hope I remember after the show to go look that up.

2938
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:13,020
I love ZZT.

2939
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:17,000
I'm curious though who the authors are because if they're authors that work for a particular

2940
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,100
large gaming Web site then I'm interested.

2941
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:21,820
It's Anna Anthropy.

2942
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:25,940
I oh I've I've heard that name before.

2943
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:30,020
I believe she was at one of the gamer X events.

2944
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:31,020
Yes.

2945
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:38,020
She's been right or author of Rise of the Video Game Zenisters.

2946
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:43,820
OK yes I know I think I recognize the panels a gamer game creator historian 30 year old

2947
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:44,820
teen witch.

2948
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:45,820
All right.

2949
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:46,820
So OK.

2950
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:47,820
I can deal with that.

2951
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:49,780
Teen witches are so in right now.

2952
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:50,780
Yeah.

2953
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:51,780
You know watching Sabrina.

2954
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:52,780
All right.

2955
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:53,780
OK.

2956
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:54,780
Oh.

2957
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:55,780
And says.

2958
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:56,780
Yeah.

2959
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:57,780
Yeah.

2960
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:58,780
She says her previous.

2961
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,780
Yeah.

2962
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:03,780
Rise of the Video Game Zenisters and Starwench which she recently made is easy to version

2963
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:04,780
of.

2964
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:05,780
Oh so.

2965
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:06,780
OK.

2966
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:07,780
So there's a little credit in there.

2967
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:08,780
She makes her own ZZT game.

2968
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:09,780
So yeah.

2969
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:10,780
All right.

2970
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:11,780
I'm into it.

2971
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:12,780
Yeah.

2972
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:13,780
Definitely.

2973
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:14,780
All right.

2974
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:15,780
I'll check it out.

2975
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:16,780
All right.

2976
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:17,780
Anyways that's all I had.

2977
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:18,780
No that's fine.

2978
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:19,780
Let's move on.

2979
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:20,780
Let's get into some more gaming news.

2980
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:21,780
You have a few more things that we're going to get to the discord part of the show and

2981
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:22,780
as well as any chat room comments.

2982
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:24,660
We'll get to that a little later on here in our roundtable.

2983
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:25,660
But first Loki.

2984
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:26,660
So this is interesting.

2985
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:31,660
We have Twitch actually releasing games on their platform.

2986
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:36,300
So this is a new free to play karaoke game called Twitch sings and it's a partnership

2987
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:40,180
between harmonics and Twitch and it's been in beta for a while.

2988
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:41,180
Yes.

2989
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:44,380
Because you've probably seen this on Twitch already but only certain people had access

2990
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:46,080
to it.

2991
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:47,500
So apparently yet.

2992
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:52,660
So they have now close to 2000 songs and we'll get new songs over time.

2993
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:56,260
And apparently it ties directly with the players Twitch accounts letting them stream

2994
02:10:56,260 --> 02:11:02,980
games without needing any sort of additional software or whatever.

2995
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:09,340
Interesting you also support duets using asynchronous multiplayer where one person records half

2996
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:14,420
of it and the other person sings to the upload of that.

2997
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:17,500
Interesting I have no interest in doing this whatsoever but it's interesting that it's

2998
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:18,500
something that's available.

2999
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:26,460
I hope we see more things like this or you know Twitch built games or something.

3000
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:29,700
I downloaded it and I'm too afraid to play it on stream.

3001
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:36,420
I got to be honest because my one like karaoke infamous thing I did was when we were at that

3002
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:41,060
theme park years ago and I went to sound booth and I did Madonna's like a prayer because

3003
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:45,260
that was like a big thing you will do like yeah you go record your video or the video

3004
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:49,540
no music video is a CD this is before like CD burners were everywhere.

3005
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:52,260
So like that was the great America right now is a great America.

3006
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:53,260
Yeah we're there.

3007
02:11:53,260 --> 02:12:00,400
You know I didn't do that Jessica did Lisa Loeb or oh oh no non blondes that was always

3008
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,040
her like no she did.

3009
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:03,040
She did stay.

3010
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:04,040
Oh yeah.

3011
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,040
That was one of her go to.

3012
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,040
So yeah.

3013
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:07,040
Yeah.

3014
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,040
But anyway.

3015
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:09,040
So anyway.

3016
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:11,380
Well the problem is that CD ended up in the hands of trying to Travis Donovan.

3017
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:14,140
Oh no.

3018
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:17,920
So it kind of like makes me nervous to do karaoke again.

3019
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:22,780
I've gone out and done karaoke at bars and stuff but I don't know like I'm not a great

3020
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:28,180
singer like I'm not William Hung but I'm not like great.

3021
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:30,220
I'm going to get off key sometimes.

3022
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:32,060
So makes me a little scared to play it on Twitch.

3023
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:35,140
I did download the client just to see if I could play it like offline.

3024
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:39,940
I think I can but I didn't even want to play it because Alan was home.

3025
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:43,500
I didn't even want Alan around I was trying to play it.

3026
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:46,860
I should have played it earlier today when he went to the gym but I was working on it.

3027
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:51,260
I did that movie you saw during the break instead when he was gone at the gym.

3028
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:52,260
So I don't know.

3029
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:53,620
Maybe I'll play two things somewhat.

3030
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:56,700
Would you be willing to do karaoke on stream or soccer.

3031
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:58,620
I would do it once once.

3032
02:12:58,620 --> 02:12:59,620
OK.

3033
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:00,620
All right.

3034
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:04,040
I've I've done it and I've been recorded before.

3035
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,140
Maybe I'll do it for charity.

3036
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:09,500
Maybe that's maybe that's will finally get me to do two things if it's for rock band

3037
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:10,500
for charity maybe.

3038
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:11,500
Yeah.

3039
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:12,500
Something like that.

3040
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:14,940
By the way why are all the copies of robot money do you like expensive.

3041
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:17,260
I have no idea why.

3042
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:19,260
I don't know.

3043
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:21,100
All right.

3044
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:25,540
Moving on to talk about World of Warcraft something a little more old school and getting

3045
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:29,620
really old school pretty soon because World of Warcraft classic as you know is on the

3046
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:34,140
way out because what's new is not good for some people they want to go play the game

3047
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:38,180
the way it used to be back in my day so World of Warcraft classic is on the way and people

3048
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:40,740
want to know how's PVP going to work.

3049
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:44,940
Like because you know PVP didn't just like end up in the game all at once.

3050
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:49,060
How is it going to work in World of Warcraft classic what's going to look like when the

3051
02:13:49,060 --> 02:13:50,060
game rolls out.

3052
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:53,980
And the answer is it's going to be rolled out gradually just like it was when the original

3053
02:13:53,980 --> 02:13:55,160
game launched.

3054
02:13:55,160 --> 02:13:58,420
So there will be no kill tracking or reward system at first.

3055
02:13:58,420 --> 02:14:01,500
If you take down other players just to kill them.

3056
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,180
That's just good.

3057
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:04,180
Good on you.

3058
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:05,180
E-peen.

3059
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:06,180
E-peen points.

3060
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:07,180
That's all you get.

3061
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:11,820
Phase two kicks in there will be an honor system and rank rewards.

3062
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:14,540
And then the third phase will bring in the battlegrounds.

3063
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:16,900
Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch.

3064
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:19,260
The fourth phase, Arathi Basin.

3065
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:23,860
The fifth phase I don't think I don't think will affect PVP I think they're doing other

3066
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:24,860
updates.

3067
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:29,040
And the sixth phase is finally the World PVP in the Eastern Playlands and Silithus.

3068
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:31,220
But we don't know how long these phases are.

3069
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:32,220
We don't know if they're months.

3070
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:35,620
We don't know if they're weeks or what that's going to look like.

3071
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:36,620
But I don't know.

3072
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:40,220
I really think all these people have been demanding the classic WoT and I think they're

3073
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:43,100
going to download it, play it, and realize it sucks.

3074
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:46,940
Like I just feel like Blizzard's pouring all these resources into something that's not

3075
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:48,660
going to last very long.

3076
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:53,940
I mean I'm sure there'll be like a little a little audience that sticks with it hardcore.

3077
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:57,020
Now if they were doing something a little more frozen in time when Wrath of the Lich

3078
02:14:57,020 --> 02:15:01,060
King was current content maybe but I even then I still feel like it would be something

3079
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:05,260
where it's like oh you download the novelties but you've just gotten too used to the quality

3080
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:08,840
of life stuff that's in the MMOs now.

3081
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:15,420
Like when people realize that there is no flying mounts that's going to be irritating.

3082
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:19,580
When people realize that oh there's weapon skills you have to level up because that's

3083
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:22,300
what you used to have to do and wow they're going to be annoyed.

3084
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:26,540
Like there's a lot of things where the quality of life you forget like how much these games

3085
02:15:26,540 --> 02:15:30,340
have progressed because oh everything sucks now I guess.

3086
02:15:30,340 --> 02:15:31,340
I don't know.

3087
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:34,340
Anyway World of Warcraft classic I'll still check it out.

3088
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:40,880
Like I mean it's supposed to be free if you're a wow subscriber anyway which I am so I'll

3089
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:46,100
check it out anyway but it's just I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.

3090
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:47,100
All right.

3091
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:48,100
Anyhow let's move on.

3092
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:50,020
DarkSakura what do you have for us?

3093
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:55,920
Well there is a documentary coming about this comes actually from Destructoid but they are

3094
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:03,480
doing a project about Shirley Curry who is the gaming grandma.

3095
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:08,380
And so they're going to basically it's going to be actually no it looks like it's already

3096
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:11,880
released but it's for her 83rd birthday.

3097
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:16,840
Going through Skyrim and YouTube and how all of these people have affected her life and

3098
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:20,120
how she keeps doing it and enjoys what she does.

3099
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:26,660
So I think that's pretty cool and I'd say if you want to watch it I'll link the page

3100
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:32,640
for it in the chat room but it's on Destructoid and I think it would be a worthwhile watch.

3101
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:36,740
And this is the same grandma that is like known for Skyrim and we just had a story like

3102
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:40,480
two weeks ago about that she's in Elder Scrolls 6 now.

3103
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:41,480
Yep.

3104
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:42,480
That's pretty cool.

3105
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:43,480
Yeah.

3106
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:44,920
She seems like a fun lady.

3107
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:48,960
So I tried to get my mom into games but she wasn't having it.

3108
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:54,320
I can just imagine your mom sit her down with Skyrim you know and what she would say.

3109
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:55,320
No.

3110
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:56,320
Yeah.

3111
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:57,320
She would.

3112
02:16:57,320 --> 02:16:58,320
Yeah.

3113
02:16:58,320 --> 02:16:59,320
No.

3114
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,720
I detect holding a controller like this.

3115
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:01,720
She'd be like what do I do.

3116
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:02,720
There's too many.

3117
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,720
But you know you do it.

3118
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:04,720
I'll just tell you what to do.

3119
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:05,720
No.

3120
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:11,400
The only games I could ever get my mom to play would be like Wheel of Fortune Jeopardy

3121
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:13,800
Family Feud like the game show games.

3122
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:17,760
She would play those but she would still be like you type it in.

3123
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:18,760
You do.

3124
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:19,760
You run it.

3125
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:20,760
I don't want to touch it.

3126
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:21,760
Oh my God.

3127
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,240
Why don't they have game show games like in VR.

3128
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:27,980
Like imagine actually being able to spin the wheel in Wheel of Fortune.

3129
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:30,220
I'm sure somebody is working on something like that.

3130
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:34,740
Just I was going to say just waiting for VR to gain a little more of a foothold.

3131
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:39,260
But honestly PlayStation VR is so like out there now I'm now I'm surprised there isn't

3132
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:40,620
a Wheel of Fortune VR game.

3133
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:42,620
You can even have someone host it or something.

3134
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:43,620
I don't know.

3135
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:44,620
It'd be funny.

3136
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:45,620
It's like a wish.

3137
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:46,620
Yeah.

3138
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:47,620
Yeah.

3139
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:48,620
Yeah.

3140
02:17:48,620 --> 02:17:51,140
These I smell money games live game show apps are all the rage.

3141
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:56,060
Now did you know that even dating apps have like game show things in them.

3142
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:57,060
What Yeah.

3143
02:17:57,060 --> 02:18:00,100
There's like there's a there's what are you saying there's like a tinder game show now

3144
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:04,060
sort of like I wouldn't expect you to know about this because it's a gay dating app.

3145
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:08,760
There's a gay one called Scruff that like you know gay dudes used to find each other.

3146
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:13,400
And this thing has a game show built into it that they do.

3147
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:19,180
That's just it's the exact same thing as HQ it's the exact same thing as that.

3148
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:22,820
But it's in this and they'll they'll do a thing where they're all like if you've been

3149
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:26,220
eliminated from the game you can swipe to the side and see other players that have been

3150
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:29,900
eliminated and you can tap on their profile to save them for later or whatever.

3151
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:35,140
I don't I don't know all the ins and outs of it but yeah they do like a game show and

3152
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:40,540
I know it's funny but like it's all the rage these these game show things okey doke.

3153
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:42,780
And I don't think it's just dating apps that are doing them too.

3154
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:49,400
So I'm surprised that we don't have like an HQ type of thing on PlayStation yet or Microsoft.

3155
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:50,400
Maybe it's a matter of time.

3156
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:51,460
I don't know.

3157
02:18:51,460 --> 02:18:58,680
So let's see Kai's you know says I was watching a trivia show in Altspace VR SSU 100 Matt

3158
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:03,280
says got to have a VR match game with a digital Charles Nelson Riley.

3159
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:04,280
Hell yes.

3160
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:08,560
Well ABC has been reviving all those old game shows like match game is back on ABC and they're

3161
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:10,400
they're doing a press your luck.

3162
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:14,120
And I think it was the other one concentration maybe that they're doing to I know there's

3163
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:15,120
they're adapting.

3164
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:16,120
Yeah.

3165
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:19,240
ABC is having a lot of those game shows are probably more successful in American Idol

3166
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:22,800
reboots doing so you know that's on air.

3167
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:26,640
It's like literally on right now like on the word like there's an American Idol thing on

3168
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:27,640
now.

3169
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:28,640
Like against Game of Thrones.

3170
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,640
Yeah.

3171
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:30,640
Right.

3172
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:31,640
Yeah.

3173
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:32,880
I guess it's something to realize that was on.

3174
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:33,880
Yeah.

3175
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:34,880
No it's back.

3176
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:39,980
Well like it's not even Simon Cowling there anymore it's Katy Perry some country guy Luke

3177
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:42,880
something and Lionel Richie.

3178
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:47,640
Yeah I watched that like part maybe part of it last season.

3179
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:48,640
I don't really remember.

3180
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:55,140
I don't watch the show but I see the emotional porn clips on Facebook of like this really

3181
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:58,320
sweet audition that just knocks it apart.

3182
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:02,140
You won't believe what happens at the 75 second mark like those types of things.

3183
02:20:02,140 --> 02:20:05,380
I just know I'm not doing this.

3184
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:06,380
I tried to.

3185
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:09,220
We tried watching I think we just got bored of it really fast.

3186
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:13,180
All right let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we get to discord if we

3187
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:17,460
have anybody tonight unfortunately because of those things our live viewership is a little

3188
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:19,500
lower than this week.

3189
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:20,500
How long is the season again.

3190
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:21,900
There's only like six or seven weeks right.

3191
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:22,900
It's a short season.

3192
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:24,180
It's like eight episodes.

3193
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:26,500
No offense but good.

3194
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:27,500
It's gotten into our numbers.

3195
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:28,500
All right.

3196
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:30,380
A few more stories for you guys first though Loki.

3197
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:34,700
So in case you're not aware there is this Twitter account called Can you pet the dog

3198
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:40,460
which basically answers or ask that question among lots of things including games.

3199
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:43,820
I'm assuming just games.

3200
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:49,820
But apparently one of them it actually looked at into the gungeon and it said no.

3201
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:57,220
And so into the gungeon of course the devs behind that once people I guess saw that they

3202
02:20:57,220 --> 02:21:01,640
prompted them to like hey you know why can't we pet the dog in the game.

3203
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:06,980
So with the latest update they have now added the ability to pet the dog into the game in

3204
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:11,820
which the of course tweet was deleted from the Twitter account.

3205
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:18,740
Can you pet the dog with now it being updated to say yes yes now you can pet the dog.

3206
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:25,700
All those updates just to get on the Web site that yes you can now pet the dog.

3207
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:26,700
Yes.

3208
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:27,700
What happens when you pet the dog.

3209
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:28,700
Just go Arf.

3210
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:32,500
I don't like in some games when you go up and talk to the dog the dog just goes wolf

3211
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:35,220
estimation boy and that's like you petting the dog.

3212
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:39,460
I don't know but you can I guess I'll have to download and see I don't know.

3213
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:40,460
All right.

3214
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:41,460
Anyhow.

3215
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:46,980
And lastly tonight my last story that I had earmarked for tonight was about roblox.

3216
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:51,100
So I guess we kind of already got into that discussion earlier but the notable landmark

3217
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:56,760
for roblox is that they have hit 90 million monthly active users.

3218
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:59,220
They announced that news today actually.

3219
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:03,780
This gaming company is also going to be expanding into other territories.

3220
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:08,740
French and German languages will be added into the game and even more languages from

3221
02:22:08,740 --> 02:22:09,740
there.

3222
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:15,080
So in a statement the president of roblox international which yes is a thing Chris Minzer

3223
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:19,740
said roblox is where anyone can unleash their creativity and have fun with their friends

3224
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,380
no matter where they live.

3225
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:25,820
By bringing top games and resources to French and German audiences we're uniting the next

3226
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:30,840
generation through a truly global platform for play.

3227
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:33,160
Everyone playing it is 13 I'm telling you.

3228
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:35,300
Or younger.

3229
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:36,300
Or even younger.

3230
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:40,440
No I should I there was one or two people in chat that were like I'm 30 and I play it

3231
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:43,600
so I'm just saying I just knows wow.

3232
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:44,600
I feel old.

3233
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:49,040
I don't usually get that feeling a lot but yeah and dark soccer if you're in your feelings

3234
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:53,480
right now with your birthday being this week I implore you do not watch roblox streams

3235
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:59,000
because you'll just be more in your feelings because that's where I was today.

3236
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,900
I have no feelings.

3237
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:03,920
My heart shriveled up.

3238
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:04,920
All right.

3239
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,800
So congratulations though to roblox no you know what I will say this.

3240
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:17,740
I will say that it's really cool that roblox is getting kids interested in programming

3241
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:19,960
and stuff like the way you describe it.

3242
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:20,960
That is pretty rad.

3243
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:26,000
So as much as I like poke fun at this game tongue in cheek I think that is really cool.

3244
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:29,480
Wow breaking news I had no idea this was the case.

3245
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:34,320
Bobby Blackwell is telling me buzzer the network on Twitch that has all the classic game shows

3246
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:36,800
is no longer airing.

3247
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,160
That's tragic.

3248
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:41,040
Is the over the air buzzer still there.

3249
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,040
I'm sad.

3250
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:43,040
What happened.

3251
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:47,520
They put a goodbye message or anything.

3252
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,520
God damn it.

3253
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:50,260
This is why we can't have nice things.

3254
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:54,720
I love my classic game shows but I guess that's actually I feel like it probably went off

3255
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:55,720
the air a while ago.

3256
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:59,000
I haven't seen it in a long time actually.

3257
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,520
So they probably pulled themselves a long time ago.

3258
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:05,780
No I don't see anything.

3259
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:07,480
It just said we'll be back soon.

3260
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:08,800
All right then.

3261
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:10,200
Yeah as soon as any time.

3262
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:11,880
Yeah that could be anything.

3263
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:16,600
All right well anyhow hopefully you'll be with us very soon.

3264
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:20,120
We're going to take some calls now via discord.

3265
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:26,800
So if you want to be on the show you can join the green room over on the vog network discord

3266
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:32,880
which again is accessible over at vog network dot com slash discord.

3267
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:36,000
Although of course nobody's there right now I have a feeling it's going to be a very slow

3268
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:40,280
week just because our live listenership is a little bit lower than usual and I imagine

3269
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:43,520
all the TV going on and other things share of sorts.

3270
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:47,480
Well not just that but if I'm not mistaken if Easter is next weekend then I mean spring

3271
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:49,760
break started this week for a lot of people.

3272
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:50,760
Right.

3273
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:51,760
Yeah.

3274
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:52,760
So that's probably cutting into it too.

3275
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:57,200
So I don't think it's just the HBO shows fault and that sort of thing.

3276
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:01,880
So we'll take questions in our chat and comments as well over a vog.

3277
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:06,720
Well I mean vog network dot com will get you there but over twitch TV slash vog network.

3278
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:11,960
So as you know says I just saw buzzer a day or two ago it's a sister network on one of

3279
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:13,040
my local channels.

3280
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:19,100
Yeah they they are you know when TV switched from analog to digital right.

3281
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:23,240
So like TVs don't have the dials anymore or if you had a TV that had the dials you had

3282
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:26,960
to get an adapter to get digital signals that changed like God that was probably like eight

3283
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:29,800
years ago at this point it's been a while.

3284
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:34,600
When the expansion to digital happened there's more room there's more bandwidth.

3285
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:38,160
So it's off the air because I'm like it seems to be pulling up on their Web site.

3286
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:41,120
I don't know if maybe they're streaming through a different platform or something interesting

3287
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:44,880
I don't know if they have it or that could actually that could be the buzzer.

3288
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:48,000
That could be the buzzer network that's over the air.

3289
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:54,240
Maybe it's just on their their but but I can't pull that up on my Xbox one.

3290
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:57,780
That's what I like to do with the twitch app is I would just pull up buzzer and watch old

3291
02:25:57,780 --> 02:25:58,840
game shows.

3292
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:05,860
So anyway but yeah no but the digital expansion happens so that's why you have like all these

3293
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:11,780
like little networks that you're like you know like your CBS station like here we have

3294
02:26:11,780 --> 02:26:14,080
what CBS is 13 right.

3295
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:20,180
So I think 13 too is like the CBS all news network all day and it is news all 24 7 and

3296
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:23,260
I think there's another one that's just weather 24 7.

3297
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:27,100
And so that's where buzzer goes on some of these areas is that they just go on one of

3298
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:28,680
the digital channels.

3299
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:31,840
Some will do like Christian programming all day long depending on what part of the country

3300
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:36,380
you live in or other types of religious programming or possibly Spanish language programming is

3301
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:38,800
another one.

3302
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,620
There's another one that's on to movies.

3303
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:43,060
There's some that just show classic movies all day long.

3304
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:44,700
So it just depends.

3305
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:51,820
Let's see Frodo Swaggins is asking in our chat room is did Facebook streaming ever go

3306
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:52,820
anywhere.

3307
02:26:52,820 --> 02:26:54,140
Oh it's it's still a thing.

3308
02:26:54,140 --> 02:26:56,420
I see it's so easy from your mobile phone.

3309
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:58,780
I mean like the real life streaming.

3310
02:26:58,780 --> 02:26:59,900
I see that all the time.

3311
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:05,380
I was watching because I was a youtuber that I watch only 43 who does a lot of Grand Theft

3312
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:07,420
Auto stuff and all sorts of other games.

3313
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:13,060
But he for a while tried doing live streaming from Facebook for the Facebook gaming stuff

3314
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:14,060
specifically gaming.

3315
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:15,060
OK.

3316
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:16,060
Yeah.

3317
02:27:16,060 --> 02:27:19,840
So Facebook gaming stuff and his thing take away from it was when he did like his first

3318
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:21,220
few streams.

3319
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:27,280
He got quite a few views on there but then it really dropped immensely afterwards like

3320
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:31,860
he was getting just no traction whatsoever and he thought it was probably their algorithm

3321
02:27:31,860 --> 02:27:33,360
that's fucking with it.

3322
02:27:33,360 --> 02:27:37,860
And so he's basically given up on it and going back to Twitch and YouTube instead.

3323
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:43,020
So it sounds like it's still out there but however they have their algorithms it's not

3324
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:44,020
working out.

3325
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:46,700
They might have had that curiosity factor at first too.

3326
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:50,340
But then like now people aren't talking about oh Facebook's getting into gaming streaming

3327
02:27:50,460 --> 02:27:51,460
so people aren't looking at it.

3328
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:52,460
Yeah.

3329
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:53,460
I think that's a huge part.

3330
02:27:53,460 --> 02:28:00,180
So it's there but I don't know how long until I think that the problem where I think a lot

3331
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:04,140
of the competitors to Twitch and so forth have a real problem getting their foot in

3332
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:06,620
the door is because Twitch has an app.

3333
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:08,740
Twitch isn't just a Web site.

3334
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:10,060
Twitch is a phone app.

3335
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:11,980
Twitch is an app on PlayStation 4.

3336
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:13,460
It's an app on Xbox One.

3337
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:16,980
And I would bet those that are watching the show right now some are probably on their

3338
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:17,980
PCs.

3339
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:21,180
Most are on their PCs or Macs whatever you know desktop computers right now watching

3340
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:22,180
the show.

3341
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:26,660
And I would say quite a few are on their mobile phones watching probably so they can watch

3342
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:29,300
in their bedroom or while they multitask or something.

3343
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:32,180
Maybe some might just have their headphones in because you can just listen to audio only

3344
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:33,180
on Twitch.

3345
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:35,340
So some people might be doing it that way.

3346
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:40,100
And then some folks might be on their PlayStation or their Xbox One streaming through it right

3347
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:41,100
now.

3348
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:42,900
That's what's so I think great about Twitch.

3349
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:49,420
When Facebook gaming came out the only way to watch it was on PC or Mac or whatever.

3350
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:51,580
Could you even do it on the mobile app.

3351
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:53,420
Maybe you probably could do it on the mobile app.

3352
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:54,420
That's it.

3353
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:56,860
It wasn't really baked into consoles or anything else.

3354
02:28:56,860 --> 02:29:01,380
At least Mixer you know which is probably Twitch's biggest well Mixer and YouTube I

3355
02:29:01,380 --> 02:29:03,460
guess which are probably the biggest competitors.

3356
02:29:03,460 --> 02:29:05,560
YouTube is also available everywhere right.

3357
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:07,580
We know that YouTube is everywhere.

3358
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:09,180
Mixer is on most of those places.

3359
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:13,460
It's just not on the PlayStation or the Nintendo Switch.

3360
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:19,800
But if these rumors and things about Nintendo and Microsoft being in bed together continue

3361
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:24,460
I would bet we're going to get a Mixer app on Nintendo Switch before we get a Twitch

3362
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:26,900
app on Nintendo Switch.

3363
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:28,480
Not saying you're gonna be able to stream your games.

3364
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:32,460
I don't know if the Switch has the power for that but you might be able to watch at least.

3365
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:34,180
I mean YouTube is on there now.

3366
02:29:34,180 --> 02:29:35,220
Am I correct.

3367
02:29:35,220 --> 02:29:36,220
So yeah.

3368
02:29:36,220 --> 02:29:37,220
Yeah.

3369
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:43,060
Look in our chat lights up there and Bobby says the Amazon Fire TV stick finally got

3370
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:44,060
a Twitch update.

3371
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:46,620
Act Deaf is using his PlayStation 4.

3372
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:48,860
Spyro 557 Jonathan's on his phone.

3373
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:50,980
Frodo Swaggins is on his phone at work.

3374
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:53,660
So people that's the great thing about Twitch in my opinion.

3375
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:59,280
And one reason why I was really sold on the move over from how we were doing this before

3376
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:00,280
on Shoutcast.

3377
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:01,280
Yeah.

3378
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:04,600
Because you couldn't really do Shoutcast I mean you could do Shoutcast on mobile but

3379
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:08,880
it was like you had to know that you really download an app called TuneIn and that will

3380
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:11,800
get you into it and like all this stuff like it just wasn't the same.

3381
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:15,720
Like Twitch is very very easy and that's kind of what I like about it to be honest.

3382
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:19,240
Anyway I do see we have a call waiting in the green room so I want to go ahead and take

3383
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:20,240
a call here.

3384
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:25,560
I just closed my control panel however so there we go I think I can do my drag and drop

3385
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:26,560
now.

3386
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:27,560
Yes there we go.

3387
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:28,560
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3388
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,560
Who's this?

3389
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:30,560
Hey this is Act Deaf.

3390
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:31,840
Hey it's good to hear from you Act Deaf.

3391
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:32,840
What's up buddy?

3392
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:43,000
Well I want to talk about KmonGo and pretty much all the events we've had for the last

3393
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,460
like two months maybe.

3394
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:50,640
There's been a lot right because we don't just have the community days but we've been

3395
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:55,600
having these research days right so it's it's been a lot.

3396
02:30:55,600 --> 02:31:00,500
Yeah it's been a lot we've had the at least in the last month.

3397
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:11,740
We've had the Econox event, we've had also the Lotad and Castform event, then we also

3398
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:23,540
had Trico last month, we had just the Bagon community day also and we had this past week

3399
02:31:23,540 --> 02:31:28,140
what what what other event we had oh the debug got a bug out event.

3400
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:36,540
So yeah there have been like really really tons of events but by my question here for

3401
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:44,380
for you and anyone on the studio playing Pokemon Go have you liked the events at all?

3402
02:31:44,380 --> 02:31:47,620
Have you literally been like excited to play an event?

3403
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:49,620
When I can go to them.

3404
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:55,220
Yeah I'm kind of with you Jamie I like the concept of the events I think they're doing

3405
02:31:55,220 --> 02:31:58,880
too many of these limited time events.

3406
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:03,940
I think these like week long things like the bug festival or the raid bosses are changing

3407
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:08,620
that's fine but like there's too many things that are limited time and then you have that

3408
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:12,820
whole FOMO if you fear missing out and you feel like well the object of the game is to

3409
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:16,060
collect them all and they can't do every event then I've flopped and I might as well quit

3410
02:32:16,060 --> 02:32:22,100
playing and like these things like the lunchtime raids like in theory that's a good idea but

3411
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:27,980
that they should be doing it like more often than what they're doing or the you know the

3412
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:34,660
community day and stuff that's fine and good but like I can't like put aside this specific

3413
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:41,860
three hour window to go do these things every time you know at the whim of Niantic and whatever

3414
02:32:41,860 --> 02:32:45,540
window they choose that's why I think the low tat event and the castle one thing ended

3415
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:50,540
up being a little better because that had the nine hour window on it right yeah yeah

3416
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:54,460
and that was a little better so you didn't feel the need to grind the entire nine hours

3417
02:32:54,460 --> 02:32:57,780
you just did it enough to get like your one or two but then I guess the shiny drop rate

3418
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:01,740
was so low on some some people did grind for hours and hours and still didn't get what

3419
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:05,100
they were looking for so I think Niantic in some ways has to find the balance there but

3420
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:11,500
I think as far as like the burnout of Pokemon go with all these events and the limited event

3421
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:17,580
fatigue I think it's very real like I have a friend who is a big presence in Pokemon

3422
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:22,980
go like co like he doesn't lead the raid group but he's kind of like the vice lead of a big

3423
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:28,340
raid group here locally and he kind of said like yeah I'm just getting really kind of like Pokemon

3424
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:32,660
go is kind of starting to drag a little bit like it's just not as exciting as used to be so he

3425
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:39,180
picked up ingress and like he's gone like off the deep end and ingress I mean that a good way like

3426
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:43,380
he's already up to like level he's gonna be level 9 pretty soon which you know takes a little while

3427
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:48,100
I know it doesn't sound like a long way but it's a pretty long way in ingress and it like he's just

3428
02:33:48,100 --> 02:33:53,500
enjoying that right now so it's and I'm sure when the Harry Potter game comes out of all things it's

3429
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:58,180
gonna make this worse because so many people are gonna want to jump ship to Harry Potter now is that

3430
02:33:58,180 --> 02:34:03,740
really a loss for Niantic I guess not if they're just it's kind of like it's kind of like when

3431
02:34:03,740 --> 02:34:10,420
people leave World of Warcraft to go play overwatch is that really a loss for blizzard not really

3432
02:34:10,420 --> 02:34:15,380
because you're still kind of keeping them in the system keeping it in the fam so to speak so yeah

3433
02:34:15,380 --> 02:34:20,060
I don't know but um how are you feeling about it all act after what's that what's the impression

3434
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:27,460
from you as well as like your community well mostly my community has been someone liking it

3435
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:36,220
but but I understand also the frustration coming from the loss of people and friends that are

3436
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:44,900
playing right now because like for example the past bug out of band that lasted a week do you

3437
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:52,900
get any like shiny from from it from which event I didn't get any from the last one yeah from the

3438
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:58,780
bug bug out of and from oh the bug event no I didn't get any I I'm sorry when he was saying

3439
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:04,700
that real fat I was like is that a bag on I got no no the bug event I ain't gaining I had well I

3440
02:35:04,700 --> 02:35:10,900
already had a shiny Caterpie I had that from before I got it in a research task but I know

3441
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:14,980
like Scyther was the new one no I did I saw Scyther's everywhere but I didn't get a shiny

3442
02:35:14,980 --> 02:35:20,220
yeah and many people were frustrated because of that because oh there they all wanted us

3443
02:35:20,220 --> 02:35:29,180
a shiny Scyther I managed to get one and I was like really really lucky but so many people even

3444
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:36,580
in my my personal raid group like we're really really frustrated they were like oh I'm tired

3445
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:45,980
of this I don't want to do this every every single week like per se because if if you're not gonna

3446
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:53,300
get like new content we're not gonna get like that really really big chance of getting a shiny

3447
02:35:53,380 --> 02:35:59,900
and I understand that a shiny it's like a really really lucky occurrence it shouldn't be like oh

3448
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:07,700
they they just dust them around especially with this kind of events but still it's like there's

3449
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:17,460
no not gonna say pressure but there's no there's no really really great reward yeah or doing those

3450
02:36:17,460 --> 02:36:23,780
events so yeah you just play normally I think Pokemon go could really benefit from like a

3451
02:36:23,780 --> 02:36:29,020
crafting system sort of thing like a way and you know not maybe like literally the way you might

3452
02:36:29,020 --> 02:36:34,100
interpret what I'm when I say that but like you know a way to sort of guarantee that you can get

3453
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:40,980
a shiny Scyther if you do like a lot of work like you might still have a chance at it through RNG

3454
02:36:40,980 --> 02:36:46,300
but like you guarantee yourself one if you're willing to do a lure item for a shiny yeah well

3455
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:50,580
because they don't want to give out well I've heard that that might be something because somebody did

3456
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:55,980
data mining I've heard there is like a shiny it's either a is it a lure or an incense these an

3457
02:36:55,980 --> 02:36:59,980
incense thing that they're looking at doing like that would attract more shinies but I also

3458
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:06,660
realized Niantic doesn't want to necessarily give away shinies like candy because there's only so

3459
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:11,580
many and then like if somebody fills out a pokey Texas shinies then what you know like what's what's

3460
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:15,980
left to do in the game for some people so they want to keep people coming back so but I you know

3461
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:23,900
I think of things like the Meltan quest I took a long time to do or the what was the one the

3462
02:37:23,900 --> 02:37:29,900
Halloween by the way I know it's hard it's hard to find the Aerodactyl huh spirit orb I think I've

3463
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:35,380
had a bunch of Aerodactyls had a spear I just keep forgetting the transfer stuff to my let's go game

3464
02:37:35,380 --> 02:37:39,660
but um you know they had a question I think I think maybe if there was like some type of

3465
02:37:39,660 --> 02:37:43,300
questing or some other way you could like guarantee you to get a shiny if you do a lot

3466
02:37:43,300 --> 02:37:49,260
of work if you spin a stop every day if you're checking like I I think it would help I think

3467
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:53,780
with some of that so that at least you can still get the reward and not feel like you're just at

3468
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:59,820
the mercy of the random number generator yeah and I've seen concepts of that like the shiny

3469
02:37:59,820 --> 02:38:09,260
incense and also like in the main games that you can have a shiny charm so you could possibly get

3470
02:38:09,340 --> 02:38:16,900
they could reward it if if they they're planning on expanding levels like instead of 40 being the

3471
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:25,500
limit like 45 or 50 being the level limit they can probably reward the a shiny charm for yeah

3472
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:30,740
those getting levels or you know maybe maybe you'll hate me for putting this idea out in the

3473
02:38:30,740 --> 02:38:35,700
universe but one big thing they started doing in ingress when they released ingress prime is that

3474
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:41,420
now you can do something called recursion so if you were a max level agent in ingress level 16

3475
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:45,980
you could basically go back to the beginning you wouldn't lose your badge you wouldn't lose your

3476
02:38:45,980 --> 02:38:50,100
perks that come with the leveling you wouldn't lose like your badges or anything you wouldn't

3477
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:55,020
lose your lifetime AP is still track but basically you go back to level one and level again I

3478
02:38:55,020 --> 02:39:00,260
actually did it and I'm only on level 10 in the recursion process now so soft six levels to go

3479
02:39:00,260 --> 02:39:04,980
which can take me a very long time but my point is we're still waiting to see what the perk is

3480
02:39:04,980 --> 02:39:11,300
for recursing in the first place besides a shiny badge but what if they brought in a similar type

3481
02:39:11,300 --> 02:39:16,340
of system in Pokemon go where okay you've hit the max level you've gone as far as you can go in

3482
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:24,980
Pokemon go you can reset back to level one but you get a big reward like a shiny charm maybe would be

3483
02:39:24,980 --> 02:39:30,100
like your your reward for resetting back to level one I bet you there's people that would do it for

3484
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:39,460
a shiny charm Shane or maybe like a permanent incubator and a second permanent incubator for

3485
02:39:39,460 --> 02:39:43,980
recursing going back to the beginning there might be some people that would be really intrigued by

3486
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:50,020
that idea so I don't know this is something that I could I think when we talk about extra levels in

3487
02:39:50,020 --> 02:39:55,260
Pokemon go I have a feeling they might do something like the recursion from ingress instead or

3488
02:39:55,420 --> 02:40:01,820
prestige ing is how they call this in other games too and yeah that that would be actually awesome I

3489
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:09,580
would be down for that actually because even right now and as sj100 madison and shad you get to level

3490
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:17,020
40 and lucky x are like yeah I I don't need them I I have no use for them I have like almost like

3491
02:40:17,820 --> 02:40:22,540
more than 40 lucky x that I don't I don't use because I don't have the need for them

3492
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:29,740
so yeah having like recursive or or prestige whatever they want to call it yeah it would be

3493
02:40:29,740 --> 02:40:37,660
great because they I would be like more incentivized to play more because I would

3494
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:44,460
like to to get those rewards again at level 20 level 30 or even getting again to level 40

3495
02:40:45,020 --> 02:40:52,300
that that would be like really awesome that the game is fine right now it's it isn't

3496
02:40:52,300 --> 02:40:57,740
and like bobby buckwolf says also a dead game it isn't at all well he always says that just yeah

3497
02:40:58,460 --> 02:41:05,020
yeah he's that's the recurring joke there but but still that there's many people that think that

3498
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:13,660
and it it isn't but it's starting to feel like is it is going to be a dead game it won't it's

3499
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:19,980
starting to feel like a job and games shouldn't feel like a job yes and I see people that treat

3500
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:26,060
pokemon go and ingress as their job you know and it's like you just kind of like okay you don't

3501
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:31,500
want to let a game dictate that much you know what I mean it's it's really it's really kind

3502
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:36,220
of hard to watch that but um maybe niantic is listening and maybe would adapt some of these

3503
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:40,300
ideas I think that would be very exciting but I will say this you know despite this conversation

3504
02:41:40,300 --> 02:41:43,580
about some of the troubles of pokemon go I don't know about your neck of the woods but like

3505
02:41:43,580 --> 02:41:49,020
community day yesterday down at capital park where I usually go it was it was hopping like it was

3506
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:52,620
more crowded yesterday and I've seen it in quite a while so I don't know if that's just because the

3507
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:59,340
weather was really good too or what but it was it was hopping yesterday oh yeah I've seen that

3508
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:06,380
effect on my neck on the woods were there server problems there's um not in the states yeah there

3509
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:12,140
were server problems in japan yeah yeah they they always happen in japan it's like they give

3510
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:17,260
they end up extending it and in japan what happens is because now they do it time zone by time zone

3511
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:22,300
who has the first time zones on the planet that region like australia asia they get the first

3512
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:28,140
ones and so all the problems show up then yeah in japan it's always a given that it's going to fail

3513
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:33,980
that these at the first hour so yeah they always extend it they always do something like that

3514
02:42:33,980 --> 02:42:39,020
because it always fails because there's way too many people playing in japan yeah and not

3515
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:44,700
mentioning spoopers but yeah i was gonna say i didn't notice anything going on so no it was

3516
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:49,900
fine here but but california if you think about it we're one of the last areas to do community

3517
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:55,660
day because the only place on earth that has time zones later than us is like hawaii alaska

3518
02:42:55,660 --> 02:43:01,100
the hawaii and alaska would be the latter or earlier than us would be the no they're they

3519
02:43:01,260 --> 02:43:05,580
because they have to wait till it's three o'clock in their region so oh i see and they're behind so

3520
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:13,100
hawaii is like the last on the planet to do the community day basically yeah so yeah but but yeah

3521
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:20,140
going back to the community day thing it was pretty great the past two community days have been

3522
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:27,020
really packed their way there have been way more people than in previous community days and that

3523
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:33,500
has been awesome but something that is going to suck but really really suck is coming into the

3524
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:41,900
summer having the three to six time in a 110 degree weather i don't know if you caught me

3525
02:43:41,900 --> 02:43:46,620
i complained about this exact thing earlier i said they're gonna need to re-evaluate those times when

3526
02:43:46,620 --> 02:43:50,700
summer gets here because five o'clock is the hottest point of the day so either it needs to

3527
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:56,460
go back what do it in the morning or yeah they need to go back to the 11 am time frame or i'm

3528
02:43:56,460 --> 02:44:01,020
just gonna go play indoors like we have a mall here that has 10 pokestops it's enough

3529
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:07,820
yeah that's what we're planning to on on on possibly torture community day

3530
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:15,820
we're going to the mall it has four five pokestops too and two gyms so we're gonna be fine

3531
02:44:15,820 --> 02:44:23,180
there there's tons of pokies uh pokemon spawning there so so yeah because in the summer at least

3532
02:44:23,180 --> 02:44:30,700
we would have endured the first hour and a half um being outside at the middle of the day but

3533
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:38,220
still it would have been uh like okay we can we can endure it but three to six is gonna be like

3534
02:44:38,780 --> 02:44:43,740
hell literally hell because it's gonna be way too hot you know what i'm thinking i'm like while

3535
02:44:43,740 --> 02:44:49,100
it's on my mind i'm like next time i go to galleria i need to submit more ingress portals

3536
02:44:49,100 --> 02:44:53,020
there so that way by the time summer rolls around maybe there'll be some more pokestops

3537
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:59,900
like kind of help myself in advance that's what i'm thinking too that's what i'm thinking with

3538
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:07,100
my brother since his level 10 ah we can make more portals there yeah go get him to submit some

3539
02:45:07,100 --> 02:45:11,180
portals at the mall get ready for that because those take a few months to go through so get

3540
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:15,580
working on that yeah all right all right my friend i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show

3541
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:19,100
but thank you for calling in i appreciate that and uh it's always good to talk to you and have

3542
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:24,860
a great week okay hey thanks for having me and good luck with shiny latios thank you i'll try

3543
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:31,100
my best take care buddy thanks all right always good to hear from act theft and i think uh i think

3544
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:34,540
on that note that's probably the i didn't see anybody else in the green room waiting so i think

3545
02:45:34,540 --> 02:45:39,980
we'll probably wrap up on that note but thanks of course to everybody who's uh listening live

3546
02:45:39,980 --> 02:45:43,260
tonight and participating and of course if you're listening on the podcast feed or watching the

3547
02:45:43,260 --> 02:45:49,020
twitch archive then that is all fine and dandy too we appreciate that as well um hey if you

3548
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:52,860
enjoyed what you heard here at orange lawns radio tonight tell a friend or two about the show help

3549
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:56,700
us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't

3550
02:45:56,700 --> 02:46:01,180
here to chat with us how can we possibly get all the opinions out there we need people who want

3551
02:46:01,180 --> 02:46:05,020
to pay for dlc to unlock everything in the game we need more of those types of opinions and the

3552
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:09,740
the other sorts of takes there and if you only have one friend then tell your one friend yes

3553
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:15,500
and or or leave us a nice five star review on a place like itunes or google play or um you know

3554
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:20,620
a nice uh twitch hosting i really can't tell you how far that stuff goes and helping like twitch

3555
02:46:20,620 --> 02:46:26,380
hosts and five star reviews on podcast apps are like the number one way to like help this grow

3556
02:46:26,380 --> 02:46:30,700
and of course we're buying me a pizza no buying jamie a pizza will do nothing that's just something

3557
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:37,260
she wants but making me happy makes me uh have more incentive to do things anyway although

3558
02:46:37,260 --> 02:46:41,340
staying in bed also works all right well uh we're gonna go around and give everybody's final

3559
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:44,860
thought because we're about to wrap up for the week here uh dark soccer will not be joining us

3560
02:46:44,860 --> 02:46:49,420
next week as she has her easter commitments in the golden gate park in san francisco and i'm

3561
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:57,660
gonna be old oh too old and happy early birthday and none of that none of that on your birthday

3562
02:46:58,700 --> 02:47:05,580
i'm gonna be doing none of anything all right but happy birthday thank you remember when we were

3563
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:10,780
kids and we first met no i'm too old to remember it was the olr my god i was how old was i when

3564
02:47:10,780 --> 02:47:16,620
our last started like 24 it's crazy i was still older just not not by much so i think i was still

3565
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:21,820
in my yeah i was in my 20s all right um let's go around to everybody's final thought dark soccer

3566
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:26,300
will start with you have a good week off next week we'll miss you but our what our aim will continue

3567
02:47:26,300 --> 02:47:33,420
to improve uh cadbury creme eggs speaking of eggs and this is my final thought deer animal crossing

3568
02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:40,700
put more of these fucking eggs where i can find them i need 150 more so i can get the stupid bunny

3569
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:46,620
and get more fucking leaves leaf tickets or points or whatever shit they're called

3570
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:52,220
frodo swagans wants to know what day is your birthday the 19th 19th i will it will officially

3571
02:47:52,220 --> 02:47:58,140
be at whatever 2 a.m is central time all right fair enough i was born into central time

3572
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:03,260
uh loki so that would actually be midnight here the day before if you think about it i

3573
02:48:03,260 --> 02:48:08,140
think that 4 a.m um central so it'd be 2 a.m here okay it's 4 a.m yeah 2 a.m here

3574
02:48:08,940 --> 02:48:15,580
i was also born early in the morning i was a 5 a.m baby i woke up my mama labor because i'm a brat

3575
02:48:16,380 --> 02:48:21,660
all right um listen i'll do my final thought my final thought tonight is um i'm gonna try to get

3576
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:26,540
to at least level 20 in borderlands and keep my going my way through the story and probably hit

3577
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:30,780
level 70 on all the healers and palm asi 14 as well that'll probably be my week and then i have

3578
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:34,380
to think about what i want to play after that because i'm not sure yet uh loki your final

3579
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:41,500
thought i'll probably finish the other two toy con things that i have still for labo vr and i'll try

3580
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:51,660
to roll back my uh insane borderland save hacking to it it's a damn game because it crashes whenever

3581
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:58,940
i go to the actual uh perk screen and that's what causes the crash every time for no reason and so

3582
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:04,460
and it's apparently this bug is not necessarily just from what i've been doing it's related to

3583
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:10,540
the phys x and it's also from the original game like the original release and so it's a bug that

3584
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:16,220
they've had in there they patched out and then remastered the bug um so yeah that's what we'll

3585
02:49:16,220 --> 02:49:22,540
be doing this week mr smoosh sounds like he's in heat uh he does that all the time he's just

3586
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:26,060
screaming in the other room would you know something like that used to happen for becky

3587
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:31,260
because i would hack her mass effect save file so like she could use like one of the hairstyles

3588
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:36,060
that's programmed into the game but it wasn't available mr smoosh screaming still is like what

3589
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:42,540
what you hacked the cat no and had the cat i like mr smoosh me too i just wish he'd scream
