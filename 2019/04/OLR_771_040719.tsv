7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	16000	This week you got your Apex and my Fortnite
16000	18000	From downtown, in my rage
18000	20000	Your Mario and my little big planet
20000	21000	And your VR and my Switch
21000	23000	We've read through the fools and hope it's all legit
23000	25000	To bring you tonight's news starting right now on the show
25000	27000	Where every gamer has a voice
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	34000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
34000	36000	Welcome back to another week of the show
36000	38000	Where every gamer has a voice
38000	40000	It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight
40000	42000	Live with episode number 771
42000	45000	For this April the 7th of 2019
45000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts
47000	49000	And joining me in studio
49000	51000	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
51000	52000	I'm so full
52000	53000	You're full?
53000	54000	Yeah
54000	55000	Of those cookies that you brought to the studio tonight
55000	57000	Well I meant to save one
57000	59000	But I ate it
59000	61000	She was going to give us a cookie
61000	63000	But she ate it
63000	65000	They came out black
65000	66000	Or gray
66000	69000	Because I made raspberry and blackberry puree
69000	71000	And when I added it to the batter
71000	73000	It turned gray and got really sticky
73000	75000	So I had to add more flour
75000	77000	So I don't know if I'm going to make them again
77000	79000	Because the first bite's like sugar cookie and then raspberry flavor
79000	81000	It turned out good though
81000	83000	It did but I like my sugar cookies
83000	85000	But I'm not doing any more dandelion cookies this season either
85000	87000	Speaking of our raspberry cookies
87000	89000	Would you allow the Twitch folks to see the back of your head
89000	91000	Because it's a very lovely red color
91000	93000	This isn't raspberry though
93000	95000	I know it's a little lighter than raspberry
95000	97000	But I like the color
97000	99000	This is flamingo
99000	101000	This is orange and peach
101000	103000	You can't really see
103000	105000	This is where my head was shaved
105000	107000	Well and for the podcast listeners
107000	109000	They can't see anything anyway
109000	111000	Sucks to be you
111000	113000	I didn't say that they suck
113000	115000	I said it sucks to be them
115000	117000	Since they can't see the gloriousity
117000	119000	Of my you know
119000	121000	My hair
121000	123000	Well if you want to see the gloriousity of hair

157000	159000	Is there something good on the house I should be paying attention to?
159000	161000	No I just have to get rid of all these
161000	163000	Great and whatever
163000	165000	Oh like the quest you have to make so many
165000	167000	No I just have so many of them
167000	169000	I'm taking out my inventory space and normally I just throw them away
169000	171000	So you know might as well
171000	173000	Gotcha you got too many balls
173000	175000	Robin he's throwing away his blue balls
175000	177000	Too many balls
177000	179000	I don't want to know about yellow balls
179000	181000	Over in our chat
181000	183000	Over at Twitch TV slash vog network

185000	187000	And you guys can join us in our chat room
187000	189000	Bobby Black Wolf suggesting that somebody could make a clip
189000	191000	Of the hair thing and then
191000	193000	Cause yeah there are clips of our show
193000	195000	And Bobby's show
195000	197000	We have a little archive cause that's a little something special
197000	199000	You can see it free of course when we broadcast live on Sunday
199000	201000	But you can subscribe using your
201000	203000	Twitch Prime subscription or any of the
203000	205000	Twitch subscription offers they have there
205000	207000	And you will get access
207000	209000	To the complete video library so you can watch
209000	211000	A video episode if you want
211000	213000	Audio only of course is free as it's always been
213000	215000	For coming up on 17 years
215000	217000	But the clips that people make
217000	219000	Are free
219000	221000	So you can see little like 30 second clips of our show
221000	223000	Some people clip random things too
223000	225000	I think some people just accidentally clip the button
225000	227000	Cause they'll be like these random I'm like why did somebody
227000	229000	Clip that it's just us I mean
229000	231000	It's not like yeah but there's
231000	233000	Also clips of things that are like
233000	235000	You know funny moments or like when
235000	237000	Smoosh came on camera that one night or whatever
237000	239000	So things happen
239000	241000	It's part of the magic of doing Twitch since
241000	243000	We did move over in December
243000	245000	From Shoutcast where we were beforehand
245000	247000	Anyway let's get
247000	249000	Into our kickoff topic tonight let's talk about
249000	251000	Let's talk about anniversaries
251000	253000	It's a little bit different of a kickoff topic
253000	255000	Usually we would talk about you know some
255000	257000	New gaming story or what's
257000	259000	Going on in the news and there is a little bit going on in the
259000	261000	Gaming news this week although it's probably slowed down
261000	263000	A little bit from last
263000	265000	Week because of
265000	267000	You know there's no PAX this week
267000	269000	Or GDC I think everything's calming down a little bit
269000	271000	But we do have a big anniversary
271000	273000	That we're looking at this week and that is
273000	275000	Final Fantasy 6
275000	277000	Celebrating it's 25th anniversary
277000	279000	Now of course I'm sure
279000	281000	Many of you guys that consume
281000	283000	Gaming podcasts are probably aware at this
283000	285000	Point that here in the US
285000	287000	We received Final Fantasy 6
287000	289000	As Final Fantasy 3
289000	291000	So sometimes this is called Final Fantasy 3 US
291000	293000	We received it as that but
293000	295000	This is in the true Final Fantasy
295000	297000	Canon it's the 6th game and
297000	299000	25 years ago on April
299000	301000	2nd so this week in
301000	303000	1994 Final Fantasy
303000	305000	6 was released in Japan
305000	307000	We got it a little bit later because
307000	309000	Back then you know it wasn't
309000	311000	Such a global economy
311000	313000	The internet had not yet taken off
313000	315000	I think the internet was probably still government in 94
315000	317000	I don't think you could do internet on Prodigy
317000	319000	Or AOL that stuff yet
319000	321000	94? Not yet
321000	323000	Almost there right? No you had AOL
323000	325000	Remember I met Dan
325000	327000	In my first year on AOL
327000	329000	In 93, 94 was
329000	331000	AOL 1.5 which was the DOS based
331000	333000	I thought it was more like after I graduated high school in 96
333000	335000	But I think it was still
335000	337000	We can say it was still very niche and not a lot of people were
337000	339000	I was in college
339000	341000	But anyway
341000	343000	Regardless Final Fantasy 6 came out
343000	345000	25 years ago and obviously
345000	347000	A lot of people
347000	349000	Remember this game very fondly
349000	351000	Although we sometimes joke about
351000	353000	Super Nintendo releases and
353000	355000	What's better Super Metroid or
355000	357000	Chrono Trigger or
357000	359000	We razzed maybe other games
359000	361000	Of Final Fantasy series like you guys know I have my
361000	363000	Issues of Final Fantasy 8 and so forth
363000	365000	All that tongue and cheek
365000	367000	Talk aside I think
367000	369000	Generally most people regard this
369000	371000	As especially in
371000	373000	Our age group of gamers
373000	375000	And that's an important footnote to make
375000	377000	You know the late 30's early 40's
377000	379000	Probably a good range outside of that too
379000	381000	I think there's a generation almost that would consider
381000	383000	Even if maybe Final Fantasy 6 isn't
383000	385000	Your favorite game
385000	387000	It's probably one of your favorite
387000	389000	Games if you're a role play
389000	391000	Person if you're more of a sports gamer
391000	393000	Maybe it's not in your list but I know a lot
393000	395000	Of people that would be Final Fantasy 10
395000	397000	If you're a sports game oh for Blitzball
397000	399000	Heck yeah come on San Arc and Abe's yeah right
399000	401000	But anyway
401000	403000	I think this game certainly left an impact
403000	405000	On a lot of people
405000	407000	Dark Sakura you know since you were
407000	409000	On the internet earlier and I know you're a big retro
409000	411000	Gamer and a big gamer girl
411000	413000	All the way back in college and so forth
413000	415000	What was your memories with
415000	417000	Final Fantasy 6?
417000	419000	Pretending to have the flu for a week so I could beat it
419000	421000	After I rented it
421000	423000	So you rented the game
423000	425000	You didn't even I rented it and you held on to it
425000	427000	For an entire week that's a lot of late fees
427000	429000	No I
429000	431000	Renewed my rental the place that we were renting our
431000	433000	Video games from you could rent for a week oh that's
433000	435000	Oh nice and so cause I wasn't running through
435000	437000	Blockbuster we were doing like little mom and pops
437000	439000	Yeah I rented cause I worked for
439000	441000	Mom and pops I usually rented through there too but
441000	443000	Yeah but I
443000	445000	Played the shit out of it
445000	447000	And I actually
447000	449000	Started over after the
449000	451000	Minecart level and then
451000	453000	Just started completely over and just
453000	455000	Zoomed right up till then and then
455000	457000	Got through it I don't know why I think it was
457000	459000	Just that motion sickness thing I've had cause I had
459000	461000	I just couldn't do it at all
461000	463000	Got so pissed that I put it away for a day
463000	465000	Went back started over and beat the
465000	467000	Whole game in the rest of the week and
467000	469000	It was absolutely amazing and then I
469000	471000	Finally got my own copy
471000	473000	I remember
473000	475000	Watching a friend in high school
475000	477000	Play it because you know my family
477000	479000	Was pretty middle class so it's like
479000	481000	We didn't really get the games when they first
481000	483000	Came out or that was a real treat like when I got
483000	485000	Mortal Kombat on Mortal Monday or whatever
485000	487000	It was that was a freaking treat cause
487000	489000	I usually didn't get games on the release day so I didn't get
489000	491000	Final Fantasy 3 I didn't even I somehow didn't
491000	493000	Even realize the game was coming out and I was over at a
493000	495000	Friends house one day and
495000	497000	We were about to do I used to do
497000	499000	D&D in high school so we were about to do a D&D
499000	501000	Thing and I walk in and they're playing
501000	503000	I'm like oh my gosh this
503000	505000	Is like Final Fantasy 2
505000	507000	But because remember I didn't I wasn't
507000	509000	As aware of what was going on in Japan and everything
509000	511000	I'm like this is Final Fantasy 2 but like
511000	513000	Like oh my gosh I'm just like watching
513000	515000	Like dumbfounded the entire time because
515000	517000	There's like the mechs and the different
517000	519000	I think he was at the point in the game where you
519000	521000	Had Edgar and Sabin and
521000	523000	So he was showing off how you could put like in the
523000	525000	Controller input cause remember with Sabin it's like
525000	527000	He did a little Hadouken and he would actually do
527000	529000	Was it that was one move?
529000	531000	I think so. You know there was like the controller input moves
531000	533000	And it was like oh my gosh it's like a
533000	535000	Fighting game not really but you know
535000	537000	When you're 13 you're thinking those types of things right
537000	539000	It's a fighting game and then
539000	541000	Of course Edgar had the tools right
541000	543000	So he had like the chainsaw
543000	545000	And the so it was like
545000	547000	Yeah the autocrossbow the gas
547000	549000	Thing the bio weapon or whatever
549000	551000	And so it was like getting to see all that for the first
551000	553000	Time was like oh my gosh it's so cool
553000	555000	And so like I knew I had to have it and so I
555000	557000	You know begged and I ugly begged
557000	559000	I was like what did they get? So finally
559000	561000	For Christmas that year I got that game
561000	563000	And I just I played it like
563000	565000	Every single day until I beat it
565000	567000	I think part of me as a
567000	569000	Kid is still a little more
569000	571000	Fond of Final Fantasy 2 or what
571000	573000	Would be 4 of course in canon
573000	575000	Just because that was like the first one
575000	577000	I played and especially like the
577000	579000	Story from start to finish
579000	581000	Because I don't know why but Final Fantasy
581000	583000	6's ending
583000	585000	Was always a little weirder to me
585000	587000	Like that I think it's
587000	589000	Let me kind of rephrase this
589000	591000	Because I think it's something I've grown to appreciate
591000	593000	In my older years
593000	595000	As I did versus when I would have first
595000	597000	Played through this game you know
597000	599000	Many years ago when I was like
599000	601000	13
601000	603000	Is that I seem to remember
603000	605000	Actually no I would have been ordering 13
605000	607000	Because this game was out when I was in high school and it's
607000	609000	What 25 years ago so I was more like 15, 16
609000	611000	But I didn't
611000	613000	Like the way like at the end you
613000	615000	Split up into the 3 parties
615000	617000	And he had to kind of go through that way
617000	619000	And then like everybody
619000	621000	Kind of had like a little piece of an
621000	623000	Ending and then like if you didn't have
623000	625000	Somebody you wouldn't see their piece
625000	627000	Because there's somebody I didn't
627000	629000	Oh I think it was Shadow I didn't have Shadow
629000	631000	You have to wait for him
631000	633000	Well right but I didn't know that
633000	635000	Wait for his late diva ass
635000	637000	Right so I didn't know that when I was
637000	639000	A teenager actually you know the
639000	641000	As a teenager do you know what I remember
641000	643000	About Final Fantasy 6
643000	645000	Like something I interpreted in the script
645000	647000	That like nobody else took away from it
647000	649000	And I know this is wrong but when I first
649000	651000	Played the game I thought that
651000	653000	One of the flashback scenes with
653000	655000	Realm and
657000	659000	What was the older guys name
659000	661000	Her grandfather
661000	663000	Whose name I can't remember in the moment but somebody will
663000	665000	Yell it out in chat shortly
665000	667000	I thought that Shadow was Realms mom
667000	669000	Notice I didn't say dad
669000	671000	I said mom
671000	673000	I thought that was like the twist
673000	675000	Because ninja why not a female ninja
675000	677000	Thank you strago
677000	679000	So why not a female ninja
679000	681000	And I don't know what it was in the script if there was like a
681000	683000	Pronoun I misread or something I don't know but I thought
683000	685000	Like for years
685000	687000	That Shadow was Realms mom
687000	689000	Until somebody was like
689000	691000	No no no like it's actually
691000	693000	Maybe her dad but it's not really said
693000	695000	I would have
695000	697000	I'm now going to head canon that it's her mom
697000	699000	Because we don't really know
699000	701000	If Shadow is actually a dude
701000	703000	Ultros was her mom
703000	705000	Alright what are you
705000	707000	You played through this game right
707000	709000	Yeah I rented it from Blockbuster
709000	711000	I did I think
711000	713000	I'm pretty sure I did I know I didn't own it
713000	715000	But I had it long enough to play through it and beat it
715000	717000	And I did
717000	719000	And it was great
719000	721000	I think I rented it multiple times
721000	723000	And just
723000	725000	Everything about it was fantastic and I must have
725000	727000	Played it like
727000	729000	Over the course of a weekend or something to finish it but
729000	731000	In a weekend
731000	733000	I remember that game took like 60 hours
733000	735000	To beat or something I don't know
735000	737000	But it was yeah I was
737000	739000	I just remember the end on it
739000	741000	But I don't know
741000	743000	How long it took me to do it but
743000	745000	It was fun
745000	747000	So if y'all have an SNES classic
747000	749000	I mean that's probably the easiest way to play this game now
749000	751000	Well let's talk a little bit about you know
751000	753000	Because to tie this into some more recent news
753000	755000	And things we've been talking about on the show more recently
755000	757000	You know we seem to think
757000	759000	That we might be standing on
759000	761000	Looking at the future of gaming
761000	763000	Where things are going to go more streaming
763000	765000	And so forth
765000	767000	And it's not like you know Super Nintendos are gonna suddenly
767000	769000	Wilt up and die and those things
769000	771000	Especially can take a beating right
771000	773000	Well I mean that's just what
773000	775000	They're pushing for console
775000	777000	Gaming and stuff but it doesn't mean that anybody's actually
777000	779000	It doesn't mean it's gonna take off
779000	781000	You know like they may say that
781000	783000	We wanna go this route but if no one buys
783000	785000	The system or no one pays into it
785000	787000	They're not gonna continue with it
787000	789000	So I'm not really worried
789000	791000	That it's going streaming because
791000	793000	There's still PC
793000	795000	There's still retro
795000	797000	You know if you don't like what
797000	799000	The new game's coming out on your streaming
799000	801000	Platform or if it's just
801000	803000	Not gonna work because you don't have the bandwidth
803000	805000	Or the bandwidth caps
805000	807000	For it then
807000	809000	I'm sure you'll find ways around it
809000	811000	When we're looking at 25
811000	813000	Years from now do you think
813000	815000	The only way people are going to be able to experience
815000	817000	Final Fantasy 6 is
817000	819000	By finding
819000	821000	Grandma at that point or Grandpa's old
821000	823000	Super Nintendo and playing
823000	825000	The actual cartridge or do you think
825000	827000	No emulators come on
827000	829000	So emulators
829000	831000	All of a sudden they're gonna find a way
831000	833000	To wipe those off the internet this time
833000	835000	I guess that's true I don't
835000	837000	Maybe because I think of the full experience
837000	839000	As plopping down in front of the TV
839000	841000	With a controller but you're right
841000	843000	Why can't you do an emulator on the TV thanks
843000	845000	To the
845000	847000	Little computers in a box and the USB
847000	849000	Stick which name escapes me at the moment
849000	851000	Raspberry Pi
851000	853000	And all those things
853000	855000	And I'm sure that technology's gonna just get even more
855000	857000	Yeah they're gonna get more powerful
857000	859000	And it's just gonna be
859000	861000	You'll be able to play all those old games
861000	863000	That you want
863000	865000	Just because there's new games coming out
865000	867000	Doesn't mean we have to only play those new games
867000	869000	Otherwise we wouldn't be remastering
869000	871000	Borderlands 1
871000	873000	Or doing all this stuff
873000	875000	I think it's just
875000	877000	Good games are gonna be good games no matter what
877000	879000	And that's why everyone's saying
879000	881000	Well it's all gonna go the streamy route
881000	883000	But indies
883000	885000	Can't necessarily afford to maybe
885000	887000	Be on those streaming platforms so they're gonna do
887000	889000	Things differently
889000	891000	Unless there was a do it yourself solution
891000	893000	Like YouTube
893000	895000	There will be ways
895000	897000	To put yourself on different
897000	899000	Platforms but it doesn't mean that's the only
899000	901000	Way to do it and they're gonna
901000	903000	Fill the void of so it's not gonna be
903000	905000	That this is gonna be the only
905000	907000	Way you do it it's only gonna be streaming
907000	909000	You're not really gonna purchase anything you're only gonna have
909000	911000	Licensing to it or something maybe the
911000	913000	Wrong thing to say is the only way but
913000	915000	Especially again you know not to repeat this conversation
915000	917000	Too much when we go look at the film industry
917000	919000	I think and we see like a lot of it is
919000	921000	Netflix and these sorts of things now maybe
921000	923000	The primary consumption method is
923000	925000	Streaming and physical
925000	927000	Blu-rays and DVDs are more
927000	929000	Collectible keepsake they're more
929000	931000	Collectibles they're more the secondary way to
931000	933000	Do things right I guess you could
933000	935000	Do it that way but if it's gonna be like
935000	937000	You know the film industry that we're gonna
937000	939000	Have Square Enix's streaming service
939000	941000	We're gonna have Nintendo
941000	943000	Streaming service Microsoft streaming service
943000	945000	Sony EA Activision
945000	947000	All of them wanting their own I think
947000	949000	I think especially on the TV I think things are gonna
949000	951000	Break with that eventually I think you're gonna
951000	953000	See mergers and things you know
953000	955000	Oh you're gonna see piracy is what you're gonna see
955000	957000	Because people are gonna get tired of it
957000	959000	Lots of great comments in our chat
959000	961000	Over at twitch.tv slash vog network
961000	963000	And Bobby Blackwolf saying
963000	965000	Google wants to dumb down
965000	967000	Your computer enough to make it a dumb terminal
967000	969000	Where the actual computing power is in a server
969000	971000	Farm so the new computers of the future
971000	973000	Wouldn't have the horse power to run an emulator
973000	975000	Well a super
975000	977000	Nintendo emulator in this day and age can run on your
977000	979000	Phone you know what I mean but I get what
979000	981000	You're saying they're kind of tongue in cheek when it comes to Stadia
981000	983000	And things no I get what they're trying to do too
983000	985000	They're lowering the cost of computing
985000	987000	For like people to get
987000	989000	Into that so like say I don't want
989000	991000	To drop several thousand dollars on whatever
991000	993000	I can buy a Chromebook or well
993000	995000	And also something we we really
995000	997000	Always need to be aware of is that we're
997000	999000	In the United States we're in California
999000	1001000	Computers and being able to go pick one up
1001000	1003000	Is kind of a part of our culture but you go
1003000	1005000	To many other countries throughout the
1005000	1007000	World and computers are
1007000	1009000	Not something that's just
1009000	1011000	Assumed everybody has in fact
1011000	1013000	It's a rarity you don't see computers but I'm
1013000	1015000	Never gonna buy a Chromebook for
1015000	1017000	Like playing games that's never
1017000	1019000	Gonna be a thought that ever goes through
1019000	1021000	My mind because if I'm gonna build a
1021000	1023000	PC to play games on whether it be
1023000	1025000	Buying a laptop or something it's gonna have
1025000	1027000	The horse power to play games I'm not gonna
1027000	1029000	Well I'll just buy a Chromebook
1029000	1031000	Because it essentially does nothing without
1031000	1033000	You know Google you know
1033000	1035000	So I just
1035000	1037000	I would never do that but
1037000	1039000	There's other people that Chromebooks are
1039000	1041000	A good option like for example I have a
1041000	1043000	Co-worker that is retiring and she
1043000	1045000	Wants a computer that can she can check email
1045000	1047000	And do Facebook and I'm like
1047000	1049000	Chromebook is your way to go because
1049000	1051000	That's all that shit does
1051000	1053000	That was that was my mom when she was still
1053000	1055000	With us is that she just
1055000	1057000	Wanted to do email and she wanted to
1057000	1059000	Be able to look at her kids on Facebook
1059000	1061000	That's all she yeah and so for that I mean
1061000	1063000	And she's like well maybe I should get a Mac
1063000	1065000	Even email I feel like is
1065000	1067000	Starting to fade away it doesn't seem
1067000	1069000	Like email is going away in favor of things like
1069000	1071000	I hate to say it Facebook Messenger but Facebook
1071000	1073000	Messenger is huge but I also see
1073000	1075000	Other I feel like things like Telegram
1075000	1077000	And some of those are starting to gain a lot of speed too
1077000	1079000	Well I don't think
1079000	1081000	Email is not going anywhere but
1081000	1083000	I think that
1083000	1085000	You know for there's a market
1085000	1087000	Physical mail is not going anywhere either
1087000	1089000	But like the only thing that I welcome
1089000	1091000	Getting in the physical mail anymore is
1091000	1093000	Packages like stuff I bought on the internet
1093000	1095000	That's it it's true yeah
1095000	1097000	But I don't know
1097000	1099000	I just think that it's not going to be
1099000	1101000	They want you to
1101000	1103000	Be convinced that this is going to be the next
1103000	1105000	Big thing because they want the investors
1105000	1107000	To be excited about it and they want
1107000	1109000	People to be excited about so they jump into
1109000	1111000	It but let's just see what it actually
1111000	1113000	Is by the time it actually comes
1113000	1115000	Out and how wonderful it is because
1115000	1117000	If you may remember not that long ago
1117000	1119000	When they were talking about the PlayStation
1119000	1121000	3 or I think it was the PlayStation 3
1121000	1123000	That it was going to be you know
1123000	1125000	1080p
1125000	1127000	Full native 1080p 120
1127000	1129000	Frames per second it's just going to be this
1129000	1131000	Monster of a system that was going to be super
1131000	1133000	It just it fucking wasn't so it's like
1133000	1135000	The same thing with
1135000	1137000	They overhype everything
1137000	1139000	And then it comes out and then they have to lower their
1139000	1141000	Lower your expectations to what it actually
1141000	1143000	Can do so let's just wait and see what
1143000	1145000	It can actually do before we
1145000	1147000	You know start predicting where the industry
1147000	1149000	Is going because who gives a shit where the industry
1149000	1151000	Is going we're just going to go with it
1151000	1153000	Dialing back to Final Fantasy 6 a little bit
1153000	1155000	Since that was what this is originally about
1155000	1157000	I would love to see this game remade
1157000	1159000	Well it has been Loki
1159000	1161000	Well I meant remade like
1161000	1163000	I meant remade in sense like Final Fantasy 7
1163000	1165000	Is being remade type of thing
1165000	1167000	Oh you want to see it but I don't know if it would
1167000	1169000	I don't know if you can ever like
1169000	1171000	Lightning strike twice with
1171000	1173000	The Final Fantasy 6 like you know obviously
1173000	1175000	The recent mobile
1175000	1177000	Support they did was not good
1177000	1179000	Or I would even take
1179000	1181000	A new Final Fantasy game
1181000	1183000	Done in the style of Final Fantasy 6
1183000	1185000	We don't need 3D polygons
1185000	1187000	In like real time battles and shit like that
1187000	1189000	Just you know drop
1189000	1191000	Down because that doesn't cost
1191000	1193000	As much to develop
1193000	1195000	Didn't they kind of do that with the Final Fantasy 15
1195000	1197000	Damn it I can't remember the name of it
1197000	1199000	But it was basically like it was like a
1199000	1201000	Earlier throwback
1201000	1203000	Well they also did the after years for Final Fantasy 4
1203000	1205000	So that was like that
1205000	1207000	And if you got that on the WiiWare it was like
1207000	1209000	It was like you were playing Final Fantasy 2
1209000	1211000	Slash 4 like graphics
1211000	1213000	There was some good comments so I want to make sure
1213000	1215000	I got a couple other of these because
1215000	1217000	ActDeft in our chatroom said that eventually
1217000	1219000	And I lost the original comment but he had made the point
1219000	1221000	That oh yeah games eventually will fall
1221000	1223000	In the public domain too
1223000	1225000	So after so many years
1225000	1227000	You're not really pirating the game anymore
1227000	1229000	Because it's in the public domain
1229000	1231000	But it doesn't get really complicated though
1231000	1233000	Unfortunately the game was made in Japan
1233000	1235000	But I guess since it was put out in the US
1235000	1237000	As Final Fantasy 3 I guess there's
1237000	1239000	A certain term
1239000	1241000	But you can thank Disney for continuing to
1241000	1243000	Push that term back
1243000	1245000	Because Mickey Mouse
1245000	1247000	Mickey Mouse should have been public domain by now
1247000	1249000	But he's not
1249000	1251000	So kind of interesting how that all works
1251000	1253000	Well it's because he's also their trademark
1253000	1255000	So you got trademark issues too
1255000	1257000	But Bobby Blackwolf
1257000	1259000	Pointing out the new Dragon Quest
1259000	1261000	Does that if you'd played that on 3DS
1261000	1263000	It had the top screen and bottom screen
1263000	1265000	And I think with the whole
1265000	1267000	Switch port they're doing something with that too
1267000	1269000	Obviously it's not top screen and bottom screen but like a button
1269000	1271000	To switch between the two
1271000	1273000	So some people do dig their retro modes
1273000	1275000	Dragon Quest is a pretty good game as well
1275000	1277000	So
1277000	1279000	Yeah Questbuster says
1279000	1281000	I wanted that 16 bit Final Fantasy
1281000	1283000	13 that Square Enix made
1283000	1285000	A trailer of to explain the story
1285000	1287000	TigerClawnChat says
1287000	1289000	Some games will get in the public domain
1289000	1291000	But some of the more bigger ones they will continue to make games
1291000	1293000	For those as long as they are around
1293000	1295000	You know I'm almost starting to feel like about
1295000	1297000	Video game remakes though kind of finishing up
1297000	1299000	That thought as I am some of the movie remakes
1299000	1301000	Like some of them can be really good
1301000	1303000	But a lot of them
1303000	1305000	Are not good and something like okay like the
1305000	1307000	Borderlands remaster where they just basically
1307000	1309000	Went in and put out
1309000	1311000	4k textures and didn't really change the game
1311000	1313000	I would consider that more like a
1313000	1315000	Criterion collection
1315000	1317000	Release of an old movie
1317000	1319000	They're not trying to redo the movie
1319000	1321000	It's not a remake it's a remaster
1321000	1323000	Exactly
1323000	1325000	They did change a few things
1325000	1327000	A lot of video game remakes are kind of
1327000	1329000	Not Resident Evil 2 though
1329000	1331000	That was freaking amazing
1331000	1333000	There's a few diamonds in the rough and I liked
1333000	1335000	Blaster Master Zero even though other people
1335000	1337000	Had their problem with it and I would say not
1337000	1339000	Every movie remake was bad
1339000	1341000	Although most of them are I'm trying to think of a good
1341000	1343000	Movie remake
1343000	1345000	The new stars born was incredible
1345000	1347000	So you know
1347000	1349000	It's not Barbara
1349000	1351000	Or Judy Garland
1351000	1353000	I kind of thought it was better
1353000	1355000	There were as many motorcycle accidents in it as there
1355000	1357000	Was in the previous version
1357000	1359000	There's no way I'm going to answer that question
1359000	1361000	I actually think that the Total Recall remake
1361000	1363000	Which is actually I think off the original
1363000	1365000	Story
1365000	1367000	Honestly it's arguably a better
1367000	1369000	Movie than the Arnold one
1369000	1371000	Even if it doesn't have the cult following
1371000	1373000	The original one did
1373000	1375000	Not Spielberg
1375000	1377000	Miniseries, Stephen King
1377000	1379000	Miniseries, some people swear that the
1379000	1381000	Miniseries they did on The Shining is actually better than
1381000	1383000	The movie because it was more faithful to the book
1383000	1385000	Stephen King actually signed off on
1385000	1387000	The Shining
1387000	1389000	Well Stephen King also signed off on the end of
1389000	1391000	The Mist and that was a poor decision
1391000	1393000	That's true too
1393000	1395000	But then they made The Mist a TV show
1395000	1397000	Isn't The Mist a TV show now I think
1397000	1399000	I thought I heard something about
1400000	1402000	Not that I watch TV anyway
1402000	1404000	I know I so rarely do anymore these days
1404000	1406000	And then what else
1406000	1408000	Every Animal Crossing new game has been good
1408000	1410000	The It, some people
1410000	1412000	The It
1412000	1414000	It's just It
1414000	1416000	Versus the miniseries
1416000	1418000	It's not Tim Curry
1418000	1420000	I don't mean to
1420000	1422000	Go down this rabbit hole
1422000	1424000	I don't mean to go down this rabbit hole of remakes
1424000	1426000	Someday when computer technology
1426000	1428000	Is good enough
1428000	1430000	To resurrect
1430000	1432000	You know
1432000	1434000	Movie actor Tim Curry
1434000	1436000	He's not dead
1436000	1438000	I understand he's not dead but
1438000	1440000	To the point where mobility is limited
1440000	1442000	Mobility is you know
1442000	1444000	He's not what he used to be unfortunately
1444000	1446000	But he's a national treasure
1446000	1448000	International treasure
1448000	1450000	I want the new Dune to be good
1450000	1452000	Because I saw the
1452000	1454000	Four hour original
1454000	1456000	Because I knew someone who
1456000	1458000	Remember we talked about Betamaxes earlier
1458000	1460000	Someone had it taped on Betamax
1460000	1462000	Funny enough Questbuster and chat
1462000	1464000	Is talking exactly about the Dune thing right now
1464000	1466000	Sci-fi did their own Dune series
1466000	1468000	And it was actually pretty good
1468000	1470000	The series is good but it lacks the epic music of Tangerine Dream
1470000	1472000	That was in the movie
1472000	1474000	That's how some people feel about Legend
1474000	1476000	To tie it back to Tim Curry
1476000	1478000	Legend
1478000	1480000	I was telling you actually somebody on the phone
1480000	1482000	I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry
1482000	1484000	On this show
1484000	1486000	I will always play six degrees of Tim Curry

1776000	1778000	Order of Magic was also done by Jon Pappadou
1806000	1808000	Well, we tried to get everything set up
1808000	1810000	Dan couldn't find the crap we needed
1810000	1812000	but then we decided
1812000	1814000	we might be playing something on the Saturn instead
1814000	1816000	because we want to go through
1816000	1818000	all of our Konami collections
1818000	1822000	and just sit and bore the shit out of people with Parodius
1822000	1824000	and Salamander
1824000	1826000	and maybe some weird RPGs
1826000	1830000	that we have to have a translation FAQ for
1830000	1832000	that we're going to speak our own dialogue for
1832000	1834000	like View 10 a game
1834000	1836000	Hi, in another universe I turn into a car
1836000	1838000	if everyone has seen the Utena movie
1838000	1840000	that must be the awesome universe
1840000	1842000	Utena turns into
1842000	1844000	spoiler, she turns into a pink Batmobile
1844000	1846000	and she and Anthe drive off through the city
1846000	1848000	it's weird
1848000	1850000	and then they're naked on the chassis
1850000	1852000	of the pink Batmobile
1852000	1854000	as they drive off into their lesbian sunset
1854000	1856000	that is literally the ending of the Utena movie
1856000	1858000	okay
1858000	1860000	right?
1860000	1862000	okay
1862000	1864000	right?
1864000	1866000	ah, jeez
1866000	1868000	but anyway, we've been kind of on this
1868000	1870000	old Konami shooter kick
1870000	1872000	so that's kind of what we're going to do
1872000	1874000	we watched through different playthroughs of Parodius
1874000	1876000	and the collection that we
1876000	1878000	no, it's not the collection we have
1878000	1880000	the PSP version
1880000	1882000	is the one where they replaced
1882000	1884000	um
1884000	1886000	crap, what song was it?
1886000	1888000	it was like a pop song that was in the
1888000	1890000	pattern version and they switched it out
1890000	1892000	for a remix of
1892000	1894000	Brilliant to You
1894000	1896000	because we were trying to figure out which one had Brilliant to You in it
1896000	1898000	and it was
1898000	1900000	I think Ocean Berry Parodius
1900000	1902000	for the PSP
1902000	1904000	so
1904000	1906000	anyway
1906000	1908000	Bright Man says a pink lesbian Batmobile
1908000	1910000	that's not something I thought I would hear about
1910000	1912000	have you heard this show?
1912000	1914000	well, we've done it all
1914000	1916000	now we have pink Batmobile lesbians
1916000	1918000	show Michelle
1918000	1920000	or Tamar
1920000	1922000	anyway
1922000	1924000	so that's really been about the
1924000	1926000	extent of us making plans
1926000	1928000	and just getting shit together
1928000	1930000	Dan kept thinking we wanted to play
1930000	1932000	on the CRT, I'm like why would we play
1932000	1934000	Saturn on CRT when it's
1934000	1936000	you know
1936000	1938000	HDMI
1938000	1940000	whatevs!
1940000	1942000	moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1942000	1944000	um, I played not a lot
1944000	1946000	of stuff this week but I did start off the
1946000	1948000	week by trying to transcribe more
1948000	1950000	edits I was missing off of my DDR machine
1950000	1952000	and I got through 18 of them
1952000	1954000	before I decided to try to transfer
1954000	1956000	them to my system and
1956000	1958000	you see the problem is I'm using a brand new
1958000	1960000	editing tool
1960000	1962000	I used to use one called DDR Edit Max
1962000	1964000	and it's old, it only ran
1964000	1966000	on XP and out of
1966000	1968000	Visual Basic 6
1968000	1970000	runtime
1970000	1972000	which doesn't work in
1972000	1974000	Windows 10, so I found
1974000	1976000	thanks to the Wayback Machine
1976000	1978000	DDR Edit Max 2
1978000	1980000	that actually does work
1980000	1982000	but
1982000	1984000	there's a problem is that something's
1984000	1986000	wrong with the edit
1986000	1988000	files themselves and
1988000	1990000	the machine does not recognize them
1990000	1992000	or doesn't recognize most of them
1992000	1994000	it recognized one of them
1994000	1996000	and I don't know why one works
1996000	1998000	and the rest don't
1998000	2000000	so I've been
2000000	2002000	digging through them through
2002000	2004000	hex editors going back to my
2004000	2006000	edit FAQ that thank god I made
2006000	2008000	a long ass time ago because
2008000	2010000	it's actually helped me trying to read this shit
2010000	2012000	which I found out a bunch of new stuff
2012000	2014000	with it as well and I've been
2014000	2016000	updating it as I go but I
2016000	2018000	still haven't gotten any of it to work correctly
2018000	2020000	because something is fucked up
2020000	2022000	in the header and I'm not sure what
2022000	2024000	I need to figure out how to fix it
2024000	2026000	because there's some really awesome edits
2026000	2028000	I want to play so that was
2028000	2030000	about most of my week
2030000	2032000	and then I decided
2032000	2034000	to check
2034000	2036000	to see how much well because I
2036000	2038000	saw the Labo
2038000	2040000	VR kits coming out this
2040000	2042000	following week so I was like okay well
2042000	2044000	it seems so soon like
2044000	2046000	yeah let's see how much the other
2046000	2048000	Labo kits are because I know they're coming down in prices
2048000	2050000	and stuff so I found the robot kit for
2050000	2052000	$29.99
2052000	2054000	it actually ended up getting I think for $25
2054000	2056000	after I think I had a
2056000	2058000	coupon or something on there but
2058000	2060000	$25 for the robot kit I was like
2060000	2062000	can't beat it for that price that's kind of worth it
2062000	2064000	so I went ahead and picked that up
2064000	2066000	so I've been building that I started that today
2066000	2068000	and then I pre-ordered
2068000	2070000	the VR kit that will be coming next week
2070000	2072000	because my kids like
2072000	2074000	playing with the VR stuff and I hate
2074000	2076000	having to set up the Playstation VR for them
2076000	2078000	all the time so I was like well I'll just
2078000	2080000	build this and they can shove their
2080000	2082000	head in the butt of a bird
2082000	2084000	so
2084000	2086000	so we'll be doing that
2086000	2088000	and then
2088000	2090000	what else I played a little bit of Ingress
2090000	2092000	today just because I was
2092000	2094000	because I was
2094000	2096000	trying to report a
2096000	2098000	pokestop for being in the wrong
2098000	2100000	spot and
2100000	2102000	you can't do that in Pokemon Go and
2102000	2104000	apparently I can't do it in Ingress either but
2104000	2106000	you have to download Scanner Redacted and you can still do it
2106000	2108000	there which is the 1.0
2108000	2110000	because they had it was
2110000	2112000	the arcade creek trail and they had the
2112000	2114000	lizard marked there which there is a lizard
2114000	2116000	it's a big cement lizard but it was
2116000	2118000	several like tens of feet
2118000	2120000	away from where it actually is
2120000	2122000	it's in a completely wrong spot so
2122000	2124000	I was going to report it
2124000	2126000	but I did
2126000	2128000	Download the Scanner Redacted app and since you made
2128000	2130000	your account before Prime
2130000	2132000	you can still now if you're a brand new agent
2132000	2134000	you can't use Scanner Redacted because
2134000	2136000	they're trying to prevent people making new accounts
2136000	2138000	to spoof and things but since you had an existing account
2138000	2140000	you can do it yeah so
2140000	2142000	I may get around to that or I just may not
2142000	2144000	give a shit but
2144000	2146000	it was in the right spot at one
2146000	2148000	time so it's like it got moved I don't know
2148000	2150000	how that's shenanigans
2150000	2152000	it's awfully
2152000	2154000	conveniently close to a
2154000	2156000	mobile home park where maybe someone's
2156000	2158000	living in and
2158000	2160000	you know couch portaling
2160000	2162000	send me info on that portal we'll get it fixed
2162000	2164000	but anyway so yeah I did that and
2164000	2166000	I played Pokemon Go a little bit because
2166000	2168000	yeah so I'm going
2168000	2170000	to be I wanted to and like
2170000	2172000	I must have been half asleep last night when
2172000	2174000	I decided to order I ordered another
2174000	2176000	docking station for my
2176000	2178000	switch because I was like I want to take it apart
2178000	2180000	and I'm going to use this to build
2180000	2182000	and then of course my dumb brain today
2182000	2184000	is like you idiot you can't
2184000	2186000	you can't hack that apart to make it
2186000	2188000	allow you to stream
2188000	2190000	from handheld mode because the damn thing's gonna
2190000	2192000	think it's docked and it's not going to work so
2192000	2194000	that's kind of the frustration
2194000	2196000	because I wanted to like actually
2196000	2198000	do some streaming from the
2198000	2200000	VR thing to show like what it looks like
2200000	2202000	but you can't because
2202000	2204000	fucking switch
2204000	2206000	can't stream in handheld mode
2206000	2208000	so
2208000	2210000	what are you going to do?
2210000	2212000	So yeah
2212000	2214000	I guess I'll just have to find something else to do instead
2214000	2216000	and play some Borderlands
2216000	2218000	alright yeah that's it
2218000	2220000	My gaming week so I actually
2220000	2222000	officiated my first wedding
2222000	2224000	yesterday so
2224000	2226000	I do weddings now if you're curious
2226000	2228000	at least in California
2228000	2230000	I'm sure it's probably not that hard to do in other states
2230000	2232000	but so that
2232000	2234000	took up a lot of my time this weekend however
2234000	2236000	I have been playing some other games
2236000	2238000	including Beat Saber I
2238000	2240000	played a little bit this week because I had not
2240000	2242000	gotten around yet to the official volume
2242000	2244000	one DLC pack and they
2244000	2246000	put out that what's that
2246000	2248000	crab song whatever that April Fools
2248000	2250000	thing was like a year ago it was like this crab song
2250000	2252000	that they put in Beat Saber
2252000	2254000	that you can play
2254000	2256000	I also like the coloring in it because they use
2256000	2258000	blue and green as the colors instead of the blue and red
2258000	2260000	that most songs do
2260000	2262000	so yeah that was fun I liked
2262000	2264000	playing that so I played a little bit of that
2264000	2266000	and then I played some of the DLC songs because I downloaded that
2266000	2268000	because I have Beat Saber on PlayStation 4
2268000	2270000	so I was playing some of those songs and
2270000	2272000	you know just enjoying
2272000	2274000	expanding the original library of songs
2274000	2276000	not that the songs are bad but now
2276000	2278000	they're starting to sort them out a little bit too so like
2278000	2280000	instead of just having a big song list
2280000	2282000	I have like official volume one
2282000	2284000	soundtrack add on
2284000	2286000	songs or whatever it's called and then like
2286000	2288000	DLC one and so on and so on
2288000	2290000	so yeah I've been playing that
2290000	2292000	and then I've been playing Final Fantasy 14
2292000	2294000	just a little bit kind of got sucked back into that
2294000	2296000	after the Stormblood story patch and for no
2296000	2298000	good reason I pushed my
2298000	2300000	White Mage all the way to level 70 so that's my
2300000	2302000	fourth job at max level behind
2302000	2304000	Astrologian Bard and Red Mage
2304000	2306000	so now I have Astrologian Bard, Red Mage, White Mage all
2306000	2308000	at 70 no tank at 70 yet
2308000	2310000	and I don't know if I'll bother taking a tank that high
2310000	2312000	because I'm not that big a fan of tanking
2312000	2314000	but I guess if anything I like Dark Knight
2314000	2316000	of the tanks but we'll see
2316000	2318000	so did you want to say something on?
2318000	2320000	I actually just remembered the other
2320000	2322000	thing I was going to do for gaming is I'm going to go back to
2322000	2324000	Star Trek Online. Oh yeah
2324000	2326000	I'm going to cancel the wow and everything and go back to Star Trek Online
2326000	2328000	I'd be curious how that game kind of
2328000	2330000	sizes up now compared to when it was first out
2330000	2332000	They've been incorporating more characters and
2332000	2334000	have from the TV series and
2334000	2336000	have the actors back
2336000	2338000	as voice actors. Oh that's cool.
2338000	2340000	So I didn't mean to derail your segment
2340000	2342000	but I thought that since you're talking about MMOs
2342000	2344000	that might be curious too. That's not the first time.
2344000	2346000	And I do it to you too. Alright.
2346000	2348000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says oh speaking of Diablo 3
2348000	2350000	Rob I sent you something on Switch. I apologize
2350000	2352000	I haven't checked Diablo 3 on Switch in a long time
2352000	2354000	but I should probably get on that. It would be nice
2354000	2356000	to roll a season 16 character
2356000	2358000	but one more game that I played this week
2358000	2360000	that I think is kind of a big deal IDK
2360000	2362000	I played Borderlands which you know
2362000	2364000	is not a game I've played. I've played it before
2364000	2366000	but I haven't played a lot of it
2366000	2368000	but I downloaded the remaster
2368000	2370000	because I had it on Steam
2370000	2372000	anyway, the original, and if you had
2372000	2374000	the original game of the year edition
2374000	2376000	which I'm sure a lot of people bought for like 5 or 10 bucks
2376000	2378000	Yeah I just saw what was it
2378000	2380000	the pre-sequel and stuff was discounted
2380000	2382000	I'm like oh I should buy the pre-sequel
2382000	2384000	and I looked at my library and I'm like oh I already have it
2384000	2386000	So I looked at my library
2386000	2388000	and now there's Borderlands GOTY
2388000	2390000	and then there was sure enough Borderlands GOTY
2390000	2392000	Enhanced and I was like cool
2392000	2394000	I downloaded the Enhanced one and
2394000	2396000	originally it wanted to set my configuration
2396000	2398000	for 1080p and I was like
2398000	2400000	no I know my video card can do better than that
2400000	2402000	it was doing ultra
2402000	2404000	settings at 1080p so I kicked it down to
2404000	2406000	high settings on 2K
2406000	2408000	obviously my video card's not quite
2408000	2410000	good enough to do full 4K but it's 2K
2410000	2412000	and that works. The game runs very smoothly
2412000	2414000	and it looks really good
2414000	2416000	on PC. The art
2416000	2418000	style of the, you know how Borderlands has the very
2418000	2420000	strong outlines in a lot of
2420000	2422000	the art that it does. It really pops
2422000	2424000	you know in that high resolution
2424000	2426000	It is funny though because you definitely
2426000	2428000	notice the parts of the game
2428000	2430000	that aren't in 2K or 4K
2430000	2432000	namely anything pre-rendered
2432000	2434000	so like the little introduction videos
2434000	2436000	so I've played through the intro of the game
2436000	2438000	and I did the first boss or whatever
2438000	2440000	Nine, what is it? Nine Tails?
2440000	2442000	No Nine Toes
2442000	2444000	So I've killed Nine Toes and when it did
2444000	2446000	the whole like introduction
2446000	2448000	it suddenly switches to a video and you can
2448000	2450000	tell like there's like it looks
2450000	2452000	kind of a little more grainy and not
2452000	2454000	quite the same and I was like oh okay
2454000	2456000	but you know obviously that's a very minor
2456000	2458000	complaint it's not even really a complaint
2458000	2460000	because the game is how old but it's
2460000	2462000	fun to explore it again and I feel
2462000	2464000	like in some ways I've gotten a little
2464000	2466000	better at shooters on the PC
2466000	2468000	and I think because I remember I used
2468000	2470000	to be very much like I only wanted to do
2470000	2472000	shooters with a controller because of
2472000	2474000	stuff like Halo that I you know
2474000	2476000	had grown up on or whatever but thanks
2476000	2478000	to things like Overwatch and other
2478000	2480000	shooters I've been playing on PC like I feel
2480000	2482000	very comfortable playing Borderlands on
2482000	2484000	PC with keyboard and mouse
2484000	2486000	so I remember how it was the opposite in Final Fantasy
2486000	2488000	11 where I played everything on a controller
2488000	2490000	including my macros as a healer
2490000	2492000	Well you know in Final Fantasy 14
2492000	2494000	some people play controller on
2494000	2496000	computer and it's totally
2496000	2498000	like but that game was kind of built for
2498000	2500000	a controller not so much 11 a little bit
2500000	2502000	well no a little bit because it was on
2502000	2504000	the Playstation 2 in Japan and not everybody
2504000	2506000	had that you know yeah and
2506000	2508000	honestly for the longest time I was
2508000	2510000	strict to controller
2510000	2512000	I mean Rob came
2512000	2514000	and saw me play using my little shoulder buttons
2514000	2516000	for my macros and yeah it works but
2516000	2518000	I don't know it's kind of funny
2518000	2520000	how people kind of turn around on what they play on
2520000	2522000	It does yeah yeah um let's see
2522000	2524000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I think
2524000	2526000	Borderlands still has an aim assist on
2526000	2528000	PC which helped me that is
2528000	2530000	true the aim assist is still there obviously
2530000	2532000	I'm using it no shame in that I
2532000	2534000	the nine toes guy killed me once
2534000	2536000	because he has two little ads
2536000	2538000	or whatever and so I had to do him
2538000	2540000	do that fight does he have nine toes
2540000	2542000	apparently he has nine toes and three balls
2542000	2544000	that's what the intro says there's a lot of
2544000	2546000	there's a lot of straight
2546000	2548000	bro humor in the game
2548000	2550000	in Borderlands that I just
2550000	2552000	kind of go whatever
2552000	2554000	I find it more questionable if he had
2554000	2556000	a camel toe so
2556000	2558000	anyway but whatever I think the
2558000	2560000	game is it's fun to play I like
2560000	2562000	the questing system feels like an MMO
2562000	2564000	really so it's kind of yeah it's fun
2564000	2566000	so I'll probably play some more of it I want to play
2566000	2568000	some more of it and see you know where the story goes
2568000	2570000	and I because I've never
2570000	2572000	really touched the second game and you know
2572000	2574000	if I really enjoy it maybe I'll even buy the
2574000	2576000	third game when it comes out so
2576000	2578000	I'm definitely buying the third game but I want to let
2578000	2580000	y'all know I finally am getting around and I played
2580000	2582000	a little bit of Borderlands before but it was just like I'm terrible
2582000	2584000	at shooters this is bad but I don't know
2584000	2586000	I'm approaching this with some
2586000	2588000	more years of gaming of different types
2588000	2590000	under my belt and I'm kind of like into it right now
2590000	2592000	and it looks very nice with the enhanced version
2592000	2594000	so um kudos
2594000	2596000	so far so
2596000	2598000	Bobby Blackwell says will you buy the third
2598000	2600000	game in September or in April
2600000	2602000	um I'm not going to buy the third game unless
2602000	2604000	I actually make it through the first two
2604000	2606000	isn't that fair? Three
2606000	2608000	well I,
2608000	2610000	do you have to play pre-sequel? Pre-sequel's
2610000	2612000	pretty fun Is it? Alright
2612000	2614000	well then I guess I have three to play so
2614000	2616000	I don't know I haven't played
2616000	2618000	pre-sequel yet
2618000	2620000	well let's I guess we need to get into the
2620000	2622000	news a little bit and talk about why Bobby
2622000	2624000	is asking that question uh real quick
2624000	2626000	this is where I usually plug our social media
2626000	2628000	so follow us on Twitter slash
2628000	2630000	or excuse me at OLR we're also on
2630000	2632000	Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge
2632000	2634000	radio we are no longer on Google Plus
2634000	2636000	Google Plus is officially dead rest
2636000	2638000	in peace uh alright let's
2638000	2640000	get to the news starting off with
2640000	2642000	the big decision when to buy Borderlands
2642000	2644000	right? Yeah so Borderlands
2644000	2646000	uh they did a second because you may remember
2646000	2648000	the original announcement that they did at PAX East
2648000	2650000	they had more details coming
2650000	2652000	you know next week
2652000	2654000	and so the more details that were coming
2654000	2656000	it's going to be
2656000	2658000	an exclusive
2658000	2660000	game to the Epic Games Store for six months
2660000	2662000	it's going to be launching September 13th
2662000	2664000	and then you'll be able to buy it elsewhere
2664000	2666000	April 2020
2666000	2668000	and it's also going to be out on
2668000	2670000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
2670000	2672000	and of course
2672000	2674000	a lot of people aren't very happy about this
2674000	2676000	mainly because the Epic Store
2676000	2678000	is very bare bones
2678000	2680000	and is missing a lot of the things
2680000	2682000	that you would expect
2682000	2684000	from a storefront including you know being able
2684000	2686000	to um
2686000	2688000	put stuff in a shopping cart
2688000	2690000	and you know I don't even know
2690000	2692000	do they have friends list? I mean they have friends list
2692000	2694000	but they don't have a lot of most of
2694000	2696000	the bare modes things I would say
2696000	2698000	it is bare bones but also I would
2698000	2700000	say it's it's progressed since
2700000	2702000	it first came out they're still updating it
2702000	2704000	and who knows where we're going to be in September
2704000	2706000	September's still a ways out
2706000	2708000	so of course since quickly though
2708000	2710000	I can understand the frustration though where it's like
2710000	2712000	I have Borderlands 1 and 2 on
2712000	2714000	Steam and now I'm going to have to go
2714000	2716000	to this store to get Borderlands 3
2716000	2718000	and it's you know going to be a little bit different
2718000	2720000	of course tell that to all the Bayonetta
2720000	2722000	fans right?
2722000	2724000	I have to buy a Wii U or a
2724000	2726000	Switch if I want to play Bayonetta 2
2726000	2728000	even if I play the first Bayonetta
2728000	2730000	Xbox 360 or wherever
2730000	2732000	the multitude of places where the first Bayonetta came out
2732000	2734000	it's on PC now
2734000	2736000	not not Bayonetta 2
2736000	2738000	the first Bayonetta is but not Bayonetta 2
2738000	2740000	gotta get a Switch
2740000	2742000	because the Epic Games Store is still so bare bones
2742000	2744000	that there is no way to leave reviews
2744000	2746000	on any game there
2746000	2748000	people have turned to Steam to go
2748000	2750000	express their frustrations by review
2750000	2752000	bombing of course the other Borderlands
2752000	2754000	games and you know Steam is very
2754000	2756000	fond of that happening so
2756000	2758000	yeah
2758000	2760000	Steam is really not getting a lot of good news
2760000	2762000	with this because not only do they not get the game
2762000	2764000	but then now all the users are going to
2764000	2766000	shit on the store for Borderlands
2766000	2768000	1 and 2 right
2768000	2770000	so that sucks but I know that
2770000	2772000	they had talked about ways to
2772000	2774000	prevent review bombing so we'll see
2774000	2776000	how that ends up working out but
2776000	2778000	I mean I don't know like
2778000	2780000	yeah it's annoying
2780000	2782000	that the only thing Epic's doing
2782000	2784000	right now seems like to try to drive
2784000	2786000	people to their platform well a couple things
2786000	2788000	I guess they're lowering the price
2788000	2790000	which is why or the cut that they
2790000	2792000	take which is why these big game companies are
2792000	2794000	kind of going their way because I'm sure they're
2794000	2796000	getting money thrown at them
2796000	2798000	plus they're also getting more
2798000	2800000	of more profit off of everything
2800000	2802000	so of course they want to make as much
2802000	2804000	money as possible
2804000	2806000	I think originally the plan was more
2806000	2808000	to try to drive you know indies to their
2808000	2810000	platform but
2810000	2812000	whatever it is what it is
2812000	2814000	the free games they give away
2814000	2816000	is nothing to buy
2816000	2818000	no that's nice and it's
2818000	2820000	to me it's kind of like you play
2820000	2822000	and stuff like that or like even
2822000	2824000	EA services
2824000	2826000	Origin you just have to have
2826000	2828000	it for certain games whether you like
2828000	2830000	it or not and I think this is kind of like this
2830000	2832000	if I want to play this game on PC at launch
2832000	2834000	I just have to
2834000	2836000	I already have Epic installed so it's not a big deal
2836000	2838000	to be honest I have Origin
2838000	2840000	you know love it or hate it
2840000	2842000	which it's come a long way but I
2842000	2844000	have Origin installed because that was the only
2844000	2846000	way I was going to be able to play Mass Effect Andromeda
2846000	2848000	on PC
2848000	2850000	as well as got a sweet deal
2850000	2852000	on Titanfall 2
2852000	2854000	you know there's just there's certain things that
2854000	2856000	you can only get on Origin that have to do with
2856000	2858000	EA BioWare and that type of thing
2858000	2860000	Can't you put like external games into it?
2860000	2862000	You have to have Origin for Apex
2862000	2864000	Can't you put external games into your Steam library
2864000	2866000	anyways because I thought they have ways to launch them
2866000	2868000	so I mean I'm sure that if this
2868000	2870000	isn't like any other game out there
2870000	2872000	you can have an executable that's straight
2872000	2874000	you don't have to launch it through the Epic
2874000	2876000	storefront I'm pretty sure
2876000	2878000	that you can just have an executable shortcut or something
2878000	2880000	The way that it works for
2880000	2882000	Origin is that it will
2882000	2884000	open when you have the link to
2884000	2886000	the game it will open
2886000	2888000	Origin and then open the game
2888000	2890000	but run it through Steam so that you can do your
2890000	2892000	screenshots and everything through the Steam platform
2892000	2894000	Oh wow. Because that's how
2894000	2896000	basically how I got all of my stuff
2896000	2898000	for my little effect which I've kind of let
2898000	2900000	fall to the wayside
2900000	2902000	Well the game's been out a long time now you've probably screen capped almost everything you can
2902000	2904000	I've had drama that's kept
2904000	2906000	me from posting and being sick and
2906000	2908000	family members dying and stuff
2908000	2910000	speaking of Mass Effect not to like
2910000	2912000	completely 180 this conversation but I noticed
2912000	2914000	Alan was like he was
2914000	2916000	reinstalling Mass Effect the other night and I'm like what's going on
2916000	2918000	he's like there's some new mod that came out that I want to check
2918000	2920000	out so I think they have like another new
2920000	2922000	graphics mod or something and so
2922000	2924000	now I see him because you know remember
2924000	2926000	Alan will get obsessed with one
2926000	2928000	game at a time. One game at a
2928000	2930000	time and um
2930000	2932000	It's nice to be able to have that kind of restraint
2932000	2934000	I don't have that kind of restraint
2934000	2936000	I know he's the complete polar opposite
2936000	2938000	so like Dark Souls has been his thing for a long time
2938000	2940000	Overwatch he still kind of plays off and on
2940000	2942000	this is the one that surprised me do you know what game
2942000	2944000	has been like his late like it's all he's been playing
2944000	2946000	lately? Dead Island
2946000	2948000	of like all the games in the universe
2948000	2950000	The first one? Yeah
2950000	2952000	I think it's a combination of the
2952000	2954000	series but mostly the first one
2954000	2956000	like that's what he's kind of been
2956000	2958000	into lately so yeah
2958000	2960000	I mean not to knock that game I know some of y'all are big
2960000	2962000	fans. By the way what ever happened
2962000	2964000	to Dead Island 2? Wasn't that like supposed to be out by now?
2964000	2966000	Uh I think Dead Island
2966000	2968000	2 already came out. No I don't think it ever did
2968000	2970000	there was like a Dead Island like
2970000	2972000	expansion for the
2972000	2974000	first game or something it was just built on the
2974000	2976000	first game. It still says it's upcoming on
2976000	2978000	wiki. Yeah they showed a trailer for Dead Island
2978000	2980000	2 like in 2014. Yeah I was like
2980000	2982000	I was like the last time I went to E3
2982000	2984000	Oh yeah. I saw that Dead Island 2 too.
2984000	2986000	That was a long time ago right?
2986000	2988000	Well there's a rumor on
2988000	2990000	this E3
2990000	2992000	like thing about with some pre-alpha footage
2992000	2994000	on it saying that
2994000	2996000	it's supposed to
2996000	2998000	the release date is going to be announced at E3
2998000	3000000	Well then they
3000000	3002000	have like a what was the other dead game
3002000	3004000	there was another dead bot not Dead by Dawn
3004000	3006000	but like there was a
3006000	3008000	oh like not a dead island but like a dead
3008000	3010000	free running game I can't remember the hell it's called
3010000	3012000	but they had like a couple sequels of that
3012000	3014000	I thought that was maybe
3014000	3016000	I don't know maybe
3016000	3018000	stop making zombie games because
3018000	3020000	I can't tell them apart okay?
3020000	3022000	Maybe you should stop doing that. I did not mean to
3022000	3024000	180 the conversation but we got on a tangent train
3024000	3026000	as we sometimes do. Let's have the
3026000	3028000	the chat brings back. Act F says
3028000	3030000	Dead Island Riptide no that was kind of that was
3030000	3032000	still it was like the first game
3032000	3034000	like after bit because you
3034000	3036000	just started at level 40 or you could import
3036000	3038000	characters to the first game it wasn't a true sequel
3038000	3040000	Dead Island Riptide was not the true sequel but
3040000	3042000	good point
3042000	3044000	The Break Man says is Dead Island any good
3044000	3046000	and Quest Buster says
3046000	3048000	it's good now it was pretty broken on release
3048000	3050000	and that's pretty much everything I've heard too and knowing Alan
3050000	3052000	he's probably modded the fuck out of the game
3052000	3054000	I'll bet you anything what got him on it there's probably
3054000	3056000	some graphic mod for the game
3056000	3058000	that got him into it
3058000	3060000	Maybe he should join up with Minecraft
3060000	3062000	Knowing Alan as well as I do
3062000	3064000	So YYR
3064000	3066000	is kind of fed up a little bit here
3066000	3068000	saying I'm just fed up with apps
3068000	3070000	and launchers I basically refuse to
3070000	3072000	play anything that would require me to download
3072000	3074000	an app or get another launcher
3074000	3076000	I have enough accounts I don't want anymore
3076000	3078000	since I play mostly niche stuff
3078000	3080000	I haven't really been affected by any of this yet
3080000	3082000	but if someone releases their game on the epic store
3082000	3084000	good for them but I'll never play it
3084000	3086000	Um
3086000	3088000	Isn't it I might be wrong I don't to be
3088000	3090000	honest I've never bought anything on the epic
3090000	3092000	store I have a nice collection of the free
3092000	3094000	stuff and fortnite that's about it
3094000	3096000	so I mean at least I bought things
3096000	3098000	I haven't bought anything yet on the epic
3098000	3100000	store personally but
3100000	3102000	do you
3102000	3104000	because we were just kind of talking about the
3104000	3106000	launcher loading in the background
3106000	3108000	if I get a game like
3108000	3110000	say super meat boy that I got for free
3110000	3112000	or whatever on the epic game store
3112000	3114000	if I just run that executable
3114000	3116000	doesn't it not go through the store
3116000	3118000	like maybe you don't have to use launcher I don't know
3118000	3120000	I can't remember I have it just I had it already
3120000	3122000	on there when I was trying out
3122000	3124000	development in unreal engine so
3124000	3126000	I already have it on there
3126000	3128000	for that um
3128000	3130000	and but I right now it's mainly
3130000	3132000	now it's just to grab the free
3132000	3134000	game of every couple weeks or whatever
3134000	3136000	that they put out and Bobby's correcting
3136000	3138000	me it does still launch the epic game store in the
3138000	3140000	background alright fair enough it's probably
3140000	3142000	must check to make
3142000	3144000	sure you bought it or something I don't know yeah
3144000	3146000	so I mean whatever I've
3146000	3148000	I haven't really purchased anything from
3148000	3150000	the epic game store I have looked at the new
3150000	3152000	game that they have from coffee scene studios
3152000	3154000	I may pick up that one
3154000	3156000	um but
3156000	3158000	so far I haven't purchased anything
3158000	3160000	from there alright
3160000	3162000	well let's move on and talk about
3162000	3164000	um what's going on
3164000	3166000	with the switch online retro
3166000	3168000	service so um
3168000	3170000	switch online uh has
3170000	3172000	been adding more NES games every
3172000	3174000	month and um
3174000	3176000	uh some of the latest
3176000	3178000	games will be coming to the switch um in
3178000	3180000	April of 2019 on
3180000	3182000	the 10th so what next week I think yeah
3182000	3184000	about three days uh they've announced
3184000	3186000	the next series of games that's going to come out which includes
3186000	3188000	punch out
3188000	3190000	not the Mike Tyson punch out cause obviously
3190000	3192000	the licensing stuff is gone although
3192000	3194000	I'm sure y'all heard about that tweet where Mike Tyson
3194000	3196000	was like why am I not in punch
3196000	3198000	out on this like I seriously don't
3198000	3200000	I don't think Mike Tyson knows
3200000	3202000	that he was taken out
3202000	3204000	of punch out a long time ago I don't
3204000	3206000	think he knows about Mr. Dream shh don't tell him
3206000	3208000	don't tell him I don't know
3208000	3210000	anyway he might bite Mr. Dream's ear off
3210000	3212000	uh also coming out Star
3212000	3214000	Soldier kind of a fun little shooter
3214000	3216000	and then Super Mario Brothers
3216000	3218000	The Lost Levels at least
3218000	3220000	that's what they're calling it here in the
3220000	3222000	US and so they actually are
3222000	3224000	giving it the little box you know that they kind
3224000	3226000	of created for Super Mario All-Stars
3226000	3228000	little square box but what's funny is
3228000	3230000	that when they showed the preview movie
3230000	3232000	they didn't bother to correct the title screen
3232000	3234000	or anything so when you launch it it's still just
3234000	3236000	Super Mario Brothers 2
3236000	3238000	obviously the Japanese version of these releases
3238000	3240000	same thing punch out Star Soldier
3240000	3242000	Super Mario Brothers 2 for them
3242000	3244000	but you know like if you launch
3244000	3246000	our Super Mario Brothers 2 in their
3246000	3248000	Famicom online it says Super Mario Brothers
3248000	3250000	USA they changed the title screen
3250000	3252000	they didn't they didn't do that here
3252000	3254000	so
3254000	3256000	because they actually did get it released to
3256000	3258000	Super Mario USA there later right
3258000	3260000	yeah so but anyway
3260000	3262000	that's not really the big news although it's certainly
3262000	3264000	a part of this as well as the the
3264000	3266000	question people might be asking is how long
3266000	3268000	is Nintendo going to keep going with this like
3268000	3270000	are they going to release every single NES game
3270000	3272000	and which honestly would be doubtful
3272000	3274000	due to licensing
3274000	3276000	and you know especially when
3276000	3278000	third parties develop the game where does
3278000	3280000	the money go and all that stuff so
3280000	3282000	um apparently what's happening
3282000	3284000	over in Hong Kong some leaflets for the
3284000	3286000	Switch online service were being distributed
3286000	3288000	and leaflets talk about what
3288000	3290000	the Switch online service includes because you know
3290000	3292000	they're trying to sell people on get your
3292000	3294000	you know online Nintendo subscription
3294000	3296000	so you can access the classic library
3296000	3298000	but apparently there's one little section with
3298000	3300000	fine print that says
3300000	3302000	eventually Nintendo will stop
3302000	3304000	adding new NES games to the
3304000	3306000	collection but obviously they're not
3306000	3308000	saying when or anything
3308000	3310000	like that but this it kind of already
3310000	3312000	has the internet riled up on oh
3312000	3314000	the Super Nintendo must be coming because
3314000	3316000	they're saying the Nintendo thing is ending
3316000	3318000	there's only a finite amount
3318000	3320000	of games on the Nintendo so eventually
3320000	3322000	yes it will end
3322000	3324000	and it could be
3324000	3326000	ending in three years
3326000	3328000	it doesn't mean it's going to end by the end
3328000	3330000	it's because we live in a world where people
3330000	3332000	are going to sue over the fact that Red Bull
3332000	3334000	doesn't give them wings so of course they have
3334000	3336000	to you know put the
3336000	3338000	put the disclaimer in there guess what
3338000	3340000	eventually we're not going to be adding
3340000	3342000	this was in Hong Kong I don't know if Hong Kong
3342000	3344000	has a sue happy culture like we have here
3344000	3346000	but but I get what you're saying
3346000	3348000	of course I get what you're saying you have to
3348000	3350000	you have to say the obvious things like
3350000	3352000	that because you're right people will sue well I've been paying
3352000	3354000	money every month where's my new games class
3354000	3356000	action lawsuit yeah
3356000	3358000	yeah anyway uh
3358000	3360000	dark to see in chat says well I assume they would
3360000	3362000	they were not going to end it like next month
3362000	3364000	but obviously they won't keep it going forever
3364000	3366000	honestly they would have made a lot more money if they
3366000	3368000	just uh virtual console
3368000	3370000	you think huh I know
3370000	3372000	well now especially that they just gave away a year
3372000	3374000	free with Amazon Prime obviously
3374000	3376000	Twitch and Amazon must be kicking them some money
3376000	3378000	but it's interesting they could have made a lot
3378000	3380000	more money a lot more
3380000	3382000	way all they just
3382000	3384000	seem happy I don't have to drop
3384000	3386000	the drop the cost
3386000	3388000	of the games down like you know cut down the amount
3388000	3390000	that they were charging for those because eight dollars
3390000	3392000	for a Super Nintendo game is just ridiculous but
3392000	3394000	cut that down to a point that it is like
3394000	3396000	very like four ninety
3396000	3398000	nine or something like that or you know
3398000	3400000	cut it down to where it's just like impulse by
3400000	3402000	people be eating that shit up
3402000	3404000	so Questbuster in chat says there's around
3404000	3406000	seven hundred or thirty officially licensed game
3406000	3408000	on the NES but
3408000	3410000	I mean you're assuming they're going to
3410000	3412000	I mean I don't think you specifically are assuming but like
3412000	3414000	they're not going to release all seven hundred thirty games
3414000	3416000	they're just not like the licensing on
3416000	3418000	too many games is too complicated for example
3418000	3420000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
3420000	3422000	by Konami not going to come out
3422000	3424000	not going to happen because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
3424000	3426000	licensing now is complicated
3426000	3428000	I don't think Konami owns the license anymore
3428000	3430000	they haven't for some time either EA has
3430000	3432000	or somebody else has it and that
3432000	3434000	I mean miracles happen because they did
3434000	3436000	release that arcade game on 360
3436000	3438000	when people didn't think that would happen but it's going to be
3438000	3440000	much harder for like a classic thing
3440000	3442000	that Nintendo kind of oversees for that to happen
3442000	3444000	I would say things like the
3444000	3446000	Guardian Legend as much as Dark
3446000	3448000	Sakura and myself and many of you stand that
3448000	3450000	game hard I just don't see that game
3450000	3452000	coming out because the license it's too complicated
3452000	3454000	who owns that game now? I think we figured
3454000	3456000	it out. Whoever owns
3456000	3458000	Bode Brund
3458000	3460000	well Bode Brund only published it
3460000	3462000	it's compile
3462000	3464000	we figured out the rights in the previous episode
3464000	3466000	it's so far like four times removed
3466000	3468000	now at this point and then I think I cried
3468000	3470000	yeah I might have cried
3470000	3472000	but you know again
3472000	3474000	miracles happen but they're just
3474000	3476000	not going to jump through hoops
3476000	3478000	for all seven hundred thirty games because
3478000	3480000	also let's be real some of them were pretty bad
3480000	3482000	some of those games were pretty bad
3482000	3484000	so maybe we don't need
3484000	3486000	all seven hundred and thirty but
3486000	3488000	yeah I think you know it's inevitable this is
3488000	3490000	going to end but I would say it's still going to be going at least
3490000	3492000	for a year I think the
3492000	3494000	thought is that you know as far as a Super
3494000	3496000	Nintendo online or something that does
3496000	3498000	seem like a very logical kind of next
3498000	3500000	step although
3500000	3502000	you know Loki to kind of build on your point
3502000	3504000	maybe they're going to have
3504000	3506000	the NES library be
3506000	3508000	Nesflix style
3508000	3510000	but maybe the Super Nintendo games
3510000	3512000	they plan to do piecemeal maybe
3512000	3514000	we're all assuming they'll be
3514000	3516000	assuming or did they say in
3516000	3518000	the earliest they did say in the
3518000	3520000	earliest press releases
3520000	3522000	that there would be Super Nintendo games didn't they
3522000	3524000	and the earliest earliest
3524000	3526000	materials about this online service
3526000	3528000	I'm trying to remember that far back
3528000	3530000	and they seem to remember that might have been a
3530000	3532000	I don't need
3532000	3534000	the Super Nintendo games to come out
3534000	3536000	because I have a Super SNES
3536000	3538000	Bobby's confirming what I just said they did say the earliest
3538000	3540000	ones absolutely did say that
3540000	3542000	well that's cool but I don't need it because
3542000	3544000	you only sold me your systems
3544000	3546000	you know you sold me that stuff already so
3546000	3548000	obviously I already have it and modded it
3548000	3550000	you know
3550000	3552000	SNES classic yeah exactly so I
3552000	3554000	don't need your you know extra
3554000	3556000	stuff Bobby points out
3556000	3558000	the early ones didn't even mention NES
3558000	3560000	games they only mentioned Super Nintendo games
3560000	3562000	so it would be interesting if they started
3562000	3564000	to dial back from that now but I kind of I don't think
3564000	3566000	they will I think most people kind of figure that
3566000	3568000	maybe when this
3568000	3570000	new Switch comes out or whatever they'll roll
3570000	3572000	out if rumors are true they'll
3572000	3574000	roll out the matching Super Nintendo library to
3574000	3576000	go with it who knows but we'll see
3576000	3578000	anyway that's to assume that the
3578000	3580000	Switch Online stays legal
3580000	3582000	right Narsakra I guess there's some interesting legal
3582000	3584000	things going on right there is that
3584000	3586000	basically in the UK the
3586000	3588000	competition and markets authority
3588000	3590000	has opened an investigation against Microsoft
3590000	3592000	Nintendo and Sony to check on
3592000	3594000	their online service practices to see
3594000	3596000	if they violate a consumer protection law
3596000	3598000	consumer law is a lot
3598000	3600000	more of a big thing
3600000	3602000	I guess in
3602000	3604000	Europe Australia
3604000	3606000	those general areas
3606000	3608000	but basically
3608000	3610000	they want to see if it's violating
3610000	3612000	those aspects of their consumer law they want to know
3612000	3614000	the auto renewal policies are fair
3614000	3616000	how easy it is to get a refund
3616000	3618000	or cancel it and whether or not the terms
3618000	3620000	of services
3620000	3622000	take more power out of the
3622000	3624000	customer's hand and put it into
3624000	3626000	the companies so basically
3626000	3628000	they want to make sure the laws are fair and
3628000	3630000	equal to both company and
3630000	3632000	consumer it's
3632000	3634000	actually part of a response to
3634000	3636000	a quote super complaint
3636000	3638000	on a loyalty penalty
3638000	3640000	which is basically the tendency for
3640000	3642000	some of the companies to punish
3642000	3644000	long standing customers by
3644000	3646000	making it difficult or
3646000	3648000	expensive to leave
3648000	3650000	and so they're
3650000	3652000	they said the investigation just started but they may
3652000	3654000	only take enforcement action
3654000	3656000	if they believe the companies are not being fair
3656000	3658000	you know
3658000	3660000	the biggest things that have indicated
3660000	3662000	this is becoming a problem is that Sony raised
3662000	3664000	prices for Playstation Plus
3664000	3666000	that there is
3666000	3668000	I mean just kind of like we were saying that there's no
3668000	3670000	guarantee that you're going to get
3670000	3672000	the same number of free
3672000	3674000	games or perks for
3674000	3676000	the cost that you're paying for it
3676000	3678000	and of course there is
3678000	3680000	auto renewal
3680000	3682000	you know for example
3682000	3684000	like what's going on now
3684000	3686000	with the Switch promotion for Twitch Prime
3686000	3688000	you have to
3688000	3690000	turn the auto renewal off after your time
3690000	3692000	period is up or you're going to get charged
3692000	3694000	and well
3694000	3696000	it's interesting because you know this is UK
3696000	3698000	law so a lot of our normal ways of
3698000	3700000	thinking don't really apply
3700000	3702000	necessarily but like I know this is a super
3702000	3704000	common tactic in the US like
3704000	3706000	when it comes to let's say Spotify
3706000	3708000	I'll pick on Spotify you get 99
3708000	3710000	cents for a month of Spotify right
3710000	3712000	but the whole trick is now they get your credit
3712000	3714000	card number they're going to auto bill you
3714000	3716000	unless you like turn it off
3716000	3718000	and heck there's tons of iPhone
3718000	3720000	and Android apps that do this too right they'll give away
3720000	3722000	a 7 day
3722000	3724000	preview of like the sleep
3724000	3726000	app that I use we'll do like a 7 day
3726000	3728000	preview of their mode but then
3728000	3730000	if you don't turn it off it will do an auto
3730000	3732000	renew so like I feel like in our
3732000	3734000	culture that's a thing like you got
3734000	3736000	it like we all know that's a gotcha
3736000	3738000	tactic in a lot of different places
3738000	3740000	right or a gym membership that's another
3740000	3742000	big one sign up for a gym membership
3742000	3744000	for 5 bucks but then after
3744000	3746000	30 days oh it's going to be the full you know
3746000	3748000	$50 a month or whatever it is right
3748000	3750000	but um yeah
3750000	3752000	it's the fact that it's UK law
3752000	3754000	I don't I can't put myself into the same
3754000	3756000	like shoes or whatever
3756000	3758000	so but some of our chatters think there
3758000	3760000	might be something here uh break man in chat says by
3760000	3762000	British laws I think they have a chance
3762000	3764000	I think Microsoft and Sony will lose this
3764000	3766000	but I don't know how it will affect us in America
3766000	3768000	well and I will tell you one thing too
3768000	3770000	just with some other companies
3770000	3772000	like for example with these
3772000	3774000	increased stringency of
3774000	3776000	encryption requirements and
3776000	3778000	uh customer control over
3778000	3780000	their personal online data
3780000	3782000	um because they became so
3782000	3784000	much stringent um overseas
3784000	3786000	that American companies are actually now
3786000	3788000	following suit to match those so that they don't have
3788000	3790000	to worry about what
3790000	3792000	are we doing different here what are we doing different
3792000	3794000	there you know it's
3794000	3796000	going to be universal it's why when you go on to all
3796000	3798000	these different websites now there's a huge
3798000	3800000	fucking thing that says by using
3800000	3802000	this website you agree to use cookies
3802000	3804000	here's our cookie policy that's because of
3804000	3806000	something that happened in the UK not here
3806000	3808000	so but we all
3808000	3810000	kind of get it too because
3810000	3812000	in the world wide web
3812000	3814000	you know it kind of has to apply
3814000	3816000	they set the bar at the most
3816000	3818000	stringent standard and then the rest of us kind of see
3818000	3820000	the effects of that exactly yeah
3820000	3822000	I think the auto renewal you know it's interesting because you know
3822000	3824000	it's a like when you get your free
3824000	3826000	PlayStation Plus games let's say
3826000	3828000	if you don't renew
3828000	3830000	and you're at the mercy of
3830000	3832000	Sony and everything I'm saying could apply
3832000	3834000	to Microsoft or I'm not picking on
3834000	3836000	Sony I'm just using them as an example
3836000	3838000	but um you know if you don't renew
3838000	3840000	um you don't get to play
3840000	3842000	those games anymore that you got for
3842000	3844000	free and that's part of the agreement but
3844000	3846000	you're kind of at the mercy of Sony
3846000	3848000	could kind of kick up the price of that
3848000	3850000	at any time they want to
3850000	3852000	well the same thing goes for Spotify subscription
3852000	3854000	or Pandora or Apple Music
3854000	3856000	it really is quite literally the same
3856000	3858000	thing it's just for games instead of listening
3858000	3860000	to music you know
3860000	3862000	it's really
3862000	3864000	no different I mean you know
3864000	3866000	Pandora could bump up their price or Spotify
3866000	3868000	could bump up their price and it's really
3868000	3870000	I
3870000	3872000	mean
3872000	3874000	it's like that ongoing
3874000	3876000	capitalist inflation cycle
3876000	3878000	where everything else increases
3878000	3880000	but your money does not so
3880000	3882000	it's all that
3882000	3884000	Akuma JP in chat says in Japan
3884000	3886000	we're trying to get rid of auto-subscribe
3886000	3888000	and fees for unsubscribe
3888000	3890000	I can't even believe there'd be like
3890000	3892000	fees for unsubscribing you know what I kind
3892000	3894000	of think is that I
3894000	3896000	the thing that frustrates me is that like to
3896000	3898000	get to unsubscribe from some
3898000	3900000	things you have to like call
3900000	3902000	in and the thing is only
3902000	3904000	open between like 9 am and 5
3904000	3906000	pm when a lot of people are working or whatever
3906000	3908000	so sometimes it's like really hard
3908000	3910000	to like cancel something because you can only
3910000	3912000	do it over the phone even though you can sign up for it
3912000	3914000	online so I kind of think
3914000	3916000	and I thought I heard something about the rules
3916000	3918000	moving this way or whatever is
3918000	3920000	that if you sign up for something
3920000	3922000	online you ought to be able to
3922000	3924000	cancel online as well
3924000	3926000	you shouldn't be able to sign up
3926000	3928000	and then not
3928000	3930000	like cancel the same way you signed
3930000	3932000	up they should only have cancellation
3932000	3934000	cancellation over the phone is the only option
3934000	3936000	if subscribing over the phone is the only
3936000	3938000	option that's the thing that I kind of disagree with
3938000	3940000	but I thought I heard something about laws
3940000	3942000	we're looking into that as well
3942000	3944000	so YYR in chat
3944000	3946000	says where are there fees for unsubscribing
3946000	3948000	it could be another part
3948000	3950000	you know Akuma JP is commenting from Japan
3950000	3952000	so maybe it's just not something we
3952000	3954000	have here but
3954000	3956000	well I have heard of things like early
3956000	3958000	termination agreements like cell phones
3958000	3960000	you sign up for a year
3960000	3962000	and then mortgages prepayment penalties
3962000	3964000	sure or
3964000	3966000	again
3966000	3968000	gyms right for some
3968000	3970000	deals you have to sign up for a year
3970000	3972000	and if you break it early you get a penalty
3972000	3974000	so but I get
3974000	3976000	that that's kind of you know
3976000	3978000	maybe we kind of sit here
3978000	3980000	going oh well doesn't everybody
3980000	3982000	know that but you know certain cultures
3982000	3984000	may have a different approach and I think
3984000	3986000	that's also what you're seeing here is that the UK
3986000	3988000	is starting to look at some things that maybe
3988000	3990000	we've just kind of come to accept as normal
3990000	3992000	in our culture and going huh should that
3992000	3994000	really be the way I don't know
3994000	3996000	so anyway
3996000	3998000	alright Sia Tabiri in chat
3998000	4000000	says Verizon will never let the
4000000	4002000	government stop that and Amazon
4002000	4004000	or Act Deft points out Amazon
4004000	4006000	used to have a cancellation fee for monthly
4006000	4008000	prime subscribers but they got rid
4008000	4010000	of that and then
4010000	4012000	the break man says
4012000	4014000	rollover contracts are a big no-no
4014000	4016000	in the UK as of the 2015 law
4016000	4018000	very interesting how all these
4018000	4020000	as the world gets more and more closer
4020000	4022000	together through the internet
4022000	4024000	all these laws in different places
4024000	4026000	kind of set different tones very interesting
4026000	4028000	anyway it's always about
4028000	4030000	consumer advocacy though that's very important
4030000	4032000	well let's move on for the sake of time
4032000	4034000	we're gonna go to our next topic Loki
4034000	4036000	yeah so this is kind of neat
4036000	4038000	so apparently Microsoft is rolling
4038000	4040000	the Xbox or they're giving you an
4040000	4042000	option to
4042000	4044000	have basically Xbox Live and Game Pass
4044000	4046000	as one big subscription
4046000	4048000	so apparently the plan
4048000	4050000	is to merge them into a $15
4050000	4052000	per month subscription called Xbox Game
4052000	4054000	Pass Ultimate
4054000	4056000	that'll basically give you both of those
4056000	4058000	services
4058000	4060000	at one cost now
4060000	4062000	apparently the annual of course
4062000	4064000	live gold membership is
4064000	4066000	$60 and 12 months of Game Pass is
4066000	4068000	$120 so that still
4068000	4070000	works out to $180 per year
4070000	4072000	so you're not really saving any money
4072000	4074000	in that way
4074000	4076000	but maybe $15
4076000	4078000	a month they're kind of
4078000	4080000	poising it in a way that
4080000	4082000	like hey you pay like 12 bucks a month
4082000	4084000	for Netflix or whatever and
4084000	4086000	it's not much more so
4086000	4088000	maybe that's how they're trying
4088000	4090000	to sell it when I first read the article
4090000	4092000	I was like oh this is what they're gonna start to move to
4092000	4094000	it's the only option I was like I've been saying this
4094000	4096000	they dropped the price down like maybe dropped it down
4096000	4098000	to like say $12.99 a month
4098000	4100000	or something like that and then
4100000	4102000	look see if you sign up for both
4102000	4104000	you save a little bit but
4104000	4106000	if you sign up for both
4106000	4108000	you pay for both that's not really much
4108000	4110000	of a deal
4110000	4112000	aren't you saying that only if you're paying for like live
4112000	4114000	on a year if you're paying live month to month you're still saving money
4114000	4116000	aren't you? Right but you're
4116000	4118000	always gonna be saving a month even just paying it for a
4118000	4120000	year so I
4120000	4122000	depends on how you want to do it
4122000	4124000	but I've been kind of sitting here going it's only
4124000	4126000	a matter of time before they just kind of
4126000	4128000	loop Game Pass and gold into the same thing
4128000	4130000	and this feels like a step in that direction
4130000	4132000	even though you know the finances and all that
4132000	4134000	get tricky and I do think
4134000	4136000	I do think you know they're not gonna
4136000	4138000	be able to easily
4138000	4140000	convince people to do this if they can't get
4140000	4142000	the price of Game Pass as low as the price of gold
4142000	4144000	maybe this could be per month
4144000	4146000	and then if they have like a year
4146000	4148000	subscription to this it's even less
4148000	4150000	you know maybe they could do something like that
4150000	4152000	I can understand that might be a little bit more
4152000	4154000	enticing because it's like oh hey you know I can get both these
4154000	4156000	services for less than I'm
4156000	4158000	you know paying for them
4158000	4160000	you month to month or something like that
4160000	4162000	I just don't see the advantage of just
4162000	4164000	putting the prices together
4164000	4166000	it's if you're doing it month to month
4166000	4168000	and YYR points out if you're paying month to month
4168000	4170000	$15 a month is a 25% savings
4170000	4172000	over subscribing to both individually
4172000	4174000	but if you're paying $60 a year then it's the same
4174000	4176000	price unless they get rid of gold
4176000	4178000	and just have that is this is your
4178000	4180000	only option I just I feel
4180000	4182000	like that you know I've been saying that for a long time
4182000	4184000	but maybe I know I know we're probably still
4184000	4186000	a little bit away from that but it'll be
4186000	4188000	very interesting to see I think at E3
4188000	4190000	what Microsoft does to push this further
4190000	4192000	are they saying this is going to be a thing at E3 or
4192000	4194000	sooner than that?
4194000	4196000	The thought was that it's supposed to be
4196000	4198000	this is rumor right? It's supposed to be out
4198000	4200000	around the time when the Xbox
4200000	4202000	One S all digital edition is revealed
4202000	4204000	the thought is so
4204000	4206000	that I think is supposed to happen in a few weeks
4206000	4208000	so I guess we'll hear about this before
4208000	4210000	E3. Alright
4210000	4212000	it'll be interesting if all this stuff kind of comes out
4212000	4214000	before E3.
4214000	4216000	Moving on to what's been kind of
4216000	4218000	an interesting back and forth this week
4218000	4220000	Kotaku ran a very
4220000	4222000	interesting piece on BioWare
4222000	4224000	that was really kind of a dragging and exposing
4224000	4226000	of some of the things that went on behind the scenes
4226000	4228000	at Anthem and the development
4228000	4230000	of Anthem and why Anthem may not
4230000	4232000	have turned out to be as
4232000	4234000	wonderful as it did. I'm not going to
4234000	4236000	really try to summarize the article if
4236000	4238000	you want to go read it you can. I would say
4238000	4240000	what I took away from this and maybe some of you in
4240000	4242000	the chat feel different but it really sounds
4242000	4244000	like they shifted
4244000	4246000	development in the last year
4246000	4248000	and a half which I feel like we
4248000	4250000	hear about games all the time and I would say
4250000	4252000	Final Fantasy XV was another one of those games
4252000	4254000	they just took the wheel and change
4254000	4256000	development in the last year and a half and
4256000	4258000	that's one of the reasons but it sounds like the biggest
4258000	4260000	reason Anthem had
4260000	4262000	problems was that they were forced to use the Frostbite
4262000	4264000	engine. It really sounds like that Frostbite
4264000	4266000	engine is not doing
4266000	4268000	BioWare any favors because it sounds
4268000	4270000	like I'm hearing a lot of the same
4270000	4272000	stuff out of what happened with
4272000	4274000	Mass Effect Andromeda and so on. Anyway
4274000	4276000	but the complicated
4276000	4278000	stuff that happened. So Kotaku
4278000	4280000	put out their story and then like what like 15 minutes
4280000	4282000	after the fact BioWare
4282000	4284000	put out a thing that
4284000	4286000	basically was like you know
4286000	4288000	we don't agree and it was
4288000	4290000	very kind of generic and didn't really
4290000	4292000	speak specifically to the piece like they knew it was
4292000	4294000	coming but they didn't know specifically what was
4294000	4296000	in it and obviously if Kotaku had asked
4296000	4298000	BioWare to comment on it then they probably knew it was
4298000	4300000	coming. Well a secondary
4300000	4302000	piece kind of came out and
4302000	4304000	Casey Hudson I believe wrote this piece
4304000	4306000	to something they sent to the whole
4306000	4308000	staff and of course emails
4308000	4310000	leaked from within what a shock
4310000	4312000	and part of the letter says
4312000	4314000	what we found out of bounds
4314000	4316000	was the naming of specific developers
4316000	4318000	as targets for public criticism
4318000	4320000	because Kotaku does try to kind of
4320000	4322000	draw this line of this particular
4322000	4324000	individual came in and the development kind of
4324000	4326000	shifted so it did kind of I did
4326000	4328000	find it to be maybe finger pointing a little bit
4328000	4330000	but I didn't me personally I didn't see
4330000	4332000	it as a negative I kind of felt like
4332000	4334000	it might be that this guy saw this
4334000	4336000	machine that was rolling in like all these different
4336000	4338000	directions and had to put it on
4338000	4340000	course because it was spiraling out of control
4340000	4342000	or something. It sounds like there's a lot
4342000	4344000	of other issues going into this that are
4344000	4346000	more complex than a three hour show can handle
4346000	4348000	but what's also interesting
4348000	4350000	is Kotaku kind of notes at the end of the letter
4350000	4352000	they said that
4352000	4354000	they've heard from a number of developers
4354000	4356000	who work or have worked at beloved
4356000	4358000	AAA game studios with messages like
4358000	4360000	replace BioWare with my
4360000	4362000	studio and it's the same story
4362000	4364000	and these are things like
4364000	4366000	crunch hours
4366000	4368000	just things
4368000	4370000	the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing
4372000	4374000	rivalries between studios that are in
4374000	4376000	different cities and like all
4376000	4378000	of these things are just like really really
4378000	4380000	messy and
4380000	4382000	I don't know
4382000	4384000	I think we all have been sitting here going
4384000	4386000	the gaming industry is going to
4386000	4388000	crack under some of this at some point
4388000	4390000	and I don't know if it's the AAA
4390000	4392000	gaming that is going to be
4392000	4394000	looking at streaming as a primary thing that's
4394000	4396000	going to cause some things to crack or if
4396000	4398000	game developers do
4398000	4400000	cross that bridge and they
4400000	4402000	form a big game developer union
4402000	4404000	I mean Hollywood has unions
4404000	4406000	they need to unionize like
4406000	4408000	major Hollywood has Screen
4408000	4410000	Actors Guild, Writers Guild
4410000	4412000	I mean right so
4412000	4414000	it would be
4414000	4416000	sorry now it's SAG-AFTRA
4416000	4418000	the Screen Actors and the Play Actors
4418000	4420000	and voice actors
4420000	4422000	are part of that as well which
4422000	4424000	have affected gaming in the past
4424000	4426000	and they have very specific rules
4426000	4428000	they have to follow so anyway
4428000	4430000	I know that's a really kind of like controversial thing
4430000	4432000	but I think a lot of us are sitting here going
4432000	4434000	this whole like gaming crunch
4434000	4436000	time and the way games are being developed
4436000	4438000	it ain't working
4438000	4440000	y'all
4440000	4442000	and especially when you look at Anthem
4442000	4444000	some people are still defending
4444000	4446000	Anthem and having a good time playing it
4446000	4448000	and if you're having a good time with Anthem
4448000	4450000	go you, have fun
4450000	4452000	but I'm hearing some challenges about
4452000	4454000	what to do at the end of Anthem
4454000	4456000	and that it seems like it might be a little bit short sight
4456000	4458000	I feel like this is a broken record
4458000	4460000	there's so many of these games that have been in development
4460000	4462000	for years, well we just joked about
4462000	4464000	Dead Island 2 right?
4464000	4466000	they probably haven't started the real development
4466000	4468000	on Dead Island 2 yet
4468000	4470000	and they're going to crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch
4470000	4472000	to get it out by the end of a fiscal year
4472000	4474000	so
4474000	4476000	anyway
4476000	4478000	Kaijuto in chat says if they make a union
4478000	4480000	I hope they name it the multiplayer
4480000	4482000	unions don't really get
4482000	4484000	very cute names
4484000	4486000	it'll probably be something very, very plain
4486000	4488000	let's see
4488000	4490000	Act Def says
4490000	4492000	it's the people running the unions that
4492000	4494000	may be bad, unions aren't a bad thing
4494000	4496000	and devs should definitely form one
4496000	4498000	I don't know if the US has a similar law but in Mexico
4498000	4500000	you have the right to start a union
4500000	4502000	yeah you have the right to start a union, it's just
4502000	4504000	some companies will go so far
4504000	4506000	as to show you movies on your first day on why it's a bad idea
4506000	4508000	sometimes happens
4508000	4510000	so anyway
4510000	4512000	YYR in chat says and this is why I develop games
4512000	4514000	in my spare time and refuse to actually try to do it
4514000	4516000	for a living, sorry that you're all still waiting
4516000	4518000	for the new bungee ferret tossing but
4518000	4520000	it's not ready, and that's okay
4520000	4522000	YYR, when it's ready, it's ready
4522000	4524000	and that's cool, I mean you got new baby
4524000	4526000	and all that stuff, you're busy
4526000	4528000	it's fine, it's done
4528000	4530000	when it's done, right
4530000	4532000	just like we've gotten used to with a lot of blizzard games
4532000	4534000	just like we get used to with a lot of movies
4534000	4536000	it's done when it's done, right
4536000	4538000	and that's a-ok
4538000	4540000	so
4540000	4542000	what was I gonna say with the whole
4542000	4544000	that whole tangent
4544000	4546000	about the development needing to take its time
4546000	4548000	I lost my train of thought but
4548000	4550000	I think, you know, it's gonna get worse
4550000	4552000	in some ways when the graphics
4552000	4554000	are pushed even further
4554000	4556000	as we move into the Playstation 5
4556000	4558000	and the Xbox, you know, whatever the next Xbox
4558000	4560000	is, I don't know, I feel like something's gonna give
4560000	4562000	here, it's just
4562000	4564000	this industry really can't
4564000	4566000	keep going the way it's
4566000	4568000	going and people
4568000	4570000	need to be held accountable for some of these really
4570000	4572000	fucking bad decisions that happen
4572000	4574000	because I, from my perspective and looking
4574000	4576000	at all this, I feel like truly
4576000	4578000	the bottom line in this whole
4578000	4580000	thing on why these games are not
4580000	4582000	turning out as good as they could be
4582000	4584000	is that they're being forced to use the Frostbite engine
4584000	4586000	because of some type of company
4586000	4588000	you know, because EA, EA's making
4588000	4590000	them do it, like the real enemy
4590000	4592000	in this whole thing between
4592000	4594000	Mass Effect Andromeda and
4594000	4596000	maybe the next Dragon
4596000	4598000	Age and Anthem
4598000	4600000	is the Frostbite engine
4600000	4602000	so, you know what, EA
4602000	4604000	it is time to let that engine
4604000	4606000	go and if your developers
4606000	4608000	want to make a game in Unity, fucking let them
4608000	4610000	fucking let them
4610000	4612000	why are you, why are you tied, like you're
4612000	4614000	gonna go like that, do you want that Frostbite
4614000	4616000	engine to be the hill that you
4616000	4618000	die on? Cause
4618000	4620000	so far it's not looking good
4620000	4622000	Unless they have some sort of exclusivity
4622000	4624000	contract
4624000	4626000	and they're stuck to it
4626000	4628000	What I'm saying is that that contract is garbage
4628000	4630000	and it's sinking those games and they need to
4630000	4632000	end that contract or whatever it is
4632000	4634000	But companies don't think that way, they think of
4634000	4636000	immediate and not long term
4636000	4638000	Anyhow, let's move on
4638000	4640000	we got plenty more show to cover
4640000	4642000	Alright, well, how about
4642000	4644000	loot boxes?
4644000	4646000	How about no loot boxes?
4646000	4648000	Well, anyway
4648000	4650000	the Federal Trade Commission is going to
4650000	4652000	be holding a public workshop
4652000	4654000	on August 7th
4654000	4656000	2019 at the Constitution
4656000	4658000	Center in Washington D.C.
4658000	4660000	It will be webcast on the FTC's
4660000	4662000	website, but the workshop is called
4662000	4664000	Inside the Game, Unlocking Consumer
4664000	4666000	Issues Surrounding Loot Boxes
4666000	4668000	to quote
4668000	4670000	Examine consumer protection issues
4670000	4672000	related to video game loot boxes
4672000	4674000	End game rewards players can
4674000	4676000	buy while playing a video game
4676000	4678000	So this is what they want to do, they want to include
4678000	4680000	industry representatives, consumer advocates
4680000	4682000	trade associations, academics
4682000	4684000	and government officials to discuss
4684000	4686000	these following things. So it's the
4686000	4688000	end game transition landscape
4688000	4690000	including origin and
4690000	4692000	evolution of loot boxes and their role
4692000	4694000	in game play in the digital marketplace
4694000	4696000	and this is actually bullet points from
4696000	4698000	their thing
4698000	4700000	I was just going to say, Bobby is suggesting
4700000	4702000	this webcast should include one slide
4702000	4704000	with one word, don't
4704000	4706000	Research examining
4706000	4708000	consumer behavior including child and adolescent
4708000	4710000	behavior in the context of video games
4710000	4712000	and digital transactions
4712000	4714000	and a discussion of consumer awareness
4714000	4716000	and education about end game digital
4716000	4718000	transactions including the mechanics, marketing
4718000	4720000	and financial commitments associated
4720000	4722000	with loot boxes
4722000	4724000	They're also saying
4724000	4726000	that the public can
4726000	4728000	submit their input on those
4728000	4730000	topics by emailing lootbox
4730000	4732000	workshop at
4732000	4734000	ftc.gov up until
4734000	4736000	June 7th of this year
4736000	4738000	So there you go, you can send your email
4738000	4740000	subject, loot boxes, message, don't
4740000	4742000	There's also
4742000	4744000	an online
4744000	4746000	comment, forum
4746000	4748000	comment, forum on
4748000	4750000	the FTC
4750000	4752000	website which I will be linking in chat
4752000	4754000	Oh good!
4754000	4756000	But I'll just
4756000	4758000	go ahead and read it, it's regulations
4758000	4760000	dot gov slash
4760000	4762000	dot get question mark
4762000	4764000	D equals FTC
4764000	4766000	dash 2019 dash 0021
4766000	4768000	I imagine most of you will just Google
4768000	4770000	it. Whatever, I just said it
4770000	4772000	because it was a short one, it wasn't all crazy
4772000	4774000	But yeah,
4774000	4776000	basically you can
4776000	4778000	comment on the
4778000	4780000	document, there's nothing supporting right now
4780000	4782000	but the final
4782000	4784000	on that page is the document
4784000	4786000	for their
4786000	4788000	proposal on here for that workshop
4788000	4790000	and just taking a quick glance
4790000	4792000	over on it
4794000	4796000	Why does everything from the FTC
4796000	4798000	have to be in Microsoft Word format?
4798000	4800000	So basically
4800000	4802000	yeah, it's a lot of what I said
4802000	4804000	but it talks about what a loot box
4804000	4806000	is, why people
4806000	4808000	have concerns about it
4808000	4810000	and basically some of the goals of it
4810000	4812000	and again, it's for the public
4812000	4814000	I think it would be interesting to read this
4814000	4816000	and I might have to go in and do it later just to see how it's been
4816000	4818000	dumbed down for government officials
4818000	4820000	There's also a media contact listed in here
4820000	4822000	Fun
4822000	4824000	I imagine many of you are running
4824000	4826000	to the forum right now to simply post
4826000	4828000	don't
4828000	4830000	Does anyone enjoy loot boxes?
4832000	4834000	Sometimes they're kind of fun if you're guaranteed
4834000	4836000	something nice
4836000	4838000	I mean, I didn't mind it so much in
4838000	4840000	Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
4840000	4842000	but I got
4842000	4844000	kind of tired of it
4844000	4846000	I prefer being able to
4846000	4848000	win currency in my game
4848000	4850000	instead of getting a box for it
4850000	4852000	because that's 90% of
4852000	4854000	I saved my points and got stuff
4854000	4856000	instead of just paying into them
4856000	4858000	What are the people who will pay into it to get the biggest and bestest?
4858000	4860000	I like Enforza
4860000	4862000	where it's like you kind of have a wheel
4862000	4864000	that you spin but you'll get everything eventually
4864000	4866000	you know what I mean? If they want to
4866000	4868000	hand it out in a random order then fine
4868000	4870000	I don't know, but anyway
4870000	4872000	AkumaJP in chat says
4872000	4874000	free loot box I don't mind
4874000	4876000	when it's free and you get them as a part
4876000	4878000	of playing through the game
4878000	4880000	I think that's why a lot of people kind of give
4880000	4882000	Overwatch some slack because
4882000	4884000	Overwatch is kind of constantly handing out
4884000	4886000	free loot boxes between the holidays
4886000	4888000	and every time you level up and all that stuff
4888000	4890000	so I think that's why
4890000	4892000	some people kind of let that one slide
4892000	4894000	I don't know. Anyway, moving on
4894000	4896000	we still have some more gaming stories for you guys
4896000	4898000	Loki. Alright, well
4898000	4900000	something coming from yet another
4900000	4902000	battle royale game
4902000	4904000	but taking a page
4904000	4906000	out of Apex Legends
4906000	4908000	Fortnite has decided to add reboot vans
4908000	4910000	which apparently is very similar to
4910000	4912000	the respawn
4912000	4914000	beacons that you have in Apex Legends
4914000	4916000	but of course now they're just
4916000	4918000	kind of skinning it for
4918000	4920000	Fortnite so that's the new update that's going to be
4920000	4922000	coming very soon as well
4922000	4924000	to kind of mix up the game a little bit
4924000	4926000	and they kind of do something like
4926000	4928000	once a month anyways to kind of mix the game
4928000	4930000	up so I'm not surprised
4930000	4932000	that one game's curving
4932000	4934000	off of another game for
4934000	4936000	gameplay ideas
4936000	4938000	It's kind of interesting now to see how like
4938000	4940000	Fortnite that's been kind of leading things
4940000	4942000	it's kind of taken some cues now from
4942000	4944000	Apex which has Apex overtaken
4944000	4946000	Fortnite at this point or is it still kind of like a back
4946000	4948000	and forth? I've been watching the
4948000	4950000	Twitch rankings that closely and I know that's just one
4950000	4952000	representation
4952000	4954000	of how the games might actually be doing
4954000	4956000	when it comes to the money they're making
4956000	4958000	and so forth so yeah but
4958000	4960000	I mean I think it sounds interesting
4960000	4962000	I don't know I still just when it comes
4962000	4964000	to Fortnite like the building thing I just
4964000	4966000	I've never been able to wrap my head
4966000	4968000	around how the building works like what
4968000	4970000	like strategically how you like do that
4970000	4972000	in Fortnite because Fortnite has like no
4972000	4974000	tutorial and so I've never really been able to
4974000	4976000	figure out how to use that effectively
4976000	4978000	You can do the creative mode which
4978000	4980000	you know what's funny and a half later because I went to go look at the
4980000	4982000	Weezer thing at one point and like you know
4982000	4984000	I yeah the creative mode's kind of fun I
4984000	4986000	like that but then when I I don't know
4986000	4988000	what the building in combat
4988000	4990000	I don't know I haven't been able to wrap my head around that but the building
4990000	4992000	stuff isn't in Apex so
4992000	4994000	in some ways it's kind of easier I think
4994000	4996000	so yeah
4996000	4998000	Bobby Blackwell says
4998000	5000000	in Fortnite when you shoot someone they turn into
5000000	5002000	a 10 story building yeah
5002000	5004000	or they they try to hide themselves inside
5004000	5006000	a 10 story building so that you can't shoot them
5006000	5008000	I suppose alright anyway
5008000	5010000	one more story for you guys before we get to
5010000	5012000	the Classic Game of the Week and it has to do with some
5012000	5014000	Best Buy leaks so who
5014000	5016000	knows if they're true or not but
5016000	5018000	I know they're talking about some things
5018000	5020000	I think a lot of us have been waiting for
5020000	5022000	well anyway apparently these were on
5022000	5024000	internal employee terminals
5024000	5026000	suggesting that Persona 5
5026000	5028000	was about to get a
5028000	5030000	Switch release for 60 bucks
5030000	5032000	they didn't have a date on it
5032000	5034000	it just was in the system
5034000	5036000	you know how that goes somebody made a record in the system
5036000	5038000	you know how that goes remember Walmart Canada
5038000	5040000	and E3 last year yeah
5040000	5042000	Metroid Prime Trilogy was
5042000	5044000	another one and I think a lot of us have been kind of
5044000	5046000	asking oh when is that going to come out on Switch so that
5046000	5048000	might actually be a thing but then
5048000	5050000	the other surprise in there was
5050000	5052000	The Legend of Zelda
5052000	5054000	A Link to the Past
5054000	5056000	wait a minute wait a minute
5056000	5058000	that's the Super Nintendo game
5058000	5060000	why would the Super Nintendo game
5060000	5062000	be released by itself
5062000	5064000	unless
5064000	5066000	either Nintendo does plan to
5066000	5068000	piecemeal this despite
5068000	5070000	their earlier marketing about
5070000	5072000	the NES and the Super Nintendo
5072000	5074000	being separate or could
5074000	5076000	they since they're making
5076000	5078000	this Link's Awakening game
5078000	5080000	in a 3D environment
5080000	5082000	that looks a lot like A Link to the Past
5082000	5084000	but 3D could they
5084000	5086000	possibly maybe
5086000	5088000	be remaking
5088000	5090000	A Link to the Past as
5090000	5092000	well that's what some people are
5092000	5094000	theorizing with this how would you
5094000	5096000	feel about how would you guys feel about
5096000	5098000	A Link to the Past remake
5098000	5100000	in that
5100000	5102000	3D style that they're doing this Awakening
5102000	5104000	remake in
5104000	5106000	I mean
5106000	5108000	I need my pixels
5108000	5110000	I'm open to it like the Secret of Mana
5110000	5112000	remake was alright
5112000	5114000	but the original is still
5114000	5116000	like the one like if I'm like you've never
5116000	5118000	played Secret of Mana I'm gonna pull up the original
5118000	5120000	like the 3D remake was cool
5120000	5122000	in some ways but it also had issues when it first came out
5122000	5124000	I don't know if you guys remember the Secret of Mana
5124000	5126000	kind of had some issues when it first came out so
5126000	5128000	I don't know but Nintendo
5128000	5130000	usually does not
5130000	5132000	I would trust Nintendo's quality
5132000	5134000	a little bit more than probably anybody else
5134000	5136000	so anyway
5136000	5138000	let's see
5138000	5140000	Brakeman says I want a VR style
5140000	5142000	remake be careful what you ask
5142000	5144000	for let's see
5144000	5146000	Bobby Blackpool says what is the remake also
5146000	5148000	has Metroid and has a randomizer
5148000	5150000	you're on
5150000	5152000	but I don't think that's what's gonna happen although
5152000	5154000	god I wish Nintendo would go down that path
5154000	5156000	can you even imagine you know what I want
5156000	5158000	I want a new remix game
5158000	5160000	like NES remix and wasn't there
5160000	5162000	SNES remix at one point I remember
5162000	5164000	no there wasn't then I want an SNES
5164000	5166000	remix I want those games to come back
5166000	5168000	out those are fun anyway
5168000	5170000	alright let's move on to
5170000	5172000	the classic game of the week
5172000	5174000	every week here on the show Dark
5174000	5176000	Soccer steps in the gaming vault to find the game
5176000	5178000	that she thinks hey sticky
5178000	5180000	you guys should be checking out this classic
5180000	5182000	oh my god the cat threw up and you know
5182000	5184000	sometimes that's what I say in the vault
5184000	5186000	sometimes Dark Soccer will pick
5186000	5188000	pretty obscure Japanese titles you probably never
5188000	5190000	played like last week was one of those
5190000	5192000	titles right it wasn't very
5192000	5194000	yeah it was but this
5194000	5196000	this week she's picking a game
5196000	5198000	that I owned
5198000	5200000	this is a little bit more
5200000	5202000	one that you guys probably could play
5202000	5204000	honestly act deaf this goes out to you
5204000	5206000	what is the classic game of the week
5206000	5208000	actually finger trick
5208000	5210000	it is Kirby Superstar
5210000	5212000	because
5212000	5214000	it's so much fun I've decided that
5214000	5216000	my first tattoo might actually
5216000	5218000	be Kirby riding the star
5218000	5220000	it might be if I don't get my cherry blossom
5220000	5222000	but anyway
5222000	5224000	in PAL regions it was released as Kirby's
5224000	5226000	Fun Pack and it came out in
5226000	5228000	1996 so the
5228000	5230000	year I moved out here
5230000	5232000	the year I graduated high school
5232000	5234000	girl I should take that back
5234000	5236000	no I moved out here did I move out here in 96?
5236000	5238000	I don't remember
5238000	5240000	no I think I moved out here in 98
5240000	5242000	anyway whatever
5242000	5244000	anyway it was
5244000	5246000	developed by HAL Laboratories and published by Nintendo
5246000	5248000	for the Super Nintendo
5248000	5250000	and it was part of
5250000	5252000	the entire Kirby series
5252000	5254000	it basically was advertised
5254000	5256000	as featuring 8 games
5256000	5258000	7 short sub games
5258000	5260000	with all the same basic gameplay
5260000	5262000	and too many games
5262000	5264000	it was later released on Wii and Wii U
5264000	5266000	and there's an enhanced remake
5266000	5268000	called Kirby Superstar Ultra
5268000	5270000	that came out on the DS in 2008
5270000	5272000	also Nintendo
5272000	5274000	re-released Kirby Superstar in Japan
5274000	5276000	US and Europe
5276000	5278000	in November 2017 as part of the
5278000	5280000	Super NES Classic Edition
5280000	5282000	which I think I played
5282000	5284000	quite a bit of that during the time
5284000	5286000	anyway you play
5286000	5288000	as Kirby who can float
5288000	5290000	and inhale stuff and spit him out
5290000	5292000	if he swallows certain enemies
5292000	5294000	he gains their abilities and can use them
5294000	5296000	as his own
5296000	5298000	another feature of this
5298000	5300000	particular game is helpers
5300000	5302000	so when Kirby has an ability he can
5302000	5304000	transform it into a helper character
5304000	5306000	that the second player or computer can
5306000	5308000	control and certain abilities
5308000	5310000	like
5310000	5312000	crash or the mic cannot be
5312000	5314000	like crash or mic cannot be
5314000	5316000	turned into helpers
5316000	5318000	so you have to choose to give the helper
5318000	5320000	a form or revert them into a power
5320000	5322000	up in an emergency
5322000	5324000	so some of them
5324000	5326000	like wheelie allow Kirby to interact with
5326000	5328000	them during two player play
5328000	5330000	so
5330000	5332000	basically if it takes too much damage
5332000	5334000	then Kirby can grant it a new power
5334000	5336000	before it disappears and he has to create
5336000	5338000	a new one and if Kirby takes too much
5338000	5340000	damage he loses a life
5340000	5342000	so there are a few
5342000	5344000	the different ones in here are Spring Breeze
5344000	5346000	which is a simplified remake
5346000	5348000	of Kirby's Dream Land
5348000	5350000	but it has the Superstar enhancements in it
5350000	5352000	so basically you have to make it to a
5352000	5354000	castle to challenge King Dedede
5354000	5356000	who has stolen food from Dream Land
5356000	5358000	wah
5358000	5360000	and also float islands
5360000	5362000	in Castle Lola Will have emerged
5362000	5364000	and Kabula does not
5364000	5366000	appear and then
5366000	5368000	when you reach Castle Dedede you don't have
5368000	5370000	to do a boss rush to get to
5370000	5372000	King Dedede
5372000	5374000	Dynablade is an original
5374000	5376000	one where you have to stop Dynablade
5376000	5378000	which is a giant bird from
5378000	5380000	disturbing Dream Land's crops
5380000	5382000	it's all about food isn't it Kirby?
5382000	5384000	so you have four layers that you have to play and then you face off
5384000	5386000	against Dynablade and you have two secret
5386000	5388000	areas and many bosses that move around the world
5388000	5390000	map in this one
5390000	5392000	Gourmet Race, jeez even more food
5392000	5394000	so you have to race against King Dedede
5394000	5396000	while eating as much food as you can
5396000	5398000	so
5398000	5400000	you take
5400000	5402000	it takes place across three levels of different links
5402000	5404000	and whoever earns the most points by the end of all three levels
5404000	5406000	with a bonus point being the first to
5406000	5408000	finish each race
5408000	5410000	and so then you can choose to race
5410000	5412000	King Dedede or your ghost
5412000	5414000	to be the best at that
5414000	5416000	and the DS actually had multiplayer
5416000	5418000	functionality in this one
5418000	5420000	then we have the Great Cave Offensive which is
5420000	5422000	a metroidvania style game
5422000	5424000	where Kirby has to explore a cave for treasure
5424000	5426000	and so you have
5426000	5428000	sixty treasure chests
5428000	5430000	and you get a maximum score
5430000	5432000	of, it looks like
5432000	5434000	ninety-nine million
5434000	5436000	no, nine million nine hundred and ninety
5436000	5438000	nine, nine hundred and ninety points
5438000	5440000	and sixty treasures
5440000	5442000	it also has references to
5442000	5444000	other Nintendo games like the Triforce
5444000	5446000	screw attack
5446000	5448000	the helmet of Captain Falcon and
5448000	5450000	Mr. Saturn from Earthbound
5450000	5452000	and then you've got
5452000	5454000	other value
5454000	5456000	items that appear like in other
5456000	5458000	role playing games. We have the Revenge of
5458000	5460000	Meta Knight which basically has Kirby
5460000	5462000	trying to destroy Meta Knight's battleship
5462000	5464000	the Halberd before Meta Knight can
5464000	5466000	conquer Dreamland
5466000	5468000	you have a time limit and it will cost
5468000	5470000	you a life if it hits zero
5470000	5472000	and it is very apparently plot based
5472000	5474000	so then we also have Milky Way Wishes
5474000	5476000	which is the largest game in the collection
5476000	5478000	basically the sun and the moon
5478000	5480000	around planet Popstar
5480000	5482000	are fighting and a creature named
5482000	5484000	Marx tells Kirby that he must travel across
5484000	5486000	nine planets to restore a giant
5486000	5488000	wish granting comet
5488000	5490000	Nova, comet Clock Nova
5490000	5492000	so unlike this one
5492000	5494000	Kirby can't copy
5494000	5496000	the enemies
5496000	5498000	he can get copy essence's
5498000	5500000	deluxe and then he can choose a copy ability
5500000	5502000	from the list and then he has it through the game
5502000	5504000	also
5504000	5506000	beating Milky Way Wishes
5506000	5508000	grant you the arena sub game
5508000	5510000	and the arena is an endurance mode
5510000	5512000	that is a big boss rush, you fight basically
5512000	5514000	every boss, there are 26 bosses
5514000	5516000	in 19 rounds
5516000	5518000	and in between each round you have
5518000	5520000	a room with maximum tomatoes
5520000	5522000	five of them which can only be used
5522000	5524000	once each and then
5524000	5526000	two randomly selected pedestals will
5526000	5528000	give you certain powers
5528000	5530000	you can choose any of the powers at the beginning of the game
5530000	5532000	and then if you beat that you get the sound test
5532000	5534000	function so you can listen to all the music in the game
5534000	5536000	there are some sub games like Samurai Kirby
5536000	5538000	where it's a
5538000	5540000	timing based mini game
5540000	5542000	like quick draw from Kirby's adventure
5542000	5544000	where you have to
5544000	5546000	do the attack at just the right moment
5546000	5548000	wild gunman basically and then megaton
5548000	5550000	punch which is what I did yesterday
5550000	5552000	anyway you have to punch a crack
5552000	5554000	in the planet and you have to make a bigger crack
5554000	5556000	the point is crack rob
5556000	5558000	anyway
5558000	5560000	this is one of those games that had a special
5560000	5562000	chip for it, it's the SA-1 chip
5562000	5564000	and
5564000	5566000	with this particular
5566000	5568000	one it was basically just to
5568000	5570000	be able to
5570000	5572000	help with some of the computer generated imagery
5572000	5574000	like what was in the
5574000	5576000	introduction
5576000	5578000	they had some
5578000	5580000	other things that were planned
5580000	5582000	for the game and of course
5582000	5584000	Sakurai who also did give us Smash
5584000	5586000	Brothers
5586000	5588000	was developing the game using three different
5588000	5590000	design pillars as he said it
5590000	5592000	a two player co-op gameplay, beat em up
5592000	5594000	gameplay and an omnibus format
5594000	5596000	that you could use it to reach
5596000	5598000	an ending and actually it was
5598000	5600000	that last
5600000	5602000	sorry the two player co-op
5602000	5604000	I believe was requested by Miyamoto
5604000	5606000	and then
5606000	5608000	a couple of the other things
5608000	5610000	that were wanted to be in the game
5610000	5612000	was one called Kagero Mansion
5612000	5614000	which was a survival horror game
5614000	5616000	that leaves Kirby stuck in a mansion
5616000	5618000	with a cursed seal in his mouth
5618000	5620000	so he cannot use his
5620000	5622000	inhale or copy ability
5622000	5624000	and then
5624000	5626000	it was meant to be a little bit more
5626000	5628000	proactive in the gameplay but
5628000	5630000	they didn't want to
5630000	5632000	do it so basically
5632000	5634000	but when it was sold in Japan
5634000	5636000	it was sold in a package
5636000	5638000	resembling a wooden box with a seal
5638000	5640000	burnt off
5640000	5642000	like buying high priced sake or dishware
5642000	5644000	comes in one of those boxes, luxury items
5644000	5646000	so the design was supposed to be
5646000	5648000	like a luxury item box
5650000	5652000	so anyway
5652000	5654000	with the remake version
5654000	5656000	which came out in 2008 so it's still
5656000	5658000	under that 10 year thing
5658000	5660000	it has different modes
5660000	5662000	in it for Kirby Super Star Ultra
5662000	5664000	there's Revenge of the King which is a more
5664000	5666000	difficult version of Spring Breeze
5666000	5668000	where you fight a stronger King Dedede
5668000	5670000	which is Mask's Dedede
5670000	5672000	and in this one Kabula appears
5672000	5674000	and you
5674000	5676000	have to face using Starship Kirby
5676000	5678000	and you also have a Boss Rush
5678000	5680000	and they're all powered up
5680000	5682000	on top of that. Then you have Meta
5682000	5684000	Nightmare Ultra which you
5684000	5686000	control Meta Knight and he plays
5686000	5688000	through the levels on Spring Breeze, Dynablade
5688000	5690000	the Great Cave Offensive, Revenge
5690000	5692000	of Meta Knight, and Milky Way Wishes
5692000	5694000	and at the end of Milky Way Wishes instead of fighting
5694000	5696000	Marks he fights Galacta Knight
5696000	5698000	Helper to Hero
5698000	5700000	is also like an arena mode
5700000	5702000	but you play as a helper
5702000	5704000	and fight a new character
5704000	5706000	Wham Bam Jewel
5706000	5708000	True Arena is an enhanced arena
5708000	5710000	you've got all your extra bosses
5710000	5712000	in that one and then you have the sub games
5712000	5714000	Snack Tracks, Kirby Swipe
5714000	5716000	and Kirby on the Draw
5716000	5718000	which can be played up to 4 players
5718000	5720000	a local play. Anyway
5720000	5722000	it was pretty
5722000	5724000	pretty rad. People liked it and it
5724000	5726000	sold over 1 million copies in Japan
5726000	5728000	and it received fairly
5728000	5730000	favorable ratings and
5730000	5732000	a lot of people considered it one of the best games
5732000	5734000	in the franchise.
5734000	5736000	It got really great reviews
5736000	5738000	in EGM back then Electric Gaming Monthly
5738000	5740000	GamePro really
5740000	5742000	GamePro gave it a 5 out of 5
5742000	5744000	in sound and control and Fun Factor
5744000	5746000	got a 4.5 out of 5
5746000	5748000	and it was really considered just a
5748000	5750000	very charming and fun little game
5750000	5752000	Famitsu gave it 32 out of
5752000	5754000	40
5754000	5756000	and in 2008
5756000	5758000	Superstar Ultra became a Famitsu
5758000	5760000	Gold title
5760000	5762000	and that particular one
5762000	5764000	sold 1 million
5764000	5766000	21,000 copies in
5766000	5768000	Japan and was the 9th best selling
5768000	5770000	game of Japan in 2008
5770000	5772000	as of December 2008 it was the 5th best
5772000	5774000	selling Nintendo DS game in the US
5774000	5776000	and as far
5776000	5778000	as its legacy
5778000	5780000	some of the tracks
5780000	5782000	ended up in Super Smash Brothers
5782000	5784000	especially in the N64 and that was
5784000	5786000	the music from the Gourmet Race and Kirby's
5786000	5788000	theme song. It was on
5788000	5790000	Wii Virtual Console
5790000	5792000	and Wii U Virtual Console
5792000	5794000	like I said earlier
5794000	5796000	and it was included in Kirby's Dream Collection
5796000	5798000	that was released on the Wii
5798000	5800000	in celebration of the 20th anniversary
5800000	5802000	Metal Knights Battleship
5802000	5804000	the Halberd reappeared in
5804000	5806000	Kirby's Squeak Squad
5806000	5808000	Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Kirby's Epic Yarn
5808000	5810000	Super Smash Brothers for Wii U
5810000	5812000	and Kirby Planet Robobot
5812000	5814000	try that fist a little
5814000	5816000	it's not a tongue twister it's a
5816000	5818000	and then a stage based off
5818000	5820000	the Great Cave Offensive
5820000	5822000	shows up in Super Smash Brothers
5822000	5824000	for Wii U
5824000	5826000	that basically is just a reference back to them
5826000	5828000	of course it's included in the Super Nest classic
5828000	5830000	edition. So there you go
5830000	5832000	we got some koi b action
5832000	5834000	yes and it's a game that I
5834000	5836000	remember pretty fondly as well
5836000	5838000	I had this game, I loved the samurai game
5838000	5840000	the little wild gum and rip off was so much fun
5840000	5842000	I can't go
5842000	5844000	all
5844000	5846000	crazy
5846000	5848000	about
5848000	5850000	picking weird obscure shit no one's heard of
5850000	5852000	or that maybe five of us have heard of
5852000	5854000	I like the obscure stuff but I think
5854000	5856000	a good segment is a mixture of all of it
5856000	5858000	I am still thinking of getting the Kirby
5858000	5860000	on a star
5860000	5862000	because I said that when I lost
5862000	5864000	100 pounds I'd get ink
5864000	5866000	well now I've lost 116
5866000	5868000	I guess you still don't have ink
5868000	5870000	that's okay because I talked about getting a tattoo a long time ago
5870000	5872000	as well because I was
5872000	5874000	going to get a sound wave
5874000	5876000	here because thankfully
5876000	5878000	thanks to the long running history of this show
5878000	5880000	I have audio of my mom
5880000	5882000	because she was on the show so I wanted to get
5882000	5884000	you need to get the one of her going, Rob
5884000	5886000	well I wanted to get her
5886000	5888000	on my arm
5888000	5890000	and it's that whole little nerdy thing
5890000	5892000	where you can use the phone to play it and read it
5892000	5894000	and I realize that type of stuff won't be around forever
5894000	5896000	even though tattoos are but I still think like sound waves
5896000	5898000	the fact that it would be my mom and just the fact that
5898000	5900000	this shit here has been
5900000	5902000	a part of my life for so long there should be a
5902000	5904000	representation of that, you know, so
5904000	5906000	that's what I'm looking into doing
5906000	5908000	we'll have to go get matching
5908000	5910000	tattoos, no we wouldn't get matching tattoos
5910000	5912000	but sibling tattoos
5912000	5914000	anyway, does Agdeft have a Kirby tattoo?
5914000	5916000	I'd be curious about that
5916000	5918000	yeah I really want to know Agdeft, do you have a Kirby tattoo?
5918000	5920000	and where is it?
5920000	5922000	we're going to take a studio break real quick
5922000	5924000	but we're just going to throw it to a segment
5924000	5926000	I made earlier today, we're talking about classic
5926000	5928000	games, I've talked a lot on the show
5928000	5930000	before about the classic
5930000	5932000	Nintendo online library on the Switch
5932000	5934000	but I've talked about the
5934000	5936000	oh well maybe that's
5936000	5938000	something for the future
5938000	5940000	but I've talked about the Famicom
5940000	5942000	library and how there are some subtle differences
5942000	5944000	in some of the games and I thought it would be kind of
5944000	5946000	fun for this segment tonight to
5946000	5948000	show some of those subtle differences
5948000	5950000	here, so we will be right back
5950000	5952000	here on Orange Lounge
5952000	5954000	Radio, let's throw it to myself
5954000	5956000	earlier today
5956000	5958000	Hey everybody, it's Rob in the
5958000	5960000	office studio and I thought for our
5960000	5962000	OLR break tonight we could take a look at something
5962000	5964000	that I've talked a few times about on the show
5964000	5966000	but I haven't really shown here on the show
5966000	5968000	and I thought it would be a good thing for the midpoint
5968000	5970000	break, I've done a couple of livestreams
5970000	5972000	on my own personal channel that have
5972000	5974000	addressed this a little bit but what I wanted to show
5974000	5976000	tonight was the Nintendo Switch
5976000	5978000	online family computer classic console
5978000	5980000	or Famicom classic console
5980000	5982000	as opposed to the online library
5982000	5984000	for the NES that I think many of you
5984000	5986000	are used to, if you own
5986000	5988000	a Nintendo Switch you've probably fired up
5988000	5990000	this application and it shows you
5990000	5992000	all the classic games that you can play
5992000	5994000	and you can fire up whatever it is that you
5994000	5996000	want and you can play it, so
5996000	5998000	here's what it looks like right now
5998000	6000000	I think we're going to talk in tonight's show about some of the other
6000000	6002000	games that are coming soon, you can kind of see generally
6002000	6004000	what it looks like for those of you that don't own a Switch out there
6004000	6006000	you can pick whatever game it is
6006000	6008000	that you want to play and you just pretty much
6008000	6010000	go right into that game and you can hit the ground running
6010000	6012000	and play the game
6012000	6014000	but I want to take a look at the
6014000	6016000	Japanese version of this, the Famicom
6016000	6018000	which you can see right off the bat
6018000	6020000	had the very different controllers
6020000	6022000	it was a different system in Japan
6022000	6024000	and because it was a different system
6024000	6026000	there was also some different
6026000	6028000	types of peripherals, like they had a
6028000	6030000	disk based system if you weren't already aware
6030000	6032000	you could actually load
6032000	6034000	games based on a disk
6034000	6036000	kind of like computers back in the 80's
6036000	6038000	a lot of disk based stuff
6038000	6040000	well it's very easy since the Nintendo Switch is region free
6040000	6042000	it's very very easy to create a
6042000	6044000	Japanese account, you can go online
6044000	6046000	you create an account and just set it's
6046000	6048000	home as Japan somewhere
6048000	6050000	and then you can sign in on your
6050000	6052000	Switch with that account and you can go on to the
6052000	6054000	eShop and download this for free
6054000	6056000	and as long as you still have an online subscription
6056000	6058000	for your US account
6058000	6060000	or wherever it is you happen to be
6060000	6062000	it will work, the Japanese
6062000	6064000	stuff will work too because again
6064000	6066000	the Nintendo Switch is region free, it's just most people
6066000	6068000	don't think to make a Japanese
6068000	6070000	account to go on to the Japanese eShop
6070000	6072000	and download this, if you do do that
6072000	6074000	I notice sometimes I get
6074000	6076000	Japanese news updates and things
6076000	6078000	because I have both accounts on my Switch but
6078000	6080000	I don't mind at all actually
6080000	6082000	it's sometimes nice to see things on the other side of the pond
6082000	6084000	so let's fire up the Famicom version
6084000	6086000	of this and you don't have
6086000	6088000	to use, so you'll notice
6088000	6090000	if you have a Japanese account here, you don't have to use
6090000	6092000	the Japanese account, you can just use your regular account
6092000	6094000	in fact that would be the one you would want to use
6094000	6096000	because that's the one that actually
6096000	6098000	is paying for the Switch online service
6098000	6100000	which maybe you got free through the whole Amazon
6100000	6102000	deal lately, I don't know, but you only
6102000	6104000	need that Japanese account
6104000	6106000	to actually download the client from the
6106000	6108000	store, you'll see here, oh the
6108000	6110000	Japanese version looks very different because
6110000	6112000	again the boxes in Japan
6112000	6114000	very different and so it looks a little more jigsaw
6114000	6116000	puzzle here because of the fact
6116000	6118000	that all the
6118000	6120000	disks were different sizes and of course
6120000	6122000	there's a lot of special versions, different
6122000	6124000	software as well and all that fun stuff
6124000	6126000	and so you can kind of jump in and see some of the
6126000	6128000	big differences, for example let's fire up
6128000	6130000	Super Mario USA
6130000	6132000	right, which we all know is Super Mario Bros. 2
6132000	6134000	so it has kind of a different title
6134000	6136000	screen to it, otherwise
6136000	6138000	once you get into the game really it's pretty much the
6138000	6140000	same thing, it's just Super Mario Bros. 2
6140000	6142000	they just had that different screen that
6142000	6144000	went with it, so that one's a little bit like
6144000	6146000	whatever, there's not a lot of differences there
6146000	6148000	of course, one of the big big differences
6148000	6150000	is that Japan has been getting some games
6150000	6152000	that we haven't been getting in the US
6152000	6154000	for example, I don't believe this Yara
6154000	6156000	Kung Fu came out in the US
6156000	6158000	at all, this is based on a classic
6158000	6160000	arcade game, a really classic fighting
6160000	6162000	arcade game and yeah you can play
6162000	6164000	this which I don't think is available
6164000	6166000	in the US store at all
6166000	6168000	so, you know by downloading the Japanese
6168000	6170000	client, which again you have access to
6170000	6172000	and if you're paying for the US online you can just
6172000	6174000	create a Japanese account and go get it, you can check
6174000	6176000	out this game if you want, that's not
6176000	6178000	the only one
6178000	6180000	however there, you could also get Fire Emblem
6180000	6182000	which I know is a series a lot of people
6182000	6184000	are paying attention to now
6184000	6186000	but the original original was on
6186000	6188000	the NES and so that's what this game
6188000	6190000	is, unfortunately this one's a little
6190000	6192000	harder to play because as you see you're
6192000	6194000	gonna have to know some Japanese
6194000	6196000	in order to kind of make your way around the game
6196000	6198000	but I'm sure there's lots of FAQs
6198000	6200000	online that'll help you get through the game
6200000	6202000	because obviously, you know, people have
6202000	6204000	wanted to play this before so there's
6204000	6206000	fan translations and all that good stuff
6206000	6208000	obviously you can't translate the ROM itself
6208000	6210000	but there's some good text guides and things
6210000	6212000	that can walk you through the game and when in doubt
6212000	6214000	I'm sure a lot of YouTubes or other Twitch streamers
6214000	6216000	that are playing the game as well could also
6216000	6218000	help out with things like that, so this bottom option
6218000	6220000	will always take you back out to the main menu
6220000	6222000	also some other interesting differences, Blaster
6222000	6224000	Master, completely different game
6224000	6226000	in Japan, so it has like a completely
6226000	6228000	different screen here, Metafight right?
6228000	6230000	When you start the game, so you remember the story
6230000	6232000	in the US is like, oh you're gonna go rescue
6232000	6234000	your frog so you have this, you know
6234000	6236000	Sophia, the big
6236000	6238000	car that you're driving through the cave
6238000	6240000	right? You've seen that sequence at the beginning of Blaster Master?
6240000	6242000	Yeah, all in Japan? No.
6242000	6244000	Different story. It's not a cave.
6244000	6246000	It's like this laboratory thing.
6246000	6248000	Completely different story going on in that game
6248000	6250000	there, so that's kind of another like
6250000	6252000	little interesting difference. But one of the things
6252000	6254000	that I think gets really interesting is when you get
6254000	6256000	into some of these games that were on the
6256000	6258000	Disk System, the Famicom Disk System
6258000	6260000	because some of the sound
6260000	6262000	is slightly different because the
6262000	6264000	Famicom Disk System again had that extra
6264000	6266000	sound chip, so the versions
6266000	6268000	that are actually emulated here on
6268000	6270000	the Famicom library are
6270000	6272000	the Disk System versions. So for example
6272000	6274000	let's go to a game that I know everybody
6274000	6276000	knows, so where is it down here? Here we go.
6276000	6278000	The Hyrule Fantasy, right? The Legend of Zelda
6278000	6280000	and you can see that little logo with the little
6280000	6282000	yellow guy there for the Disk System, okay?
6282000	6284000	So that shows you that The Legend of Zelda was
6284000	6286000	a disk game and the way they translated that
6286000	6288000	when this game came out in the US was they
6288000	6290000	used the battery pack, but let's take a look at some of the
6290000	6292000	differences. So
6292000	6294000	it's very subtle
6294000	6296000	but if you can kind of hear the theme music
6296000	6298000	in the background, I'll shut up for a minute.
6302000	6304000	Little chimes.
6304000	6306000	There's some extra stuff in it, right?
6306000	6308000	Because there was a different sound
6308000	6310000	processing system on the
6310000	6312000	Famicom with the Disk System
6312000	6314000	versus the NES. So it sounded like a different
6314000	6316000	font as well that they used in that version.
6316000	6318000	So I can just go in real quick here as well.
6318000	6320000	I think I already set up a file. Now you have
6320000	6322000	to actually wait. The downside to using
6322000	6324000	the Disk System is it emulates the
6324000	6326000	loading times as well.
6326000	6328000	So you have to sit through the loading times
6328000	6330000	to actually get into the game.
6330000	6332000	But once you do,
6332000	6334000	it's pretty much the same game you remember from before.
6334000	6336000	But let me go pick up the sword,
6336000	6338000	okay?
6338000	6340000	And it is in Japanese
6340000	6342000	so he doesn't say
6342000	6344000	what he usually says.
6344000	6346000	It's dangerous to go alone, right?
6346000	6348000	But now, listen carefully when I fire the sword
6348000	6350000	because I have the full health.
6350000	6352000	Kind of a very
6352000	6354000	different sort of noise it makes there when you fire
6354000	6356000	that off, right? So some subtle
6356000	6358000	differences. Again, at the end
6358000	6360000	of the day, it's pretty much the same game
6360000	6362000	but there are some differences.
6362000	6364000	Now, some of these differences on the other
6364000	6366000	Disk System games get more so. Like if I
6366000	6368000	were to go over to Metroid,
6368000	6370000	okay, so here's Metroid.
6370000	6372000	And again, if you listen
6372000	6374000	very carefully, you can hear an extra kind of
6374000	6376000	bass track in the background
6376000	6378000	music here. But if I actually get into the game,
6378000	6380000	okay, look at this. You don't remember
6380000	6382000	this from the NES version of Metroid
6382000	6384000	because this was
6384000	6386000	on the Disk System so it had a file menu very
6386000	6388000	similar to what you had
6388000	6390000	with The Legend of Zelda because
6390000	6392000	Metroid came out first in the US
6392000	6394000	and that was their password
6394000	6396000	pack. That's why there were the silver
6396000	6398000	boxes. This and Kid Icarus
6398000	6400000	were the password pack series. So they
6400000	6402000	used passwords at first to sort
6402000	6404000	of emulate a little bit what they
6404000	6406000	were doing with the
6406000	6408000	sorry, I hit the mic. With the Disk
6408000	6410000	Systems before. So if I actually start the game
6410000	6412000	here and it actually, you know, it'll load here a little bit
6412000	6414000	and then
6414000	6416000	you'll hear it. Loading, loading, loading.
6416000	6418000	Now loading.
6418000	6420000	Lots of loading for these games.
6420000	6422000	That's, again, the downside to the Japanese
6422000	6424000	ones is that you have to actually emulate
6424000	6426000	that disk loading. Here we go.
6426000	6428000	I think it'll start here after this.
6434000	6436000	You kind of notice like, kind of like
6436000	6438000	an extra horn noise in there a little bit.
6438000	6440000	Probably. Oh, and I actually
6440000	6442000	I picked a pile that I actually already played so I can't
6442000	6444000	even go pick up the item now because I've already played this
6444000	6446000	character a little bit. Whoops. That's alright.
6446000	6448000	You can still hear like, some
6448000	6450000	of those subtle differences a little bit.
6450000	6452000	And when I get hit, like that little owl noise
6452000	6454000	is slightly, slightly different.
6454000	6456000	Newer releases.
6456000	6458000	I mentioned Kid Icarus as well
6458000	6460000	and I think we'll go there.
6462000	6464000	So again,
6464000	6466000	a screen with multiple files
6466000	6468000	just like you'd have in the other
6468000	6470000	disk games so
6470000	6472000	it wants a name but I don't really have
6472000	6474000	one so we'll just give it a fake name there.
6474000	6476000	And
6476000	6478000	start the game.
6478000	6480000	And
6480000	6482000	all those loading screens.
6482000	6484000	There we go.
6486000	6488000	And I think
6488000	6490000	for the most part the audio
6490000	6492000	is very similar in this game.
6494000	6496000	But I think when you get
6496000	6498000	hit
6498000	6500000	I want to say I noticed
6500000	6502000	a big difference when he, like
6502000	6504000	if you die or whatever. Maybe to do that
6504000	6506000	I might have to just do a falling death here.
6506000	6508000	Oh, maybe it was the Grim Reaper guy.
6508000	6510000	Let me see if I can just run up to him real fast
6510000	6512000	this first level.
6512000	6514000	Let's be real, it's not hard to die in Kid Icarus.
6514000	6516000	This game is very hard.
6516000	6518000	Some of those games you have to really kind of remember
6518000	6520000	your way through.
6520000	6522000	Okay, let's see.
6524000	6526000	So there's the harp that turns everybody
6526000	6528000	into hammers.
6532000	6534000	Kind of makes a little bit of a different noise instead of just
6534000	6536000	like a tick tock.
6536000	6538000	Ooh, I really went the wrong way on that.
6538000	6540000	I'm really not supposed to go to the right, that's okay.
6542000	6544000	Alright, there's one of the death guys.
6544000	6546000	Oh no!
6548000	6550000	Did you hear that little extra
6550000	6552000	backing track there? Wow, I wasn't
6552000	6554000	trying to die there, but you know, fail.
6554000	6556000	I did it anyway. Alright.
6556000	6558000	Anyway, I think that's enough
6558000	6560000	of a tour. A little quick break tonight.
6560000	6562000	But you know, I just thought for those of you that have
6562000	6564000	played Nintendo Switch and maybe haven't played around with it,
6564000	6566000	it's kind of just fun to look at some of the differences
6566000	6568000	between the Japanese releases and the American
6568000	6570000	releases. And again, you know, even though
6570000	6572000	you might be like, well, whatever with the extra sound,
6572000	6574000	you do have some of those extra games.
6574000	6576000	And now it's going the other way
6576000	6578000	too with this last month that we had
6578000	6580000	we had the Star
6580000	6582000	Tropics release in the U.S. that they didn't get
6582000	6584000	in Japan. So you know what? If you happen
6584000	6586000	to be one of those few Japanese listeners
6586000	6588000	that's participating with Orange Lounge Radio tonight,
6588000	6590000	maybe there's something to go in the other way
6590000	6592000	as well if you want to check out Star Tropics for the first time.
6592000	6594000	So there's that. Anyway,
6594000	6596000	just a little bit of a tour there of the differences
6596000	6598000	and I'll be curious if any of you guys
6598000	6600000	check it out this week. Be sure to send me a tweet
6600000	6602000	at MrRobRoberts if you decide
6602000	6604000	oh, this segment kind of
6604000	6606000	inspired you to go into the Famicom
6606000	6608000	library and check some of the things out there.
6608000	6610000	But for now, we will head back to the studio.
6620000	6622000	Enjoying that. YYR is like noticing
6622000	6624000	a lot of the differences that I'm pointing out there
6624000	6626000	and talking about maybe making a
6626000	6628000	switch online just
6628000	6630000	to check that out. And Brakeman
6630000	6632000	made some funny comments in our chat at
6632000	6634000	Twitch.tv slash OLR going, the music
6634000	6636000	I grew up with and loved was
6636000	6638000	watered down. My whole reality has been
6638000	6640000	shattered. Gee, thanks, OLR.
6640000	6642000	It's all perspective. I mean,
6642000	6644000	sure, maybe it was missing some of
6644000	6646000	the tracks there because it had
6646000	6648000	like one less chip or something.
6648000	6650000	But perspective a little bit,
6650000	6652000	those loading times in Metroid
6652000	6654000	were pretty bad and that didn't exist
6654000	6656000	when it was in a cartridge form.
6656000	6658000	There are some pros and cons and
6658000	6660000	like I said, I'd be curious if somebody like
6660000	6662000	AkumaJP or maybe one of our other listeners in
6662000	6664000	Japan would be curious about
6664000	6666000	exploring it the other way to see
6666000	6668000	what we always complain about and maybe
6668000	6670000	hear what the watered down audio sounds like or
6670000	6672000	check out StarTropics or some of those things
6672000	6674000	I was addressing there in the video.
6674000	6676000	Yeah.
6676000	6678000	Let's see.
6678000	6680000	Other comments in chat here. MetalMayham
6680000	6682000	says, admittedly, I never had Kid Icarus on the nest.
6682000	6684000	It's a hard game, but it's definitely
6684000	6686000	worth playing. It's a fun game.
6686000	6688000	So, Brakeman said that was a really fun segment.
6688000	6690000	OrangeRite says, Joy Mech Fight
6690000	6692000	is worth the time to make the Japanese
6692000	6694000	account alone. Yeah, why not? I mean,
6694000	6696000	part of the reason I want to highlight that is
6696000	6698000	I know I always talk about it, but like, those of you that
6698000	6700000	are already subscribing to Switch Online, which is
6700000	6702000	a ton of people at this point with the Twitch Prime
6702000	6704000	add-on now, you know, you
6704000	6706000	can go peek at some of those differences. Again,
6706000	6708000	it kind of takes a special type of gaming
6708000	6710000	nerd to appreciate a lot of those differences. I think
6710000	6712000	for the most part, they're all going to be very subtle and you'll just
6712000	6714000	be like, oh, there's really the same game.
6714000	6716000	But there's at least those couple extra games, like Joy Mech
6716000	6718000	Fight and so on. So, anyway,
6718000	6720000	all that being said, I think we
6720000	6722000	will get back into some
6722000	6724000	news and our show and the rest of what we got
6724000	6726000	to talk about tonight. So, let's do some rapid
6726000	6728000	fire news. Loki, I believe, starting
6728000	6730000	us off. There's some ridiculous stuff that you'll
6730000	6732000	find out there on the internet, including
6732000	6734000	screenshots, or I should say a
6734000	6736000	photographs of Gabe Newell
6736000	6738000	in China,
6738000	6740000	pimping out
6740000	6742000	some underwear. Well, apparently
6742000	6744000	some Chinese company that sells underwear
6744000	6746000	has used his likeness
6746000	6748000	on the cover of these
6748000	6750000	packages, and it's funny because
6750000	6752000	You know, when I think of underwear model,
6752000	6754000	I don't always think of Gabe Newell,
6754000	6756000	but I appreciate that we're being
6756000	6758000	body positive and featuring all sorts of
6758000	6760000	different, except the picture is him fully
6760000	6762000	clothed, to be clear.
6762000	6764000	The picture is Gabe Newell
6764000	6766000	fully clothed. He's wearing a bra on his head,
6766000	6768000	like Travis, being Queen
6768000	6770000	Amidala.
6770000	6772000	No, no, none of that. Are they selling
6772000	6774000	boxers or briefs? That's the important question.
6774000	6776000	Apparently, they appear to be
6776000	6778000	boxer briefs. Broccoli?
6778000	6780000	No, boxer briefs.
6780000	6782000	Although, the way
6782000	6784000	they actually have it listed, it's
6784000	6786000	large brief.
6786000	6788000	It's 5XL.
6788000	6790000	Oh, okay.
6790000	6792000	That's just probably the box the person picked up.
6792000	6794000	So, alright.
6794000	6796000	Interesting. Congrats, Gabe Newell,
6796000	6798000	CEO, underwear model.
6798000	6800000	But are they three-packs
6800000	6802000	is what I have to see. It's only a two-pack.
6802000	6804000	Oh, okay. Can't get to the
6804000	6806000	three-pack. No.
6806000	6808000	Apparently, so, yeah.
6810000	6812000	At least they respect that part of the
6812000	6814000	Newell. I'm so glad we talk
6814000	6816000	about such important elements of GameCo.
6816000	6818000	I'm so glad for all the stories we bumped tonight so we
6818000	6820000	could cover that one. Hey, you know what?
6820000	6822000	Can you not get enough of Hideo
6822000	6824000	Kojima? Well, guess what?
6824000	6826000	Soon, you'll be able to get him in other
6826000	6828000	mediums as well, including
6828000	6830000	a brand new show that's gonna be
6830000	6832000	on Prime Video. So,
6832000	6834000	Hideo Kojima has apparently
6834000	6836000	a cameo in
6836000	6838000	this new crime series. It's coming out
6838000	6840000	Too Old to Die Young.
6840000	6842000	And he's actually featured in the
6842000	6844000	trailer very
6844000	6846000	extremely briefly.
6846000	6848000	But you can check it out.
6848000	6850000	And it looks
6850000	6852000	interesting. I don't know what the series is about
6852000	6854000	but it's
6854000	6856000	the music
6856000	6858000	they have the retro
6858000	6860000	was it like the
6860000	6862000	retro waves music in the actual
6862000	6864000	series? Plus it just kind of
6864000	6866000	I don't know, very dark and stylistic
6866000	6868000	so it looks neat. And that
6868000	6870000	seems like something that he would get himself
6870000	6872000	involved in. So
6872000	6874000	check it out since I have Prime
6874000	6876000	Video and I don't use it for anything.
6876000	6878000	Alright. Get on it.
6878000	6880000	Alright. Moving on
6880000	6882000	April Fools was this past week
6882000	6884000	which, you know, I'm kind of over
6884000	6886000	all the dumb things people do on that day.
6886000	6888000	But once in a while, like video games
6888000	6890000	will put out like a little extra thing for
6890000	6892000	April Fools Day that ends up being like a permanent thing.
6892000	6894000	For example, I talked earlier in the show, Beat Saber
6894000	6896000	had that crab song and that's like there
6896000	6898000	now. Yeah, a full time thing. Well,
6898000	6900000	also, here's another one. So if you're a Rage 2
6900000	6902000	player, then they
6902000	6904000	unleashed a new announcer pack
6904000	6906000	featuring Tim Kitsrow
6906000	6908000	who is the announcer from NBA
6908000	6910000	Jam and NFL Blitz.
6910000	6912000	So if you want the guy from downtown
6912000	6914000	if you want that in
6914000	6916000	Rage 2, yes, that is
6916000	6918000	really something that is available.
6918000	6920000	If you pre-order Rage 2, you
6920000	6922000	get the He's On Fire cheat code
6922000	6924000	DLC pack.
6924000	6926000	And that will have the commentary for
6926000	6928000	the actions that you perform in the game.
6928000	6930000	It looked hilarious. Yeah, it looked hilarious
6930000	6932000	in the trailer. And that's a real thing.
6932000	6934000	So I like it when the April Fools jokes are
6934000	6936000	like legit, like actual things
6936000	6938000	that are just, they're just stupid and you turn them on
6938000	6940000	in office as you need to.
6940000	6942000	Now y'all know I love me some Civilization 6
6942000	6944000	right? In the Civilization series.
6944000	6946000	I think this is really cool is that
6946000	6948000	now if you link your 2K
6948000	6950000	account, you can actually
6950000	6952000	play Civilization 6 with cross
6952000	6954000	save support. So you can
6954000	6956000	start a game on the PC,
6956000	6958000	save it, and pick it up on the Switch.
6958000	6960000	Cool. Pretty cool. Yeah.
6960000	6962000	Cross save as opposed
6962000	6964000	to just like a cross play type of thing.
6964000	6966000	So that's pretty neat. So anyway, that was a recent update
6966000	6968000	that just came out. No April Fools joke there.
6968000	6970000	Where you can save a game
6970000	6972000	on the PC and you can pick it up on the
6972000	6974000	Switch. Again, you have to have a 2K
6974000	6976000	account to basically
6976000	6978000	facilitate the cross save. So
6978000	6980000	yeah, yet another game company account
6980000	6982000	you get to make. Woohoo. But that's kind of
6982000	6984000	a neat thing there. So do remember that
6984000	6986000	the original, or excuse me, the Switch
6986000	6988000	version of Civ 6 is the original
6988000	6990000	with no expansions.
6990000	6992000	So keep that in mind for your Civ 6
6992000	6994000	game. That's an important thing is that if you have
6994000	6996000	a Civ 6 game with all the expansions
6996000	6998000	oops, you can't actually transfer that file.
6998000	7000000	So do keep that in mind
7000000	7002000	with this. But I think that's pretty cool.
7002000	7004000	It's kind of one of those things that like now they announced
7004000	7006000	and I'm like, oh, that really should have been there
7006000	7008000	the whole time. How about that?
7008000	7010000	Anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7010000	7012000	Well coming out is going to be
7012000	7014000	Konami's Arcade Archives
7014000	7016000	series.
7016000	7018000	And the game that's going to be added to that is
7018000	7020000	Time Pilot. That's going to be coming
7020000	7022000	out on April 11th, 2019.
7022000	7024000	Basically you go through time rescuing other
7024000	7026000	pilots. Apparently in 2001 we were supposed to have UFOs.
7026000	7028000	I love Time Pilot.
7028000	7030000	But it is actually saying it's going
7030000	7032000	to be the first of their classic
7032000	7034000	arcade titles to join that. So that's pretty cool.
7034000	7036000	It'll be on PS4
7036000	7038000	and Switch in Japan on April 11th.
7038000	7040000	It will be 823 yen.
7040000	7042000	A game that was
7042000	7044000	prominently featured on
7044000	7046000	Nick Arcade.
7046000	7048000	I was going to say StarCade.
7048000	7050000	StarCade had this game all the time.
7050000	7052000	Anyway, also the game
7052000	7054000	Power Rangers Battle for the Grid
7054000	7056000	is going to have some free DLC characters
7056000	7058000	and more content.
7058000	7060000	Enway has revealed
7060000	7062000	three characters coming out.
7062000	7064000	That's going to be Dragon Armor Trini
7064000	7066000	rest in peace.
7066000	7068000	Udonna and
7068000	7070000	Cenozoic Blue Ranger
7070000	7072000	are going to be out with no other
7072000	7074000	cost and that they are
7074000	7076000	hard at work on packing more content
7076000	7078000	into the game.
7078000	7080000	They are giving the
7080000	7082000	fans what they want. All six of them.
7082000	7084000	There's more fans than that.
7084000	7086000	Alright.
7086000	7088000	Well go go Power Rangers.
7088000	7090000	I heard what you did there.
7090000	7092000	I know. It was intentional. Let's travel around
7092000	7094000	the world and check out some games that are coming out
7094000	7096000	real soon starting in the US.
7096000	7098000	We have a few things this week.
7098000	7100000	Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy
7100000	7102000	on PC, the Nintendo Switch,
7102000	7104000	PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7104000	7106000	We have Shovel Knight
7106000	7108000	Showdown on PC,
7108000	7110000	Mac, and Linux.
7110000	7112000	Wii U, Nintendo Switch,
7112000	7114000	PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7114000	7116000	Zanki Zero
7116000	7118000	Last Beginning on PC
7118000	7120000	and PlayStation 4.
7120000	7122000	Earth Defense Force Iron Rain on
7122000	7124000	PlayStation 4.
7124000	7126000	Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 4
7126000	7128000	VR Kit is coming out this week
7128000	7130000	on the Switch. And last but not least
7130000	7132000	Konami Arcade Classics
7132000	7134000	PC, Switch, PlayStation 4,
7134000	7136000	and Xbox One.
7136000	7138000	Which if I'm not mistaken has Time Pilot
7138000	7140000	in it as well. So it's a little weird
7140000	7142000	that Arcade Archives is doing one for 8 bucks
7142000	7144000	when it's part of a collection that's going to be
7144000	7146000	20 bucks. So this is a little weird
7146000	7148000	but okay.
7148000	7150000	You gotta choose how you want to consume your
7150000	7152000	Time Pilot I suppose.
7152000	7154000	So I'm traveling over to Japan. It's a little bit lighter in Japan
7154000	7156000	this week. I don't know if that's because gold weeks
7156000	7158000	at the end of the month or some of those budget things
7158000	7160000	that Loki talked about in the last episode. Who knows
7160000	7162000	maybe all of that coming into play. But the only release
7162000	7164000	really on the PlayStation 4 this week is
7164000	7166000	V-Rally 4 that is out on April
7166000	7168000	11th. Over on the Nintendo
7168000	7170000	Switch, oh a little bit a bigger deal
7170000	7172000	on the Switch. Not only is V-Rally 4 also
7172000	7174000	out on the Switch, but the Final Fantasy
7174000	7176000	X and X-2 HD Remaster
7176000	7178000	hits the Switch on April 11th.
7178000	7180000	So that's kind of a big deal. So that is happening
7180000	7182000	this week as well. But that's
7182000	7184000	really it as far as like big notable releases go.
7184000	7186000	Dark Sakura, what about the UK? Two things
7186000	7188000	on the 8th.
7188000	7190000	Dangerous Driving and
7190000	7192000	Zanki Zero Last
7192000	7194000	Beginning. That's
7194000	7196000	it.
7196000	7198000	Alright I think Dangerous Driving was
7198000	7200000	supposed to be coming out here too but I must have missed
7200000	7202000	out on the list. But it is. Okay.
7202000	7204000	It's Burnout Paradise or it's basically
7204000	7206000	Burnout. Yes but the
7206000	7208000	team kind of doing a new game right? Yeah.
7208000	7210000	It's basically Burnout.
7210000	7212000	It's like yeah. Burnout Take Down
7212000	7214000	basically but not. That team is
7214000	7216000	in the UK so maybe it is coming out there first.
7216000	7218000	Right. Yeah so maybe they do get it first
7218000	7220000	for a change. Who knows.
7220000	7222000	Anyway. The
7222000	7224000	Final Fantasy X stuff won't be out until next week.
7224000	7226000	Yeah it's Japan's getting it
7226000	7228000	first. That sometimes happens. Of course.
7228000	7230000	Alright. Well I mean honestly.
7230000	7232000	I mean what can they do for us?
7232000	7234000	If you really
7234000	7236000	wanted to play those remasters right now
7236000	7238000	it's out on Playstation 4 and PC.
7238000	7240000	It's just the Switch versions you have to wait on.
7240000	7242000	Anyway. Alright.
7242000	7244000	Let's go to the mail bag
7244000	7246000	because every week you guys send us
7246000	7248000	emails at participate at
7248000	7250000	orangelandradio.com
7250000	7252000	and why are you laughing?
7252000	7254000	Because there's nothing in there. There's no email.
7254000	7256000	Nobody sent us any emails to participate.
7256000	7258000	Someone trying to scam us did.
7258000	7260000	Those don't count. Spam emails don't count. I deleted it
7260000	7262000	and bypassed the trash. So participate
7262000	7264000	at orangelandradio.com if you
7264000	7266000	want to send us an email in a future week but
7266000	7268000	since y'all didn't send us emails you know what that means.
7268000	7270000	Fuck off. No.
7270000	7272000	It means I get to have an excuse to
7272000	7274000	talk to Dark Soccer about Drag Race.
7274000	7276000	Season 11. So.
7276000	7278000	I need to watch the last episode but it's already been spoiled
7278000	7280000	for me in the most delightful of manners. Well you don't have to
7280000	7282000	spoil it here but who are you rooting for on
7282000	7284000	Drag Race Season 11? I'm rooting for that
7284000	7286000	little romance budding between Miss
7286000	7288000	Vanjie and Brooklyn
7288000	7290000	Heights. Even straight
7290000	7292000	people know Miss Vanjie. Even
7292000	7294000	straight people do.
7294000	7296000	That was the most meme-able thing that's ever come out of
7296000	7298000	the show. I'm actually
7298000	7300000	Evie Oddly is my top favorite.
7300000	7302000	My second favorite would be
7302000	7304000	Brooklyn Heights.
7304000	7306000	And my third favorite is actually
7306000	7308000	kind of a tie between Miss Vanjie just
7308000	7310000	because I love her. I mean I love
7310000	7312000	her terrible. Get these cookies!
7312000	7314000	Yeah. And I love her talking.
7314000	7316000	And Nina West.
7316000	7318000	Yeah I love Nina West. I like
7318000	7320000	the campy queens. Yeah I love the campy queens.
7320000	7322000	My favorite is Evie Oddly for sure.
7322000	7324000	I think she's going to go all the way to the end.
7324000	7326000	Nina West I really like too.
7326000	7328000	She's going to be here locally in a couple weeks. I kind of want to go
7328000	7330000	see that show. I think it'll be a lot of fun.
7330000	7332000	Yeah I'm like you. I love a campy queen.
7332000	7334000	But as far as like a glamour queen goes I think
7334000	7336000	Acuria Chanel Davenport
7336000	7338000	has been bringing a lot of great stuff to the runway. I do
7338000	7340000	but I really like Plastique Tiara
7340000	7342000	and I would like to have another Asian queen
7342000	7344000	somewhere in the top. Yeah.
7344000	7346000	I mean that isn't you know the
7346000	7348000	an
7348000	7350000	imitatable uh
7350000	7352000	Raja. And not this bitch on
7352000	7354000	this season. Oh yeah.
7354000	7356000	Her. Her. Her and Silky
7356000	7358000	can go fuck right off. The other one I wanted to
7358000	7360000	fuck off is gone. What did you say is in town tonight?
7360000	7362000	Somebody's downtown tonight from the show.
7362000	7364000	He said. I lost it because it was
7364000	7366000	on my Facebook. Oh
7366000	7368000	it was I remember it was Trinity. It's not even from the
7368000	7370000	season. Yeah Trinity the Tuck. Your current
7370000	7372000	one of your current fucking half
7372000	7374000	reigning. One of our local queens
7374000	7376000	is um performing with her. Oh fun!
7376000	7378000	That's good. Support your local queens.
7378000	7380000	I want to tell everyone right now I'm going to
7380000	7382000	give one more shout out and this is to
7382000	7384000	a Facebook page
7384000	7386000	that everyone must follow.
7386000	7388000	It's called Possum Core.
7388000	7390000	Okay. And it's nothing but adorable
7390000	7392000	little freaking possums.
7392000	7394000	Alright well moving away from the mail
7394000	7396000	bag saying. Possums! I
7396000	7398000	did neglect to ask you because you're talking about
7398000	7400000	plugs. Did you have a podcast you want to plug this week?
7400000	7402000	Um. I guess we can do that here too.
7402000	7404000	Game Buoy.
7404000	7406000	Heck yeah. Game Buoy.
7406000	7408000	Our pals at Game Buoy. I'm trying
7408000	7410000	to do like non-vogue ones but
7410000	7412000	no one gave me a submission this week. The girl
7412000	7414000	can't help it. And they just came back. They just came back
7414000	7416000	from a hiatus. Welcome back. Welcome
7416000	7418000	Buoyak. Yeah. Game
7418000	7420000	Buoyak. Keep us afloat.
7420000	7422000	Aye aye.
7422000	7424000	We don't want to you know
7424000	7426000	Other nautical terms. Yes.
7426000	7428000	Will you be our star to guide us in the
7428000	7430000	gaming news
7430000	7432000	realm with opinions. Possums!
7432000	7434000	Yes. We don't want to sink
7434000	7436000	by not knowing
7436000	7438000	all the gaming news that's not on our
7438000	7440000	radar. Dude I am posting this freaking adorable possum in chat.
7440000	7442000	Alright. Anyway. Let's move
7442000	7444000	on. Alright. Back to gaming news. And
7444000	7446000	Loki what do you want to talk about in gaming news tonight?
7446000	7448000	So I just mentioned during
7448000	7450000	our release dates that the VR
7450000	7452000	Joy-Con set is coming
7452000	7454000	out for Labo.
7454000	7456000	And to go along with that they
7456000	7458000	released a video this week announcing that
7458000	7460000	hey not only are you going to be able to use the stuff
7460000	7462000	that's in those sets with
7462000	7464000	this but you'll be able to use the VR
7464000	7466000	goggles that you create with it
7466000	7468000	with other games. So
7468000	7470000	on April
7470000	7472000	25th they're going to
7472000	7474000	add support to
7474000	7476000	Super Mario Odyssey and
7476000	7478000	Zelda Breath of the Wild.
7478000	7480000	So the way this is going to work in Mario
7480000	7482000	Odyssey you're going to have a few different
7482000	7484000	levels or mini challenges
7484000	7486000	they call them. Where
7486000	7488000	basically it's all in 3D but you're kind of
7488000	7490000	watching from like a
7490000	7492000	kind of a fixed camera type thing.
7492000	7494000	So you're going to do that.
7494000	7496000	So they're just videos basically?
7496000	7498000	No you actually play it. Oh you're playing it
7498000	7500000	but it's a fixed camera. Yeah so it's like a fixed
7500000	7502000	camera type thing. Gotcha. But then
7502000	7504000	in Breath of the Wild though it's actually
7504000	7506000	going to be full on like
7506000	7508000	a VR first
7508000	7510000	person view I guess. Or
7510000	7512000	VR support
7512000	7514000	throughout the entire game except for the pre-rendered
7514000	7516000	cutscenes which won't be in VR.
7516000	7518000	But apparently you'll
7518000	7520000	be able to turn that option
7520000	7522000	or turn that on in the options menu
7522000	7524000	to get full VR support
7524000	7526000	for the game. I can't imagine playing through
7526000	7528000	that entire game in VR though especially because there's no
7528000	7530000	there's no way to strap it to your head. You have to hold
7530000	7532000	it. There is not a way to
7532000	7534000	strap it to your head. You have to basically hold
7534000	7536000	it up because it's
7536000	7538000	basically just the
7538000	7540000	the actual switch
7540000	7542000	just inside some cardboard and you have to hold it up
7542000	7544000	because it's weighted. So you
7544000	7546000	can't really strap it to your head because it'd be pretty damn
7546000	7548000	uncomfortable.
7548000	7550000	It's not exactly well thought
7550000	7552000	out for like playing a long game
7552000	7554000	like that but I can see the Mario
7554000	7556000	thing is a neat idea. It's a cute novelty.
7556000	7558000	It is a cute novelty
7558000	7560000	but yeah it'd be nice if they had straps to actually
7560000	7562000	strap it to your head but
7562000	7564000	I can't see how that would be comfortable
7564000	7566000	in any way being that it is just a piece of cardboard.
7566000	7568000	You have to like not only hold it up but like
7568000	7570000	the joy cons are there too because and Bobby's
7570000	7572000	pointing out it tracks your head movement that way
7572000	7574000	you have to control it up here.
7574000	7576000	Yeah you're holding it like this.
7576000	7578000	It doesn't sound comfortable at all.
7578000	7580000	It's going to be very uncomfortable.
7580000	7582000	That's the type of thing where it's like I will give that three minutes
7582000	7584000	max and then I'll be over it.
7584000	7586000	I'll play the Mario Odyssey levels
7586000	7588000	Yeah the Mario Odyssey one looks good.
7588000	7590000	It'll be very short but
7590000	7592000	It's like I'll turn it on just to see
7592000	7594000	Hyrule in VR. Ooh that's neat.
7594000	7596000	Okay done.
7596000	7598000	That's about all I would be able to tolerate of that as well.
7598000	7600000	For sure.
7601000	7603000	Well I want the full report
7603000	7605000	next week on the VR thing.
7605000	7607000	Yeah well I'm putting together the robot
7607000	7609000	one now so I mean that'll be fun.
7609000	7611000	But yeah the VR one is
7611000	7613000	coming on Friday when it releases
7613000	7615000	because I ordered it through Amazon.
7615000	7617000	I want to know all the details on that so
7617000	7619000	alright. Well moving on let's talk about
7619000	7621000	you know for VR beginning
7621000	7623000	something else is ending
7623000	7625000	sort of. Starlink is
7625000	7627000	going away a little bit. Well obviously
7627000	7629000	they can't like shut down the game. If you've already
7629000	7631000	bought the game you obviously can still
7631000	7633000	play it however
7633000	7635000	Ubisoft has mentioned no more physical toys
7635000	7637000	will be made for the game so
7637000	7639000	the toys to life things. They were clearing that shit out at
7639000	7641000	Target a few weeks ago.
7641000	7643000	Yeah and honestly like
7643000	7645000	Nintendo kind of treated this like it was
7645000	7647000	a Star Fox game so I kind of forgot
7647000	7649000	it was a toys to life
7649000	7651000	game I just kind of thought it was a
7651000	7653000	oh somebody like made
7653000	7655000	put Star Fox in a not Star Fox
7655000	7657000	game and now it's sort of Star Fox. I can't believe it's not
7657000	7659000	Star Fox. It's just yeah I don't know
7659000	7661000	it's a neat idea but
7661000	7663000	eh. Now to be clear
7663000	7665000	the game is still being supported because
7665000	7667000	pilots, spaceships, weapons there's going to be a
7667000	7669000	spring update that's going to add more of that but it's
7669000	7671000	all digital which maybe
7671000	7673000	some people are going to enjoy is that it seems like all
7673000	7675000	these things they had planned for future toys
7675000	7677000	eh. Well that's you know
7677000	7679000	funny enough that you mentioned that because that's actually how
7679000	7681000	they treated the PC version of
7681000	7683000	Disney
7683000	7685000	Infinity was it was all digital
7685000	7687000	you had cards you could put codes in you get
7687000	7689000	like with the actual well originally I think it was the
7689000	7691000	mobile they had a mobile game too I think
7691000	7693000	so you put in codes that came with the actual
7693000	7695000	characters to unlock
7695000	7697000	the digital ones but of course you know
7697000	7699000	now there's ways to you know cheat
7699000	7701000	that but it was all
7701000	7703000	now I think if you buy the games it just comes
7703000	7705000	with all of the characters that they had released
7705000	7707000	with that so
7707000	7709000	I don't know that's the only bad thing about those toys
7709000	7711000	to life stuff is like
7711000	7713000	eh. It's
7713000	7715000	it has to be really something
7715000	7717000	you want to collect because those things are
7717000	7719000	pretty big like the Arwing thing I could see
7719000	7721000	that would be pretty cool for someone to put on a shelf
7721000	7723000	but like all the other things
7723000	7725000	I don't know that's a bit
7725000	7727000	much. Alright
7727000	7729000	now the company did make a statement
7729000	7731000	the developers of the game made a statement
7731000	7733000	you don't usually hear them be very frank about what's
7733000	7735000	going on but the statement says despite
7735000	7737000	the immense and continuous support from our players
7737000	7739000	the sales for Starlink Battle for Atlas
7739000	7741000	fell below expectations
7741000	7743000	consequently we recently made the decision
7743000	7745000	to not release any additional physical toys
7745000	7747000	for the spring update and in the future
7747000	7749000	not often you hear a company being very upfront
7749000	7751000	where it's like well didn't sell enough of them
7751000	7753000	so the end
7753000	7755000	so it's kind of a sad reality
7755000	7757000	I guess so that's what happens when you guys
7757000	7759000	try to jump into the toy toys
7759000	7761000	life stuff too late in the game I mean
7761000	7763000	come on it'll be so up to you
7763000	7765000	maybe it'll work a little better for him digitally
7765000	7767000	we'll see but I
7767000	7769000	still need to play the game myself just because I
7769000	7771000	was curious about the whole Star Fox
7771000	7773000	you know obviously I would play on the Switch so I could see all that
7773000	7775000	go check out the clearance stuff
7775000	7777000	because those games I think were
7777000	7779000	the toys themselves were like five bucks
7779000	7781000	so like a big thing and I was like
7781000	7783000	maybe I should get some of these and I'm like I'm never going to play this
7783000	7785000	why am I going to buy this stuff
7785000	7787000	alright moving on Dark Sakura what do you have for us
7787000	7789000	I got some stuff
7789000	7791000	so Jackbox Party Pack
7791000	7793000	6
7793000	7795000	is coming in Q4 2019
7795000	7797000	but at any rate
7797000	7799000	they did
7799000	7801000	something kind of different
7801000	7803000	they do
7803000	7805000	we know that it's going to be called
7805000	7807000	trivia murder party minigame
7807000	7809000	from 2016
7809000	7811000	it's going to be returning
7811000	7813000	and that it's going to give us five games
7813000	7815000	per collection and maybe four more
7815000	7817000	and one with a new concept
7819000	7821000	so
7821000	7823000	at any rate it also did like a
7823000	7825000	really weird kind of
7825000	7827000	trailer with people wearing sheets
7827000	7829000	in a forest labeled ghosts
7829000	7831000	like what is this
7831000	7833000	it's going to
7833000	7835000	at any rate be
7835000	7837000	PC, PS4, Xbox One
7837000	7839000	Switch and Apple TV and iPad
7839000	7841000	so
7841000	7843000	hopefully it'll be
7843000	7845000	pretty good
7845000	7847000	we'll see
7847000	7849000	I don't know do you think you're going to
7849000	7851000	begin to this one?
7851000	7853000	I haven't gotten any of the other Jackbox games
7853000	7855000	although didn't they give one away
7855000	7857000	I think Epic Store had one
7857000	7859000	for free didn't they?
7859000	7861000	I don't remember
7861000	7863000	I'm trying to look at this weird
7863000	7865000	I don't have enough friends to play those with
7865000	7867000	so that's the problem
7867000	7869000	oh you have at least three
7869000	7871000	not that they want to play with me anytime
7871000	7873000	oh no
7873000	7875000	I do have the Jackbox Party Pack
7875000	7877000	I grabbed that
7877000	7879000	it was one of the free Epic games
7879000	7881000	that they had on there
7881000	7883000	I did get that
7883000	7885000	by the way The Witness is free right now
7885000	7887000	so check that out
7887000	7889000	well at any rate
7889000	7891000	I don't know if the weird
7891000	7893000	trailer is enough
7893000	7895000	it's kind of like people are banking in
7895000	7897000	on this kind of
7897000	7899000	oddity related
7899000	7901000	I don't know Trivia Murder Party was awesome
7901000	7903000	so I'm down for a sequel
7903000	7905000	but I wonder what type of new theme they're going to be able to do
7905000	7907000	what was the t-shirt one that they had
7907000	7909000	I don't remember
7909000	7911000	I don't really play a whole bunch of it myself
7911000	7913000	I just remember the last time I played it
7913000	7915000	was over at a Halloween party
7915000	7917000	well
7917000	7919000	well at any rate
7919000	7921000	sometime later in the year
7921000	7923000	we're going to have it
7923000	7925000	so we will see it when we see it
7925000	7927000	sounds awesome
7927000	7929000	anything else?
7929000	7931000	so we're having a microphone issue
7931000	7933000	and I can't tell which mic it is
7933000	7935000	it's all of the mics
7935000	7937000	they're all bad
7937000	7939000	I'm terrible
7939000	7941000	Radio Shack Ghosts
7941000	7943000	well we didn't get these from Radio Shack did we?
7943000	7945000	well it's still Radio Shack Ghosts
7945000	7947000	you know Dan worked for Radio Shack
7947000	7949000	and did he confirm that it's full of ghosts?
7949000	7951000	no
7951000	7953000	I think the ghosts were like possessing
7953000	7955000	but they used to play like the
7955000	7957000	chill station from
7957000	7959000	on Sirius
7959000	7961000	so every time I go in
7961000	7963000	Loki's unplugged for a minute I want to see if the chat says it's Loki's mic
7963000	7965000	I'm trying to diagnose which mic is having the issues
7965000	7967000	I don't need a mic
7967000	7969000	I talk loud enough to be picked up by all of them
7969000	7971000	and it's please
7971000	7973000	says I think it's Loki's mic
7973000	7975000	interesting so they say they keep hearing static
7975000	7977000	on their end
7977000	7979000	it's live radio
7979000	7981000	these things happen
7981000	7983000	it is not the Mac Mini
7983000	7985000	so I'm curious
7985000	7987000	if they're saying it's gone away
7987000	7989000	has it gone away at this point?
7989000	7991000	because I just unplugged Loki so if it's Loki's mic
7991000	7993000	the noise should have gone away
7993000	7995000	it's gone away so it's Loki's mic
7995000	7997000	don't make me sing
7997000	7999000	I'm going to sub his mic out for another chord real quick
7999000	8001000	well Loki's got a story to do
8001000	8003000	well nobody has a hot mic but you
8003000	8005000	I do
8005000	8007000	so this is the Dark Sakura Hour
8007000	8009000	and I'm going to go ahead and do my story for reasons
8009000	8011000	well I don't have another story
8011000	8013000	so I'm going to think of a story
8013000	8015000	and yesterday
8015000	8017000	you know that Burrito Week
8017000	8019000	National Burrito Day was last week
8019000	8021000	and Dan and I went out and got burritos
8021000	8023000	at Freebirds
8023000	8025000	and I ended up being
8025000	8027000	it was super good but they had
8027000	8029000	that alternate
8029000	8031000	meat thing, Rob, I'm just going to read your story
8031000	8033000	because fuck it
8033000	8035000	okay
8035000	8037000	Rob's story is this
8037000	8039000	there is a working Mario maker
8039000	8041000	inside LittleBigPlanet 3
8043000	8045000	apparently
8045000	8047000	players in LittleBigPlanet 3
8047000	8049000	have
8049000	8051000	basically made their own version
8051000	8053000	it's so weird
8053000	8055000	because it looks actually completely right
8055000	8057000	so they can do
8057000	8059000	blocks, pipes, coins and elements
8059000	8061000	of Super Mario Brothers
8061000	8063000	it's not
8063000	8065000	and someone actually tried to recreate
8065000	8067000	the level
8067000	8069000	so they did the demo
8069000	8071000	of Super Mario Maker running in
8071000	8073000	LittleBigPlanet and it actually looks
8073000	8075000	pretty legit, I mean
8075000	8077000	some of the stuff is a little different
8077000	8079000	this is actually kind of
8079000	8081000	kind of cool
8081000	8083000	well it's amazing what they can do with LittleBigPlanet 3
8083000	8085000	and so I can only imagine what we're going to be able to do
8085000	8087000	when we actually get
8087000	8089000	he's actually talking quietly
8089000	8091000	so I'm impressed
8091000	8093000	different
8093000	8095000	different cable
8095000	8097000	same story
8097000	8099000	talking
8099000	8101000	talking in the yellow
8101000	8103000	so yeah it would be interesting to see
8103000	8105000	what actually is going to happen when Dreams comes out
8105000	8107000	because you can do a ton more stuff in Dreams
8107000	8109000	than you can in LittleBigPlanet 3
8109000	8111000	so I'm very curious to see what they
8111000	8113000	can do with that full on Mario Maker
8113000	8115000	in that one
8115000	8117000	but it looked neat, it's pretty impressive
8117000	8119000	I haven't played LittleBigPlanet 3
8119000	8121000	even though we got it free
8121000	8123000	even though you cosplayed Sackboy
8123000	8125000	that was a long time ago
8125000	8127000	in a galaxy far far away
8127000	8129000	namely Rob's Old House
8131000	8133000	ok so live fixing
8133000	8135000	on the air, apparently I
8135000	8137000	tech supported the issue, the chat is happy
8137000	8139000	don't know you'll piss off
8139000	8141000	the electronics union Rob
8141000	8143000	like Bobby says
8143000	8145000	alright anyway
8145000	8147000	let's try to move back and talk about
8147000	8149000	the Loki story that we missed tonight
8149000	8151000	so there's one more we were going to do there
8151000	8153000	so unfortunately
8153000	8155000	speedrun.com has
8155000	8157000	had to revert their rankings
8157000	8159000	back to their April 1st date
8159000	8161000	because apparently
8161000	8163000	they had a security breach
8163000	8165000	which left many of the
8165000	8167000	leaderboards at risk of tampering
8167000	8169000	and so because of that
8169000	8171000	they had to roll back their data
8171000	8173000	and so unfortunately some of
8173000	8175000	these records that people may have set
8175000	8177000	have been
8177000	8179000	removed, so they said
8179000	8181000	about 3 to 5
8181000	8183000	counts moderating
8183000	8185000	prominent boards
8185000	8187000	were compromised and this
8187000	8189000	cause is still
8189000	8191000	understood to be only a few
8191000	8193000	users using
8193000	8195000	or reusing passwords that were compromised from
8195000	8197000	other sites years ago
8197000	8199000	and so because of that
8199000	8201000	they had to unfortunately roll back their
8201000	8203000	database
8203000	8205000	so that sucks
8205000	8207000	that's why you need these unique
8207000	8209000	strong and unique
8209000	8211000	strong passwords, symbols
8211000	8213000	and record your shit
8213000	8215000	yes
8215000	8217000	alright
8217000	8219000	the video cassette recorder
8219000	8221000	like they had to do in the days
8221000	8223000	of Donkey Kong
8223000	8225000	alright well this is, sorry
8225000	8227000	it's been a little awkward trying to get to the end here
8227000	8229000	with all the sound issues but we're finally all worked out
8229000	8231000	I think this is going to come a point
8231000	8233000	when I have money
8233000	8235000	that I'm just going to
8235000	8237000	all new mics, all new cords
8237000	8239000	why not, we got a new mixing board
8239000	8241000	these mics were
8241000	8243000	graciously donated by Brad
8243000	8245000	from Pod Culture but that was a few years
8245000	8247000	ago at this point so I think our system
8247000	8249000	might have just kind of lived its life
8249000	8251000	so we might have to end up getting some new stuff
8251000	8253000	we'll see very soon
8253000	8255000	anyway
8255000	8257000	let's get to our listener
8257000	8259000	round table, so we're actually going to
8259000	8261000	open up our Discord server
8261000	8263000	if you want to join the green room over on
8263000	8265000	Discord at the VOG Network Discord
8265000	8267000	which is vognetwork.com slash Discord
8267000	8269000	we're going to be taking some calls here
8269000	8271000	or if you have a question on chat
8271000	8273000	or something you want to ask you can ask
8273000	8275000	away in chat, while I get that all set up
8275000	8277000	is there anything that you
8277000	8279000	want to add here for Last Minute Stories
8279000	8281000	Loki?
8281000	8283000	I don't
8283000	8285000	have anything
8285000	8287000	other than I have to say
8287000	8289000	one thing I didn't mention as part of my gaming week
8289000	8291000	the whole Labo thing
8291000	8293000	one of the things I like the best about
8293000	8295000	the Labo software right now
8295000	8297000	is the music in those
8297000	8299000	building menus, it's fantastic
8299000	8301000	it's some really
8301000	8303000	really
8303000	8305000	energetic
8305000	8307000	kind of jazzy tunes that they've got going on
8307000	8309000	there, so I really like the menu
8309000	8311000	that's like Wii U or Wii
8311000	8313000	Shop music type stuff
8313000	8315000	really, really good stuff
8315000	8317000	I dig that and also just like
8317000	8319000	some of the joking around
8319000	8321000	because a lot of the stuff you have to do the same shit over and over
8321000	8323000	now look, isn't that
8323000	8325000	relaxing to fold these creases
8325000	8327000	and stuff like that
8327000	8329000	it's kind of
8329000	8331000	I got a humor to it, like I really wanted my kids
8331000	8333000	I really wanted my kids to
8333000	8335000	put this shit together, but they didn't want to
8335000	8337000	do any of it, so I'm like
8337000	8339000	do it, do it, do it, is it done yet?
8339000	8341000	I'm like, I just opened the box
8341000	8343000	it's not done yet, you see the stack of
8343000	8345000	cardboard here, Jesus Christ
8345000	8347000	alright, I know
8347000	8349000	we got one person waiting in the green room
8349000	8351000	so let's get to it, hello, you are on
8351000	8353000	Orange Lawn Radio, who's this?
8353000	8355000	Yeah, this is Metal Mayhem
8355000	8357000	Hey Metal Mayhem, what's on your mind buddy?
8357000	8359000	No, hold on
8359000	8361000	just a very broad topic
8361000	8363000	for you guys tonight
8363000	8365000	seeing as that we're
8365000	8367000	all pretty much with the
8367000	8369000	same age range
8369000	8371000	within a couple of years and we've been gaming
8371000	8373000	for quite a long time
8373000	8375000	I have a
8375000	8377000	general question for
8377000	8379000	the three of you
8379000	8381000	is there
8381000	8383000	even though
8383000	8385000	gaming magazines haven't been around
8385000	8387000	for roughly about ten years
8387000	8389000	give or take, because
8389000	8391000	that kind of killed off
8391000	8393000	gaming mags for better
8393000	8395000	or for worse
8395000	8397000	have there been any
8397000	8399000	in the past
8399000	8401000	that you
8401000	8403000	bought on a
8403000	8405000	regular basis
8405000	8407000	either at the newsstand or through subscription
8407000	8409000	so gaming magazines
8409000	8411000	what like gaming magazines were you guys
8411000	8413000	all into, like and what did you actually
8413000	8415000	subscribe to or consume
8415000	8417000	DarkSakura, did you have any magazines
8417000	8419000	that you got on a regular basis?
8419000	8421000	Not really, I would just go steal them from the grocery store
8421000	8423000	You stole magazines?
8423000	8425000	Yeah, like GamePro and EGM
8425000	8427000	Oh my gosh, we have a criminal
8427000	8429000	in our midst
8429000	8431000	I admit to it, they can't prove it, just me saying so
8431000	8433000	doesn't mean I actually did it
8433000	8435000	You just said it to look cool, even though stealing
8435000	8437000	is wrong, don't do it
8437000	8439000	Don't steal from the magazine rack in your grocery
8439000	8441000	store
8441000	8443000	Honestly, I had a subscription
8443000	8445000	in Nintendo Power for a long
8445000	8447000	time, I think I finally let it go when I went off to
8447000	8449000	college, but I had the very first issue in Nintendo Power
8449000	8451000	I wish I hadn't thrown it away, I didn't realize
8451000	8453000	how valuable that thing would be
8453000	8455000	But I subscribed to Nintendo Power for a long
8455000	8457000	time, and that was certainly a go-to magazine
8457000	8459000	I like EGM, I picked that up a lot
8459000	8461000	Honestly, it was the type of thing
8461000	8463000	the grocery store used to have
8463000	8465000	a magazine section, which is where a lot
8465000	8467000	of gaming cards are now, and so like
8467000	8469000	every time we went to the grocery store, I would kind of be able
8469000	8471000	to be like, can I get GamePro?
8471000	8473000	So I would kind of like
8473000	8475000	catch up on a video game magazine
8475000	8477000	that way, and so I kind of rotated through
8477000	8479000	all of them. I remember once
8479000	8481000	GamePro had this thing where
8481000	8483000	like, you could be an
8483000	8485000	editor or something, it was like they were gonna
8485000	8487000	have a team of 75 winners
8487000	8489000	that were like editors, and I ended up getting
8489000	8491000	picked, like they sent me a thing that was like
8491000	8493000	I got picked, I won the thing because I
8493000	8495000	had to send a little thing in writing or whatever, and then
8495000	8497000	nothing ever came of it
8497000	8499000	I never got anything else but the whole
8499000	8501000	congratulations, you got picked to do nothing
8501000	8503000	Alright, I guess I get to sit there and look fabulous
8503000	8505000	So there was that
8505000	8507000	Because we have
8507000	8509000	no editors here
8509000	8511000	They do nothing
8511000	8513000	Yeah, I guess they went under after that
8513000	8515000	To do a throwback, even though it's not necessarily
8515000	8517000	100% video gaming
8517000	8519000	I also remember, I was a big Commodore 64
8519000	8521000	enthusiast back in the day
8521000	8523000	because that was the computer that was in my family
8523000	8525000	so I loved those Compute Gazette
8525000	8527000	magazines that you could type the programs
8527000	8529000	in the back and like make your own stuff
8529000	8531000	I loved that stuff, and so there was
8531000	8533000	a lot of classic computing magazines I really
8533000	8535000	got into as well, VG&CE
8535000	8537000	Video Games Computer Entertainment was another one
8537000	8539000	Loadstar
8539000	8541000	was that only a disc thing, or was that
8541000	8543000	actually, I think it was actually a magazine for a short time
8543000	8545000	Logie, what about you? What about you and magazines?
8545000	8547000	I did subscribe
8547000	8549000	to Nintendo Power
8549000	8551000	and GamePro
8551000	8553000	and then I used to pick
8553000	8555000	up a lot at the stores, especially when I had
8555000	8557000	like, I had
8557000	8559000	my own PC at that time
8559000	8561000	so like my first PC
8561000	8563000	I would pick up PC Gamer
8563000	8565000	because they had the discs with like
8565000	8567000	full games in them sometimes
8567000	8569000	and so I would pick those up just for the games
8569000	8571000	and I used
8571000	8573000	to like also some of the import magazines
8573000	8575000	for different
8575000	8577000	things, because usually they had like
8577000	8579000	I don't know
8579000	8581000	Oh, the official PlayStation magazine
8581000	8583000	OPM, I did subscribe
8583000	8585000	to that as well, also for the demo discs
8585000	8587000	because that was awesome
8587000	8589000	Actually, there was a magazine that Dan and I
8589000	8591000	were subscribing to for a while
8591000	8593000	We were subscribing to Retro Gamer
8593000	8595000	Oh, and the
8595000	8597000	Xbox game magazine, also for the demo discs
8597000	8599000	Notice
8599000	8601000	the trend here, demo discs
8601000	8603000	that will get me to subscribe to your magazine
8603000	8605000	Demo discs
8605000	8607000	are a good thing. Metal Mayhem, what about you
8607000	8609000	real quick?
8609000	8611000	Well, I
8611000	8613000	personally didn't subscribe to it
8613000	8615000	particularly my father did, but
8615000	8617000	my father
8617000	8619000	multi-year subscription to
8619000	8621000	Nintendo Power
8621000	8623000	and this is before
8623000	8625000	future publishing
8625000	8627000	or whatever the name of the company is to go over
8627000	8629000	and
8629000	8631000	to a certain extent that
8631000	8633000	magazine was alright, but eventually it kind of
8633000	8635000	dawned on me that, hey
8635000	8637000	Nintendo's running this magazine
8637000	8639000	naturally, they're in the business of
8639000	8641000	selling games, they're not going to say, hey
8641000	8643000	our games are crap, don't buy them
8643000	8645000	it's Nintendo Power
8645000	8647000	So, like, eventually
8647000	8649000	It's that moment when you're younger
8649000	8651000	that you realize everything you loved
8651000	8653000	was advertising
8653000	8655000	Yeah, so
8655000	8657000	eventually I started going to
8657000	8659000	the magazine
8659000	8661000	I also started getting all the magazines
8661000	8663000	I initially started getting
8663000	8665000	game foam, which I loved
8665000	8667000	and then like
8667000	8669000	Loki, I started getting
8669000	8671000	an official
8671000	8673000	PlayStation Magazine once I got
8673000	8675000	a PlayStation 1
8675000	8677000	I got that for the demo
8677000	8679000	mostly, but I ended up liking the magazine
8679000	8681000	itself
8681000	8683000	and eventually when I got a 360
8683000	8685000	I got an
8685000	8687000	OXM as well for the demo disc
8687000	8689000	and I ended up liking the magazine
8689000	8691000	as well
8691000	8693000	Yeah, I used to love those official PlayStation Magazine demo discs
8693000	8695000	I think if you still have, I think some of those demo discs
8695000	8697000	are kind of collectibles at this point
8697000	8699000	Well, there was some that was pretty awesome
8699000	8701000	like the official Xbox magazine, they actually had
8701000	8703000	DLC for free on there, I remember
8703000	8705000	for Oblivion they had
8705000	8707000	a few Oblivion DLC packs
8707000	8709000	that were free in there, I was like, sweet
8709000	8711000	Yeah, it was awesome
8711000	8713000	Anyway, Middle Mayhem is a great question
8713000	8715000	I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls
8715000	8717000	but great question, and happy reading
8717000	8719000	Alright, have a nice day
8719000	8721000	You too, take care
8721000	8723000	What's kind of cool is they had a demo in one of them
8723000	8725000	for Timeshift, the Atari
8725000	8727000	version of Timeshift because
8727000	8729000	they had changed publishers
8729000	8731000	at one time for that game, so they had
8731000	8733000	a demo that was of a game that never
8733000	8735000	came out, and they released later on
8735000	8737000	another demo for the actual version that came out
8737000	8739000	that was from another publisher altogether
8739000	8741000	Alright, well let me
8741000	8743000	go to another call here
8743000	8745000	Hi, you're on Orange Town Radio, who's this?
8745000	8747000	Hey, what's going on everybody?
8747000	8749000	Hey, Rama, how you doing?
8749000	8751000	Not too much, I'm a little stuffed from dinner
8751000	8753000	and getting ready for a brand new work week
8753000	8755000	You know, and I learned tonight, I thought
8755000	8757000	only Bobby and I had privileges to
8757000	8759000	drag and drop people into other channels, but apparently
8759000	8761000	you do too
8761000	8763000	And you see, the funny thing is, I didn't
8763000	8765000	even realize, because I
8765000	8767000	barely used Discord on my phone
8767000	8769000	and I'm like, okay, this is it, I didn't
8769000	8771000	realize, so like, wait, why is this locked
8771000	8773000	I was like, oh, oh
8773000	8775000	oh, and I was like, my bad,
8775000	8777000	Rob, my bad
8777000	8779000	So for those that don't know, because you can't see it
8779000	8781000	behind the scenes, you can't see the Discord activity
8781000	8783000	but during that last call with Metal Mayhem
8783000	8785000	like, Rama kept dropping into the channel
8785000	8787000	and I was like, okay, Rama, I get it
8787000	8789000	you want to be on the show, but like, you need to, like
8789000	8791000	I don't want background noise coming through, I'm like, you need to go wait
8791000	8793000	like everybody else, you know, and I keep
8793000	8795000	dragging and dropping him back in the channel
8795000	8797000	and then suddenly he disappeared
8797000	8799000	so I don't know if Rama, you dropped off, or Bobby
8799000	8801000	saw what was going on and was like, I'll show him
8801000	8803000	or what
8803000	8805000	No, I realized
8805000	8807000	after the fact that I looked in the room
8807000	8809000	I was like, restricted channel, wait, that's not
8809000	8811000	the green room, oh damn, whoops
8811000	8813000	Oh, oh, Bobby
8813000	8815000	said he revoked your access
8815000	8817000	what, what, what, it's like you
8817000	8819000	you were in the room and then the sirens started going off
8819000	8821000	woo woo woo
8821000	8823000	intruder alert, intruder alert
8823000	8825000	Well, I look at it
8825000	8827000	this way, if something happens
8827000	8829000	I have my papers, I'm good
8829000	8831000	I know, I know, alright
8831000	8833000	all that joking aside, uh, what's
8833000	8835000	on your mind tonight, buddy?
8835000	8837000	Alright, I wanna talk about something in regards to
8837000	8839000	a comment you made last week
8839000	8841000	that I agree with you about
8841000	8843000	Okay, good, you agree with me
8843000	8845000	sure, what is that?
8845000	8847000	The 3D Zeldas
8847000	8849000	Oh, oh, when I
8849000	8851000	gave my hot take, the Ocarina of Time
8851000	8853000	and stuff, like, you guys, you guys
8853000	8855000	hyped those games up a lot
8855000	8857000	I will say
8857000	8859000	this, I got a Nintendo 64
8859000	8861000	just for Ocarina
8861000	8863000	of Time, I saved up my money
8863000	8865000	I got the console, I got the
8865000	8867000	game, a few hours into this
8867000	8869000	game, I'm like, what the hell is this?
8869000	8871000	I felt like I got ripped
8871000	8873000	off, woo, okay?
8873000	8875000	I don't know if I would go
8875000	8877000	that strong with it, but I, I
8877000	8879000	personally, I think Breath of the Wild is the best
8879000	8881000	3D Zelda they've ever made
8881000	8883000	and I don't know if that's just because
8883000	8885000	you know, maybe now I'm kinda more used to 3D
8885000	8887000	games, I've just accepted it as that's where we're
8887000	8889000	at, whereas, you know, when the Nintendo 64
8889000	8891000	was brand new, I was still, you know
8891000	8893000	I was kinda like, all these, these polygons are
8893000	8895000	so bulky, they're just like shapes
8895000	8897000	floating out there, and you know, all that type of stuff
8897000	8899000	I mean
8899000	8901000	I do enjoy my fair share of 3D
8901000	8903000	games, I just
8903000	8905000	I just couldn't get into it, I'm like
8905000	8907000	I prefer my top
8907000	8909000	slash 2D Zelda games, now I
8909000	8911000	did play Breath of the Wild, and I did
8911000	8913000	like that, and
8913000	8915000	that game did one thing the other 3D
8915000	8917000	games did not do, it
8917000	8919000	actually mapped the button so Link could
8919000	8921000	jump
8921000	8923000	Oh man, yeah
8923000	8925000	I, I wish, uh
8925000	8927000	yeah, that, that's uh
8927000	8929000	Link being able to jump is important
8929000	8931000	Yeah
8931000	8933000	I mean, this is a 3D game, he should be able to
8933000	8935000	like jump over, so I'm like, there
8935000	8937000	what do you mean, he can't
8937000	8939000	you know what, forget it
8939000	8941000	forget it, I'm like, nope
8941000	8943000	I, I, you know what, I even said
8943000	8945000	you know, I'm gonna give Ocarina
8945000	8947000	Time another shot, so I went out
8947000	8949000	and got it on 3DS
8949000	8951000	I played it through
8951000	8953000	two hours in, I gave it the Mako
8953000	8955000	shot, I'm like here, you can have this, I don't
8955000	8957000	want it, I will play my 2D
8957000	8959000	Zeldas till I can't play them anymore
8962000	8964000	What, what do you think about the whole
8964000	8966000	um, the announcement
8966000	8968000	or well, either the rumor I guess
8968000	8970000	that Legend of Zelda
8970000	8972000	Link to the Past might be getting like
8972000	8974000	a 3D style
8974000	8976000	remake in the vein of the Link's
8976000	8978000	Awakening remake, uh, what do you think
8978000	8980000	about that, like a 2D game kind of going to that
8980000	8982000	sub 3D type
8982000	8984000	of thing, what do you, what do you make of all that?
8984000	8986000	Um, I don't know
8986000	8988000	if you saw my reaction, but when
8988000	8990000	Nintendo announced uh, Link's Awakening
8990000	8992000	for the Switch, my,
8992000	8994000	I pretty much said, fuck
8994000	8996000	I have to get a Switch now, fuck, I have to get a
8996000	8998000	Switch now, it's like, there were
8998000	9000000	reasons why I needed, I was gonna get a Switch
9000000	9002000	Yeah, um, I, you know, and we were talking
9002000	9004000	earlier about how like the Secret of Mana remake
9004000	9006000	you know, was kind of like a little bit hit and miss
9006000	9008000	but I, I kind of expect a certain quality
9008000	9010000	out of Nintendo, and so I think this
9010000	9012000	um, Link to the, you know, this Link's Awakening
9012000	9014000	for sure, but maybe even Link to the Past
9014000	9016000	is gonna be pretty, pretty
9016000	9018000	cool, it's gonna be up to a certain level, so I'm excited
9018000	9020000	about it
9022000	9024000	Alright, for some reason
9024000	9026000	I've lost your audio, are you still there with us, Rama?
9026000	9028000	Um,
9028000	9030000	Okay, if you can hear us, we can't
9030000	9032000	hear you, I don't know if maybe
9032000	9034000	Bobby's messing around with some permissions
9034000	9036000	live on air or what, but for some reason
9036000	9038000	we lost you, Rama, but thank you so much for the call
9038000	9040000	uh, and we'll talk to you next time, or everybody
9040000	9042000	should be listening to Anime Jam Session Tuesday night
9042000	9044000	here on the Voice Geeks Network
9044000	9046000	Uh, meanwhile, I've got one more person
9046000	9048000	waiting, so let me bring this person in, hopefully this
9048000	9050000	person can talk, hi, you're on Orange Town's
9050000	9052000	Radio, who's this?
9052000	9054000	Hey, good, oh, we can't hear you
9054000	9056000	So that wasn't me
9056000	9058000	What's up, buddy?
9058000	9060000	Hi, how are you?
9060000	9062000	Yeah, it's been a while
9062000	9064000	Uh, yeah, obviously you've noticed
9064000	9066000	I haven't been on like
9066000	9068000	for god knows how long
9068000	9070000	Probably more than a year, year and a half
9070000	9072000	Everything's good, uh, just settling
9072000	9074000	in to my new digs
9074000	9076000	I've been here for over
9076000	9078000	a year now
9078000	9080000	I mean, if you see the, yeah
9080000	9082000	I'm finally out of the city, I'm
9082000	9084000	excited about it
9084000	9086000	I'm in Westchester now, so
9086000	9088000	all things, you know, settling
9088000	9090000	in with my fiance and all
9090000	9092000	So, um, yeah, I just
9092000	9094000	uh, went to PAX last weekend
9094000	9096000	How was that?
9096000	9098000	Uh, hit or miss
9098000	9100000	Mostly, Thursday was probably the least
9100000	9102000	crowded day, I was actually able
9102000	9104000	to go to the show floor most, you know
9104000	9106000	hit up most of the booths, or a good
9106000	9108000	chunk of the booths
9108000	9110000	But it was mostly me just flying
9110000	9112000	and like, you know, just
9112000	9114000	But it was mostly me just flying and like
9114000	9116000	in Thrustmaster's booth
9116000	9118000	because they had DCS World in VR
9118000	9120000	And, you know
9120000	9122000	I love flying games, and I
9122000	9124000	won a headset because I shot
9124000	9126000	down, I shot down two
9126000	9128000	Russian aircraft on an F-18
9128000	9130000	uh, simulator
9130000	9132000	with their fancy $500 joystick
9132000	9134000	Oooh
9134000	9136000	That's like, that reminds me of the time
9136000	9138000	uh, it was years ago, it was when
9138000	9140000	Final Fantasy XI was being
9140000	9142000	shown at E3
9142000	9144000	It wasn't new though, it was already out
9144000	9146000	Maybe it was the year they were showing on 360, I don't remember
9146000	9148000	It was the first or second year I was ever at E3
9148000	9150000	But anyway, long story short, um, I won
9150000	9152000	some like, I think it was like a Ballista competition
9152000	9154000	or something like the PVTP they were doing
9154000	9156000	I won some type of Final Fantasy XI thing, my team of eight
9156000	9158000	and then they spun a wheel to see
9158000	9160000	which person got to pick their prize first
9160000	9162000	and they thought for sure people would pick
9162000	9164000	the Nobuyamatsu CDs first
9164000	9166000	that were signed, but I was like, no
9166000	9168000	they were giving away a full on brand new motherboard
9168000	9170000	you remember that?
9170000	9172000	It was a motherboard processor thing
9172000	9174000	and I got that at E3
9174000	9176000	and that ended up being
9176000	9178000	the show computer later on
9178000	9180000	uh, at some point
9180000	9182000	so it was kind of funny the way that all worked out
9182000	9184000	so anyway
9184000	9186000	Yeah, so, I mean, there was a lot of like
9186000	9188000	VR, most of the past couple of years
9188000	9190000	PAX has been mostly VR now
9190000	9192000	like, I don't know if you noticed
9192000	9194000	but a lot of uh
9194000	9196000	just lots of demo boosts
9196000	9198000	especially Facebook
9198000	9200000	you know, and their Oculus
9200000	9202000	their Oculus booths
9202000	9204000	like, literally capped almost every day
9204000	9206000	after Thursday
9206000	9208000	I have to admit, I haven't been to PAX
9208000	9210000	in a little while because uh
9210000	9212000	you may have caught some of the shade I was throwing last week
9212000	9214000	but our feathers were ruffled a few years ago
9214000	9216000	and I wasn't super impressed with the show anyway
9216000	9218000	so I just haven't spent the money to go back in a while
9218000	9220000	um, I've been tempted to go to another one
9220000	9222000	but I would be curious to see
9222000	9224000	like, what it would
9224000	9226000	look like, and plus
9226000	9228000	honestly, like, a lot of my money
9228000	9230000	like, a lot of my convention money, I do DragonCon now
9230000	9232000	and I try to get to other, like, smaller conventions
9232000	9234000	so it's just, it's been hard to swing PAX
9234000	9236000	as well on top of all that, but never say never
9236000	9238000	Yeah
9238000	9240000	I mean, you're not missing much
9240000	9242000	all it is, is just like, it's a lot more
9242000	9244000	like, esports, uh
9244000	9246000	uh, you know, it's a lot more esports related
9246000	9248000	now, like, most of the boosts either
9248000	9250000	whether it's like, you know
9250000	9252000	Twitch or Discord, they have
9252000	9254000	boots over there, apparently
9254000	9256000	Facebook with, uh, Facebook Live
9256000	9258000	and Oculus, obviously, so it's a lot
9258000	9260000	more, it's a heavy emphasis on
9260000	9262000	esports now, and just streaming
9262000	9264000	So, so it's like
9264000	9266000	So go ahead
9266000	9268000	I mean, I haven't gotten to that game yet
9268000	9270000	of whole, of streaming, I know
9270000	9272000	friends of mine who are definitely in that, uh
9272000	9274000	in Twitch, with their own channels and all
9274000	9276000	but, you know
9276000	9278000	that's what I've seen, it's like, either that
9278000	9280000	or TableTop
9280000	9282000	Yes, I believe we're doing a Twitch show right now
9282000	9284000	Um
9284000	9286000	But anyway, uh
9286000	9288000	So I, I kinda drug you into the conversation
9288000	9290000	about PAX and everything, but is there, is there something
9290000	9292000	you actually wanted to talk about tonight?
9292000	9294000	Um, let me see
9294000	9296000	Uh, I don't
9296000	9298000	Uh, other than, uh
9298000	9300000	Try to remember
9300000	9302000	Like, I've been reading here and there, like
9302000	9304000	I guess most of it is
9304000	9306000	just like, people, you know
9306000	9308000	I remember, like
9308000	9310000	out of this whole, uh
9310000	9312000	Me Too movement and the fact that actually
9312000	9314000	an incident similar to that happened last weekend
9314000	9316000	in PAX East, where
9316000	9318000	believe it or not, uh
9318000	9320000	Magic the Gathering player got, like
9320000	9322000	one of the top players basically got dropped
9322000	9324000	out of the tournament
9324000	9326000	last minute because, uh, a lot of
9326000	9328000	uh, long story short, a lot of things
9328000	9330000	came out about his misogyny
9330000	9332000	and other nasty things
9332000	9334000	about women that he's, uh, the way he's treated
9334000	9336000	them, and so
9336000	9338000	Yeah, and that, they didn't want that
9338000	9340000	I, I haven't heard a lot of what's going on
9340000	9342000	but it sounds like the company, uh
9342000	9344000	didn't want to take the risk that this individual would win
9344000	9346000	and then some of that
9346000	9348000	is gonna reflect on them
9348000	9350000	because whoever wins that tournament is gonna
9350000	9352000	basically end up being an ambassador for the brand
9352000	9354000	and if there's a lot of these things that could
9354000	9356000	drag that down, you know
9356000	9358000	uh, I can see why the company wants
9358000	9360000	to make sure that doesn't happen
9360000	9362000	Right, I mean, that's, that was
9362000	9364000	I mean, I get it, like, you know
9364000	9366000	and then recalling, like, other
9366000	9368000	I guess nowadays, it's like
9368000	9370000	you know, Twitch is
9370000	9372000	or, or, or just having exposure
9372000	9374000	in general just exposes you
9374000	9376000	you know, it
9376000	9378000	it scrutinizes all your actions that you make
9378000	9380000	like, it, if you were a dick
9380000	9382000	before streaming, then
9382000	9384000	chances are, you're walking on a tight
9384000	9386000	rope, basically
9386000	9388000	with your behavior, unless you change it
9388000	9390000	and, you know, obviously
9390000	9392000	with sponsorships and all
9392000	9394000	it's, you're putting yourself in a
9394000	9396000	precarious position where
9396000	9398000	any action that you may have done behind
9398000	9400000	the scenes before, you know
9400000	9402000	before streaming or becoming a
9402000	9404000	streamer, which I can't even believe that's
9404000	9406000	a profession now, and
9406000	9408000	and it's just like, you
9408000	9410000	you do things, it's your behavior
9410000	9412000	that ends up reflecting poorly
9412000	9414000	like, I don't know if you heard about this one
9414000	9416000	uh, you know, a couple of months back
9416000	9418000	where this streamer was playing Fortnite
9418000	9420000	and he was beating on the, on his
9420000	9422000	uh, I think it was his wife
9422000	9424000	or a significant other, while on the
9424000	9426000	stream, like literally being, like
9426000	9428000	off camera, just like beating the crap
9428000	9430000	out of, you know
9430000	9432000	just because he just, like he was
9432000	9434000	he was getting nagged by her and then he
9434000	9436000	was like, the way he's reacting
9436000	9438000	okay, so that's really gross and not something, I mean
9438000	9440000	it's, that's a gross, gross
9440000	9441000	incident, sure
9441000	9443000	yeah, it is, it's bad, it's
9443000	9445000	and it, and the thing is like
9445000	9447000	Twitch only gave him a slap on the wrist
9447000	9449000	initially, until people
9449000	9451000	called Twitch out for the fact that
9451000	9453000	he wasn't, his channel
9453000	9455000	wasn't suspended permanently after two weeks
9455000	9457000	well, he also got arrested too
9457000	9459000	yeah, that too
9459000	9461000	but the fact of the matter is that Twitch gave him
9461000	9463000	like, you know, Twitch really
9463000	9465000	gave him a slap on the wrist initially
9465000	9467000	it wasn't until like, you know
9467000	9469000	public pressure
9469000	9471000	you know what's interesting, you know what's interesting is that there was a story
9471000	9473000	this week, and it didn't make our short roll tonight, but it was
9473000	9475000	about something about how like, Mixer
9475000	9477000	is really trying to figure out
9477000	9479000	how can we like, differentiate ourselves
9479000	9481000	from Twitch, and one of the things that
9481000	9483000	Mixer is trying to put out there and kind of push
9483000	9485000	is that they want to be very much like an
9485000	9487000	anti-toxicity environment
9487000	9489000	and so they have some different rules
9489000	9491000	and was it, and you know, I, what's interesting
9491000	9493000	is that it would be interesting to see how Twitch
9493000	9495000	might ultimately respond to that, because I don't think
9495000	9497000	Twitch necessarily wants to be known as like, we love
9497000	9499000	toxicity, I don't think so, I think it's one
9499000	9501000	of those, you know, maybe, and I don't
9501000	9503000	I don't know enough about the situation, I don't want to
9503000	9505000	defend it, or either way, but maybe just Twitch
9505000	9507000	needed a minute to kind of assess like,
9507000	9509000	what do we do, because maybe we haven't been in the situation
9509000	9511000	before, we don't have a clear policy
9511000	9513000	let's hope Twitch has learned from that
9513000	9515000	and on that note, we talk about learning from
9515000	9517000	things, I think that
9517000	9519000	you know, when we talk about what people have done in their
9519000	9521000	past versus what they're doing now
9521000	9523000	I think a very important question to ask is
9523000	9525000	you know, we're considering, do we
9525000	9527000	cancel somebody over what they said 10 years
9527000	9529000	ago, and this whole thing, I think you're gonna
9529000	9531000	have to look at a situation like that and go, but it does sound like
9531000	9533000	the person like, wants to do better, are they
9533000	9535000	learning, are they apologizing, do they
9535000	9537000	realize why what they said was shitty
9537000	9539000	and now they're acting
9539000	9541000	differently, or do they
9541000	9543000	show that they don't give a fuck, and
9543000	9545000	that whole type of thing, and I think a lot of that
9545000	9547000	sometimes weighs into
9547000	9549000	how people might respond
9549000	9551000	to a particular situation
9551000	9553000	you know, obviously these issues
9553000	9555000	that you bring up are a way bigger
9555000	9557000	you know, cultural issue than probably something
9557000	9559000	we can really sink into in 3 hours
9559000	9561000	here on OLR, but you know
9561000	9563000	you are correct that we are moving
9563000	9565000	more and more into a time frame
9565000	9567000	where things are
9567000	9569000	documented, so why on
9569000	9571000	earth you'd want to
9571000	9573000	take physical action on your spouse
9573000	9575000	which why on earth you'd want to do that ever
9575000	9577000	is one question, but then to do that
9577000	9579000	in an environment where it's recorded
9579000	9581000	gross, even if it's a
9581000	9583000	joke, not funny, you know
9583000	9585000	it's like, what the hell, you know
9585000	9587000	I mean, if we're getting into the place where more and more
9587000	9589000	things are recorded, you have to kinda
9589000	9591000	make sure you're saying
9591000	9593000	good things, and being a good person
9593000	9595000	and putting positive stuff out there where you can
9595000	9597000	sociopaths don't care
9597000	9599000	well right, there's always gonna be a few bad eggs
9599000	9601000	but you know, I'm just
9601000	9603000	I don't know, I don't know, I mean
9603000	9605000	the way I see it is that we're at an age where
9605000	9607000	like, you know
9607000	9609000	probably like, like 10 years
9609000	9611000	ago you didn't have this type of scene
9611000	9613000	where people are making a living off
9613000	9615000	of just streaming and just playing Fortnite
9615000	9617000	for example, and then
9617000	9619000	it brings out the, you know
9619000	9621000	the bad elements, like you have certain
9621000	9623000	individuals who haven't
9623000	9625000	haven't been conditioned
9625000	9627000	to, you know
9627000	9629000	behave in a certain way, or they're
9629000	9631000	basically just assholes inherently
9631000	9633000	and as a result, you see their true colors
9633000	9635000	in the way they obsess over
9635000	9637000	what they're trying to do versus
9637000	9639000	you know, the other things that
9639000	9641000	kind of like, push them
9641000	9643000	to the brink and cause them to act out
9643000	9645000	differently in front of a
9645000	9647000	live studio, you know, live audience
9675000	9677000	from that, and we've, you know, hopefully moved on
9677000	9679000	and at the end of the day, trying to do
9679000	9681000	a positive thing, but anyway
9681000	9683000	Zaku is good to hear from you, and I'm glad to
9683000	9685000	hear you had a good time at PAX
9685000	9687000	ish, and I hope to
9687000	9689000	hear from you again, don't be a stranger
9689000	9691000	Yup, definitely
9691000	9693000	Take care buddy, have a good one
9693000	9695000	You too, bye
9695000	9697000	Alright, always good to hear from Zaku
9697000	9699000	here, so going to our
9699000	9701000	chat, let's see
9701000	9703000	Oh
9703000	9705000	Gosh, that's a really sick story, I don't even want to repeat
9705000	9707000	that story, it's really sick, alright, just what some
9707000	9709000	people do on
9709000	9711000	stream to maybe tug at people's heart
9711000	9713000	strings, and it's sad, because
9713000	9715000	then it like, ruins it for everybody else
9715000	9717000	It's just, blah, anyway
9717000	9719000	Alright, well trying to do good things here at Orange
9719000	9721000	Lounge Radio, we are the show where every gamer
9721000	9723000	has a voice, you know, as long as you're not
9723000	9725000	being a jerk and hurting
9725000	9727000	other people's feelings and stuff like that, you know, we
9727000	9729000	want positivity at the end of the day
9729000	9731000	Doesn't mean we can't be critical of the things
9731000	9733000	we love, like EA insisting
9733000	9735000	on using that Frostbite engine
9735000	9737000	It's a bad decision, it's not
9737000	9739000	you know, we can call
9739000	9741000	that out, but it's all
9741000	9743000	in how you do it and what you say when you do it
9743000	9745000	Anyway, hope
9745000	9747000	you guys enjoyed this episode of Orange Lounge Radio

9777000	9779000	Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?
9779000	9781000	My final thought is
9781000	9783000	I'm going to build
9783000	9785000	the Labo thing this week and
9785000	9787000	I don't know, I'll
9787000	9789000	try to get my
9789000	9791000	edits to work, that's really what
9791000	9793000	it's been down to, it's like
9793000	9795000	I know how that format works more than
9795000	9797000	probably anybody, and
9797000	9799000	yet it's not working
9799000	9801000	It's frustrating, because it should work
9801000	9803000	It's just not
9803000	9805000	My final thought is
9805000	9807000	sorry for the mic issues, but the joys of live
9807000	9809000	radio and what we do here, thank you guys

9819000	9821000	gaming is ready for one more
9821000	9823000	They haven't said when
9823000	9825000	I'm hoping the summer time, but
9825000	9827000	yeah, and
9827000	9829000	Darzaga, last but not least, your final thought
9829000	9831000	I'm happy that Star Trek Online plays on a Mac
